Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Warner released language for a legislative approach to address \nglobal climate change. The committee also has announced a subcommittee \nhearing on this legislation for October 24. I understand that the \nsubcommittee intends to mark up this legislation on October 31 and move \nit to the full committee soon thereafter.\n  I acknowledge the commitment Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Warner, both of \nwhom I hold in the highest regard, have shown to this issue. However, I \nam concerned about the aggressive committee agenda for the \nconsideration and markup of this legislation. I would hope that the \nlegislation would proceed under regular order--which for complex \nenvironmental legislation establishing new emission control regimes \ntypically includes multiple hearings on the legislative language and \nample time for Members to review legislative language.\n  For example, when the committee was considering multipollutant \nemission reduction legislation under the Clear Skies Act, the committee \nheld three legislative hearings over a period of 2 months before \nproceeding to a markup. That process allowed the committee to hear from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, State and local officials, union \nrepresentatives, public interest groups, various trade associations, \nand representatives from financial institutions. This approach provided \nMembers with the input and time necessary for meaningful participation \nin the committee markup process.\n  The Subcommittee on Environmental Protection followed a similar \nprocess during consideration of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air \nAct. From September 1989 to the final markup in December 1989, the \nsubcommittee held three legislative hearings, which provided Members \nwith the valuable opportunity to question a wide variety of witnesses \non the implications of specific provisions in the legislation.\n  I also note that, on environmental legislation of significant \nimportance, the committee has a history of expending the time and \nconsideration necessary to achieve broad, bipartisan support before \nreporting legislation out of committee. In the past, this has ensured \nthat, when moving from full committee to the Senate floor, the \nlegislation has matured sufficiently for consideration by the full \nSenate body. I believe this front-end work on consensus is even more \nimportant given the current demands on floor time and the underlying \nlegislative atmosphere in general.\n  But this process is also important because we cannot afford to get \nthis wrong. I believe that rushing legislation through committee will \nnot affect a reasonable solution to the problem. We must find a way to \nharmonize policies that address our Nation's energy, economic, and \nenvironmental needs. And the only way we can do this is by taking a \ndetailed look at what has been proposed.\n  Unfortunately, what we have had in this Nation for many years is a \n``tail wagging the dog environmental policy'' that is hurting our \nNation's international competitiveness. Here is an example that we are \nall familiar with: Coal-fired power plants have become increasingly \nclean, yet they face a daunting number of new air quality requirements. \nThese requirements are duplicative, inefficient, and create \nconsiderable uncertainty for an industry that is providing the nation \nwith one of its most critical resources: safe, economic, and reliable \npower generation.\n  These policies have resulted in a sharp increase in the use of \nnatural gas for electric power generation--accounting for almost 94 \npercent of the increase in domestic demand for natural gas since 1992. \nThe demand for natural gas is sending ripple effects throughout the \neconomy because of its use as both a fuel and a feedstock for the \nproduction of everything from fertilizer to plastics to heating homes. \nThis has contributed to loss of over 200,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio \nalone. And these sharp price increases continue to impair the \ncompetitive position of U.S. manufacturing companies in domestic and \nworld markets.\n  That our Nation's environmental policies have this type of effect on \nour economy is not a new revelation. But one thing has become clear--\nthere is a faction of groups that have made it their priority to kill \ncoal. Those that support this objective have illustrated to me that \nthis dialogue is being driven by ideological extremes. This is \nunfortunate and does nothing to foster an environment where rational \npolicy choices may be made about the serious issue we face.\n  I recognize that we need to address climate change. But any \nreasonable climate change policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwould also: Promote economic stability--reductions should not cause \nfuel switching, sharp electricity rate increases or economic \ndislocation; promote technology development--legislation must provide \nincentives to advance the pace of technology; provide for reductions \nfrom developing countries--we cannot send jobs overseas to countries \nthat don't share our environmental objectives.\n  These goals are to keep the Nation's economy, and that of Ohio, on a \nsure footing while decreasing emissions. Coal is the Nation's most \nabundant, cheap and accessible energy resource. Its strategic value \nfrom a national security and economic perspective should not be \nunderestimated. It is simply nonsensical to put a policy in place that \nwould jeopardize this resource. Climate change requires a long term \nsolution whose strategy is fully capable of accommodating the time \nnecessary to get the technology in place that will ensure coal's \ncontinued viability.\n  An analysis released this summer of the Lieberman-McCain climate \nchange bill--a predecessor to this legislation--which capped greenhouse \ngas emissions at 60 percent below 1990 emissions levels by 2050--is \nillustrative of my concerns. It concluded: Reductions in real GDP over \nthe lifetime of the bill could be in the order of several trillion \ndollars. The analysis predicted that in 2050 average household annual \nconsumption would be about $1,900 lower; gasoline prices would increase \napproximately $0.70 per gallon; and electricity prices are projected to \nbe about 25 percent higher. But EPA points out that the impacts may be \nunderestimated. This is because the analysis assumes: One, that carbon \ncapture and storage technologies are widely available at a reasonable \ncost; and two, a 150-percent increase in nuclear power generation will \noccur. These assumptions are absurd.\n  Needless to say, this legislation would cause drastic reductions in \nthe use of coal. Some activists would applaud this, but it could result \nin the elimination of over 50,000 coal industry jobs. Not exactly a \nrecipe for economic recovery.\n  If enacting these restrictions would save the world from \nenvironmental collapse, as many would have us believe, it might be \nworth the economic pain. But the proposals, as demonstrated in a more \nrecent EPA analysis requested by Senators Bingaman and Specter, will \nhave little or no effect on global temperatures. In fact, this study \nconcluded that even the most stringent of the policy proposals under \nconsideration would have a net effect on global atmospheric \nconcentrations of CO2 of a mere 25 parts per million.\n  The point of all this is that we need to take the time to fully \nunderstand the costs and benefits of the policies that are being \nadvanced to address the problem of climate change. Yes this is a \nproblem that we need to address, but\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nrecklessly moving forward may result in disastrous economic \nrepercussions, with little or no benefit to the environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require Congress to provide health care for all children \n       in the U.S. before funding special interest pork projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) This section may be cited as the ``Children's \n     Health Care First Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be used for any congressionally directed spending \n     item, as defined by Sec. 521 of Public Law 110-81, until the \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     certifies that all children in the U.S. under the age of 18 \n     years are insured by a private or public health insurance \n     plan.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment, for myself and my \ncolleague Senator Burr, is about the topic of the Children's Health \nCare First Act of 2007.\n  There has been a lot of debate, a lot of politics on children's \nhealth care. The House failed to override what I think was a poor \nsolution to take care of children in this country by expanding \nchildren's health care through the SCHIP program and spending $4,000 to \nget $2,300 worth of coverage for our kids.\n  What we do know is we do have problems with health care. We need to \nbe debating health care. We need to figure out how we are going to do \nthis. Myself and Senator Burr have an amendment that solves the health \ncare problem, which has not been considered yet but which we are \nsoliciting and for which we have received a number of cosponsors. This \namendment, however, redirects us toward priorities. It is something we \nneed to talk about. It is something the Senate doesn't talk about.\n  We had numerous quotes in this body about how important it is to make \nsure kids in this country have access to care. What we do know--and I \nused the number $2,300 because that is the high end if we were to buy \nevery kid in this country a health insurance policy. It is probably \nmore like $1,700. So if you take the $2,300 that we have as a high-end \nnumber to buy kids health insurance, and not put them in something that \nhas a Medicaid stamp or a SCHIP stamp on their forehead but real health \ninsurance, and you look at the earmarks in this bill, which are $398 \nmillion, you could, in fact, buy insurance for 173,000 kids, in this \nbill alone. So 173,000 children could be covered for health care from \nthe earmarks alone in this bill.\n  Now, this amendment is real simple. If everybody in this body claims \nthey want to take care of kids and their health care, they ought to be \nwilling to give up their earmarks to cover kids. So what this bill says \nis, let's have no earmarks, no directed spending until such time as we \nhave covered the kids in this country. We put kids ahead of us. We put \nkids ahead of our political interests. We put children's health care \nahead of the politics and the consequential action of using politics in \nterms of earmark spending.\n  Now, $400 million is a lot of money, and $400 million is out of the \npriorities of what this country ought to be doing that are in this bill \nthat is Member-directed spending. This amendment simply says: We don't \ndirect any of that money--none of it, zero, not one earmark--until we \nhave cared for the kids, until we are caring for the kids. So in \nessence, what we are doing by accepting this amendment is saying, \ninstead of rhetoric, we are going to say kids count. We are going to \nstart putting the priorities back. If access to care for children is \nimportant, is it less important than your favorite earmark?\n  I know if you total up certain of the earmarks of one certain State \nwhich has $72 million worth of earmarks, you have enough to cover all \nthe uninsured kids in that State--all the uninsured kids in that State \nfrom the earmarks in this bill. So what are our priorities? Are our \npriorities children? Are our priorities the health care of kids?\n  This amendment is going to be a fun vote because what it is going to \ntell your constituency is: Kids aren't important if you vote to keep \nyour earmarks, but if you say I am willing to abate on the earmarks, \nand I am going to do what is right. This amendment says none of this \ndirected spending goes until the Secretary of HHS certifies that kids \nunder 18 in this country have access and have care. We have had months \nof debate about the children's SCHIP. We are going to have more because \nanother bill is coming. But it seems to me the American public might \nwant to ask: Why are you earmarking special money for special projects \nwhen you have a chance to make sure it will go toward children and \nsolving the problem?\n  So this is going to be a tough vote: kids versus my political career, \nkids\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\nversus my political power, kids versus my political earmarks. We are \ngoing to see. We are going to begin to see what the real priorities of \nthe Senate are. Is it our ability to direct funds without competition, \nwithout oversight to special projects all across this country, or is it \nto truly solve the health care needs of the kids in this country? It is \nreal simple, real straightforward. It is either yes or no, kids are \nimportant, and directed, unaccountable, noncompetitive earmarks aren't \nor political power, political earmarks, noncompetitive grants, no \noversight is more important than kids having access to health care.\n  The $400 million in earmarks will be set aside for children's health \ncare in this bill with this amendment. So the reason it is called the \nChildren's Health Care First Act is because children ought to come \nfirst. As parents, we put our kids first, or at least we should. Should \nthe Senate not put the kids first? Should we not put them out in front \nto make sure they are our priority or are we going to play the game: \nWell, this isn't the way to do it, Senator Coburn.\n  This is going to speak volumes to the American public about our \npriorities. I have challenged this body on our priorities. I am going \nto continue to challenge the body on our priorities. As we vote on this \namendment, the American people are going to see what our priorities \nare. It is either going to be kids or it is going to be us.\n  Let's talk about what is in this bill. This is the bill through which \nCongress can and should provide funding for health care for children. \nYet it diverts $400 million away from children's health in order to pay \nfor earmarks.\n  Here is a little ``smitling'' of what the earmarks are: $350,000 for \nan art center, $100,000 for a celebration around a lake, $500,000 for \nfield trips, $500,000 for a virtual herbarium, $50,000 for an ice \ncenter. How can we spend money on those things when kids in this \ncountry don't have access to care?\n  So we are going to debate this again on Monday when we come back in, \nbut it is going to be a test of our true priorities. You are going to \nsee all the rhetoric in the world on the repeat SCHIP bill. You have \nseen it. You have seen it in television advertisements against people \nwho didn't think that was the best way to do it, and now is the chance \nto put your words into action. Either kids are important or they are \nnot. But it would seem they are going to be less important than our \npolitical power, our political expediency, and our ability to empower \nthe select and the well-connected and the well-heeled in this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and ask the cosponsor of this amendment \nto speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Coburn. This \nis an important debate. I think some in the body have suggested this is \nsort of a dilatory tactic. It is not. I think the future of health care \nin this country is one of the single most important topics this body \nshould talk about.\n  Senator Coburn went down the list of earmarks we find in the bill. \nThe incredible thing is it didn't seem odd hearing those on this floor \nbecause we hear it all the time. But to the American people, when you \nhear about a field trip costing $500,000 to the Chesapeake Bay, America \nthinks that is probably a field trip for Members of Congress. I am not \nsure we could find the Chesapeake Bay. I am not sure we can get outside \nof the 30-square miles surrounded by a reality called Washington, DC. \nTherein lies a lot of the problem.\n  All we are asking our colleagues to do is express your view through a \nvote as to whether children are more important than the personal \ninterests of the earmarks. I have some in this bill. I would give them \nup, as long as I know the money is going to where it can do some good. \nWe have debated children's health, and I voted against the extension of \nthe SCHIP bill. My Governor lobbied extremely hard for me to support \nthat bill. Now, all of a sudden, we are talking about covering 177,000 \nkids in America with this bill. I haven't gotten a call from my \nGovernor. The Governor is willing to take it if it is a lump sum with \nno conditions and they can use that however they want to, but when you \ntarget it on kids, what is this about? This is about prevention. This \nis about creating a medical home for kids versus delivery of care in \nthe emergency room because both of them don't cost them anything.\n  The misunderstanding about the American health care system today is \nthat if you can't pay and you walk into an emergency room, every \nemergency room is required to provide that care for you. Well, that \ncreates a tremendous cost shift, and for those of us who pay out of our \npocket or we pay because we have insurance coverage, our insurance goes \nup. And the rate out of pocket goes up because we are having to \ncompensate for the people who don't pay, who don't have coverage, for \nthe people who we have not changed our health care system to reflect \nwhat their conditions are.\n\n  We have an opportunity to begin to chip away at it. We have an \nopportunity to insure at least 170,000 people. If this were only North \nCarolina, the $2,300 Dr. Coburn talked about for the cost of a policy \nwould be closer to $1,342. We could actually insure more children in \nNorth Carolina, and he probably could in Oklahoma.\n  We know people will call and question our numbers, so we take the \nmost expensive rate it could cost. I remind my colleagues that under \nthe SCHIP program we passed, if the Federal Government is to provide \nthis care, it was allocated somewhere between $3,400 and $4,000 per \nchild. There is the reason you never want the Federal Government \nnegotiating your health care. I came here 13 years ago. My insurance \nwas with a company of just over 50 employees, and when I became a \nFederal employee and accessed my care with the same plan of coverage, \nonly one thing changed: My premium went up because the Federal \nGovernment had negotiated my plan.\n  I learned this last year when my oldest son turned 22. I got a notice \nfrom BlueCross BlueShield that the Federal plans drop our children at \nage 22 regardless of whether they are in school. My son happens to \nstill be in school. I hope this year he will graduate. I was faced, \nlike every Federal employee, with the fact that I had a child who was \nno longer going to be insured under my family plan. I thought for sure \nthat if I called the Federal Government, they would tell me they had \nalready negotiated a plan that I could step him right over into, and \nthey had. It was the same BlueCross BlueShield plan he was under. What \nwas the annual cost? It was $5,400 a year for a 22-year-old healthy \nbull. What did I do? I went back to North Carolina and checked with the \nschool and said: Have you got a negotiated plan? They said: We have a \nnegotiated plan with BlueCross BlueShield, which was identical to what \nhe had under me--the one OPM negotiated, which was $5,400--and I paid \n$1,428 for that. It had the same deductible, same copay, same coverage, \nwith one big difference: One was negotiated by the private sector, or \nby the university, and the other by the Federal Government.\n  We don't negotiate deals in the best interest of the people we are \ntrying to cover. That is one of the reasons expansion of SCHIP is a bad \nthing. Actually, changing the health care system to cover 47 million \nAmericans--children and adults who today don't have insurance--is a \ngood thing. I would vote today for the current SCHIP to be \nreauthorized, for us to put in enough money to make sure nobody is \ndropped from the rolls, to change the formula for the States so those \nwho were cheated were treated fairly, and I would vote for it today. \nBut why would I expand a program that pays 30 percent too much to 50 \npercent too much to cover our kids when the answer to health care is to \nfix the system?\n  The reality is that we are here about this amendment. This amendment \nwould force Congress to prioritize between children's health, rather \nthan parochial pork projects of over 700 projects, almost $400 million, \nthat we could redirect from this one appropriations bill and devote it \nfully to the 9.5 million uninsured children in this country. And 9.5 is \nthe number in total; 3.9 of those have been without insurance for over \na year. So, as you can tell, you have the majority of the children's \npopulation that is considered uninsured that at some point in the last \n12 months has actually been insured.\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\n  Going back to SCHIP expansion, one of the clear facts about expanding \nSCHIP--not just the numbers of kids who are on it but the income \nlevel--is that I don't think Americans believe that an income at \n$82,000 needs to be subsidized by the Federal Government. That is where \nthey were driving the income limits for SCHIP.\n  Probably more important than that is that we were actually taking \nkids off of their parents' insurance and putting them on the Federal \nGovernment's insurance. We were taking kids who ride for free on their \nparents' insurance and now paying $4,000 to put them on the Federal \nGovernment's plan. The taxpayers looked at us and thought we were crazy \nthat we were even debating this. There wasn't an exclusion in the \nexpansion that said we are going to take the ones who are only \nuninsured today; no, we are taking all of them. We will take the ones \nwho are insured and flip them over, and clearly the only thing that \nachieves is growing the size of the Federal system.\n  Mr. President, I hope when we come back on Monday that more of our \ncolleagues will listen and that many will express their preference that \nwe put children's health in front of projects. I actually believe that \ntoday, if it passed, it would never come out of conference, the \nearmarks would show back up, and children's health would go away, and \nit would happen at some point in that process. Quite honestly, who \nwould lose? The kids. The kids are losing today because we are not \ndebating what we should be debating, which is health care reform. The \nuninsured are losing today because we should be debating health care \nreform. Every American is losing today because, for those who are \ninsured, those who have seen their premiums rise in high single and \ndouble digits every year for the past 10 years--and they have asked \nwhy. I can tell you why. It is because we won't fix health care. It is \nbecause your premium increase is reflective of those who are not \ncovered.\n  Tom Coburn and I are here today saying we should cover them and we \nhave a plan to do it. It doesn't distinguish between adults and \nchildren. Through covering those 47 million--or whatever the number \nis--we will save $200 billion a year in cost shifting. That $200 \nbillion a year will begin to bring everybody's premium in America down \nfor the first time in the last decade. So it is not just an effect on \nthe uninsured, an effect on children, an effect on adults; it is an \neffect on every American who currently has private insurance and the \nreality of the impact on their premium cost.\n  I know the occupant of the chair today is a big proponent of \nprevention. He is outspoken on it. You cannot have prevention without \ncoverage. You cannot have real prevention that individuals buy into \nunless there are rewards on the other end. The reward of healthy \ndecisions is that you're less risky for illness. When you are less of a \nrisk, your premium cost goes down.\n  Eventually, I would like to see every American own their health \ninsurance policy. I would like to see the ability to take an insurance \npolicy from one employer to another because we have negotiated, not an \nemployer. I would love to see every American in a position where they \nare not holding onto a job they hate in a location they dislike because \nthey cannot afford to give up health insurance. I want to see them have \nownership with health insurance, like with a 401(k) plan. They can make \nthe decision about what is best for their family and future and \noccupation without health care being the pivotal piece of that \ndecision.\n\n  We are held hostage by the employer-based system. That is not to say \nI am proposing we get away from it. I am only suggesting that a \npartnership between individuals and employers, between individuals and \ninsurance companies, an effort by Congress to restructure health care \nand reform insurance products, to provide America with an unlimited \nbasket of options for coverage, is a good thing.\n  We created Part D Medicare. For the first time, we extended \nprescription drug coverage to seniors in the country. It was not an \noversight in 1965. Medications at that time weren't really used widely \nto treat patients. Today, it is part of every office visit--some type \nof medication. So we didn't know exactly where we were headed when we \ncreated Part D--something targeted just for Medicare individuals.\n  Today, 84 percent of the population that is eligible has signed up. \nWhat is our experience in the first year? It is important to look at \noutcomes. Our experience is that premiums dropped 28 percent. This \nyear, the costs every Medicare-eligible person paid last year dropped \n28 percent, on average, for Part D coverage. What about the drug cost? \nWhat about the pills they are buying every month or every quarter? The \nfirst year, the reduction in the cost of services delivered and \npharmaceuticals is 33 percent. Why? One, we extended the offer to all \nseniors. We didn't exclude anybody. Two, we created real competition, \nwhich means that if there is a Federal piece, we had private sector \nplans and options that competed. We made sure there was a robust basket \nof competition. Third, and probably most important, for the first time \nwe forced transparency in health care. We actually made plans and \npharmacies list the price of certain drugs online so that we could do \nwhat we do best in America: shop where the price was the most \nadvantageous for what it was we wanted to purchase. You know what. We \nlearned that seniors are very aggressive at it. I knew that about my \ngrandparents before they died. I am finding out that, as my parents get \nolder, they get a little tighter and they want to make decisions that \nare financially to their benefit.\n  We have extended that opportunity to millions of Medicare-eligible \nindividuals in this country. What are we talking about? Creating the \nsame model, taking that positive experience we had with Part D and \nextending it over to the entire population that is under private \ninsurance, giving them options--options that deal with real \ncompetition, transparency in dealing with prices, the opportunity for \nthose covered by employers to have reductions in premiums, and over \nsome period of time, for those Americans who want to take advantage of \nit, to actually have ownership in a plan they have negotiated that \ndoesn't lock them into an employer, but they are able to use that in a \nportable way, to switch jobs without having to renegotiate their \ncoverage.\n  Well, I think I have presented to you where we are today and where I \nthink we need to go over some period of time in the Senate. It won't \nhappen if Members take this opportunity to insure 177,000 children who \nare currently uninsured, who currently cause a cost shift in America, \nwho currently receive emergency care and are not provided prevention, \nwho don't have a medical home to go to, a doctor they know they can \ncall, whether it is for a sore throat or an earache or, Heaven forbid, \nthe current staph infection that is going around, which has killed now \none out of five individuals who have been infected with it.\n  We live in a very dangerous world, which should take what is best \nabout our health care system--and that is prevention and diagnosis--and \nmake sure every American has it. You cannot have it without coverage. \nYou have to start somewhere, and these 177,000 children is the perfect \nplace for us to start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3399\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 3399.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3399.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate wasteful spending by the Centers for Disease \n                        Control and Prevention)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: Section. \n     __.

Mr. President, has the Senator provided his amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. This amendment has been cleared on both sides. I will \ntalk with the Senator about it.\n\n[[Page S13142]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Children's Health Care\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to just a bit of the debate a \nfew minutes ago by my colleagues. My colleagues are good Members of the \nSenate, and they offer interesting ideas on the floor of the Senate. I \nwish to point out, however, the issue of ``earmarks'' which they \ndiscuss and describe a lot is really legislative-directed funding, \nwhich is a very small percentage, in many cases, in bills. It is 1 or 2 \nor 3 percent of the funding. The rest of it goes downtown to some \nagency, and the folks in the agency make a decision where to spend \ntheir money.\n  We have changed substantially the legislative-directed funding which \nexists. We are reducing almost in half legislative-directed funding. We \nhave made it all transparent.\n  The implication in the discussion I heard, and I have heard it many \ntimes, is there is no virtue and there is certainly no value in having \nany legislative-directed funding; let the agency downtown determine how \nevery dollar is spent.\n  The power of the purse in the Constitution rests with the United \nStates Congress. We are responsible and accountable for how taxpayers' \ndollars are spent. Let me give one example which I think is important.\n  We just finished in this country something called the Human Genome \nProject. A lot of people would not know what that means, perhaps, but \nit is an unbelievable success story. We unlocked the mystery of the \ngenes. We now have for the first time in the history of the human race \nan owner's manual for the human body. For the first time, we have an \nowner's manual for the human body in the Human Genome Project.\n  The Human Genome Project is done. It is going to dramatically change \nthe way we treat diseases. It will, in many cases, allow us to \ndetermine how we prevent dread diseases. Already we are seeing \nsubstantial results from it.\n  We had a briefing by Dr. Francis Collins recently, and he had just \ncome from a meeting in Cambridge, England, where all the folks are \nusing the breakdown of the genetic codes which have come from the Human \nGenome Project. He describes treatment for leukemia and other diseases \nthat are breathtaking as a result of the Human Genome Project that \ncreates the breakdown of the genetic code of the human body and \nprovides us the first owner's manual for the human body.\n  Guess what. Yes, that came from an earmark on the floor of the \nSenate. That is how the Human Genome Project started because someone in \nthe United States Congress decided this approach had merit and should \nbe done. No, it didn't come from some decision by some GS-13 or GS-15 \ndowntown in some agency. It came from the United States Senate in \nlegislative-directed spending.\n  I say this only to point out that this pejorative term ``earmark'' is \nsuggesting this is all a waste and it is all pork and so on. That is \nnot the case. But I recognize, and we recognize, it got out of hand, so \nwe cut it way back and made it all transparent.\n  The point is, there are some good ideas coming from the Congress, and \nhave been for a long time. One of them was the Human Genome Project, \nwhich started with an earmark or legislative-directed funding in the \nUnited States Congress. That is just one, but it is one that will \naffect the lives of virtually every American, perhaps everybody on this \nEarth, who in the future has one of the dread diseases or whose health \nis challenged. I wanted to make that point.\n  I commend those who pointed out some of this legislative-directed \nfunding ought to be cut back. We have cut it back very substantially, \nbut that which remains, in most cases, represents good investment, and \ninvestment that complements what is done in the Federal agencies as \nwell.\n  I might also observe that the proposal today to increase the health \ninsurance coverage for children, I believe, was 170,000 children. We \njust had a vote on increasing health care for children who are not \ncovered by health care at this point for 3.8 million American children, \nand that failed. We passed it in the Senate, and it was passed in the \nHouse. It failed because the President vetoed it.\n  Interestingly enough, now we have people coming to the floor of the \nSenate saying: Let's cover more children. We had a chance to cover 3.8 \nmillion more children, and it was fully paid for, but we couldn't get \nthat done because the President vetoed it. It wasn't his priority, and \nhe had sufficient support in the Congress for his position.\n  I suppose we will see a lot of proposals that say we should cover \nmore children, just far fewer. I respect my colleagues. I believe we \nshould cover children. We certainly should perhaps revisit this vote \nand see if those 3.8 million children who are going to be left without \ncoverage if the President and those who support him won't rethink their \nposition and think that represents a priority.\n  I don't know, as I have said often, what is in second, third, or \nfourth place in most people's lives. I know what is in first place, \ntheir kids. I know what is most important in people's lives--their \nchildren and their children's health. If that is not a priority, I \ndon't understand.\n  I have said often, in 100 years we will all be dead. Historians can \ntake a look at what our value system was by determining on what we \nspent our money. What was our priority? What was our value system? What \ndid we think was important?\n  I hope they will look back at the Federal budget and how we voted on \nthese appropriations bills and say: We are proud their priority was \nkids, providing health care coverage for children.\n  What on Earth is wrong with a political system that doesn't believe \nthat is the No. 1 priority?\n\n\n                           Indian Health Care\n\n  I wish to talk about children's health care, but I want to focus \nmostly on Indian children, and I am going to talk about Indian health \ncare, generally. The reason I am doing this, I am chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee in the Senate, and Senator Reid indicated we \nwill have on the floor of the Senate, perhaps in a week or perhaps 2 \nweeks, for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It has been 15 years \nsince that Act has been debated on the floor of the Senate, the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act.\n  Why separate categories, Indian health care? Why separate? We have a \ntrust responsibility. This country promised through treaty, through \nother obligations, this country said to the Indian people: We have a \ntrust responsibility to provide for your health care. It is not \nsomething that the Native Americans, the first Americans, said: We want \nyou to give this to us; we insist upon it. It was an agreement, a \ntreaty agreement by this country to say--in many cases, a treaty, in \nother cases, just a solemn promise--we will provide health care \ncoverage to American Indians as part of our trust responsibility.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act expired in the year 2000 and \nhas not been reauthorized. It is 7 years later. It doesn't mean there \nis no Indian health care. There is some, but it is horribly inadequate. \nIn any event, we should reauthorize that Act and modernize it.\n  With respect to Native Americans, we have fallen tragically short of \nwhat our responsibilities insist we do.\n  Let me describe what we are spending and how well we are doing with \nrespect to health care.\n  With Medicare, we spend $6,700 per Medicare patient; Indian health \ncare, $2,100 per capita. We spend twice as much on health care for \nFederal prisoners whom we incarcerate as we do for American Indians for \nwhom we have a trust responsibility for health care. Someone \nincarcerated gets twice as much spent on their health care as American \nIndians for whom we have a responsibility. I am talking about children, \nI am talking about elders, and I will talk about some of them in just a \nmoment.\n  We can see ranging from Medicare to the VA to Medicaid to Federal \nprisons, all the way down, and here is the lowest, and the lowest is \nthe per capita expenditure of health care for American Indians for whom \nwe have a trust responsibility.\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\n  American Indians die at a much higher rate than other Americans from \ntuberculosis, a 600-percent higher rate from tuberculosis; diabetes, \n189 percent, but in some parts of the country, it is 400 percent and \n800 percent higher than Americans. Alcoholism, 500 percent higher.\n  The fact is, we have grim statistics coming from Indian reservations \nwith respect to the health of the first Americans. The rate of sudden \ninfant death syndrome among Native Americans is the highest of any \npopulation group in the United States and more than double of non-\nIndians. Indian youth suicide on the Northern Great Plains, where I am \nfrom, is 10 times the national average.\n\n  Last night, I received a letter from a constituent on an Indian \nreservation. This constituent has had diabetes since she was 11 years \nold. Earlier this year, she received a kidney and pancreas transplant. \nShe needs an anti-rejection medication to stay alive. When she went to \nthe reservation clinic to get her medicine yesterday, she was told by \nthe doctor: There goes our budget. There are two other tribal members \nwho receive this medication, and when the funding is gone, there will \nbe no more medication.\n  The stories are pretty unbelievable. This is a picture of a young \ngirl named Avis Little Wind. I have described the tragedy of this young \ngirl previously. Avis Little Wind is 14 years old. Avis is dead. She \ntook her own life. Mental health treatment wasn't available for Avis. \nShe lay in her bed in a fetal position for 3 months, and no one seemed \nalarmed by that, before she finally took her life. She wasn't in \nschool, though she was supposed to have been. Her sister committed \nsuicide, her father died by his own hands, and this 14-year-old girl is \ngone because, I presume, she felt that she was hopeless and helpless.\n  Those on the Indian reservation dealing with mental health issues, \nincluding suicide. For suicide prevention, they have virtually no \nresources. A young lady on this Indian reservation, who testified at a \nhearing I held once, said she had a stack of files on the floor of her \noffice dealing with abuse and health issues. She said: ``We don't have \nany resources to even investigate the files. We would have to beg to \nborrow a car to take one of these kids to a clinic someplace.'' Then \nshe broke down weeping. About a month later, she resigned.\n  The fact is people are dying. Avis Little Wind died of suicide \nbecause mental health treatment wasn't available on that Indian \nreservation.\n  I was in Montana recently with Senator Tester, and a grandmother held \nup a picture of this beautiful young girl. She is 5 years old. Her \ngrandmother described the picture of her granddaughter, named Ta'Shon \nRain Littlelight. Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight loved to dance, and she \ndanced in this regalia at all the pow-wows from the time she was able \nto walk a beautiful little girl with a sparkle in her eye. Well, \nTa'Shon is gone. Ta'Shon lost her battle, as well.\n  Between May and August of last year, she was taken many times to the \nCrow Indian Health Service Clinic for health services. They diagnosed \nthe problem and they began to treat it. They said it was depression. A \n5-year-old was depressed. Well, during one of the clinic visits her \ngrandfather said: ``But there is something else going on. Take a look \nat the condition of her fingertips and her toes. There is something \nhappening in this little girl's body.'' It suggests, the grandfather \nsaid, a lack of oxygen. Something is going on. But that concern was \ndismissed, and finally the grandmother asked a doctor to try to \neliminate the possibility of cancer or leukemia, or something of that \nnature. But those concerns were dismissed.\n  In August, this young girl was rushed from the Crow clinic to St. \nVincent Hospital in Billings, MT. They airlifted her to Denver \nChildren's Hospital where she was diagnosed with incurable, untreatable \ncancer. She lived for another 3 months after the tumor was discovered, \nin unmedicated pain. She died in September. The grandmother asked at \nour field hearing if Ta'Shon's cancer had been detected earlier, would \nit have made a difference? Would this little 5-year-old girl be alive? \nNone of us knows, but the question of the quality of health care is a \nlife-or-death issue. It was for Ta'Shon.\n  Recently, on a Wednesday morning in my State, a young child on an \nIndian reservation was burned, severely burned, and rushed by the \nmother to the Indian Health Service clinic on the reservation, only to \nbe told that the clinic was closed for the morning for administrative \npurposes. Even after the frantic pleas by the mother, this boy was \nrefused care. So in her desperation, she contacted a doctor from \nanother town outside of the reservation for assistance. They directed \nher to bring her young son immediately. She did. Thankfully, that young \nboy received treatment and has survived those severe burns. She didn't \nget the needed health care for him at the Indian Health Service clinic. \nFollowing the treatment she did receive off the reservation, after a \nfrantic drive in an automobile, the Indian Health Service clinic \nrefused to cover the costs of the young boy's treatment. So the mother \nis now faced with a substantial medical bill, a mother who should never \nhave been placed in this situation and a mother who doesn't have the \nresources to pay it.\n  When we held a hearing in the Indian Affairs Committee about \nmethamphetamine, the intersection of methamphetamine and health care \nwas pretty obvious. It was a courageous tribal leader who came to our \nhearing, Kathy Wesley-Kitcheyan, the chairwoman of the San Carlos \nApache Tribe in Arizona. She said she was embarrassed to talk about \nsome of the things on her reservation, because they are not very \npositive and she said it was like airing her family's dirty laundry \nbut, she said, I must. She talked about her 22-year-old son and her \nwarning to him about the catastrophic effect of alcoholism and \nsubstance abuse. And she talked about losing her grandson. She broke \ndown talking about her wonderful grandson, a rodeo champion who had won \n26 belt buckles and 6 saddles as a rodeo rider, who made the wrong \nchoices with drugs and drinking and lost his life. She talked about the \nmethamphetamine problem.\n  That is where it intersects so quickly, in a devastating way, with \nhealth care. She said on their reservation, in 1 year, out of 256 \nbabies born on that Indian reservation, 64 out of 256 babies were born \naddicted to methamphetamine. Let me say that again. Of 256 children \nborn on that Indian reservation, 64 were born addicted to \nmethamphetamine. At the San Carlos emergency room, in 1 year, 25 \npercent of the patients who came to the emergency room tested positive \nfor methamphetamine. And on it goes.\n\n  I am describing circumstances that one would perhaps attribute to a \nThird World country, where health care doesn't exist. Yet these \nstories, in many ways, are even more heartbreaking because they happen \nhere in this country. They happen too often to people who are living in \nThird World conditions on Indian reservations with inadequate health \ncare--health care which was promised to them as a trust responsibility, \nbut nonetheless inadequate health care.\n  I recently learned of a young boy named Nicholas from the Menominee \nTribe of Wisconsin, who had a very rough start. He, like a high \npercentage of American Indian babies, was born premature--3 months \npremature. He weighed 2\\1/2\\ pounds. For the first 3 months of his \nlife, he struggled in intensive care to stay alive. As part of a \nsignificant effort by his family, his doctors at the IHS facility and \ntraditional health care practices, he persevered.\n  As a young man, he was forced to face another health care challenge: \nadult onset diabetes. While this type of diabetes usually strikes \nAmericans in mid life, it is showing up now in American Indians and \nAlaska Native youth at an increasingly younger age. In fact, there is a \n77-percent increase in diabetes in Native children and youth under 15 \nyears of age.\n  Fortunately, this young man from the Menominee Tribe is receiving \nservices from the tribal health facility and early screening at the \ntribal school, and has been able to control his blood sugar, which will \nprevent complications, one hopes.\n  David Whitetail, with the Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota, \nwas not so fortunate. He was diagnosed with type II diabetes at 17. He \ndidn't receive the necessary care, and now he\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\nis 39 years old and a dialysis patient awaiting a kidney transplant, \nbut is finally, at long last, beginning to get the care he needs.\n  A couple of years back, a young woman--I guess she would like me to \ncall her a young woman; she probably is a bit above a young woman in \nage--whose name is Lida Bearstail, went to the clinic in Mandaree, ND, \nbecause of knee pain. The cartilage had worn away and bone was rubbing \nagainst bone, causing her great, great pain. If that were to happen in \nthis Chamber to any one of us or our families, we would, of course, get \na knee transplant or get a new knee. But Mrs. Bearstail was denied this \ntreatment because it was not deemed ``priority 1''--life or limb. If it \nis not life or limb, and you have run out of contract health money, you \nare out of luck.\n  In fact, what happened to this woman, Ardel Hale Baker, is that she \nhad chest pain that wouldn't end, and her blood pressure was very high, \nand so she was diagnosed at the IHS clinic as having a heart attack. \nShe needed to be hospitalized immediately. They stuck her in an \nambulance and rushed her to a hospital off the reservation, but they \ndidn't have any contract health care money left to pay for anything, so \nthe Indian Health Service taped an envelope to this woman's leg with a \npiece of tape. She was hauled in on a gurney to the hospital with an \nenvelope taped with masking tape to her thigh, and as they unloaded her \nin the emergency room, the folks who unloaded her took a look at what \nwas taped to her leg. They opened it up and it said--and I have a \nchart, I believe, of what it said. It said this patient is not going to \nbe covered because there is no contract health money available.\n  What they were saying was this patient is having a heart attack. They \nwere saying to the patient and to the hospital, if this patient is \nadmitted, understand there is no money. There is no money here. So they \nadmitted her, she survived, but it is kind of a tragic thing to tell a \nstory about a woman who is hauled into a hospital with a piece of paper \ntaped to her leg that says, by the way, if you admit this woman, you \nare on your own because Indian Health Service contract care is out of \nmoney.\n  I have had tribes tell me that contract health care was out of money \nafter the first 3 months of the year. On one reservation they say: \nDon't get sick after June, because there is no contract health care \nmoney. If you are going to get sick, it has to be before June, \notherwise this may happen to you. If you have a heart attack and go to \na hospital, they might haul you in and there might be a note attached \nto your arm or leg that says, by the way, if you admit this patient, \nyou might have some difficulty because there is no money available.\n  This last woman, Ms. Baker, survived and then received a bill for \n$10,000. She doesn't have $10,000. So what happens when they run out of \ncontract health care, they warn the hospital you are on your own if you \ntake them. Then when the patient is released from the hospital, their \ncredit rating is ruined because they get a bill they can't pay. This is \nthe result of our failure to meet our trust responsibility.\n  That is a long description of why we need to reauthorize the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act. That Act will come to the floor in the \nnext week or two, according to Senator Reid. We have written that bill \nin the Indian Affairs Committee. The vice chair of the Committee, \nSenator Murkowski from Alaska, and I, and many other members of the \nCommittee have written a bill we think advances the interests of Indian \nhealth care.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, who is on the Indian \nAffairs Committee with us, is a valuable member and a constructive \nmember. He is a doctor, and that is extraordinarily helpful in terms of \nhis knowledge. He will make the point that we need much broader reform, \nand I will agree with him when we have this discussion. We need much \nbroader reform, and this is a step, a step in the right direction. Is \nit a step as broad as I would like to make? No. There is a reform step \nthat is much broader that we need to take, and we will. And I will work \nfor that when we move this bill, but at least we ought to move this \nlegislation.\n  I will work with Senator Coburn and others for much more substantial \nreform, but at least we need to start. This is since 2000, and 7 years \nlater we need at least to move this legislation, but it has been 15 \nyears since we last debated the issue of Indian health care on the \nfloor of the Senate. So it is long past the time for us to do what we \nare required and have promised to do, and that is meet our \nresponsibilities for health care for American Indians.\n  I want us to do this in a way that makes us proud. After all, it is \nour responsibility. We made this promise long ago, and we need to keep \nit.\n  We are a good country and a good society. We spend a lot of time on \nthe floor of the Senate talking about what doesn't work. There is a lot \nthat works in this country. We are blessed to live here and blessed to \nbe a part of this great place. But we continue as a country to always \nlook to find out what we can do to fix things that are broken, to \nimprove things that don't work quite as well as we would like. That is \nwhat we are trying to do with this issue of Indian health care.\n  I have described the failures. There are successes. There are folks \nworking in Indian health care around the country who get up every day \nand work long hours and do a remarkable job. There are others who do \nnot. I can tell you about a woman who has excruciating knee pain and \ngoes to a doctor at the Indian Health Service, and she is told to wrap \nyour knee in cabbage leaves for 4 days and it will be fine. It is \nunbelievable, but that sort of thing happens. I can tell you of other \npatients who go to an Indian Health Service doctor and get very good \ncare.\n  There are not enough resources. We need to respond, as we have done, \nto the issue of the cluster of teen suicides that exist on Indian \nreservations. There are so many things we need to do.\n  Let me make the final point. These are the first Americans. These are \nnot visitors. They were here first. Around the culture of Native \nAmericans we have built quite a country. But Native Americans need to \nshare in the great benefits bestowed upon the American people, and that \nincludes opportunities for health care, opportunities for good jobs, \nopportunities for housing, and a decent education. We fall short in \nmany of those areas. We fall short in many of them.\n  I have not spoken about education today or housing, but those issues \nthemselves are pretty unbelievable when you take a look at the \nconditions on many American Indian reservations.\n  I look forward, in the next week or two, to having an opportunity to \ndebate the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It is long past the time \nfor us to do this. This will advance the interests of Indian health \ncare, and then, in addition, we will not be completed. We will need to \ndo reform, reform in a significant way beyond this bill. But this bill \nis an awfully good first start in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3361 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I call up amendment No. 3361, which I am offering with my \ncolleague, Senator Webb of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself and Mr. \n     Webb, proposes an amendment numbered 3361 to amendment No. \n     3325.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide information to schools relating to the prevention \n             of violent events and other crisis situations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a)  The Secretary of Education shall update the \n     2002 Department of Education and United States Secret Service\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\n     guidance entitled ``Threat Assessment in Schools: A Guide to \n     Managing Threatening Situations and to Creating Safe School \n     Climates'' to reflect the recommendations contained in the \n     report entitled ``Report to the President On Issues Raised by \n     the Virginia Tech Tragedy'', to include the need to provide \n     schools with guidance on how information can be shared \n     legally under the regulations issued under section 264(c) of \n     the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and \n     the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n        (b) Not later than 3 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Education shall disseminate the \n     updated guidance under subsection (a) to institutions of \n     higher education and to State departments of education for \n     distribution to all local education agencies.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our amendment does not create a new \ngovernment program or require new spending. It is a modest amendment \ndesigned to achieve a major goal, to reduce school violence.\n  On October 10, a 14-year-old boy brought two guns to a Cleveland \npublic school. He shot four people before turning the gun on himself.\n  On April 16, a student at Virginia Tech shot 49 people, 32 of them \nfatally, before turning the gun on himself.\n  The next act of school-based violence may already be taking shape in \nthe mind of another deeply troubled child, adolescent, or adult.\n  Parents send their children to school every day trusting that they \nwill be safe. It is a crucial premise. And school-based violence \nshatters it. It doesn't matter that violent incidents are rare. The \nfact that a school, any school, could become a killing field is \nunthinkable to a parent, to any of us. Yet we must think about it. We \nmust think about school-based violence so we can minimize it.\n  There are no easy answers for a school faced with a potentially \nviolent student who has not yet acted on that potential. Schools should \nand must respect the rights of each student while ensuring the safety \nof all students. There are no easy answers, but there are answers.\n  In 2002, the Department of Education and the U.S. Secret Service put \ntogether a comprehensive guidance document to help schools respond \nappropriately when faced with a potentially dangerous student, as well \nas how to prepare for and respond to acts of violence on school \ncampuses. School administrators have confirmed that this document is \nvery useful. Unfortunately, it is also out of date.\n  Following the Virginia Tech tragedy, the President asked three \nMembers of his Cabinet: Secretary Leavitt of Health and Human Services, \nSecretary Spellings of the Department of Education, and Attorney \nGeneral of the Department of Justice, to review the events surrounding \nthe tragedy and recommend ways of preventing such tragedies in the \nfuture. This report, which was released June 13, gives us new \ninformation, and we should use it.\n  We don't have the luxury of time. It doesn't make sense to wait a \nminute longer than necessary to get the right information into the \nhands of every school administrator in this country. The Brown-Webb \namendment instructs the Department of Education to use its existing \nauthority and funding under the Safe and Drug-Free School and \nCommunities Program, to update the 2002 guidance based on what was \nlearned from Virginia Tech, and to distribute the updated guidance to \nschools within a 3-month timeframe. That is a fast turnaround, and it \nis completely appropriate. Updating the document will take staff time; \ndistributing the document will take computers and some legwork. Getting \nthis done quickly is most important because it can prevent an act of \nschool-based violence. It is what we should do.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         AMERICA'S TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this was a good week in this body for \nchanging the direction of U.S. trade policy. My fellow Senators--and I \nthink we are seeing the same in the House of Representatives--are \nbeginning to listen to the elections of last fall, beginning to listen \nto what voters are saying, beginning to listen to what workers and \nsmall businesses are telling them about a failed U.S. trade policy and \nhow we need a new direction in trade policy.\n  On Monday this week I offered a modest amendment, a reminder to the \nBush administration that we need to vigorously enforce our trade laws. \nThat amendment passed overwhelmingly, with fewer than a half dozen \nnegative votes.\n  Few in this Chamber can disagree with that, especially when we see \nwhat the unfair trade and the absence of a vigorous trade enforcement \nteam can do to American manufacturing. In our country, there are rules \nto protect the free market from anticompetitive schemes, such as \nmonopolies and collusion and price gouging. In the global economy, \nthere are similar rules to protect the free market from anticompetitive \nschemes such as Government subsidies and the dumping of underpriced \nforeign products on domestic markets.\n  Once you put domestic markets out of business, then foreign prices \nare free to rise unchecked. Lax labor and environmental laws also \nundercut the free market by creating insurmountable price differences. \nBut when our country does not combat the anticompetitive behavior in \nthe global marketplace, our economy suffers for it. That is why the \namendment this week was important, to instruct the administration to be \nmore aggressive, as the Justice Department needs to be more aggressive \nin our country, to protect the free market from anticompetitive schemes \nsuch as monopolies and collusion and price gouging; our trade \nrepresentative, our trade negotiators, our trade policy enforcers need \nto be more aggressive in enforcing international trade laws against \nanticompetitive schemes such as Government subsidies and the dumping of \nunderpriced foreign products on domestic markets.\n  American manufacturing fuels our economy, whether it is in \nMinneapolis or whether it is in Cleveland, and it supplies our national \ndefense infrastructure. In my home State of Ohio, well over 200,000 \nmanufacturing jobs have disappeared in the last 7 years.\n  We know American industry can compete with anyone in the world when \nit is actually a fair fight. But some foreign governments have unfairly \nand illegally doled out massive subsidies to their own companies. Some \nare encouraged through our tax system to reestablish offshore, \ncontributing to the outmigration of manufacturing jobs from our country \noverseas.\n  As reported today in the Hill, the Bush administration is using steel \nfrom China to build a fence on the Mexican border: ``[The Department of \nHomeland Security] criticized for Chinese steel in U.S.-Mexico fence.'' \nWe are using taxpayer dollars to build a fence on the U.S.-Mexican \nborder, and much of the steel comes from China. We know what NAFTA did \nto Mexico's middle class. We know it has run more than 1\\1/3\\ million \nfarmers off their land into the cities to compete for dwindling \nmanufacturing jobs, jobs where wages continue to drop despite increased \nforeign investment from NAFTA.\n  We know that many make the dangerous trek to our country, trying to \nget through security, go over the desert, across the river--all they do \nto find work and money for their families. Yet here we are building a \nwall made of Chinese steel. How will history judge this Congress when \nwe see more of the same failed trade policies that contribute to this \nmigration and then build a wall of Chinese steel? I wish President Bush \nwould talk to Ohioans about that. I wish he would talk to a steelworker \nin Lorain or a machine shop owner in Mansfield or a tool-and-die worker \nin Youngstown, people who are hard-working men and women who have made \nAmerica the strongest Nation in the world, workers who, frankly, feel \nbetrayed by America's trade policies.\n  Presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements like\n\n[[Page S13146]]\n\nNAFTA, promising they would create millions of jobs and enrich \ncommunities. Instead, too many of these agreements have cost millions \nof jobs and devastated communities. It is not just the worker who \nsuffers. It is the family, people down the street, as the valuation of \nhouses contributes to delinquency and foreclosures. It means fewer \npolice, fewer teachers, and fewer firefighters, as communities are \ndevastated from layoffs and workers losing their jobs. In the cities, \nworkers lose their jobs too. Yet the Bush administration and proponents \nof deals with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea want more of the \nsame. They want the current system to keep going, to be expanded, \ndespite evidence that the NAFTA model and the CAFTA model have not been \nworking for Mexican workers, Central American workers, American \nworkers, or small businesses in those countries and is not working for \nsmall manufacturers.\n  The number of workers filing for unemployment benefits jumped last \nweek to its highest level since late August. Last week, 2,000 more \nOhioans were seeking unemployment benefits, thousands more in Michigan, \nin Minnesota, in Indiana, North Carolina, all over the country--hardly \nthe sign of a good economy, hardly the time for another trade \nagreement.\n  History will be on the side of those who want a different trade \npolicy. The Founders gave Congress the responsibility to set the terms \nof trade policy. To vote up or down on a flawed agreement is in no \none's best interest. It is not smart policy or politics. We need to \nbegin by evaluating agreements such as the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, as Senator Dorgan proposed this week. We need to pause. \nLet's say no more trade agreements for a while until we fix our trade \npolicy and learn what those agreements and our trade commitments have \naccomplished for workers. If I am wrong and they are working for \nworkers, communities, consumers, and our small business owners, then \nlet's proceed. But let's stop and look, figure this out.\n  We need a new model for trade agreements that requires negotiators to \nnot just ensure better labor and environmental rules are enforced--we \nmade some progress in the Peru trade agreement on that, and that is a \nsmall step but not enough--but also raises safety standards, doesn't \nallow backdoor challenges to public interest laws, doesn't give \ncorporations the power, as NAFTA did for the first time ever in a trade \nagreement, to sue foreign governments, including foreign corporations \nto sue our Government to weaken our environmental laws, to weaken our \nfood safety laws, to weaken our worker protection laws, to undercut our \n``Buy American'' laws. That is when we end up doing stupid things like \nbuilding a wall between Mexico and the United States and using Chinese \nsteel.\n  Finally, we need to reward corporations. We have introduced the \nPatriot Corporations Act. Those corporations that play by the rules, \nhire Americans, provide health care, provide a pension, and take care \nof their communities should be rewarded with tax advantages instead of \npenalizing those companies and rewarding those companies that go \noffshore.\n  Ultimately, our commitment is to protect our country. That means to \nprotect our children from foreign products that have lead. It means to \nprotect workers, our small businesses, and our communities. That is how \nwe provide opportunity to build a thriving middle class. That is why it \nis time to take a breath, stop. Before we move forward in Peru and \nPanama, before we move forward in Colombia and South America, we need \nto examine how this trade policy is working.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13146-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BIDDING ON EBAY LETTER\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, earlier this month, I came to the floor to \ndiscuss some comments made by Rush Limbaugh.\n  Following my remarks, more than 40 of my Senate colleagues and I \ncosigned a letter to the chairman of Clear Channel, Mark Mays, telling \nhim that we wanted him to confer with Rush Limbaugh regarding the \nstatements he made. I have since spoken to Mark Mays about this. Mark \nMays, in fact, called me regarding this letter.\n  This week, Rush Limbaugh put the original copy of that letter up for \nauction on eBay. We did not have time or we could have gotten every \nDemocratic Senator to sign that letter. But he put the letter up for \nauction on eBay and, I think very constructively, left the proceeds of \nthat to go to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation.\n  What is the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation? It provides \nscholarship assistance to children of marines and Federal law \nenforcement personnel whose parent dies in the line of duty, as well as \nhealth care assistance for disabled children of fallen troops.\n  What could be a more worthwhile cause? I think it is really good that \nthis money on eBay is going to be raised for this purpose.\n  When I spoke to Mark Mays, I think he and I thought this probably \nwould not raise much money--a letter written by Democratic Senators \ncomplaining about something.\n  This morning, the bid is more than $2 million. We have watched it \nduring the week. It keeps going up and up and up, and there is only a \nlittle bit of time left. But it is certainly going to be more than $2 \nmillion. Never did we think this letter would bring money of this \nnature; and for the cause, it is extremely good.\n  Now, everyone knows that Rush Limbaugh and I do not agree on \neverything in life, and maybe that is kind of an understatement. But \nwithout qualification, Mark Mays, the CEO of the network that has Rush \nLimbaugh on it, and Rush Limbaugh, should know that this letter they \nare auctioning is going to be something that raises money for a \nworthwhile cause.\n  I do not know what we could do more importantly to help ensure \nchildren of our fallen soldiers and police officers who have fallen in \nthe line of duty have the opportunity to have a good education. Think \nabout this: More than $2 million. This is going to really help. That \nis, again, an understatement.\n  There is only a little bit of time left, so I would ask those who are \nwanting to do more--they can go to eBay and search for ``Harry Reid \nLetter'' and it will come up. I would encourage anyone who is \ninterested, with the means to do so, to consider bidding on this letter \nand contributing to this worthwhile cause.\n  I strongly believe when we can put our differences aside--even Harry \nReid and Rush Limbaugh--we should do that and try to accomplish good \nthings for the American people. This does that--more than $2 million \nfor a letter, signed by this Senator and my friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13146-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13146-S13147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID. I have indicated, Madam President, we have a lot of work to \ndo. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I have stated on a \nnumber of occasions that on controversial judicial nominations we are \nnot going to move on those until the minority tells us that is what \nthey want to do. One of those nominations is Judge Southwick. That \nmatter was reported out of committee sometime ago, and both Senator \nLeahy and I have said that when the Republicans tell us they want to \nmove to that nomination, we would do that. So sometime next week I am \nmore than likely going to move to that matter. So I want everyone to \nknow that, in fact, is the case.\n  I also, Madam President, have indicated that one of our priorities is \nto do an energy bill this year. I had a meeting yesterday with \nDemocratic chairs and other interested people, including Senator \nCantwell and Senator Dorgan, to find out how we can move forward. We \nrealize we can move forward. We have a number of issues that are \nimportant. The issues are somewhat limited. One is what are we going to \ndo on CAFE, raising the fuel efficiency of vehicles? What are we going \nto do about a renewable portfolio standard? And what are we going to do \nabout the tax aspect of this that will do a number of important things, \nnot the least of which is give the great entrepreneurs\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\nin our country the incentives to invest in alternative fuel--sun, wind, \ngeothermal, biomass? We need this to be done on a multiple-year basis. \nSo those are three important things we need to do.\n  I have had a number of conversations with my Republican colleagues. \nSenator Domenici and Senator Lott--there are others with whom I have \nspoken--but just in recent days I have spoken to them. I spoke this \nmorning with Leader Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. She wants to go \nto conference on this issue. One Republican Senator said: I understand \nyou don't want to go to conference. The Speaker wants to go to \nconference. I want to go to conference. We would like to be able to do \na bill, and we are going to do our very best to do that.\n  We are going to include the Republicans on anything we do. We know we \ncannot do a bill unless we include the Republicans in it, and we are \ngoing to do that. We are going to do our utmost to come up with a \nstrong bill, one that is in keeping with the needs of this country.\n  Madam President, everyone is occupied on that side of the aisle, but \nI am going to, in the near future, when we have a Republican who can \ncome to the floor, ask consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 340, which is H.R. 3221, which is the \nHouse Energy bill. And I will move that we go to conference on it.

Madam President, I have conferred with the bill managers.\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\nI ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3381 and to set aside \nany pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn), for himself, Mr. \n     Voinovich, and Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3381.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, first, I thank Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter for working with us on this bill, this important piece \nof legislation, and for the opportunity to offer this amendment.\n  It is my intention, at the end of my remarks, to seek to withdraw the \namendment because there are some procedural objections under rule XVI \nof the Senate rules.\n  I think this is an important amendment and an important matter for us \nto consider at the appropriate time. I hope my colleagues will work \nwith me, as well as Senator Voinovich and Senator Chambliss, who are \ncosponsors of the amendment, to find a way to address the urgent \nmatters contained within the scope of the amendment.\n  Specifically, we ought to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. \nUnfortunately, due to the size and scope of the Federal budget, there \nseems to be precious little attention given to ways to make sure that \nwe spend the taxpayers' money efficiently. While we debate the \nnecessity of appropriations, and we should continue to try to cut back \non the unnecessary expenditures wherever possible, I think it is \nimperative that Congress do the appropriate oversight on existing \nFederal programs and appropriations and ways to look for both cost \nsavings and efficiencies.\n  I think we ought to ask the fundamental question every time we are \nasked to appropriate money for a particular agency--we ought to ask \nthis question: Is this agency or program still needed?\n  What has led me to offer this amendment arises out of some good work \nbeing done by the OMB. As a matter of fact, they have published this \nbrochure called: ``Expect More.'' You could go on line to \nexpectmore.gov on the Internet and see what I am talking about. \nSpecifically, they have a tool called ``the program assessment rating \ntool,'' which helps the Office of Management and Budget assess whether \na particular Government program is working.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has recently reviewed over a \nthousand programs. As this chart indicates, upon a review of 1,016 \nFederal Government programs, they have concluded that 22 percent of \nthose programs rated either as ineffective or they are unable to \ndetermine whether they are effective. In other words, they are unable \nto find evidence that they are effective. They have not conclusively \ndetermined them as ineffective, but they have concluded that 22 percent \nof the Federal Government programs are either ineffective or the \nresults are not demonstrated. Anybody who is interested anywhere in the \nworld--certainly in the United States--can look at the information on \nthis expectmore.gov Web site and inform themselves, as I am sure they \nwould want to, about what the Federal Government is doing and not doing \non their behalf.\n  As part of the review, the OMB looked at 35 programs within the \nDepartment of Labor, totaling almost $15 billion. They identified $2 \nbillion that could be saved out of that $15 billion on programs that \nare not meeting expectations and are not effective. Some of these \nprograms include the Office of Disability Employment Policy, Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, and part of the Workforce Investment Act. \nCertainly, these programs have the potential to help people and \nstrengthen our country. But my hope is we will look at these programs \nand not necessarily decide they are not necessary--because they may \nbe--but, rather, give the appropriate oversight and come back and try \nto do what is necessary to make them effective or, if they simply \ncannot be rehabilitated or made effective, we ought to eliminate them.\n  The fact is we can look to our State governments and State laws for \nmechanisms that we could use to make sure we spend the taxpayers' \ndollars only on needed programs and in the most efficient ways \npossible.\n  I look to my State of Texas. Since 1971, we have had something called \nthe Sunset Commission, which periodically--about every 10 years--\nreviews State programs and State spending to decide what the answer to \nthe question is that I posed earlier: Is this agency or this program \nstill needed? Is the money being spent effectively?\n  Here in Washington, we could learn from the State sunset commission \nprocess, which I know happened in Texas and which also is reflected in \nthe laws of many of our State governments but which we do not have here \nat the Federal level.\n  A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that Congress spent \nalmost $160 billion in 2006 on agencies and programs that were not, in \nfact, authorized. In other words, while the authorizing committees had \npreviously authorized it, those authorizations had lapsed, indicating a \nlack of continued oversight and authorization by Congress. Yet money \nwas continuing to be appropriated and spent on these programs. This \nlist includes hundreds of accounts, both big ones and small ones, \nranging from the Coast Guard, $8 billion, to the Administration on \nAging, $1.5 billion, to section 8 tenant-based housing, $15.6 billion, \nto the foreign relations programs, which is $9.5 billion. Many of these \nprograms and agencies, perhaps most, deserve reauthorization. I am not \nsaying they do not. But reauthorization no longer means what it should. \nIt means we have conducted the appropriate investigation and oversight \nto determine whether the programs are meeting current needs or whether \nthey are no longer necessary. Congress should make sure we are only \nspending money on programs that can and are justified.\n  My amendment would take what I think is a great experiment, which has \nshown tremendous success on the State level in places such as Texas, \nand create a bipartisan Federal sunset commission to review the \nefficiency of all Federal programs but will focus their work on \nineffective and unauthorized programs and will make recommendations to \nCongress about how to improve them, if they can be improved, or whether \nwe should just eliminate them altogether.\n  To me, this is a shocking figure, when our own Federal Government \nconcludes--the executive branch, the Office of Management and Budget--\nthat almost 25 percent of Federal programs are not delivering for the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  My amendment would create, as I said, a bipartisan U.S. authorization \nand sunset commission that would be composed of four Members of the \nHouse and four Members of the Senate. The commission would issue a \nschedule-and-review proposal to Congress at least once every 10 years, \nas well as issue reports on the way to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of Government programs and agencies.\n  The schedule-and-review proposal is where the commission would review \nand analyze at least 25 percent of unauthorized Federal programs and 25 \npercent of the ineffective programs as identified by OMB and would do \nso on a rolling or ongoing basis. In other words, we have to start \nsomewhere, and that is where they would start, but we would continue \nuntil all Federal agencies and programs would be subject to this sort \nof scrutiny and review.\n  Unlike most commissions, Congress cannot simply ignore the \ncommission's work under my amendment. Rather, the amendment would \nprovide an expedited procedure that would force Congress to consider \nand debate the commission's work and then vote up or down on whether to \naccept it.\n  Simply put, this commission would help Congress do what we should \nalready be doing; that is, providing the necessary oversight to make \nsure every dollar of the taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. The \ncommission will help Congress answer the simple but powerful question I \nposed at the outset, and that is: Is an agency or program still needed? \nIt seems like common sense to me.\n  I know some will argue this is why we have authorizing committees, \nbut I believe the commission would add greater focus to the budget and \nappropriations process on saving taxpayers money as opposed to how can \nwe come up with new ways to spend more money, which tends to dominate \nthe appropriations process, and how can we\n\n[[Page S13149]]\n\nimprove Government accountability and provide for greater openness and \ntransparency in Government decisionmaking?\n  This concept, as I said, is not new or even revolutionary. My home \nState of Texas has had a sunset commission in place for 30 years, in \nwhich time it is estimated the Texas taxpayers have been saved more \nthan $700 million by eliminating ineffective or unnecessary programs, \nstarting with a zero-based budget during the sunset commission \nreviewing process and justifying each and every dollar that is added to \npay for that program if reauthorized.\n  The tendency in Washington, unfortunately, is to take an existing \nprogram and see it grow incrementally each year. Indeed, once a \nGovernment program is created, it tends to create a constituency that \nwill come to Congress and argue that it should not be eliminated--not \nonly should it not be eliminated, it should grow by a certain \npercentage each year.\n  As this and other appropriations bills come before the Senate, I ask \nmy colleagues to keep in mind the extent of waste we already see in \nGovernment programs. Rather than allowing these programs to continue \nendlessly with no real purpose and no real means of accomplishing their \ngoals, it is time we took a closer look at and acted on our \nresponsibility to eliminate wasteful Washington spending. Before we \nraise taxes and before we mindlessly appropriate money for another \nbatch of potentially ineffective and outdated programs, we should take \na hard look in the mirror on how we spend the hard-earned money of the \nbeleaguered American taxpayers. No one wants higher taxes, and our \nfirst defense against higher taxes ought to be greater efficiency and \nmoney savings by eliminating wasteful programs. Our primary means of \nensuring this efficiency would be through this bipartisan sunset \ncommission.\n  I hope all of our colleagues will seriously consider this proposal \nfor a Federal sunset commission. It is important, before we look at \nraising taxes and growing the size of Government, that we look at ways \nto eliminate waste and unnecessary programs, and that is exactly what \nthis amendment would do.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3381 Withdrawn\n\n  I understand this particular amendment, being legislation on an \nappropriations bill, will be subject to a point of order. Rather than \npursue that issue and require the procedural ruling on that decision, I \nnow ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the bill managers and my \ncolleagues for indulging me on this point. This is not an issue that is \ngoing to go away. I am not going to go away when it comes to urging \ngreater efficiency and elimination of wasteful Washington spending.\n  We have a tremendous responsibility, those of us who have been sent \nto Congress to represent our States and our districts, the least of \nwhich ought to be being good stewards of the taxpayers' money. It is \ntime to take the Federal budget off autopilot, to see the Government \ngrow and grow and grow without any real oversight, particularly when it \ncomes to these programs which have been demonstrated either as \nineffective or where it is impossible for the Federal Government to \nconclude that the evidence justifies the continued existence of these \nprograms.\n\n\n                     Funding For Deafblind Services\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in America, there are over 10,000 \nchildren like 11-year-old Nate Newton of San Antonio and 7-year-old \ntriplets Zoe, Emma, and Sophie Dunn of Houston, who are both deaf and \nblind. The increase in the number of deafblind children in America is \nfueling a growing demand for qualified teachers to work with deafblind \nchildren.\n  Texas Tech University is one of the few universities in the United \nStates that offer graduate training in deafblind education. To date, \nthe Department of Education has provided funding from the special \neducation national activities account to train teachers with deafblind \nchildren in their classes on how to educate and include these children \nin daily classroom activities. Yet Federal funding for this program has \nremained level at $12.8 million for nearly the past 20 years.\n  The House-passed version of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nincludes a modest increase of $2 million in funding for deafblind \nservices. I think this is a reasonable increase and would request that \nthe conference committee accept the higher level of funding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator raising this issue and will do \nwhat I can to ensure that we accept the higher number when we go to \nconference on this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There are over 300 deafblind children in Pennsylvania, \nso this is an issue that also affects a number of families in my State. \nI thank Senator Cornyn for calling this issue to our attention. I will \ndo what I can when we go to conference to try to keep the funding for \ndeafblind services at the higher level.\n\n\n                           1945 Trinity Test\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to discuss a matter of great \nimportance to my State with the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nHarkin. As he is aware, New Mexico was host to the Nation first test of \na nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945--the ``Trinity'' test. At the time, \nthis test, like the entire Manhattan Project, was classified, with a \npublic cover story of an ammunition magazine exploding at Alamogordo \nAir Force Base some 40 miles to the south of the test. The surrounding \ncommunities were not told that this was a nuclear weapons test until \nafter the detonation of the ``fat man'' bomb over Nagasaki nearly 1 \nmonth later. In fact, the decision was knowingly made by the Army not \nto give any advance warning or evacuate any of the surrounding \ncommunities. The radioactive fallout from this test traveled northeast \nfor at least 100 miles, and the effects were felt all around my State \nand beyond. Communities 96 miles north in Vaughn, NM, were affected; \nwindows in Silver City, 120 miles west, were shattered. For 4 or 5 days \nafter the test, the surrounding communities northeast to the test \nreported a ``white substance like flour settled on everything.'' Cattle \nthat grazed on Chupadera Mesa suffered beta radiation burns and loss of \nhair, indicating levels of radiation exceeding today's permissible dose \nby factors of several thousand. The government made no effort to \nmonitor for contamination the bodies of members of the public. A \nrecently released CDC study, ``Los Alamos Historical Document Retrieval \nProject,'' indicates that the towns of Bingham to the northeast and \nCarrizozo 30 miles to the east of the test received external doses of \nradiation far exceeding today's maximum allowable doses. The absorbed \nground level radiation 14 days after the test in Bingham was \napproximately 13 times what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows \ntoday for emergency lifesaving. The CDC report quotes documents \nreporting that a Geiger counter in Carrizozo went ``off-scale'' at 4:20 \np.m., 11 hours after the test. There is evidence that the fission \nproducts from this test were detected as far as Indiana, where a Kodak \nfilm plant observed spotting on their film from contaminated intake \nwater used to make the paper pulp to store the film.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am well aware of the problem of compensating workers \naffected by radiation from my efforts to secure a special exposure \ncohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. Have these local communities \nreceived any sort of compensation to date?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No. While the local communities surrounding the test in \nmy State have talked of illnesses such as thyroid cancer for years, the \nrecent CDC study is the first technical compilation of historical \ndocuments in the technical files of Los Alamos National Laboratory. \nDetailed technical dose reconstructions must first be attempted to take \nplace to show the probable cause of the illnesses. I would like to \nrequest that the managers of this bill work in conference to insert the \nstrongest possible language to have the National Cancer Institute \nundertake a study that estimates the number of fatal and nonfatal \nradiogenic illnesses compared to a baseline of what would be expected \nto occur naturally. This analysis must be completed by the National \nCancer Institute with the utmost urgency given that, as the chairman \nknows well from the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, many of the affected \npopulation are reaching an advanced age.\n\n[[Page S13150]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will work with my colleague Senator Specter, the \nranking member of the subcommittee, to urge the National Cancer \nInstitute to make this matter a high priority. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I will support that effort.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank both managers of this bill for their \nwillingness to work with me on this important issue.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13150-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3221\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I had indicated earlier today that I was \ngoing to move to go to conference. The record should reflect that \nSpeaker Pelosi and I have talked about this matter and we think it \nwould be appropriate to go to conference. It is my understanding we are \nclose to being able to do that. That would be good.\n  This is a bill that needs to be done and can only be done if \nDemocrats and Republicans agree. The majority of us in this body are \nDemocrats, but it is a slim majority. So everything we do, I need to \nget 20 percent of the Republicans to move forward on legislation. \nHopefully, we can do that and have a real good conference on this \nmatter.\n  As I indicated this morning, there are a number of issues that are \nimportant: A renewable portfolio; it is important we do something about \nCAFE; It is also important we do something about taxes so we can have \nthe great entrepreneurs of America have the ability to invest in \nrenewable energy. Right now the ability to do that is very limited \nbecause we have only given them a year, 2 sometimes with the tax \ncredits, and they can't plan ahead for that. So those are the three \nthings we need to work on.\n  There is much more, but that gives us an idea of what we need to \nfocus on, and it is not easy because the House did not have CAFE, we \ndid not have the renewable portfolio. So it is going to take some \nmathematical moving around to get this done because we need to work it \nout, I would hope, so we can do CAFE in both bodies and renewables in \nboth bodies. Anyway, we need to give this a valiant try, and that is \nwhat conferences are all about.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 340, H.R. 3221, the House Energy \nbill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nthe Senate engrossed amendment to H.R. 6 be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees and that the title amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I had \ntalked to the majority leader before he propounded the unanimous \nconsent proposal. As we have discussed, we are trying to clear any \nobjections on our side. Given the fact it is Friday and Members are \ntraveling, we are having a few difficulties doing that. But it is my \nhope we can continue to work through it and resolve those so the \nunanimous consent request can proceed without any objection.\n  At this point, because of those challenges we have, while we are \ncontinuing to work in good faith to resolve them, I must respectfully \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have had a good couple of months here \nin the Senate. We have accomplished a lot, working together. Hopefully, \non this momentous piece of legislation, we can continue to do that.\n  As I indicated this morning, we had a number of conversations \nyesterday, Republican Senators that want to move this forward, and I \nthink there is a real possibility we can get a conference and move \nforward on this and come up with legislation where this body agrees \nwith the House as to how to proceed.\n  I understand that is the case, and I understand why the junior \nSenator from Texas had to object. It is Friday afternoon. Hopefully, \nmaybe next week, we can appoint conferees and move forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I am so happy to announce that Senator Klobuchar achieved \nthis distinction today an hour and 5 minutes ago. I congratulate her. I \nam embarrassed to say that as a freshman, we had a large freshman \nclass, but I didn't preside for this long. I thought I was here all the \ntime. It is really quite a nice award. It is something one can keep \nforever. We have gone to some length to make sure it looks good. For \nthe time that I presided over the Senate as a freshman, I really \nlearned a lot. One learns Senate procedures, different personalities of \nSenators who come to the floor.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is to be commended. She takes good care of \nher State. She goes back often.

She sets a great example for the rest of the people in America, \nbut especially she has added so much to the Senate.\n  When I first came here, the woman was Mikulski. The woman still is \nMikulski, but she has a lot of people to help her now. The Senate is a \nmuch better place with more women. Someday--it won't be in the \nimmediate future but not in the distant future--we will have a body \nthat will have an equal number of women as men. When that happens, the \nSenate will be a better place.

Madam President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues the sad news that Mayer ``Bubba'' Mitchell, a great American \nand a great humanitarian, passed away on September 26, 2007.\n  I was lucky to know Mayer for many years. He was a successful \nbusinessman from Alabama, a philanthropist who supported groundbreaking \ncancer research and a strong voice here in the Halls of Congress. An \nadvocate for a strong friendship between the United States and Israel, \nMayer served a term as president of the American Israeli Public Affairs \nCommittee, AIPAC, and he impressed all who met him with his clear and \npassionate convictions.\n  I had the honor of attending Mayer's memorial service last month, in \nthe USA Mitchell Center at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, \nAL. I heard many moving tributes from many distinguished guests. But \nthere was one that stood out to me above the rest, so much so that I \nwish to share it with my fellow Senators.\n  My good friend Howard Kohr, the executive director of AIPAC, \ndelivered the following remarks at Mayer's memorial service. Howard so \naptly described the man we had all come to know and love that I would \nlike to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record his words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the remarks were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13151]]\n\n                 A Tribute to Mayer ``Bubba'' Mitchell\n\n       Arlene, I cannot begin without expressing the deep love and \n     affection that we all have for you. Throughout your life--and \n     in particular in this past year--which I know was especially \n     trying--you have been an ``eshet hayil'' a true woman of \n     valor. Having known you and Bubba so long and having spent so \n     much time with both of you, I know that you feel blessed to \n     have had a life with Bubba--but, Arlene, it was equally a \n     blessing for Bubba to have you.\n       To you Arlene, and to you, Abe--his partner and best friend \n     Fannie, Ann--and to Joy, Melinda, Richard, Lisa, and the \n     entire family I want you to know that I consider this to be \n     one of the great honors of my life to be asked to speak and \n     pay tribute to your husband, brother, father, and \n     grandfather.\n       You know, I spent a lot of time walking the halls of \n     Congress with Bubba. Often, after an election, I would \n     introduce some of the new members of Congress. Inevitably, a \n     few of them would call me a day or two later and ask if I \n     could get them back in touch with the Mayor of Mobile. I \n     would laugh and let them know that they had met the Mayer \n     from Mobile, not the Mayor of Mobile. But, as you can \n     imagine, after just one more meeting, as the bonds of \n     friendship began to take hold, he became to them what he was \n     to all of us--Bubba. And, once you had Bubba in your life, \n     you knew you had something special.\n       Bubba was a planner.\n       He had a clear idea of how things should be and a \n     discipline that allowed him to realize his vision. It was in \n     that spirit that he called me last spring when he heard that \n     his good friend the Republican Leader in the Senate, Mitch \n     McConnell, would be the keynote speaker at AIPAC's Annual \n     Policy Conference in Washington. He wanted to be sure that he \n     would be able to introduce the Senator--who honors us with \n     his presence here today--I of course agreed, because you just \n     did that when Bubba called. However, as important as \n     providing a proper introduction for his friend Mitch was, \n     this time Bubba had more he wanted to say. He said, ``Howard, \n     I'm not feeling too well and for all I know this could be my \n     last conference, and I have something I want to say.''\n       He began his remarks at the conference that evening with a \n     simple question. Bubba asked: ``Have I made a difference?'' \n     He went on: ``It is a question that many of us ask ourselves, \n     particularly as we advance in age. For me,'' Bubba said, ``it \n     is a question that has become persistent--and the answer more \n     important--in a year of personal health difficulties.''\n       If you were there that night you know that in asking that \n     question Bubba wasn't really speaking about himself. He was \n     holding himself up as a standard bearer of the pro-Israel \n     movement in America--he was asking everyone if we have done \n     enough. In challenging himself he was challenging us--to make \n     the most of the opportunities that God has given us and \n     realize that we have a sacred obligation to ourselves and to \n     each other.\n       It was vintage Bubba: Make yourself the example. Challenge \n     others to follow.\n       Bubba was a humble and wise man.\n       Despite his many accomplishments, Bubba was a man of great \n     humility. In a world of politics, where it is so easy to \n     become cynical or jaded, Bubba remained respectful and \n     grateful for the opportunity to play a role in history. He \n     never lost his sense of awe.\n       How many times did he put his arm around one of us at a \n     particular historic moment or in a place of renown and remind \n     us to appreciate that moment--to remember how blessed we are \n     to live in America and to enjoy the freedoms and \n     opportunities we are afforded.\n       It was September of 1991. Bubba and I were about to meet \n     with the President of the United States in the Oval Office--\n     we were there to ask him not to link urgently needed loan \n     guarantees for Russian immigrants to Israeli politics and \n     policies. We knew it would not be an easy conversation to \n     have.\n       In the moments before we headed to the White House, Bubba \n     told me, ``You have to get yourself ready for this. And to do \n     that, you have to do two things. You have to spend time to \n     realize the awesome power of this office. And then you have \n     to not be intimated by it.''\n       Bubba was not one to dish out advice that he himself did \n     not live by. And a few hours later I listened as he spoke \n     truth to power, respectfully, carefully, but clearly. I \n     listened as he made his case, relaying to the President in \n     detail about his own parent's exodus out of Russia, fleeing \n     persecution and pogroms. ``Mr. President,'' he said, ``this \n     is not an abstraction for me. This is deeply personal. Mr. \n     President, you have an historic opportunity to make things \n     different for the next generation.''\n       The son of Russian immigrants, the man from Mobile was \n     always able to say and do what he felt was the right thing--\n     because he believed so passionately that he--and each of us \n     still--has a critical role to play to ensure the future of \n     the Jewish people, of America and of Israel.\n       And so he reached out to governors and members of Congress, \n     presidents and prime ministers to better his state, his \n     country and our world--to improve all our lives. For Bubba \n     Mitchell, life wasn't only about him or his needs. It was \n     about stepping beyond himself to something far greater. Bubba \n     showed us that our actions can have meaning and our lives can \n     be significant as long as we never shy away from speaking the \n     truth or doing the right thing.\n       Bubba was a man of quiet courage.\n       Many in politics attempt to persuade with the belief that \n     volume and bravado are the key to making a point. But Bubba \n     understood that a few wise words, softly spoken, always \n     trumped the loud chatter. Yes, he was quiet, his manner was \n     all southern charm and understatement--but he was doggedly \n     determined to get results . . .\n       . . . and he was stunningly effective.\n       Bubba had the ear of presidents and prime ministers, and \n     they too would seek him out for information, counsel and \n     clarity. It is no surprise therefore, that in Bubba's last \n     days, President Bush, the Prime Minister of Israel, senators \n     and members of Congress, and countless elected officials--\n     many of whom are honored guests with us today--called him to \n     thank him for devoting his life's work to his community, his \n     country and our world. And it is no surprise that each of \n     them thanked him for his unfailing friendship.\n       Bubba was a man of action.\n       He realized that we live in a time of miraculous promise, \n     but also real danger for America, for Israel, and the Jewish \n     people. He understood the stakes and the consequences if \n     leadership was lacking.\n       When something needed to be done, he did it. And when \n     something else needed to happen, he stepped forward yet \n     again. And again and again. The cumulative effect of his \n     life's work was profound. Bubba built and sustained \n     friendships with literally dozens and dozens of elected \n     officials and decision makers that directly deepened the \n     quality and strength of the relationship between Israel and \n     the United States.\n       Bubba was a leader.\n       I had a conversation yesterday with a veteran member of the \n     House of Representatives whom I had called to inform of \n     Bubba's passing. This member said something that I have been \n     reflecting on ever since--something that says so much about \n     who Bubba was to all of us. She said, ``you know when I got \n     into politics I had a simple goal--gain the respect of Bubba \n     Mitchell. Because I knew that if I had his respect everyone \n     else would follow.'' The degree of respect that others had \n     for Bubba can be measured in many ways. But the fact that \n     over 25 current and former members of AIPAC's national Board \n     traveled from across the country to be here today is a \n     remarkable tribute to his leadership.\n       It is very important to me that his 8 grandchildren hear \n     what I have to say. You should know that for the last 25 \n     years at AIPAC there was no higher praise--and no greater \n     reward--than to have your grandfather tell me or one of my \n     colleagues or one of our fellow Board members in that soft-\n     spoken way of his--that he was proud of us.\n       Last March Bubba wondered out loud in front of 6,000 \n     friends if his life had had meaning--if he had made a \n     difference. Well today we gather here to pay tribute--to \n     celebrate the life of someone whose accomplishments are so \n     many, so varied, and so valued that his legacy rises to \n     something greater than mere difference making. Bubba's \n     difference deserves its own category--Bubba was a Jewish \n     hero. Through his actions--through his courage, generosity, \n     leadership, determination, and wisdom--he came to define what \n     it meant to be a Jewish leader in America in this century. He \n     enriched all our lives--he took care of his family, he made \n     Alabama better, he made America stronger, and Israel safer.\n       As with so many others in this room, Bubba was my mentor, \n     my teacher, my friend--my hero. How lucky I have been, how \n     lucky we all have been--to know and to love Bubba.\n       So Bubba, I think we can all answer your question now.\n       You made quite a difference.\n       Your memory will forever be a blessing. And we pledge to \n     you that our continued work will be your lasting legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13151-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13151-S13152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is with great pleasure that \nI recognize the U.S. Naval Academy's class of 1957. On Saturday \nevening, October 27, 2007, the class of 1957 will celebrate its 50th \nclass reunion in Annapolis, MD.\n  On June 29, 1953, 1,135 young men each received a one-page form \nentitled ``Interpretation of Oath'' addressed: ``To a Candidate about \nto take the Oath as a Midshipman.'' It interpreted the practical \naspects of the oath: trustworthiness, perseverance, language, \ncleanliness, and loyalty. It warned of many inoculations that soon \nwould be given and then finished with:\n\n       Men cannot be trained for a profession of arms by \n     surrounding them with luxuries and babying them. Young men \n     who are worthwhile do not wish to be coddled. The first few \n     days, when the drills are over and the night has come, you \n     will find that you are tired and perhaps a little homesick. \n     In a few days you will find that you are feeling better, you \n     have a better appetite and sleep better than you ever did \n     before. If you do your part you will find that the academy \n     will do its part by you.\n\n  Truer words have never been written.\n  Later that afternoon these young men stood in Tecumseh Court in The \nYard at Annapolis, MD, took the oath,\n\n[[Page S13152]]\n\nand became midshipmen in the U.S. Navy, class of 1957.\n  Almost 4 years later on June 7, 1957, 848 of them graduated with a \nbachelor of science in engineering, took another oath, and were \ncommissioned into the Armed Forces. Of the Navy Blue majority, 568 were \ncommissioned into the Navy: 160 went to Pensacola to become naval \naviators; 203 went into destroyers; 42 to auxiliary ships; 94 to \ncapital ships including aircraft carriers; and 104 of the class went \ninto submarines a year or so later. Sixty-four went into the United \nStates Marine Corps and 206 were commissioned into the then academy-\nless Air Force.\n  During the ensuing 50 years, the class of 1957 distinguished itself \nin service to the Republic. Of the original graduating class, 534 \nserved for 20 years or more. Thirty-eight of them gave their lives in \nthe execution of their oaths. Charles Duke walked on the Moon. Leo \nHyatt endured 2,050 days of captivity in North Vietnam. Bradley \nParkinson developed the global positioning system. Altogether, the \nclass of 1957 produced 21 admirals and generals. Class members served \nan average of 1.3 times as commanding officers. The class served with \ndistinction throughout the cold war, including the very hot Vietnam \nwar, and emerged victorious.\n  Following their retirement or resignation from their respective \nservices, members of the class continued in a variety of careers and \nprofessions: 169 of them became presidents or vice presidents of \ncompanies or corporations; 33 served as chief executive officers.\n  Mr. President, I salute the U.S. Naval Academy's class of 1957. Most \nimportantly, I wish to extend warm and hearty congratulations to them \nfor a job well done, or as the Navy would say it, ``Bravo Zulu, '57!'' \nI extend my best wishes for their continued success during the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13152-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL HERBERT S. LOCKETT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCOL Herbert S. Lockett, former ombudsman for the National Committee for \nEmployer Support of the Guard and Reserve. Colonel Lockett has a long \nand distinguished history of service to our Nation, both as a soldier \nand as a volunteer ensuring that National Guard and Reserve soldiers \nare prepared for battle. His service, both on the front lines and \nbehind the scenes, is noble and commendable. It is for this reason that \nI honor him today.\n  Colonel Lockett served as a combat medic in the Southwest Pacific \nTheater during World War II, earning a Bronze Star, an Outstanding \nLeadership Commendation, and three Campaign Stars. He cared for those \nwho were wounded and risked his own safety in service to others. Those \nwho brave bullets to provide care are truly heroic, and Colonel Lockett \nwas no exception.\n  He went on to serve in Korea as an infantryman, where he earned a \nSilver Star for Gallantry at the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. While his \nunit had taken heavy casualties, and many in his unit threatened to \ndesert, he took charge and they fought until reinforcements arrived, \nearning two Presidential Unit Citations and credit for 2,000 Chinese \nKIAs.\n  Even after retiring from active duty, Colonel Lockett continued to \nserve his country. Colonel Lockett has been a volunteer with National \nCommittee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve helping to \nprepare soldiers in National Guard and Reserve units to be deployed for \ncombat operations. For his efforts in this regard he has been awarded \nthe James N. Roche Spirit of Voluntarism Award, the highest award given \nby the committee.\n  Mr. President it is my honor to pay tribute to this great Alabamian, \nand most of all this great American. He serves as a shining example of \nthe American spirit. He is loved by all who know him for his tireless \nwork and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13152-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2198.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Crapo, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Lincoln and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2209. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, to introduce the Research \nCredit Improvement Act of 2007. We are joined by a bipartisan group of \nour Finance Committee colleagues: Senators Cantwell, Crapo, Kerry, \nSmith, Lincoln, and Snowe. As its title suggests, the purpose of this \nlegislation is to extend permanently and to improve the research \ncredit, which is set to expire in just a short time, at the end of \n2007.\n  Our Nation has benefited greatly in recent years from strong economic \ngrowth. I believe it is vital for all Americans to realize that this \neconomic growth did not just happen by accident. Rather, it is based on \nseveral factors, and one of the more important of these is innovation.\n  Innovation certainly does not just happen either. It is the result of \nseveral specific ingredients. Chief among those ingredients is the \namount of research and development occurring in the economy. Where does \nR come from? It comes from individuals, companies, and governments \nwho are willing to invest time and money.\n  Research and development is very expensive for companies to \nundertake. By its very nature, research activities seldom result in \nsuccess immediately. There are many dead ends and much frustration on \nthe way to the discovery of a product that can lead to profits.\n  Moreover, many times a firm's efforts to find innovative solutions to \nlife's problems result in good discoveries for mankind, but little or \nno immediate or even intermediate rewards for the company undertaking \nthe research. For this reason, most economists agree that even private \nresearch and development activities can create a common good, and one \nthat should be partially subsidized by the public.\n  The original research credit was enacted over 25 years ago to \nencourage an increase in R activity and to help subsidize the common \ngood that often is derived from research and innovation.\n  Just as today's economic health is a byproduct of the innovation that \ncame from yesterday's investment in R, our future economic health \nwill depend on the amount of innovation we harvest from our investment \nin research activities today, tomorrow, and into the future.\n  Years ago, our country had the clear edge on the rest of the \nindustrialized world when it came to having the most nurturing \nenvironment to foster research and development. We had more than our \nshare of the scientists, researchers, and other skilled workers to \nengage in R We had plenty of capital. We had world-class facilities. \nAnd we had the biggest market for products right here in the U.S. All \nthe ingredients for innovation were right here, and few other countries \ncould match our research environment. Thus, there was little thought of \ngoing anywhere else to perform research.\n  Sadly, this is no longer the case. Many of our trading partners now \npossess equal, and sometimes, superior environments to promote research \nto those we have here in the U.S. More importantly, many of these \ntrading partners now offer strong tax and other incentives designed to \nlure research to those nations and away from our shores.\n  Without a strong and effective research incentive of our own, I fear \nthat the United States is at risk of losing its leadership position in \ninnovation. The consequences of this could be very serious for our \nfuture economic growth and job creation, as well as for long-term \nprosperity and national security.\n  Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, our research credit is set to \nexpire in just a few weeks, at the end of December. Once again, \nAmerican businesses are finding themselves in the all-too familiar \nposition of wondering if the Congress is going to extend the research \ncredit, and if so, when and for how long.\n  This perennial guessing game that we force our research-intensive \nfirms to play every year or two is getting old. Moreover, it makes the \nresearch credit far less effective than it would otherwise be if it \nwere a constant. While it is true that there is some level of \nconfidence among the users of the research credit that this incentive \nwill be extended, everyone knows that the chances of the credit's \nrenewal are not certain, especially in today's volatile legislative \nclimate.\n  Therefore, the legislation we are introducing today once again \nprovides for the credit to be made permanent. A permanent credit can \nhelp our economy develop the new technologies that will enhance \nexisting capital inputs and make workers more productive. The result \nwill be a stronger economy at home, and a more competitive Nation \nabroad.\n  In assessing the health of our economy, we find an important \ncorrelation\n\n[[Page S13154]]\n\nbetween economic growth and inflationary pressures. One sure way to \nhave strong economic growth without the pain of inflation is to \nincrease productivity. Most productivity gains are derived from \ntechnological advances, which reduce the cost of producing goods and \nservices, and thereby help maintain low consumer prices.\n  An additional benefit of productivity growth is a corresponding \nincrease in corporate profits. Such increases lead to higher returns on \nsavings and investment, and higher wages for workers. I believe the \ngreatest benefit of increased R is productivity growth, which in turn \nforms the foundation of higher living standards.\n  Productivity growth also largely determines our society's long-term \neconomic welfare. Our ability to deal with budgetary challenges, such \nas Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlements, depends \ncritically on the future direction of our productivity.\n  My home State of Utah is a good example of how important research and \ninnovation is to state economies, and to our future prosperity. Utah is \nhome to various firms that invest a high percentage of their revenue in \nR There are thousands of employees working in Utah's technology \nbased companies, with thousands more working in other sectors that \nengage in R\n  According to a recent article in one of Utah's major newspapers, the \nDeseret Morning News, the number of Utah high tech and life sciences \ncompanies grew at the astonishing rate of more than 10 percent--from \n3,900 to 4,300--over the period of September 2005 to September 2006. \nThese industries in Utah employ more than 62,000 workers, with average \npay that is 66 percent higher than the statewide average \nnonagricultural wage. About 3,000 of these jobs are new ones added in \nthe past year.\n  These are the kinds of jobs and the kind of job growth that Utah, and \nall of the United States, needs for this new century. The jobs and \ncompanies in the high tech and life sciences sectors in Utah and around \nAmerica are diverse. But they have several things in common. They are \nclean, they are high-paying, and they require an educated workforce. \nThe vast majority of these companies export products, helping to offset \nour trade imbalance. Most importantly, however, is the fact that all of \nthese jobs depend on innovation as their lifeblood. R is in the very \nDNA of these companies.\n  One more thing all these highly desirable high tech jobs have in \ncommon is that America is at risk of losing them if we are not careful \nto maintain an environment that nurtures innovation and the other vital \ningredients that gave rise to these jobs in the first place. To my way \nof thinking, keeping a strong and viable research credit is a key part \nof this environment.\n  Since 1981, when the research credit was first enacted, the Federal \nGovernment has joined in partnership with large and small businesses to \nensure that research expenditures are made in the United States. This \nenhances domestic job creation, and helps the United States to \ninternalize more of the economic benefits from the research credit.\n  It seems clear that to continue to grow our economy we must maintain \nand enhance our position as the world leader in technological advances. \nThe worst thing we could do is to let it slip. Consequently, robust R \nspending should permeate our economy. We simply must continue to invest \nin research and development, and the Federal Government needs to \nreaffirm its role as a partner with the private sector.\n  While the research credit has proven to be a powerful incentive for \ncompanies to increase research and development activities, it \nunfortunately does not work perfectly. There are several reasons for \nthis, but a major one is that the original, or traditional, credit is \ncalculated using a base period from the mid-1980s. This reference \nperiod is becoming more distant and thus less relevant to the business \noperations of more companies each year. For example, many companies \nhave had major changes in their business models over the past two \ndecades. Yet, the traditional credit still requires a calculation that \nreferences revenue from this set of years from two decades ago.\n  This has been a growing problem for a number of years. To address it, \nCongress last year included an alternative to the traditional credit \nthat instead of referencing the old base period, is based on the \ntaxpayer's most recent three years of research activity. This credit, \nknown as the simplified alternative credit, has provided a meaningful \ntax incentive for firms with significant and growing amounts of \nresearch expenditures that were not getting much, if any, benefit from \nthe traditional credit.\n  Based on many discussions with companies that use the research \ncredit, it appears that the alternative simplified credit is now being \nused by more companies than is the traditional credit. This is true \neven though the alternative simplified credit is set at 12 percent, \nwhile the traditional credit is set at 20 percent.\n  Therefore, Senator Baucus and I have decided to introduce a change in \nthe research credit that would phase out the traditional credit, even \nas we increase the benefits of the alternative simplified credit. \nSpecifically, our bill would continue the traditional credit for two \nmore years, and then would eliminate this method of computing the \nresearch credit, beginning in 2010. At the same time, however, the bill \nwould increase the alternative simplified credit from the 12 percent \ncurrent rate to 16 percent in 2008, 18 percent in 2009, and 20 percent \nfor 2010 and thereafter.\n  We believe this gradual transformation from the increasingly obsolete \ntraditional credit to a single more relevant and strong alternative \nsimplified credit should create a smooth and generous transition, both \nfor traditional credit companies and for firms that find the new \nalternative simplified credit to be more beneficial.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in this \neffort. We have had widespread bipartisan support for extending the \nresearch credit here in the Senate. In fact, the Senate in 2001 passed \na permanent research credit, but its permanence unfortunately was \ndowngraded to another extension in conference with the House bill.\n  I believe that if we allow the research credit to expire, we will see \nthe negative effects manifest in lower economic growth, fewer jobs \ncreated, fewer innovative products created, and lost opportunities as \nresearch activities move to other countries with more attractive \nincentives. Again, we should never forget that our Nation's future \neconomic health is dependent on the innovations of today and tomorrow.\n  The United States needs to continue to be the world's leader in \ninnovation. We cannot afford to allow other countries to lure away the \nresearch that has always been done here. We cannot afford to have the \nlapses in the research pipeline that would result if we fail to extend \nthis credit before it expires on December 31. We need to make the \ncredit permanent so we can increase the growth rate of our economy. \nAnd, we need to improve and simplify the credit so that it is more \neffective.\n  Enacting this legislation would mean more and better jobs for \nAmerican workers. Innovation and new technology resulting from American \nresearch and development will continue to improve the standard of \nliving for every person in the U.S. and around the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, back in 1962, Marshall McLuhan wrote, \n``The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image \nof a global village.'' Certainly, 40 years later, that concept is truer \nthan ever. As we prepare for the future in this global village, we need \nto affirm America's leadership role in the world.\n  The United States accounts for one-third of the world's spending on \nscientific research and development, ranking first among all countries. \nWhile this is impressive, relative to\n\n[[Page S13156]]\n\nGDP, though, America falls to sixth place. And the trends show that \nmaintaining American leadership in the future depends on increased \ncommitment to research and science.\n  Asia has recognized this. Asia is plowing more funding into science \nand education. China, in particular, understands that technological \nadvancement means security, independence, and economic growth. Spending \non research and development has increased by 140 percent in China, \nKorea, and Taiwan. In America, it has increased by only 34 percent.\n  Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune \n500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have \nvisited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the \nworkers whom I met there.\n  China's commitment to research, at $60 billion in expenditures, is \ndramatic by any measure. Over the last few years, China has doubled the \nshare of its economy that it invests in research. China intends to \ndouble the amount committed to basic research in the next decade. \nCurrently, only America beats out China in numbers of researchers in \nthe workforce.\n  Today, I am pleased to join with my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Research Competitiveness Act \nof 2007. This bill would improve our research competitiveness in four \nmajor areas. All four address incentives in our tax code. Government \nalso supports research through Federal spending. But I am not \naddressing those areas today.\n  First, our bill improves and simplifies the credit for applied \nresearch in section 41 of the tax code. This credit has grown to be \noverly complex, both for taxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2008, our \nbill would create a simpler credit for qualifying research expenses \nthat exceed 50 percent of the average expenses for the prior 3 years. \nThis simplified credit would phase in over 3 years.\n  Just as important, the bill makes the credit permanent. Because the \ncredit has been temporary, it has simply not been as effective as it \ncould be. Since its creation in 1981, it has been extended 11 times. \nCongress even allowed it to lapse during one period.\n  The credit last expired in December of 2005. After much consternation \nand delay, Congress passed a 2-year extension just last month, \nextending the credit for 2006 and 2007. These temporary extensions have \ntaken their toll on taxpayers. In 2005, the experts at the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation wrote: ``Perhaps the greatest criticism of the \nR credit among taxpayers regards its temporary nature.'' Joint Tax \nwent on to say, ``A credit of longer duration may more successfully \ninduce additional research than would a temporary credit, even if the \ntemporary credit is periodically renewed.''\n  Currently, there are three different ways to claim a tax credit for \nqualifying research expenses. First, the ``traditional'' credit relies \non incremental increases in expenses compared to a mid-1980s base \nperiod. Second, the ``alternative incremental'' credit measures the \nincrease in research over the average of the prior 4 years.\n  Both of these credits have base periods involving gross receipts. \nUnder the new tax bill enacted last month, a third formula was created, \nwhich does not rely on gross receipts and is available only for 2007. \nOur bill simplifies these credits and will move all taxpayers to the \n``Alternative Simplified Credit,'' which is based on research spending \nwithout reference to gross receipts. The current formulas hurt \ncompanies that have fluctuating sales. It hurts companies that take on \na new line of business not dependent on research.\n  This new simpler formula in our bill would not start until 2008. That \nstart date would give companies plenty of time to adjust their \naccounting. The current formula would be available to companies for 2 \nyears, and then it would phase out.\n  The main complaint about the existing credits is that they are very \ncomplex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. \nThis base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to \ncalculate the credit. It creates problems for the IRS in trying to \nadminister and audit those claims.\n  The new credit focuses only on expenses, not gross receipts. It is \nstill an incremental credit, so that companies must continue to \nincrease research spending over time. Further, this bill adds a mandate \nfor a Treasury study to look at substantiation issues and ensure that \ncurrent recordkeeping requirements assist the IRS without unduly \nburdening the taxpayer.\n  A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote R A report by the \nCongressional Research Service finds that without government support, \ninvestment in R would fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus \nCRS endorses Government policies to boost private sector R\n  Also, American workers who are engaged in R activities benefit from \nsome of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled \njobs in the economy.\n  My own State of Montana has excellent examples of this economic \nactivity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments in Montana \nprovided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 \nper year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average \nprivate sector wage, which was less than $20,000 a year during the same \nperiod. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the \nassistance of the R credit.\n  Our research bill would also establish a uniform reimbursement rate \nfor all contract and consortia R It would provide that 80 percent of \nexpenses for research performed for the taxpayer by other parties count \nas qualifying research expenses under the regular credit.\n  Currently, when a taxpayer pays someone else to perform research for \nthe taxpayer, the taxpayer can claim one of three rates in order to \ndetermine how much the taxpayer can include for the research credit. \nThe lower amount is meant to assure overhead expenses that normally do \nnot qualify for the R credit are not counted. Different rates, \nhowever, create unnecessary complexity. Therefore, our bill creates a \nuniform rate of 80 percent.\n  The second major research area that this bill addresses is the need \nto enhance and simplify the credit for basic research. This credit \nbenefits universities and other entities committed to basic research. \nIt benefits the companies or individuals who donate to them. Our bill \nprovides that payments under the university basic research credit would \ncount as contractor expenses at the rate of 100 percent.\n  The current formula for calculating the university basic research \ncredit--defined as research ``for the advancement of science with no \nspecific commercial objective''--is even more complex that the regular \ntraditional R credit. Because of this complexity, this credit costs \nless than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the cost of the regular R credit. It \nis completely under-utilized. It needs to be simplified to encourage \nbusinesses to give more for basic research.\n  American universities have been powerful engines of scientific \ndiscovery. To maintain our premier global position in basic research, \nAmerica relies on sustained high levels of basic research funding and \nthe ability to recruit the most talented students in the world. The \ngestation of scientific discovery is long. At least at first, we cannot \nknow the commercial applications of a discovery. But America leads the \nworld in biotechnology today because of support for basic research in \nchemistry and physics in the 1960s. Maintaining a commitment to \nscientific inquiry, therefore, must be part of our vision for sustained \ncompetitiveness.\n  Translating university discoveries into commercial products also \ntakes innovation, capital, and risk. The Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies asked what kind of government intervention can \nmaintain technological leadership. One source of technological \ninnovation that provides America with comparative advantage is the \ncombination of university research programs, entrepreneurs, and risk \ncapital from venture capitalists, corporations, or governments. \nResearch clusters around Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research \nTriangle exemplify this sort of combination.\n  The National Academies reached a similar conclusion in a 2002 review \nof the National Nanotechnology Initiatives. In a report, they wrote: \n``To enhance the transition from basic to applied research, the \ncommittee recommends that industrial partnerships\n\n[[Page S13157]]\n\nbe stimulated and nurtured to help accelerate the commercialization of \nnational nanotechnology developments.''\n  In sum, our bill would boost both applied and basic research. It \nwould boost research by businesses big and small. And it would foster \nresearch by for-profit and nonprofits alike.\n  McLuhan's quote about the global village was taken by many at the \ntime as a wake-up call to a changing world. Since then, many more \nleaders in this village have emerged. Let us work to see that the next \nbig technological advance is discovered here in America. Only through \ncontinued commitment to research can we ensure that it is.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2212. A biff to support the establishment and operations of \nTeachers Professional Development Institutes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with my colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, that will \nstrengthen the content and pedagogy knowledge of our present K-12 \nteacher workforce and thus ultimately raise student achievement.\n  Our proposal would establish eight new Teacher Professional \nDevelopment Institutes throughout the Nation each year over the next \nfive years based on the model which has been operating at Yale \nUniversity for over 25 years. Every Teacher Institute would consist of \na partnership between an institution of higher education and the local \npublic school system in which a significant proportion of the students \ncome from low-income households. These Institutes will strengthen the \npresent teacher workforce by giving each participant an opportunity to \ngain more sophisticated content knowledge and a chance to develop \ncurriculum units with other colleagues that can be directly applied in \ntheir classrooms. We know that teachers gain confidence and enthusiasm \nwhen they have a deeper understanding of the subject matter that they \nteach and this translates into higher expectations for their students \nand an increase in student achievement.\n  The Teacher Professional Development Institutes are based on the \nYale-New Haven Teachers Institute model that has been in existence \nsince 1978. For over 25 years, the Institute has offered, six or seven \n13-session seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics that \nteachers have selected to enhance their mastery of the specific subject \narea that they teach. The subject selection process begins with \nrepresentatives from the Institutes soliciting ideas from teachers \nthroughout the school district for topics on which teachers feel they \nneed to have additional preparation, topics that will assist them in \npreparing materials they need for their students, or topics that will \nassist them in addressing the standards that the school district \nrequires. As a consensus emerges about desired seminar subjects, the \nInstitute director identifies university faculty members with the \nappropriate expertise, interest and desire to lead the seminar. \nUniversity faculty members, especially those who have led Institute \nseminars before, may sometimes suggest seminars they would like to \nlead, and these ideas are circulated by the representatives as well. \nThe final decisions on which seminar topics are offered are ultimately \nmade by the teachers who participate. In this way, the offerings are \ndesigned to respond to what teachers believe is needed and useful for \nboth themselves and their students.\n  The cooperative nature of the Institute seminar planning process \nensures its success: Institutes offer seminars and relevant materials \non topics teachers have identified and feel are needed for their own \npreparation as well as what they know will motivate and engage their \nstudents. Teachers enthusiastically take part in rigorous seminars they \nhave requested, and as part of the program, practice using the \nmaterials they have obtained and developed. This helps ensure that the \nexperience not only increases their preparation in the subjects they \nare assigned to teach, but also their participation in an Institute \nseminar gives them immediate hands-on active learning materials that \ncan be used in the classroom. In short, by allowing teachers to \ndetermine the seminar subjects and providing them the resources to \ndevelop relevant curricula for their classroom and their students, the \nInstitutes empower teachers. Teachers know their students best and they \nknow what should be done to improve schools and increase student \nlearning. The Teacher Professional Development Institutes promote this \nphilosophy.\n  From 1999-2002, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute promoted a \nNational Demonstration Project to create comparable Institutes at four \ndiverse sites with large concentrations of disadvantaged students. \nThese demonstration projects are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, \nHouston, Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Santa Ana, CA.\n  Follow-up evaluations have earned very positive results from the \nteacher participants in the Yale-New Haven Institute, as well as the \nfour demonstration sites. The data strongly support the conclusion that \nvirtually all teachers felt substantially strengthened in their mastery \nof content knowledge and they also developed increased expectations for \nwhat their students could achieve. In addition, because of their \ninvolvement in the course selection and curriculum development process, \nteacher participants have found these seminars to be especially \nrelevant and useful in their classroom practices. Mr. President, 95 \npercent of all participating teachers reported that the seminars were \nuseful. These Institutes have also served to foster teacher leadership, \nto develop supportive teacher networks, to heighten university faculty \ncommitments to improving K-12 public education, and to foster more \npositive partnerships between school districts and institutions of \nhigher education.\n  Many agree that teacher quality is the single most important school-\nrelated factor in determining student achievement. Effective teacher \nprofessional development programs that focus on subject and pedagogy \nknowledge are a proven method for enhancing the success of a teacher in \nthe classroom.\n  Though a K-12 teacher shortage is forecast in the near-term and many \nnew teachers will be entering our schools, those teachers who are \npresently on the job will do the majority of teaching in the classrooms \nin the very near future. For this reason, it is imperative to invest in \nmethods to strengthen our present teaching workforce. Like many \nprofessions, the quality of our teachers could diminish if their \nprofessional development is neglected. Positive educational \nachievements occur when coursework in a teacher's specific content area \nis combined with pedagogy techniques. This is what the Teacher \nProfessional Development Institutes Act strives to accomplish.\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has already proven to be a \nsuccessful model for teacher professional development as demonstrated \nby the high caliber curriculum unit plans that teacher participants \nhave developed and placed on the web, and by the evaluations that \nsupport the conclusion that virtually all the teacher participants felt \nsubstantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and \ntheir teaching skills. Our proposal would open this opportunity to many \nmore urban teachers throughout the nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 354\n\n       Whereas 35 years ago, on October 18, 1972, the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law \n     92-500) were enacted;\n       Whereas those amendments formed the basis of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``Clean Water Act''), the principal \n     Act governing water pollution in the United States;\n       Whereas substantial improvements to the water quality of \n     the United States have resulted from a successful partnership \n     among Federal, State, and local governments, the private \n     sector, and the public;\n       Whereas, since 1972, the Federal Government has provided \n     more than $82,000,000,000 to States and communities for \n     wastewater infrastructure and other assistance;\n       Whereas clean water is a natural resource of tremendous \n     value and importance to the United States;\n       Whereas there is resounding public support for the \n     continued protection and restoration of United States rivers, \n     streams, lakes, wetlands, and marine waters;\n       Whereas maintaining and improving water quality is \n     essential to protecting public health, fisheries, wildlife, \n     and watersheds, and for ensuring abundant opportunities for \n     public recreation and economic development;\n       Whereas it is the responsibility of all levels of \n     government and all citizens to ensure the availability of \n     clean water for future generations;\n       Whereas water pollution problems persist throughout the \n     United States, and significant challenges lie ahead in the \n     effort to protect and restore the water resources of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas in the most recent National Water Quality Inventory \n     of the 19 percent of the nations' rivers and streams assessed \n     45 percent of rivers and streams were impaired, of the 37 \n     percent of the nation's assessed lakes, ponds and reservoirs, \n     47 percent were impaired and of the 35 percent of the \n     nation's assessed bays and estuaries, 32 percent were \n     impaired; the remainder of the assessed waters met their \n     intended uses;\n       Whereas further development and innovation of water \n     pollution control programs and advancement of water pollution \n     control research and technology are necessary and desirable; \n     and\n       Whereas October 18, 2007, is the 35th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``Clean Water \n     Act''): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, as the United States marks the 35th \n     anniversary, on October 18, 2007, of the enactment of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 \n     (Public Law 92-500), which formed the basis for the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``Clean Water Act''), it is the sense \n     of the Senate that all citizens of the United States and all \n     levels of government should--\n       (1) recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of the \n     United States under that Act; and\n       (2) recommit to achieving the objectives of that Act of \n     restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and \n     biological integrity of the waters of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/19/senate-section/article/S13159-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13159-S13160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3404.
