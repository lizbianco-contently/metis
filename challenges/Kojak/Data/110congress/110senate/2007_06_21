Mr. President, Senator Ensign and I hold, every Thursday, \nin a room right off the Chamber, in the Johnson Room, the LBJ Room, a \nbreakfast where we have Nevadans come and visit with us.\n  Today it was a larger crowd than we usually have because school is \nout. Even if it were not a larger crowd, there were a lot more kids \nthere.\n  One of the young people who was there is Anna Ressell. Anna is from \nSparks, NV. She came to see me the day before yesterday with some other \nNevada girls because she is a diabetic. She was there today with all of \nher family--a wonderful child. She is 13 years old.\n  During her lifetime, this young lady has had 20,000 finger pokes, \n35,000 injections. She is a diabetic, I repeat. Think about that. When \nwe go to the doctor and they draw blood or give you a shot, we always \nwince because it hurts. We try to have a backbone of steel, but it \nhurts. This young lady has had 20,000 finger pokes to determine what \nher blood sugar levels are and 35,000 injections.\n  That is why it is so sad, when we see this young girl with her \nfamily, that that hope has been taken away. She came here with these \nother girls to talk about the need for stem cell research.\n  The President, yesterday, in his message to the Senate, snuffed out \nhope for tens of thousands of people in Nevada, people such as Anna and \nmany others suffering from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinal cord \ninjuries--millions of Americans. Their hope was snuffed out with the \nPresident vetoing this bill. It is too bad.\n  I also think it is so important that I mention to everyone, as I said \non the floor--I get up every morning and do my exercises and listen to \npublic radio. I get the news at the top of the hour and the middle of \nthe hour. I try to be up to date on what is going on in the world today \nthat is not in the morning newspaper.\n  It was not on the morning news this morning, the tragic, sad news \nfrom Iraq, that 14 more of our soldiers were killed in the last 36 \nhours--14. I don't know if any are from Nevada.\n  Meanwhile, we see further evidence that the Iraqi leaders are frozen \nin an increasingly dangerous stalemate. The Vice President resigned. \nThe fact is, our troops are caught in the middle of this civil war in \nfaraway Iraq, trying to give Iraqi leaders the space and security to \nbring their country together. We have 160,000 to 180,000 troops there \nnow, protecting the Shias, protecting the Sunnis, protecting the Kurds. \nThey are all after our soldiers.\n  Unfortunately, Iraq's leaders continue to drag their feet, while our\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\ntroops are getting killed; 14 more brave American soldiers.\n  But the problems aren't just in Iraq. The Middle East is engulfed in \ncivil war in Lebanon, civil war in Iraq, civil war among the \nPalestinians. The Israelis do not know where to turn. Iran is thumbing \nits nose at us.\n  That is why we have fought so hard, as Democrats, and will continue \nto fight, to change the course in Iraq. We need a new mission, one that \nis aligned with our strategic interests. We need to begin redeploying \nour troops from Iraq so we can reduce our large combat footprint and \nextricate forces from this Civil War.\n\n  We need more than two Republicans to help us. We have had two, and I \nso appreciate that. They made it so we were able to pass a bill, send \nit to the President, and he vetoed it. We need more.\n  I have signaled to my colleagues that the Defense authorization bill \nwill be coming up shortly. We intend to wage our battle on Iraq, \nchanging the course of the war in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8166-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 70 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 1733, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl, and the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 1704, \noffered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1733\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, resuming debate on the amendment which I \noffered, the amendment is very straightforward. It simply says that \nnotwithstanding the tax increases, $28.6 billion in tax increases in \nthe amendment pending on the floor, they shall not take effect unless \nthe Secretary of Energy certifies that those tax increases will not \nincrease retail gasoline prices or the reliance of the United States on \nforeign sources of energy.\n  The point of the amendment is to make it clear that sometimes tax \nincreases on business can be passed on to consumers. If that happens in \nthis case, we are going to see higher gasoline prices at the pump, not \nlower prices. One of the concerns many of us have with the underlying \nbill is it doesn't produce any new energy. Yet it spends $28.5 billion. \nTo make up for that spending, it taxes an additional $28.6 billion.\n  Somebody has to end up paying that tax. Most people in America know \nthat when you put a tax on a business, that gets passed on to the \nconsumers who buy the product--in this case, gasoline. So instead of \nreducing gasoline prices, this bill, if the underlying amendment \npasses, is going to add to the cost of gasoline.\n  Yesterday I mentioned a Heritage Foundation study that confirmed that \nwhat I was saying was not simply my opinion but the facts as a result \nof a study that the Heritage Foundation had done. I would like to \nexpand on that a little bit because we actually have the figures for \ntwo States, the State of the chairman of the committee, Montana, and my \nState of Arizona, to illustrate the point.\n  The study projects that gas prices in Montana, for example, in May \naveraged at $3.17 per gallon. They would be $3.48 per gallon next year \nas a result of the Energy bill before the Senate. A Montana taxpayer \nwould see spending on gasoline increase by $1,632.95 next year, as a \nresult of the bill.\n  In Arizona, we are paying about $3.09 per gallon. That would go up to \n$3.40 next year as a result of this bill, so Arizona taxpayers will see \nspending on gasoline increase by $1,140.51 next year as a result of \nthis Energy bill. That is a huge increase in consumers' payment for \ngasoline. When we realize that for many people driving is not a luxury, \nit is a requirement--to get to work or perform work--it is clear we are \ncosting the American consumer a huge amount of money that is important \nfor our economy and for them to make a living. That is an unintended \nconsequence of the tax increases embodied in this bill but real \nnevertheless.\n  What we are saying is, if that is the result of tax increases, then \nthose tax increases would not go into effect. I think that is an \nimportant principle for us to establish.\n  I would like to respond to a couple of points made by opponents of my \namendment. The chairman of the Finance Committee argued the tax \nincreases in the underlying bill are simply loophole closers, but that \nis not true. The largest tax increase in the bill is a brandnew tax. It \nis not a loophole closer, it is a new 13-percent tax on new oil \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico. How is that going to help bring down \ngasoline prices? I suggest it is not. It will help to raise prices.\n  The second largest tax increase in the bill raises the corporate tax \nrate. That is not a loophole closer either, it is simply needed to pay \nfor the other costs of the bill, so it was a ready source of revenue \nthat they decided to tap.\n  This is a raise in the corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies, \nwhich would then make it higher on those companies than others in \nmanufacturing--something we were trying to promote when we passed the \nbill 2 years ago.\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n  Raising the corporate tax rate is obviously not a loophole closer. I \nsuggest when you raise marginal tax rates, you either get less \nproduction or higher prices--more likely, both--not good results from \nraising taxes.\n  Finally, the Senator from Oregon argued yesterday that with oil over \n$55 a barrel, oil companies should not need incentives to drill for new \noil and gas. I certainly agree with that; they do not need any new \nincentives to drill for oil and gas. I have always been against those \nkinds of targeted incentives or taxpayer subsidies for any form of \nenergy. But imposing a new tax or raising the corporate rate is not the \nsame thing as repealing targeted incentives, which is what we should be \ndoing. Moreover, with oil over $60 a barrel right now, renewable energy \ncompanies should not need any further taxpayer subsidies either. The \nmarket is providing all the incentives necessary to produce hybrid cars \nand advanced fuels.\n  These tax increases are not necessary. They are going to be \ncounterproductive to our economic growth. They are going to hurt our \nproducers vis-a-vis foreign producers, they are going to further \nincrease our dependence on foreign oil and, most importantly, they are \ngoing to raise the cost of gasoline at the pump for American consumers.\n  All my amendment says is if that happens, then these tax increases \nshould not go into effect. If it doesn't have that effect, then the tax \nincreases would go into effect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Baucus \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  There are only two things wrong with the Baucus amendment: One, it \nraises taxes in the wrong places; and, secondly, it spends these taxes \non the wrong policies. I want to make two points upfront before I start \nmy remarks.\n  When we speak of American big oil, let me remind people that \nAmerica's five big oil companies hold less reserves than Hugo Chavez, \nthe state-owned company of Hugo Chavez in his country.\n  My second point is, very seldom does the United States tax businesses \nthat are in competition overseas. Let me repeat that. We in America \nhardly ever tax American businesses that are in competition overseas. \nOf course, that is exactly what we have done here, and what is going to \nhappen is not going to be good. It is not going to help the American \nconsumer one bit.\n  There are only two things, as I indicated, that are wrong with the \nBaucus amendment. I would repeat: It raises taxes in the wrong places, \nand then it spends them on the wrong policies.\n  I cast this vote, and I think it is an informed vote based on my \nexperience. It is with a deep sense of responsibility to do what is \nright, with a keen interest and understanding of energy policy, because \nI have been forced to work on it with many who know a lot about it. \nWith a real appreciation of the importance of this vote, I will oppose \ncloture.\n  The tax provisions in this bill will increase the cost of gasoline at \nthe pump for Americans, increase electricity bills for families, and \nwork severe hardship on our natural gas supply. Additionally, this \namendment could seriously harm our economy. The Federal Reserve \nChairman, Ben Bernanke, recently noted that: A significant increase in \nenergy prices can simultaneously slow the economy, and raise inflation.\n  I cannot vote for that consequence. I urge that my colleagues not do \nso either. I do not cast this vote lightly, and I arrive at the \ndecision after a great deal of reflection. There are many good and \nimportant provisions contained in this amendment. In the area of \nrenewable energy, while there may be questions about how long certain \ntax credits should be extended, there should be no doubt that in the \npast I have supported renewable energy.\n  In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with Senator Bingaman, we passed \nthe largest tax incentives for renewable energy, a variety of renewable \nenergies, than we ever have in American history. My friend and \ncolleague Senator Alexander has often referred to the bill that we \npassed as the ``Clean Energy Act.'' He is right. In 2005, in the Energy \nPolicy Act we provided renewable energy production tax credits, \nautomobile tax credits, and we can keep going. We provided tax credits \nfor energy efficient improvements, biodiesel, and for ethanol. We \nincluded tax credits for installing alternative refueling property, tax \ncredits for the installation of solar. The world demanded cleaner \nenergy, and the Energy Policy Act answered the call.\n  Between 2004 and 2006, global private capital investment in clean \nenergy rose from around $30 billion to $60 billion a year. It rose \nbecause we set the framework into law, and it was invested on the \nprivate side. In the public market and in venture capital and in \nprivate equity, in corporate research, development, and demonstration, \nand government research and development and asset financing, the answer \nhas been the same. Both the private and public sector are excited about \nthe future of clean energy, and they are busy, under our 2005 act, \ninvesting heavily in it.\n  The weakness is in the amendment I am talking about. Without \nquestion, some of the tax incentives in this bill could have a positive \nimpact on the landscape of American energy future. To deny that would \nbe to debate unfairly the merits of this amendment.\n  Cellulosic ethanol production credits, plug-in hybrid vehicle \ncredits, and clean coal energy bonds are smart financial incentives, \nand those tax policies complement many of the goals we have sought to \nachieve in the previous legislation. I think that is good.\n  Supporting the great things that we accomplished together in the \nEnergy bill 2 years ago made us all feel good. However, the tax \nincentives in this bill focus on too narrow a field of energy policy. \nThe Finance Committee has reported this amendment with a pricetag of \n$32.1 billion, a very large tax increase. In a few minutes I will speak \nabout the troubling revenue-raising proposals in this amendment.\n  But, first, I ask myself and I ask others, so our people would get a \nfeeling of what $32.1 billion is, what it can be better used for or \nwhat it might be used for in the American economy if it were free to be \ninvested or other things bought with it: $32.1 billion would purchase \n15 biorefineries, 16,000 barrels-per-day coal-to-liquid refineries, 5 \ngasoline refineries, and 4 nuclear powerplants, 10 bio-energy research \ncenters, and 500 miles of transmission lines.\n\n  Now, I am not suggesting we would buy them with this bill, but I am \nsuggesting that everyone should know the huge size of this tax, taken \nout of the economy, and what it would invest in similar dollars, that \nit could invest in the American economy. I just told you what they \nwere.\n  We could use this money for commercial demonstrations in oil shale, \nfund demonstrations for energy from coal using IGCC, and we all know we \nmust do that. We do not have any money to do them, and we are having \ndifficulty getting loans from the Government, and here we are taking \n$32 billion and not providing anything for these kinds of investments \nthat we must do if we are going to keep pace with China, which is going \nfull speed ahead with all of those things, including nuclear power, and \nnuclear powerplants in this country. We must get there also.\n  But in the meantime, we are taking an awful lot of revenue flow out \nof the economy, right away from the energy companies that know how to \ninvest it, where to invest it, how to pick up reserves, and how to keep \nthe price of oil as much within bounds as the world market will permit.\n  Without question, the revenue-raising proposals in the amendment will \nincreases the cost of exploring for and producing our Nation's oil and \ngas and natural gas. As a result, Americans will pay higher prices for \ngasoline at the pump, and we will suffer increased electricity costs as \nour Nation's natural gas supply is weakened. We will pay higher prices, \nobviously, for natural gas.\n  The excise tax on oil and gas exploration increases taxes $10 billion \nover 10 years on producers on our Nation's Outer Continental Shelf. \nFrankly, I believe that entire tax is wrong. We should not be taxing \nthe most productive--the places where more money is being put for \nexploration than anywhere else, the Outer Continental\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nShelf. Yet one-third of the taxes here come from imposing a fee, a very \nhigh fee, on the Outer Continental Shelf. Who would have thought it? \nThe place in America where we have a chance of producing, we have \nimposed a heavy tax. Proponents of this amendment claim these tax \nprovisions only affect the five largest U.S. oil and gas companies. Not \ntrue. But I have already told you who they are and what they represent \nin the world markets.\n  In fact, there are 40 lessee companies. Nearly 75 percent of all \nentities leasing on the OCS hold leases that would be subject to a 13-\npercent punitive tax. I hardly thought I would see that on the floor of \nthe Senate. Yet here it is, bragged about as a very big source of money \nthat we can do other things with, without regard to the prices the \nAmerican people are going to pay in the increased prices for oil and \ngas coming from the shelf.\n  This is the lifeblood of our domestic oil and gas production. It \nmakes absolutely no sense to advocate for independence from foreign \noil, and then turn right around and raise taxes on our domestic \ncompanies that are producing America's oil and natural gas. It will \nmean higher prices for consumers.\n  Oil and gas production in the Outer Continental Shelf amounts to \napproximately 1.7 million barrels of oil per day, and 12\\1/2\\ billion \ncubic feet of natural gas. Annually, this production equals \napproximately 600 million barrels of oil per year and 4.7 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas per year.\n  Now, that is good. They are doing fine. So why don't we put a tax on \nthem of 13.5 surtax? It makes no sense. The price will go up, \nproduction will come down. These amounts produce 30 percent of our \ndomestic oil production per year, and 23 percent of our domestic \nnatural gas. Placing a punitive tax on this production is serious \nbusiness backed by very serious facts, and I say serious consequences.\n  Activities on the OCS provide an average of over $6 billion a year in \nrevenue to the Treasury. In the future the offshore will be even more \nimportant. The Minerals Management Service estimates about 60 percent \nof the oil and 40 percent of the natural gas resources estimated to be \ncontained in remaining undiscovered fields in the United States are \nlocated where? Where might you guess? In the Outer Continental Shelf, \nupon which we are going to place a very stiff, very high tax.\n  Furthermore, the intent of the OCS excise tax and the effect of this \ntax is crystal clear. The provision charges 13 percent of the removal \nprice of taxable crude oil and natural gas, with a credit available to \nthose who have price thresholds on their oil and natural gas leases. In \nplain English, this amendment seeks to legislatively breach valid \ncontracts from 1998 and 1999, because the Clinton administration failed \nto include a term in these agreements.\n  In other words, there was no fault of the companies. The Clinton \nadministration either made a mistake or did not want to put the fee on; \nit just didn't happen. So for those 2 years, we have royalty leases \nwith no royalty thresholds.\n  Congress cannot rewrite contracts after the fact merely because we do \nnot like the contracts or the results. I predict when we are all \nfinished, the courts of the land are going to say: This part of this \ntax is illegal and unconstitutional, and out the window will go a very \nlarge portion of this tax because the rights are clearly there. We have \nto think about it and think about what we are doing.\n  I do not like the idea of the United States of America going back on \nits contracts. It sounds and looks and smells like some foreign \ncountry. But we are close to doing it here in the name of some new \nanswer, and at the same time saying it is going to yield revenues for \nus to use for various things in this bill.\n  As we consider this amendment, the Senate should be on notice that \nlegal precedent would not be on our side. The U.S. Supreme Court and \nFederal circuit court precedents suggest that the Government cannot \navoid the obligations of its contracts by using its taxing power to \ntake back benefits it has given up pursuant to an agreement. I suggest \nto the Senate that a Federal court will recognize this tax for what it \nis and, therefore, this $10 billion we are counting on in this bill \nwill be lost.\n  The Department of the Interior has already testified before \nCongress expressing its concern about protracted litigation over this \nissue and the potential for a loss of billions in revenue as well as \nthe delay of oil and gas production.\n\n  There are 2 other provisions among the revenue raising proposals that \nare very troubling. One provision would amend the Job Creation Act of \n2004, which created tax relief for more than 200,000 U.S. corporations \nand businesses. This proposal increases taxes by almost $10 billion \nover 10 years.\n  Instead of the Jobs Creation Act, we could call this provision the \nJobs Destruction Act.\n  Finally, the increase in taxes by the U.S. Government on American \ncompanies competing overseas--through the foreign oil tax provision--\nincreases taxes $3.1 billion over 10 years.\n  This amendment also attacks American interests and cedes control to \nforeign interests. It says we would rather buy energy from the likes of \nHugo Chavez in Venezuela than produce it ourselves.\n  To put the proper context on this, Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian \nstate-owned oil company, has nearly 3 times more daily output per \nmillion barrels per day than the largest U.S. oil company and holds \nnearly 10 times the oil and natural gas reserves.\n  To make it more difficult for American companies to compete overseas \nfor this global commodity at a time when oil prices are nearly $70 per \nbarrel is simply wrong. The Senate should reject this political \nexpediency that will hurt American businesses, and the American \nconsumer.\n  I began my remarks by conveying to this Senate the seriousness with \nwhich I cast this vote.\n  In my judgment, this amendment will have significant negative \nconsequences on America's energy security. The Baucus amendment will \nincrease the cost of producing oil and gas in America and will \nundermine the ability of American businesses to compete against state-\nowned oil companies run by foreign governments. The result for our \nNation will be a greater reliance on crude oil from hostile regions of \nthe world and an increase in the price of gasoline for the American \npeople.\n  That is an unacceptable consequence and not what the American people \nexpect of us.\n  For the reasons that I have stated, I must vote no on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Baucus amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I come to the floor to oppose the tax that has been proposed and is \nnow before us brought by the Finance Committee.\n  It is very easy politically to stick it to the big boys, and that is \nthe political game which is being played out on the floor of the Senate \nas we speak. Stick it to the big boys. OK, we are going to stick it to \nthe big boys, $32.1 billion worth of taxes. What will it do for us? \nWill it change the price at the gas pump today? No. In fact, we have \njust heard the Senator from New Mexico say it could possibly raise the \nprice of gas in the long term. Hasn't this Senate heard the plea of the \nAmerican consumer over the last 6 months about $3 gas? Don't we get it \ntoday or do we just want to play petrol politics? That is what the \nFinance Committee has done; they have played petrol politics. They are \nsticking it to the big boys, and they are going to put it in the green \nmachine. The green machine may yield some energy in the future, but it \nsure isn't going to change the price at the gas pump tomorrow or the \nnext day or next week or next year. If they argue in disagreement with \nme, my answer is simple: Prove it. Prove that you will change the price \nat the pump. Or will the big boys simply try to pass it through to the \nconsumer? We will find out, won't we, if this bill passes. That is why \nI am going to have to oppose cloture on the Baucus provision of taxes, \nthe petrol politics of this issue.\n  Let me show you the petrol politics of the real issue. Here is where \nthe reserves in the world exist today. Here are the big boys of \nAmerica--Exxon,\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nChevron, Marathon. Do we really think if we stick it to these three and \nmore we will change the world? No. The world today from the standpoint \nof energy is controlled over here on the left-hand side of the chart. \nIt is controlled by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and so on down the line. \nThey control the known reserves. They control the world's oil supply. \nThey are the big boys. We are not sticking it to them. In fact, we are \nhanding them a golden leaf. We are saying: You control the world oil \nsupply, and we are dependent upon you for 60 percent of our supply. But \nwe are going to penalize our producers because of the petrol politics \nof this issue.\n  There is another petrol game being played out. Petrol politics is \nbeing played out on the floor of the Senate, but petrol nationalism is \nbeing played out by these companies and countries of known reserve. \nEvery one of these producers controls their supply; their nation's \ngovernment and their nation's government's companies control the supply \nof oil. They can turn the valve on or off. Every time they do, the \nAmerican consumer ultimately pays more. That is called petrol \nnationalism. I believe when we talk about the war of energy today, that \nis what we are involved in. We are involved in a war on who can produce \nenergy and can we become energy secure so that we don't have to be \ndependent upon Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Iran.\n  We know what is happening in that area of the world today, the \nphenomenal instability. Not only do these nations play petrol \nnationalism, they also play with something else: They have the weapon \nof mass disruption. Let me repeat that. These nations hold the weapon \nof mass disruption. You change the price at the pump a couple of \ndollars because you turn the valve off in these countries, and you hit \nthis economy like a freight train.\n  What are we going to do today? We are going to tax it a little more. \nThat is all this Congress really knows how to do, is tax. They don't \nknow how to produce. We don't produce. We get out of the way of \nproduction. We encourage production, but this bill will not produce one \nbarrel of oil. ExxonMobil will produce a barrel of oil. Chevron will. \nMarathon will. The rest of these countries will. But we don't. We are \nnow stepping in the way of that production. We are now penalizing that \nproduction.\n  The senior Senator from New Mexico talked about where the greatest \nreserves of America lie today--offshore. Yet we are saying: If you want \nto play out there, if you want to go out, find it, drill, we are going \nto tax you. We are going to penalize you instead of encourage you and \nincentivize you to discover, to bring it to the wellhead and to bring \nit to America's shores and to refine it for the American consumer.\n  Anybody in a reasonable way who doesn't want to play the political \ngame being played out on the floor as we speak--petrol politics--needs \nto vote no on cloture.\n  If the American consumer thinks these companies are going to pay the \n$32.1 billion in taxes, they have it wrong. They are going to pay it at \nthe pump. The Baucus bill pumps tax dollars out of the back pocket of \nthe American consumer. It does not allow oil to be pumped out of the \nground. It does not allow us to hold a stronger political position in \nthe world of petrol nationalism. That is the debate we are going \nthrough right now. It is about windmills. It is about cellulosic. It is \nabout all the things I like. But it really isn't. It is antiproduction. \nIt is anticonsumer. It is anti-American to deny our Nation's economy \naccess to the world energy supply. That is what we are doing. Let's \nallow Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Iran to grab us by the gas nozzle and \njerk us around every time they choose. This tax package suggests that \ncould start again tomorrow because we are not going to get ourselves \nback into the business of production.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very interesting series of \nstatements we have heard in the last 15 minutes, half hour, statements \nbasically trying to lead Americans to believe that this Finance \nCommittee tax package, as well as the provisions of the tax package to \npay for incentives so we can wean ourselves away from OPEC, away from \nall these countries, is going to result somehow in some cataclysmic \nevent; namely, gasoline prices are going to go up, according to \nstatements we have heard. We have also heard that we are going to \nreduce domestic exploration and development of American oil companies; \nwe are putting ourselves in the hands of foreign countries. The fact \nis, the exact opposite is the case. These statements are amazing. It is \ngood political rhetoric, but it has nothing to do with the facts.\n  First, it is more important that people understand that the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, basically delegates to \nthe Secretary of Energy whether $30 billion worth of tax provisions \nwill be enacted. I am astounded that anybody in the Senate wants to \ndelegate that decision to the Secretary of Energy instead of the U.S. \nCongress deciding whether the tax needs to be imposed.\n  The Kyl amendment basically says that unless the Energy Secretary can \ndetermine that the effect of this will not increase the price of \ngasoline at the pump, that he, the Energy Secretary, or she, the Energy \nSecretary--whoever the Energy Secretary is--will automatically be \nforced to rescind the pay-fors in this bill. That is astounding. It is \nbasically delegating to the Energy Secretary a policy which should be \nmade by the Congress, and that is a huge dereliction of responsibility. \nI am appalled that anybody would dare suggest it. But that is a fact.\n  Second, if we look at the whole bill, the Finance Committee package \nin the Energy bill and also the Kyl amendment, several things are \nstriking. The first is the major underlying Finance Committee bill is \ndesigned to accomplish the objective that the Senator from Idaho is \ncomplaining about. The Senator from Idaho is complaining that this \namendment transfers power to Venezuela or to Saudi Arabia, other \ncountries. The whole point of this bill is the exact opposite. It is to \nwean ourselves away from OPEC, wean ourselves away from those \ncountries, so that we Americans are in a better position to determine \nour own destiny, in a better position to get more energy production \nhere in America.\n  How do we do that? The committee bill does that through all kinds of \nincentives. It reduces taxes in lots of different ways for alternative \nenergy, renewable energy, cellulosic development, encouraging more \nAmerican clean coal technology so we can tap into our vast reserves of \ncoal. It has lots of ways we could help America be more self-sufficient \nand wean ourselves away from these very high gasoline prices we are \nforced to pay partly because OPEC is forcing us to pay those prices; \nthe truth is, partly because the major oil companies are charging \nwhatever the market will bear. That is why they are charging such high \nprices to the American consumer. What evidence do I have of that? It is \nvery simple and direct.\n  I was stunned because of the candor of the CEO of ExxonMobil when he \nmade this statement. This was last year at a Judiciary Committee \nhearing. I was not there; I was watching on C-SPAN. At that hearing, \nthe exchange was essentially between the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nKohl, and the CEO of Exxon. I think Senator Kohl asked the question. \nThis was an open hearing.\n  He said: Sir, why are gasoline prices so high now?\n  The answer: Well, Exxon has to pay more because OPEC is charging us \nmore. So we to have pay more, and we transfer those price increases \ndown to the American consumer.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin asked the head of ExxonMobil: Explain this \nto me, please. At the same time, your profits have exploded. They have \ngone up about $35 billion this year. Your profits have expanded.\n  Senator Kohl said: I am a businessman. Ordinarily, if my costs go up, \nmy profits go down. Please explain to me why you would say your costs \nare going up because OPEC is charging you more and yet your profits are \ngoing way up. Why?\n  His answer was very illustrative of the point here. He said, in all \ncandor: Senator, my responsibility is not to the American consumer; my \nresponsibility is to my stockholders. I will charge whatever the market \nwill bear because I have a duty to protect my stockholders and get \nwhatever I can for my stockholders. I am going to charge whatever I \ncan.\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\n  That is why profits are so high, because Americans can't put milk in \ntheir car or their truck. They can't put in water. They have to put in \ndiesel fuel or gasoline. Americans are stuck. The majors are passing on \nthrough their distribution system these very high gasoline prices \nbecause they can get away with it and because it fattens profits and \nbecause they are beholden to stockholders, not the American consumers.\n  What about these provisions which the Senator from Arizona wants to \nstrike. There are three of them. It is very simple, and there is a \nreason why they are there and why they will not have the disastrous \neffect the Senator from Arizona claims.\n  The first one is to rescind a tax break we gave to the five major oil \ncompanies back in 2004. It is called section 199.\n  We gave that tax break, frankly, to all American domestic \nmanufacturers, including the oil companies. It was as a response to a \nWTO ruling a year or two earlier which said our American tax laws--\nwhich gave incentives for American products to be exported--were WTO \nillegal. So we came up with a backup plan. The backup plan was \nbasically section 199 in the code, enacted in the 2004 Jobs Act, which \nsays, OK, we will give an extra little break to domestic production in \nthe United States. If they export the products, fine; if they do not, \nthat is fine. We will still give them a break. That is what that is.\n  What has happened to domestic oil production in the United States \nsince that was enacted in 2004? Well, one would think it probably \nincreased a little bit because the major oil companies get a little tax \nbreak. The fact is, the exact opposite has happened.\n  Let me quote a couple statistics. In 2004, when that provision was \nput in effect, domestic production was about 170 million barrels a \nmonth. It was 170 million barrels a month in 2004. Well, you would \nthink it would go up because of that tax break for domestic production. \nOh, no, that is not what happened. It actually went down. It is down to \nabout 160 million barrels.\n  Look at the price of oil. Back in 2004, the price of oil was $40 a \nbarrel. Now it is about $65 a barrel. Well, gee, you would think--that \nis more money in the oil companies' coffers--they would want to use \nthat for more exploration, more development. No. Again, there is less \ndomestic production, even with the price of oil so high over that \nperiod of time and even though they have had a tax break. I might add, \ntoo, the price of gasoline at the pump back then was about $2 a gallon. \nToday, it is above $3 a gallon. So that did not help.\n  So, gee, we thought: We will take that away. It did not help, so we \nwill take it away. So, therefore, it seems to me it is not going to \ncause an increase in the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  I might say, the statistics cited by the Senator from Arizona are \nbased on the Heritage Foundation. I am not going to get into the \nquestion of who financed that study--I have an idea who financed that \nstudy; and, therefore, it drove the results they would like to get--but \nthat is the same organization that said Iraqi oil is going to pay for \nIraq reconstruction too. They were dead wrong then, and they are dead \nwrong now. They are an organization which, frankly, I think is not the \nmost objective, independent organization in the world. That is the \nfirst one. That is why we made that first change.\n  The second provision in the Finance Committee bill the Senator's \namendment wants to strike is a loophole closer. We are trying to close \na loophole. The Joint Committee on Taxation said--that is a bipartisan \norganization, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which serves both the \nHouse and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats--their independent \nstudy shows there is a big loophole the major oil companies take with \nrespect to foreign tax breaks in this area; that is, ordinarily a \ncompany gets to reduce its income taxes in the amount of the foreign \ntaxes that company pays to a foreign country.\n  Now, the law is different between exploration costs and distribution \ndownstream costs. The companies game the system. They offset one \nagainst the other. Joint Tax saw this big loophole. Let's close it. \nThat is the second provision. Also, I do not see how anybody could \nargue against that. It is a big loophole closer. It makes the Tax Code \nmore fair.\n  Then we get to the third provision. This is the so-called \nconfiscatory excise tax on the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico. \nLet's be honest. First of all, the President of the United States, \nhimself, believes there is insufficient revenue paid to Uncle Sam on \nthese OCS leases. The best evidence: The President of the United \nStates, himself, has enacted a 6\\2/3\\-percent royalty on all new leases \nin the gulf. He thinks they are not paying enough. He has increased the \ncurrent royalty--it was 12 percent. The bill has a 13-percent severance \ntax. The President, himself, has enacted a whole new higher royalty \nprovision on new leases in the gulf. He thinks they are undertaxed. \nRight now it is about a 12-percent royalty. This provision in our \nFinance Committee bill says a 13-percent severance tax.\n  Clearly, Congress has the power to enact a tax. The royalties paid by \nany company are credited against the 13 percent, and so it is a net \nlower than what the President thinks the amount should be in revenue \npaid by the oil and gas companies in the gulf.\n  I might also say the General Accounting Office has done a study of \nhow much America taxes oil and gas compared with how other countries \ntax oil and gas. What is the result of the GAO study? The result of the \nGAO study is we Americans basically tax oil and gas less than other \njurisdictions around the world--or other States. The State of Alaska is \ntaxing more. Other countries tax more now. We Americans are pretty easy \nand soft compared to other countries on how much we tax oil and gas \nrevenues.\n\n  So this argument that somehow, oh, my gosh, America is going to tax \noil and gas companies with these provisions--that it is confiscatory; \nthey are going to go overseas--it is just nonsense. It is just total \nnonsense because, already, oil and gas revenue in the United States is \nnot taxed as much as it is in other jurisdictions. It seems to me, \ntherefore, it is not unfair to enact this provision.\n  The main point is if the Kyl amendment passes, then the Finance \nCommittee tax title of this bill is dead because we are not paying for \nit, effectively. That is because the Energy Secretary, under the Kyl \namendment, probably would rule that maybe prices might go up at the \npump, given the politics of it all, and that means we do not have a \nbill anymore.\n  Therefore, I urge Senators to say: OK, let's do what is right. Let's \nstart to wean ourselves from OPEC. Let's start to give some incentives \nto American domestic producers of alternative fuels, renewable fuels, \nand have more conservation measures to help America again take control \nof our own destiny.\n  This is not a perfect bill. Nothing is perfect. But it is a good \nbill. It is a very good bill. It helps put America back on track, helps \nAmerica turn the corner toward more energy independence, and enhances \nour national security so we are less reliant upon OPEC, less reliant \nupon those countries to which some Senators say this bill gives a \nbreak. It does not. This bill does the exact opposite. It helps America \nbecome America again.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address why we should have \ncloture on this bill to get to finality--and that is going to take 60 \nvotes--and why you should not support the Kyl amendment.\n  In the debate on some of this bill, particularly in committee, we had \nthe issue of, well, we are taxing oil companies to promote renewable \nfuels; that this is an industrial policy, and it is bad for Congress to \nbe involved in industrial policy. Basically, I agree.\n  But, remember, throughout the history of this country, Congress has \nbeen involved in a lot of industrial policy. There would not be a \nfarmstead today that would have electricity if we did not have rural \nelectric cooperatives. Railroads would have a monopoly on hauling \nthings if we did not have river improvements so that barges could work \nas well. Railroads would still be hauling most of our commerce if we \nhad not built an interstate system. Airports and airlines are all about \nthe Government promoting competition.\n  Also, we are involved in where we are, taxing the oil industry to get \na renewable energy industry started--as we\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\nhave been for 20 years now just with ethanol, and expanding it beyond \nethanol, but we would not have an ethanol industry today if we had not \nhad tax incentives over the last few years. There will be, someday--\njust like we are saying to the oil companies today: You got your start \nbecause of tax policy, a lot of tax benefits, because the oil industry \nwas infant at one time and needed to get started. The same thing is \ntrue of alternative energy. If we do not give some tax incentives to \nget alternative energy--and I mean beyond ethanol: biodiesel, wind \nenergy, things that maybe we do not even have on our mind today--we are \ntalking a little bit about cellulosic ethanol, but it is around the \ncorner yet--we are not going to develop these industries to the strong \ncapability they need to be when there is less and less and less \ntransportation provided by petroleum products.\n  So I think we ought to look at the reality of how a gigantic oil \nindustry got started in the United States--through tax incentives. We \nare talking about tax incentives to get alternative energy started. \nThat is why I hope you will abide by the decisions the Committee on \nFinance made to have these situations where there is some tax on oil \ncompanies for the benefit of tax credits for alternative energy.\n  I hope you also appreciate the fact that maybe a lot of us would like \nto have the tax incentives without offsets, but we are in an \nenvironment of pay-go. We are not in a reconciliation situation. We are \nin a situation where we have to provide the necessary offsets in order \nto get this legislation through.\n  So I hope you will think of the history of where we have been with \ntax policies to promote an industry that is out there now. I hope you \nwill understand that God only made so much fossil fuel and there has to \nbe a follow-on if we are going to have the growth of our economy.\n  I would like to state this one last point that I have heard the \nPresident of the United States make many times when I have been to the \nWhite House in the Oval Office to talk energy. The President has said \nmany times that with these high prices of oil the way they are, we do \nnot need any more incentives for the oil companies to get more energy.\n  The President has been a friend of alternative energy, most often \nexpressing his support of ethanol, but a supporter of alternative \nenergy, and I hope he is in support of this legislation as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor because I think the Senator's time \nis about up. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I \nwant to publicly state what I have stated several times in the last few \ndays, and that is my appreciation to Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley for their leadership in putting this tax package together that \nhas been reported favorably by the Finance Committee on which I am \nprivileged to serve.\n  Let me speak, briefly, about the Kyl amendment and then talk about \nthe tax package more generally and why we should vote to invoke cloture \non this tax package and proceed.\n  On the Kyl amendment, my first concern is the obvious one: that \nadoption of the Kyl amendment would be totally irresponsible as a \nfiscal matter. The Kyl amendment says ``notwithstanding any other \nprovision of the subtitle,'' the subtitle being those provisions that \nraise revenue to pay for this. We are in a pay-go situation in the \nSenate under our budgetary arrangements, so if we are going to provide \ntax credits and tax benefits to some parts of the economy, we need to \npay for that. We need to find some way to obtain the revenue. The way \nthe committee has found is to reduce the tax benefits that some other \nparts of the economy are enjoying today.\n  So Senator Kyl's amendment says ``notwithstanding the provisions \nof''--the provisions in the tax package that raise revenue--none of \nthis shall ``take effect unless the Secretary of Energy'' positively \ndecides, that is, ``certifies that such amendments shall not increase \ngasoline retail prices and the reliance of the United States on foreign \nsources of energy.''\n  So, essentially, we are saying it is up to the Secretary of Energy \nwhether we pay for this set of tax provisions. I do not think it is \nresponsible for this Congress to take that position. I mean it is \ngreat, and I know everybody likes to be able to go home and say: I \ndidn't oppose the production tax credit extension which is in the bill, \nI didn't oppose the investment tax credit for solar energy which is in \nthe bill, I didn't oppose the provisions that would incentivize more \nbiofuels production; all I opposed was the idea that we should pay for \nthem. I don't think that is a responsible position for us to take.\n\n  On the general tax package and the cloture issue, let me say, the \narguments I have heard are three. Some have argued this is going to \nreduce production; some have argued it is going to increase the price \nof gas; some have argued this is going to hurt the energy companies. \nLet me address each of those points briefly.\n  On reducing production, I don't think this is going to reduce \ndomestic production of oil and gas. I think Senator Baucus made the \npoint very clearly that the two big items that are being used to pay \nfor this tax package are this section 199 provision, which was not even \nin the law until 2004. We are taking that away as it applies to certain \nlarge companies.\n  Then, of course, the severance tax provision. Let me talk a minute \nabout that. I wasn't here last evening when Senator Bunning was \nspeaking, but I noticed he referred to it as Senator Bingaman's \n``scheme'' in his comments last night. The severance tax proposal is \nnot that; it is a 13-percent tax which would apply prospectively; there \nis nothing retrospective about it. It is prospective. It applies to all \nproduction of oil and gas that occurs in the Outer Continental Shelf \nand in the Gulf of Mexico. It is designed so it will not be unduly \nburdensome on any company that is producing in the Gulf of Mexico. I \nthink we have done a good job in accomplishing that. It does not \nabrogate contracts. It is a forward-looking tax provision which I think \nis eminently reasonable.\n  It would raise some revenue that is sorely needed if we are going to \nextend these tax provisions, including the production tax credit, the \ninvestment tax credit, and the other provisions that are in this bill. \nI feel very strongly that we should keep it in place, and it is an \nappropriate way for this Congress to proceed.\n  The second argument we heard was if we adopt this, we are going to \nsee an increase in the price of gas. The truth is we all know the price \nof oil is determined on the world market. Our producers produce \nsomething like 5 percent of the oil that goes into the world market. So \nthe idea that for us to raise some revenue here is going to affect the \nprice of gas at the pump is not true. If the world price of oil goes \nup, we wind up paying more at the pump; if the world price of oil goes \ndown, we wind up paying less at the pump. I think American consumers \nhave watched that occur year after year and they understand that is the \ncircumstance.\n  The other argument is this is going to hurt our energy companies, \nthat this is an undue burden on them. When you look at the reality, the \nreported profits of the top five integrated oil and gas producers last \nyear were over $111 billion. I don't begrudge them that, but that is 1 \nyear, and that is 5 companies. If profits continue at somewhere in that \nrange, we can reasonably expect very conservatively that producers--\nlarge producers of oil and gas--will have over the next 10 years over \n$1 trillion in profits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So we have $1 trillion of profits over the next 10 \nyears. This package calls for raising $27 billion over the next 10 \nyears. So that is something in the range of 2.5 percent of profits, a \nmuch smaller percentage of revenues, of total revenues. So I point out \nthat is not an undue burden on\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nanyone, and I think all of these screams that this is the end of the \nworld for the oil and gas industry are not founded on any kind of basis \nin fact.\n  I think the whole purpose here is to do some very good things in the \nTax Code, which I compliment the Senator from Montana and the Senator \nfrom Iowa for proposing, and to do so by--under our pay-go rules, find \nrevenue where it will reduce production at the very least, and I think \nthey have done an excellent job in accomplishing that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the tax package and vote for cloture \non the tax package when it comes up for a vote following the Kyl \namendment, and obviously I urge all Members to oppose the Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee who I think has put together a very good energy bill. \nI thank him very much for his instructive comments here. They are very \nhelpful.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when oil was $55 a barrel, President Bush \nsaid oil companies don't need taxpayer subsidies to drill. Oil is now \njust under $70 a barrel, and certainly oil companies truly don't need \ntaxpayer subsidies to drill for oil.\n  The Finance Committee amendment begins to reverse decades of policies \nthat equated what was good for the major oil companies was good for \nAmerica, and that oil companies would get us cheap and plentiful energy \nsupplies here in America. The reality is, if you go to the gas pump \ntoday, you see gas is not cheap. If you look at the impact of a \nrefinery fire or a pipeline problem or a cold snap and the impact on \nheating oil prices, you see energy is not plentiful. If you look at the \ngrowing level of oil imports from countries around the world that don't \nhave our best interests at heart, you will see that what has been good \nfor the major oil companies has not been good for the well-being of the \ncitizens of America.\n  The Kyl amendment is just the latest in a long line of arguments that \nhas been advanced on the theory that we ought to keep subsidizing the \noil industry or energy prices will go up, oil imports will go up, and \nAmerica will be less secure.\n  The fact is our people and our country have now experienced the \nresults of past policies based on the idea that we ought to send \nbillions and billions of dollars of subsidies to the major companies. \nIt is time to end those subsidies. It is time to stop the major oil \ncompanies from fleecing taxpayers when they drill for oil on public \nlands, and it is time to embrace the very different vision of a more \npositive energy future, largely constructed by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the chairman of the Energy Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment and to support \nthe work of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss my opposition to a few of the provisions in the Finance \nCommittee-passed energy tax package. Before I begin, I would like to \ntake a moment to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for \ntheir work on this amendment. I know they have exerted an incredible \namount of energy to get this legislation to the floor so that we can \ndebate it as part of this Energy bill.\n  The package we are debating includes a number of important \nprovisions. It includes additional funding for clean renewable energy \nbonds, which are important to rural electric cooperatives who seek to \nbuild clean generation. It includes accelerated depreciation for carbon \ndioxide pipelines, which will encourage more carbon sequestration. It \nalso includes a carbon capture credit that will make it more economical \nfor some carbon dioxide to be used in enhanced oil recovery and for \nsome carbon dioxide to be sequestered. These are important provisions, \nand I am pleased to see them included in this package.\n  Although that is the case, I have grave concerns about the impact of \nthis tax package. I am specifically concerned about its impact on \nconsumers. When taken as a whole, I believe that the package will lead \nto increased gas prices and will have a detrimental impact on our \ncountry's quest to become energy independent by discouraging domestic \nenergy production.\n  The amendment contains approximately $28.6 billion in ``revenue \nraisers'' over the next 10 years. The phrase ``revenue raisers'' is \nWashington speak for tax increases, and I find it hard to believe that \nwe can increase taxes by $28.6 billion and have no impact on the price \nof gasoline at the pump for the average American. Businesses are in \nbusiness to make money, and when we increase their taxes, they pass \nthat increase along to the consumer.\n  It is not ExxonMobil or Shell or BP that will pay for these tax \nincreases. It is the senior citizen on a fixed income who fills up her \nstation wagon. It is the soccer mom who drives her children to school. \nThis tax title is not punishing the companies. It is punishing the \nAmerican people who rely on energy to fuel their daily lives.\n  Specifically, I am concerned that three provisions of this bill will \nincrease gas prices and will discourage energy production at a time \nwhen our Nation's supply does not meet our Nation's demand. Last week, \nI joined a number of my colleagues in a letter to the Senate Finance \nCommittee that urged the committee not to repeal the section 199 \nmanufacturing deduction, and I am disappointed to note that this was \nincluded. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the repeal of the \nsection 199 deduction will raise $9.43 billion over a 10-year period. \nThat is $9.43 billion that will be passed along to the American people.\n  I am also disappointed that the legislation includes a new 13-percent \nseverance tax for oil produced in the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. The \nOCS represents one of America's greatest energy sources, and raising \ntaxes on those who hope to produce in the OCS will most certainly not \nencourage the domestic energy production that we all believe is so \nimportant.\n  Finally, I am concerned that this legislation changes what is known \nas the foreign tax credit. This change, which amounts to double \ntaxation, will increase taxes by $3.2 billion over the next 10 years. \nSomeone has to pay for that tax increase, and I am concerned that it \nwill be the American people.\n  While I appreciate the work of my colleagues, at the end of the day, \nI am extremely concerned that this legislation will slow domestic \nenergy production and increase the prices paid by consumers. There are \na number of good provisions in this bill that I do support. However, at \nthe end of the day, raising taxes is not the way to increase energy \nproduction and decrease energy prices. I would urge my colleagues to \noppose cloture on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nand the Senator from Arizona has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to take half of my time \nright now and then let the Senator from Montana close, and I will close \nafter that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the arguments \nthat have been made. First, I do appreciate the candor of both the \nSenator from New Mexico and the Senator from Iowa. Rather than arguing \nthat these tax increases are loophole closers, as has been suggested, \nthey candidly acknowledge the reason for the tax increases is to pay \nfor the costs of the bill. As the Senator from Iowa said, we want to \navoid offsets, but we can't. We have to pay for the costs of the bill. \nSo, so much for the argument that these tax increases are loophole \nclosers. They are, very plainly, necessary to pay for the cost of the \nbill, so they are tax increases. I appreciate that.\n  Another bit of candor: The Senator from Montana quoting--or \nparaphrasing, anyway--the former chairman of Exxon Oil Company, \nessentially argued that it is OK to add these taxes on oil companies \nbecause they make too much money, and they make too much profit, so we \nare justified in taxing them.\n  I am not going to argue with that theory. If they make too much \nmoney,\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nwe are going to tax them, if that is the argument for imposing these \nnew taxes. All I say is as long as it doesn't raise the price of \ngasoline for American consumers, then I guess the question would be: \nWho cares? But if they do raise the cost of gasoline for American \nconsumers, then I think we should care. That is all this amendment \ndoes. It says: If it doesn't raise the cost of gasoline, go ahead and \nimpose the tax. If these oil companies are making too much money, go \nahead and tax them. But if the result of it is not just to hurt the oil \ncompanies but to hurt the American consumer, then Congress says: Wait a \nminute; not so fast. We are not going to allow that to happen. That is \nall this amendment does. So we don't say you can't tax. What we say is, \nyou can't tax if it has a negative impact on the American consumer.\n  Now, there was a question about the Heritage study. I noticed there \nwas no attack on the numbers, no refutation of the numbers, just: Well, \nwho paid for the study? I don't know who paid for the study. I presume \nHeritage paid for the study. It is their study. What does it say and \nwhy is it such a burr under the saddle of those who oppose my \namendment? Well, it found that the tax provisions in this bill, setting \naside the other mandates, will likely increase gas prices by 21 cents \nper gallon over the next 8 years, and taking all of the provisions of \nthe bill together, it can increase the price of regular unleaded gas \nfrom $3.14 a gallon to $6.40 a gallon in the year 2016, over the next \n10 years. That is a 104-percent increase.\n  If that is the case, even if it is only half that much, it is a huge \nhit to the American consumer and we shouldn't even be thinking about \nthat kind of a hit on the American consumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nletter from the Chamber of Commerce of the United State of America. It \nis dated June 20, 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2007.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, supports the \n     Kyl amendment, to H.R. 6, the ``Renewable Fuels, Consumer \n     Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007.''\n       This amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to \n     certify that the tax provisions included in H.R. 6 will not \n     lead to increased reliance on foreign oil or higher gasoline \n     prices for American consumers.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes the tax title of this bill \n     because it contains many proposals that amount to little more \n     than a modern-day Windfall Profits Tax. When that tax \n     increase was enacted in 1980, it resulted in higher prices \n     for consumers, long waits at gasoline lines, and increased \n     consumption of foreign oil.\n       The economic reality is that oil and gas are necessities \n     for the nation's economic growth and well being. Even \n     assuming the development of viable alternatives and increased \n     efficiency, the U.S. will continue to rely on these \n     traditional energy sources. It is imperative that the Senate \n     ensure that the American consumer not be saddled with higher \n     prices due to the consequences of the tax changes included in \n     H.R. 6.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. KYL. This is a letter from R. Bruce Josten, who makes the point \nthat the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the tax increases in the bill \nand supports the amendment which I offer, which would condition that \ntax increase on not hurting American consumers.\n  He says:\n\n       This amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to \n     certify that the tax provisions included in H.R. 6 will not \n     lead to increased reliance on foreign oil or higher gasoline \n     prices for American consumers.\n\n  As a result, they support the amendment, and I believe they will key \nit as a key vote.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The Chamber strongly opposes the tax title of this bill \n     because it contains many proposals that amount to little more \n     than a modern-day Windfall Profits Tax. When that tax was \n     enacted in 1980, it resulted in higher prices for consumers, \n     long waits at gasoline lines, and increased consumption of \n     foreign oil.\n\n  That is what we are concerned about here. If the tax increases don't \nhave that effect, then nobody has to worry about it. But if they do \nhave that effect on the American consumers, they would not go into \neffect.\n  My penultimate point is the argument that we have to do something to \nwean ourselves from OPEC, so what do we do? We slap a new 13-percent \ntax on the production of new oil. How does that help wean us from OPEC? \nWhat it does is to say to the producers of oil: You go out and find \nsome, and by the way, if you do, we are going to hit you with a new \ntax. This is a perverse incentive, not a proper incentive.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Cornyn as \na cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \nAmericans For Tax Reform I expect will also key vote the Kyl-Lott \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 4 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes and--how many seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes 10 seconds to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from New Mexico for all of the work they have done.\n  I think the argument we are hearing today is we should have trust in \nthe oil companies and that ExxonMobil and their friends are staying up \nnights and days worrying about high gas prices in the best interests of \nthe American people. If anyone believes that, I think we have some good \nbridges to sell you right now.\n  The truth is the oil companies are ripping off the American people. \nThis moment in American history is a time that our country needs to \nradically change the way it does energy, and the Finance Committee, in \na bipartisan way, and the Energy Committee, in a bipartisan way, are \nmaking some very clear statements.\n  What they are saying is that global warming is a huge problem for \nthis Nation today, and if we do not get a handle on it, that problem \nwill only intensify in years to come.\n  What we must begin to do, and what this legislation is making clear, \nis that we have to break our dependency on fossil fuel, we have to move \nto energy efficiency, we have to move toward sustainable energy, and in \nthat process not only can we substantially lower greenhouse gas \nemissions but we can also create millions of good-paying jobs for the \nAmerican people.\n  As the chairman of the Energy Committee made clear a moment ago, the \noil companies, year after year, are making recordbreaking profits. I \nfor one do not stay up nights worrying about ExxonMobil, when a few \nyears ago they were able to provide a $400 million retirement package \nto their former CEO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for yielding me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will take the remaining 2 minutes. This \nwhole debate boils down to something pretty simple and basic; that is, \ndo we as Americans want to begin to become more self-sufficient in our \nenergy production? Do we want to be less reliant on OPEC? Do we want to \ngive incentives to new clean energy industries to develop in America--\nnot just renewables and alternatives but also clean coal technologies \nand other ways to help America be more self-sufficient?\n  Congress, for many years, has provided some very significant tax \nincentives to the oil and gas industry to help America be strong, to \nmake sure we as Americans have a strong industrial base and a strong \nenergy base to fuel our industries. That was probably the right thing \nto do over the years from 1926, and the various provisions that have \nhelped America. I think the time has come for us to give incentives to \nother industries, alternative energy, renewable fuels, clean coal \ntechnologies, cellulosic, and so forth--the same kinds of incentives \nthat the oil\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nand gas industry have enjoyed for decades and decades.\n  We are not taking away these incentives from the oil and gas industry \nat all. We are just saying the time has come for us to give incentives \nto make America more self-sufficient in the production of energy. This \nbill helps accomplish that result, and the way we do that is very fair \nand balanced. It will not have the horrible results that are claimed \nhere. I urge our colleagues to begin to take--we will still have huge \nbreaks for the oil and gas, but we give help on the margin to new \nindependent energy sources in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in closing the debate on this amendment, I \nwill respond to the point that both the Senator from Vermont and the \nchairman have just made, and that is the need to promote renewable \nenergy and to give incentives to those producers. That is a fine \nsentiment, but my amendment has nothing to do with that. My amendment \ndoesn't affect these incentives one iota. It doesn't speak to them at \nall. So that is a straw man, just as it is a straw man to argue that we \nought to have the right to sock it to the oil companies because they \nare making huge profits. I am not arguing that proposition. In fact, \nyesterday, I offered an amendment to eliminate a real loophole in one \nof those subsidies that one oil company is going to be taking advantage \nof, and both of the Senators whom I mentioned voted to support that \nsubsidy. I voted to eliminate it.\n  I am not trying to protect the oil companies, obviously. I am trying \nto protect the American consumer. My amendment says if the American \nconsumer comes out OK, tax the oil companies. My amendment says if the \nAmerican consumers are going to lose, then we say no, and then there \nare unintended consequences to these sentiments of socking it to the \noil companies, creating subsidies for renewable energy producers and so \non, fine. But if it adversely affects American consumers and increases \nour dependency upon foreign oil, then does anybody argue that we should \ndo this? Wouldn't they instead try to find another way to achieve the \nobjective? I think the answer is yes.\n  My amendment says: Do what you want to do here, but if it adversely \naffects the American consumer or increases our dependence on foreign \noil, that is where we say no, we need to find another way to do this.\n  My amendment doesn't affect the underlying subsidies and doesn't say \nthat you cannot impose additional taxes. These arguments are straw men. \nAll I say is, if the American consumers end up being the losers, as \nthey sometimes have been with our tax policies, if these are the \nunintended consequences and we become more dependent upon foreign oil, \nthen we say no. That is all this amendment does.\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully about this, and I hope they \nwill support my amendment. We are going to vote on it right now, but \nfirst I think the chairman wants to raise a point of order. I yield the \nfloor at this time for him to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter to Senator Bingaman regarding a study by professors \nof law John Leshy and Brian Gray.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                  Hastings College of the Law,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, June 18, 2007.\n     Re proposed severance tax on oil and gas production in the \n         Gulf of Mexico.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and \n         Infrastructure, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: At your request, we have examined \n     your proposal for a severance tax on production from federal \n     oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico with an eye toward \n     potential constitutional takings and breach of contract \n     issues. We also have reviewed the June 14, 2007, memorandum \n     from the Congressional Research Service on this subject.\n       We are thoroughly familiar with the legal issues posed. \n     Professor Leshy teaches them as part of his law school course \n     in Federal Lands and Resources Law. In fact, he includes a \n     section on these takings and contracts issues in the standard \n     law text that he co-authors on the subject: Federal Public \n     Land and Resources Law, 6th Ed., 2007 (which will appear next \n     month). Professor Gray has litigated several cases that \n     involved similar takings and breach of contract questions, \n     including Madera Irrigation District v. Hancock, 985 F.2d \n     1397 (9th Cir. 1993); and Peterson v. Department of the \n     Interior, 899 F.2d 799 (9th Cir. 1990). He also has written \n     several articles on the subject and teaches these materials \n     in his own courses.\n       In our judgment, the argument that this proposal raises a \n     serious takings issue has a steep uphill climb. The Supreme \n     Court has long been reluctant (for good reason) to give much \n     scrutiny to takings arguments in the context of federal tax \n     proposals. See, e.g., Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist., \n     239 U.S. 254, 264-65 (1915) (special tax assessment not a \n     taking ``unless the exaction is a flagrant abuse. and by \n     reason of its arbitrary character is mere confiscation of \n     particular property''); Cole v. LaGrange, 113 U.S. 1, 8 1885) \n     (``the taking of property by taxation requires no other \n     compensation than the taxpayer receives in being protected by \n     the government to the support of which he contributes''); \n     County of Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U.S. 691, 703 (1880) \n     (``neither is taxation for a public purpose, however great, \n     the taking of private property for public use, in the sense \n     of the Constitution'').\n       Even if a court were to apply the basic Penn Central \n     takings analysis to the proposed severance tax, we believe \n     the proposal would easily satisfy that test. The tax is for \n     an important public purpose: funding of clean energy tax \n     initiatives, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, \n     and other clean energy programs. The proposed 13 percent \n     royalty is modest and would leave the lessees significant net \n     revenue from the production of oil and natural gas. And the \n     tax, of course, would not physically encroach on the \n     companies' property. See Penn Central Transportation Co. v. \n     New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 123-28 (1978); cj. Lingle v. \n     Chevron U.S.A., 544 U.S. 528, 538-40 (2005) (confirming the \n     Penn Central standards as the general takings test).\n       The contract question is slightly more complicated, because \n     the severance tax proposal contains a provision that allows \n     lessees to credit against the severance tax the royalties \n     they pay on oil and gas production from their federal leases. \n     While companies with leases that require them to pay less \n     royalty to the United States than other lessees might argue \n     that the credit provision effectively rewrites their leases, \n     we believe this argument also would not withstand careful \n     legal scrutiny.\n       The proposed legislation does not target these leases. \n     Rather, it is aimed at a generic category of activity--Gulf \n     of Mexico OCS production--to serve a general and important \n     public policy--viz. raising revenue for green energy tax \n     initiatives. In our judgment; the severance tax therefore \n     falls within the standard government contract principle, \n     recognized for more than a century by the United States \n     Supreme Court, that protects ``public and general'' acts by \n     Congress from breach of contract claims.\n       In Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982), \n     for example. the Court upheld the application of a severance \n     tax on oil and natural gas production to long-term leases. \n     The lessees claimed that the tax effectively increased the \n     royalties on oil and gas production set forth in their \n     contracts with the Tribe. The Supreme Court rejected this \n     claim inter alia on the ground that ``Contractual \n     arrangements remain subject to subsequent legislation by the \n     presiding sovereign. Even where the contract at issue \n     requires payment of a royalty for a license or franchise \n     issued by the governmental entity, the government's power to \n     tax remains unless it `has been specifically surrendered in \n     terms which admit of no other reasonable interpretation.' ''\n       Id. at 147-48 (citations omitted); see also Bowen v. Public \n     Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41 \n     (1986). In United States v. Winstar, 518 U.S. 839 (1996), the \n     Court modified this principle of contract interpretation in \n     suits for damages--allowing certain government contractors to \n     sue for breach of contract on the ground that a new law \n     altered the terms of performance of their existing contracts \n     with the United States. The Court maintained the sovereign \n     acts/unmistakable waiver doctrine in cases involving new \n     taxes however, because the consequence of refunding tax \n     payments in the form of damages would be to nullify the tax. \n     In the Court's words: ``The application of the doctrine will \n     therefore differ according to the different kinds of \n     obligations the Government may assume and the consequences of \n     enforcing them. At one end of the wide spectrum are claims \n     for enforcement of contractual obligations that could not be \n     recognized without effectively limiting sovereign authority, \n     such as a claim for rebate under an agreement for a tax \n     exemption. Granting a rebate, like enjoining enforcement, \n     would simply block the exercise of the taxing power, and the \n     unmistakability doctrine would have to be satisfied.''\n       Id. at 994 (citation omitted).\n       There is nothing in the existing OCS leases that purport to \n     waive or to limit Congress' sovereign taxing authority. \n     Accordingly, we conclude that existing lessees that are not \n     presently paying royalties for deep water oil and natural gas \n     production would be unlikely successfully to challenge the \n     proposed severance tax on grounds of breach of contract.\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n       Please let us know if we may be of any additional \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     John D.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                  tribute to senator frank lautenberg\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, a record was broken. \nSenator Frank Lautenberg has passed Senator Clifford Case's record for \nthe most votes cast by a Senator from the State of New Jersey.\n  Senator Lautenberg's career can't possibly be summed up, though, on \nnumbers alone. I have had the good fortune of serving with this man in \nthe Senate since I came here. Sometimes the term ``American Dream'' is \nthrown around, and probably a bit too much, but if there were ever a \nMember of this body who exemplifies the American Dream, it is Frank \nLautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Frank Lautenberg was born without privilege to immigrant parents. He \nserved his country bravely in World War II and put himself through \nColumbia University on the GI bill. He is an example of what the GI \nBill of Rights did for America.\n  Frank Lautenberg achieved great personal success in the business \nworld, but he wanted to do more than be a successful businessman. And \nhe was a successful businessman, both in reputation and in the ability \nto make money in our great free enterprise system. He was an exemplar \nof that.\n  He decided he would seek public service, and, very unusually, he shot \nfor the top. He ran for the Senate--and ran and ran and ran--and was \nelected in 1982. Senator Lautenberg's legislative record is fantastic. \nIt is terrific. He has been a titan here.\n  Guns and crime: Author of the Domestic Violence Ban, and sponsored \ncountless laws to make neighborhoods safer.\n  Health and safety: He led the fight regarding drunk driving by \ntoughening Federal laws and penalties relating thereto in the States.\n  The environment: I had the good fortune of serving with him on the \nEnvironment Committee from the first day I arrived in the Senate, and I \ndo say to Frank, and he knows this, that as a result of his having a \nvery short retirement, voluntarily, I was fortunate enough to be able \nto become the chairman of that committee twice. Had he been here, he \nwould have been the chairman on those two occasions.\n  But no one, and I say it without any reservation, has a better \nenvironmental record in the history of our country than Frank \nLautenberg. He sponsored countless laws to reduce pollution; clean up \nSuperfund sites. One of the real battles of the Senate in recent years \nwas the battle he and the ranking member had--and the chairman, they \nwent back and forth--as to what would happen regarding the Superfund in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. He has followed that like \nno one else has ever followed it.\n  He has promoted recycling by legislation. He has done legislation to \nprotect our drinking water. Very importantly, he has ensured the \npublic's right to know about environmental hazards in our communities.\n  For me, personally, the legislative accolade that I wish to give him \nrelates to what he did regarding smoking cigarettes. I have five \nchildren, and traveling back and forth to Nevada as we have done, one \nof my boys was terribly affected by cigarette smoke. They tried \nsomething where you could only smoke in certain parts of the airplane, \nbut that didn't work. If you are allergic to cigarette smoke, that \ndidn't work. And my boy, Key, suffered as a result of people smoking in \nthose airplanes.\n  When Frank Lautenberg took on this battle, people actually made fun \nof him--why would he take on the tobacco industry; and if he did, did \nhe mind losing? Well, he lost a few battles, but he won the war, and my \nboy is extremely happy he did win that war. Today they do not even have \nashtrays on commercial airlines anymore.\n  The list is longer than I can possibly enumerate of his legislative \naccomplishments, but one of the things that is not a legislative \naccomplishment that I so admire about Frank Lautenberg is his sense of \nhumor. There is a story he tells, and he tells a number of stories, and \nI would go around and ask him, would you tell your story again, and he \nwould tell it just as good as the last time. The one reason I so admire \nhis humor is he reminds me of Red Skelton, because even though he has \nretold those jokes many times, in my presence, he laughed harder each \ntime at his own jokes.\n  Suffice to say, when the day has come, and it will come, when \nhistorians write about Senator Frank Lautenberg, he will be hailed as a \ngreat legislator for the State of New Jersey, a legend in the Senate, \nand a foremost legislator of great repute standing up for the health, \nsafety, and welfare of every single American, not just those from New \nJersey.\n  His record-breaking vote is reason enough to honor him, but his \ntremendous record is an accomplishment that will endure for many \ngenerations to come. Congratulations, Frank.\n  (Applause.)\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could have the attention of Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n\n\n          Honoring Senator Robert C. Byrd on His 18,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the man seated behind me, Robert Byrd, just \nvoted for the 18,000th time, more than any other Senator in history.\n  Let me tell a couple of things that are important to me about my \nrelationship with this unusually brilliant man.\n  I had returned from Nevada to Washington. I was a new Senator. I \nasked Senator Byrd what he had done that weekend--he was standing back \nhere. He said: I have been studying the Roman Empire. I am reading, for \nthe third time, Gibbon's ``The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.''\n  He said: What did you do? I was a little chagrined. I said: Well, I \ngrabbed a little pocketbook out of my library at home. It was ``The \nAdventures of Robinson Crusoe.''\n  He looked--we all know Senator Byrd when he is thinking about \nsomething. He rolled his head back, and he looked up and he said:\n\n       Robinson Crusoe, let's see. How long was he on that island? \n     Twenty-eight years, two months, two weeks, and five days.\n\n  I looked at him like: What are you talking about? I just read the \nbook. I didn't know how long he had been there. So I went home that \nnight and looked. Senator Byrd was right. Robinson Crusoe had been on \nthat island 28 years, 2 months, 2 weeks, and 5 days. I bet he hadn't \nread the book in 45 or 50 years, but he remembered that.\n  All of us will remember how he disliked the line-item veto. He came \nto the Senate floor once a week for 10 weeks and gave a lecture on the \nevils of the line-item veto. But he did it in a unique way because it \nwas all about the fall of the Roman Empire. His thesis was that the \nRoman Empire fell because the executive took power away from the \nlegislative branch of government. He gave 10 lectures, every lecture \nlasting exactly 1 hour.\n  There is not a professor who teaches Roman history who could give the \ndetailed lecture on the Roman Empire that Senator Byrd did, but he gave \nit. It was so good. At the University of Las Vegas they had a political \nscience department, and they took those lectures and turned them into a \ncourse, a graduate course.\n  What was quite remarkable is he did it without a note. He just walked \nout here and gave his lecture. As we know, he referred to the Emperors \nand how long they were there and the battles that took place and the \ntimes they took place.\n  I said: Senator Byrd, tell me how you do that without a note.\n  He looked at me and said, ``I memorized what I was going to say.'' So \nhe gave 10 hours of lectures, and every word of it he memorized.\n  I could tell stories about this man for a long time. Let me just tell \none more. I was a fairly new Senator. Some of the Senators may be \nlistening to this who went on this little trip we took to West \nVirginia. He invited the British parliamentarians to meet with us, a \nfew Senators, in the hills of West Virginia. It was beautiful. They had \nbluegrass music there. It was a festive occasion for a relatively small \nnumber of British parliamentarians and Senators. He even sang.\n  I can still remember him singing: ``There's More Pretty Girls Than \nOne.'' Senator Byrd sang that. But the music stopped, and he said: OK, \nif anybody hears anything that I have said that is wrong, I have given \na little notebook and pencil. You write it down and we'll talk about it \nlater.\n  He proceeded to tell us and the British parliamentarians about the \nreign of the British monarchs, starting from the beginning. Remember, \nhe has no notes, he is just standing there, starting from the \nbeginning. If it was necessary, he would spell the name of the monarch. \nEvery one of them he gave the years they reigned. If it was something \ninteresting that happened during their reign, he would tell us about \nit. It took him about 1 hour and 20 minutes to do this.\n  The British parliamentarians were dumbfounded. Here is this American \nSenator telling them far more than they knew about their own country.\n  This man has been such an inspiration to all of us, with his mind, \nthis incredible mind. I just finished reading Walter Isakson's \n``Einstein''--a wonderful book, 528 pages, that talks about this \nbrilliant genius. I did not know and I did not have the opportunity to \nmeet Albert Einstein, but I had the opportunity to meet this genius. He \nhas an unparalleled knowledge of the Rules of the Senate. He has a \nreverence for this institution that is unsurpassed. One of the things \nthat I think is so important is that he believes in the Constitution. I \nhave here with me--the other one is worn out, but I have here, with a \nvery nice inscription that I prize--I have it with me virtually every \nday--signed by the Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd.\n  These gifts he has been given by the Almighty bring to my mind words \nfrom Ralph Waldo Emerson in his ``Essays on Self-Reliance,'' which was \n10,000 words long. Now, Senator Byrd, if he were familiar with this, \nwould recite it. I cannot. I can't give you 10,000 words, but I am \ngoing to give you the last paragraph of this brilliant essay by Ralph \nWaldo Emerson, which I think talks about who this man is.\n\n       Use all that is called Fortune.\n       Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as \n     her wheel rolls.\n       But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with \n     Cause and Effect,\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n     the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and \n     thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit \n     hereafter out of fear from her rotations.\n       A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your \n     sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other \n     favorable event raises your spirits, and you think good days \n     are preparing for you.\n       Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but \n     yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of \n     principles.\n\n  So said Ralph Waldo Emerson. I congratulate the Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert Byrd, for accomplishing all he has done as a Member of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of all the many milestones along the \nway of the extraordinary career of Senator Robert Byrd--and, by the \nway, we have celebrated a few of those on the floor of the Senate since \nI have been here, as he achieves more and more distinction by setting \nmore and more records about Senate service, I am always reminded that \nSenator Byrd said his greatest accomplishment was his extraordinary \nmarriage to Erma for a longer period of time than many Americans live. \nI would suspect that if Senator Byrd were to list his most important \nachievement, it would be his incredible, successful marriage to his \nbeloved Erma.\n  Mr. President, let me add, on behalf of those on this side of the \naisle, our congratulations to the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 61, the nays are \n32. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are all partisans here, but I really do \nbelieve this vote we just took is going to change the complexion of the \nSenate. The American people are upset at us--Democrats and \nRepublicans--because we are not getting things done. We have to get \nover that.\n  I so appreciate Democrats and Republicans doing what is good for the \ncountry on this vote. There are still things with this bill I do not \nparticularly like. There are things my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle do not like. But we have to start legislating. I really do \nsay--and I repeat--I think this could be the beginning of our being \nable to legislate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw that suggestion so the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, be allowed to follow the statement by \nSenator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                         18,000th Rollcall Vote\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, each Senator--every Senator--has a \nresponsibility to vote. The people of West Virginia expect me to do the \njob they sent me here to do, and I am doing it. This 18,000th rollcall \nvote is a testament to their faith in me and to my work for them.\n  I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for its \nrules. I love the Senate for its precedents. I love the Senate for the \ndifference it can make in people's lives.\n  The Senate was viewed by the Framers as a place where mature wisdom \nwould reside. The Senate was intended to serve as a check on both the \nHouse of Representatives and the Executive. The longer terms, the older \nage requirements, the special functions delegated to the Senate \nregarding treaties, appointments, impeachment--all of these are \nindicative of the intent by the Framers to have the Senate be the \nstabilizer, the fence, the check on attempts at tyranny, and the calmer \npolitical passions. Partisanship was not viewed as necessary or \nconstructive in that day in time so long ago, nor, may I say, is total \ndevotion to partisanship constructive in this day in time or in any day \nin time.\n  I have served in this Chamber for nearly five decades--nearly 50 \nyears. Times have changed. The world has changed. But our \nresponsibilities, our duties, as Senators have not changed. We have a \nresponsibility, a duty, to the people to make our country a better \nplace. The people send us here to do a job. They do not send us here to \nscore political points or to advance our personal agenda.\n  If I could have one wish as I cast this 18,000th vote, it could be \nthat the Senate could put aside the political games, roll up our \nsleeves, and get back to\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nwork for the great people of this great country of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, the Senate is trying to come up \nwith an energy bill. I know Senators have been working very hard on all \nsides of the aisle to come up with consensus legislation we can \nsupport, and I really do support them. I wish to particularly call to \nthe attention of the Senate the efforts of Senators Pryor and Levin and \nStabenow to try to come up with a compromise on the CAFE. But we are \nnow where we are. We are at a very important juncture in our history.\n  You know me. I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul lies with \nthe blue-collar American. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar \nneighborhood. When Bethlehem Steel went on strike, my dad gave those \nworkers credit. When UAW was having a hard time, my father and mother \ntried to smooth the way by helping them in the grocery store. My career \nand my public service is one of deep commitment to the working people. \nSo when automobile manufacturers told me they could not meet the \nincreased CAFE standards, I listened. I listened year after year, and \nnow I have listened for more than 20 years. When they told me they \nneeded more time, I agreed. When they told me an increase in CAFE \nstandards was unattainable with existing technology, I voted against \nthe increase to give more time so we could come up with attainable and \nexisting technology.\n  But 20 years have gone by since the last increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards. I was here when we voted for those CAFE standards. Now, \nafter 20 years, I firmly do believe it is time for a change--not any \nkind of change--a smart change, a feasible change, an affordable \nchange. That is why I support the Energy bill that is before us. I \nsupport the framework that has been generally presented by Senator \nFeinstein of California. I know that American automobile manufacturers \nand their workers are true patriots. They want what is best for our \nNation. They have faced challenges before and they have met them and I \nbelieve they will face these challenges now. I believe they want to \nbuild vehicles that are safer and more energy efficient.\n\n  The time has now come to increase fuel efficiency standards. We need \na national effort. We need a national standard. It is time for our \nautomobile industry to make the changes because they need to be able to \ndo that to help their own industry survive and also for the interest of \nthe Nation.\n  I believe our world and our Nation is facing a crisis. When you look \nat the increased gas prices at the pump, it is hurting every single one \nof us. When you talk to families, you learn it now costs $90 to fill up \na minivan. A commuter who has no other way to get to work than an \nautomobile is now paying more to get to work than they are for their \nfood bill in certain areas. As the Presiding Officer knows, small \nbusinesses need those vans to make those deliveries, whether they own a \nflower shop, whether they are a heating and air-conditioning guy, \nwhether they are a plumber or whether they are the person delivering \npharmaceuticals to nursing homes. In my own State right now, the \nwatermen, those fishermen are out on the Chesapeake Bay trying to \nharvest ever-diminishing crabs with ever-increasing fuel prices.\n  It is time to conserve our energy resources and to deal with the \ncrisis we are facing. We know that energy and gasoline and petroleum \nproducts are in limited supply and are going up. We know that America's \ndependence on foreign oil presents a very serious national security \nchallenge.\n  I am on the Intelligence Committee, and I know what these \ntransnational threats are. I know that energy independence is \nabsolutely crucial to fighting the global war against terrorism. If we \nfollow the money, we know that every time we are putting money into the \ntank, we are putting money into the pockets of the petro jihadists, \nthose petro jihadists who are trying to undermine us everywhere around \nthe world. They are undermining and attacking our troops in Iraq. They \nare funding Hezbollah so they can attack Israel; Hugo Chavez, shake, \nrattling, and rolling in Latin America. Do we want our money going to \nthe petro jihadists who want to plot and destroy not only American \nlives but the American way of life? I don't want to support al-Qaida by \nbuying more gasoline than I have to, but this is what Iran, Venezuela, \nand others are doing.\n  We need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and that is one of \nthe most important ways we can as the public is by fighting the war \nagainst terrorism. There are 150,000 men and women fighting in Iraq \ntoday. The temperature is 110 degrees. We already have lost 14 more \nmilitary. While we are doing that, though, there are 300 million of us \nwho don't have to share in the sacrifice of the battle in Iraq, but we \ncan share in that sacrifice if we embrace energy conservation and are \nserious about it. At the same time, we know there is a dangerous \nincrease in the climate crisis that affects the life of our planet. It, \ntoo, is a national security issue because, make no mistake, the climate \ncrisis will affect our food supply and will create a climate in which \ninfectious disease will grow and natural disasters will increase.\n  What can we do about it? How can we sign up to have a safer America, \na safer planet? Well, I believe the most sensible foundation of an \nenergy plan must begin with conservation. We have to make better use of \nwhat we have in our homes, in our businesses, in our cars, and in our \nairplanes. We also need incentives for new renewable energy and energy-\nefficient technologies that we can use in our homes and in our \nbusinesses and an increase in fuel efficiency standards for our \nvehicles on the road and our vehicles in the air.\n  Now, in considering any fuel efficiency standard, otherwise known as \nCAFE, I come back to where I began: My heart and soul lies with the \nAmerican worker, so I believe anything we do must preserve American \njobs, but it also must achieve real savings in oil consumption. It also \nhas to be realizable and achievable. That means a real technological \nability to accomplish it. That means a reasonable lead time to adjust \nour production.\n  I also believe we have to create incentives to enable companies to \nachieve those goals. I don't believe in an industrial policy where we \npick winners and losers, but if we are going to pick a winning energy \npolicy, we have to provide some type of help to the industry to help \nthem get where we need for them to go.\n  In the 1950s, when part of the world saw the Iron Curtain come down \nand they went into communism, many against their own will, such as \nPoland, Latvia, and Estonia, there was a whole other world that chose \nto go with what they called a Socialist tendency. We saw industrial \ndemocracies such as England, France, and Canada develop a national \nhealth system. We said: Oh, no, we are Americans. We don't want to go \nthat way. We don't want to have a national health system. So we said to \nthe private sector: Provide health care, provide pensions, and we will \nsupport that. So our American manufacturing base went to a defined \nbenefit. They did provide health care. They did provide pensions. Now, \nthey should not be penalized for it. Yet you look at the fact that our \nAmerican manufacturers and our automobile industry itself does carry \nthe legacy cost of health care; we asked them to do it and they did do \nit. General Motors provides more health care than the VA system. They \nprovide more health care than some countries around the world. They \nhave legacy costs to retirees. So if we are going to make the move in \nCAFE, we have to acknowledge that issue and how that impacts their \ncompetitiveness.\n  Let's put our thinking caps on. Let's not only help one industry. \nMaybe this is the time to motivate us to get serious about having \nuniversal health care and a real prescription drug benefit so we don't \ndump it on the private sector to do.\n  I also know, when we look at this in terms of preserving jobs, we \nneed to also make sure that the technology is achievable, and I believe \nit is. I believe also there are certain waivers in this bill that help \nthem achieve--that deal with the fact that if they cannot increase some \nof these standards, the mandates can be waived. But you don't get an \nenergy policy by mandates alone. We can't mandate and regulate our way \nout of this.\n  I am going to vote to raise fuel efficiency standards, only because I \nam so convinced it is in our national security\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\ninterests. But I do not want to ignore the economic impact that this is \ngoing to have on the automobile industry. We can't just mandate and we \ncan't just regulate. So I say to my colleagues, if we are going to go \nenergy, then let's go to health care. If we are going to go energy, \nthen let's fix the prescription drug benefit and don't talk about \nvetoes and filibusters. Let's now work in our national interests. Let's \nnow work for our manufacturing base.\n\n  Out-of-control health care costs mean that companies are less able to \nbe innovative and invest in technology. Our current President likes to \ntalk a lot about relieving the tax burden, but to our business \ncommunity, the cost of health care is a tax because we have not gotten \nserious about how to provide affordable health care, both to the people \nwho want to buy it and businesses who want to provide it. So let's get \nrid of that health care tax on American business and come up with \nuniversal health care. Last year we made some progress in helping \nmanufacturers meet their pension obligations, and we can do it in \nhealth care.\n  The time has come to raise the CAFE standards, but the time has come \nalso to put our thinking caps on, to be an innovation society, and to \ncome up with new ideas for efficiency, new technologies for energy \nefficiency, new composite materials to make cars lighter but keep them \nsafe, and at the same time to seriously come to grips with health care.\n  This is not an easy vote for me. I am telling you, this is not an \neasy vote for me. I have always, for 20 years, stood with colleagues \nsuch as Senators Levin and Stabenow. I stand with them now. But I also \nknow that if the American automobile industry is going to survive and \nthat if we are going to deal with the petro jihadists, we need to get \nserious about fuel efficiency. Let's get serious about the legislation. \nLet's get serious about health care. Let's be serious about the \nAmerican workers, and let's get the job done the people want us to do.\n  So today, I know we voted for cloture on the bill, but we have to \ncontinue to speak up on what we need to do to make us a safer country, \nbut to keep a stronger economy, and for God's sake, could we start to \nbe smarter about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business, the time to be charged to the time allotted for \ncloture. I will probably take up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the first thing I want to do is take a \nminute to publicly thank the majority leader for the kindness he \nextended to me earlier when he announced the fact that I have cast the \nsecond-highest number of votes of any Senator from the State of New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, I am as surprised as anybody in this Chamber that this \nevent took place and that kind of longevity has been extended to me by \nthe people of New Jersey. I now enter the middle of my 23rd year in the \nSenate and I want to continue to serve. But that is a discussion for \nanother time.\n  The majority leader was very generous in his comments about me. \nComing from a person who has provided so much by way of leadership and \ncontribution to the country as Harry Reid, it is a touching experience. \nWe are busy, but Senator Reid took time out of the business of the day \nto note the fact that I had achieved that record.\n  The biggest surprise of all is, for me, the fact that I have been in \nthis Chamber as long as I have been. I spent 30 years building a \ncompany with a couple of colleagues.\n  That is the legend of America--what can happen even if you are born \npoor but you have some assistance. I wore the uniform of this country \nproudly during World War II. I was a beneficiary of the GI Bill of \nRights. That is how they defined the educational opportunity that was \ngiven.\n  Mr. President, my surprise--my awe, if I may--was that I was able to \ngo to Columbia University, a distinguished educational facility, which \nwas something I never dreamed possible because of the humble roots that \nmy family had. They gave me values--nothing of value but values. My \nparents' admonition throughout my life was to always be honest, always \ntell the truth, always work hard, and remember one thing, son: There \nare people as poor as we are. As difficult as it is at times, there are \nalways people less fortunate.\n  My grandmother had a little bank in the house, which we shared with \nher many times, in which we would put small coins, to be used for--I \ncannot say charity but for others who were less fortunate.\n  So I stand in this Chamber at this moment, and I want to talk about \nsomething related to roots--to my roots. My father and my mother \nstruggled to make a living. My father worked in the silk mills of \nPaterson, NJ, a textile city. Others like my dad and mother were \nbrought to this country by their parents, hoping for an opportunity to \nmake a living and to have some degree of opportunity.\n  My father worked in the silk mill with a dear friend of his who was \nlater very active in union organization. My father made a plea to his \nforeman for a holiday off. It was an important religious holiday. He \nwasn't looking for any pay, Heaven forbid. He just wanted to have the \ntime off for observance of the holiday. He and his very close friend \nasked the foreman if it would be all right if they took the day off for \nthe observance of the holiday, which was the week following. The reply \nwas very quick: Oh, sure, you can take the day off, but don't come back \nto work here anymore. With that, you can imagine the view of my father \nand his friend not being able to continue a job that was scarce and \ndifficult to get. So they waited, hat in hand.\n  In those days, people would wear hats to work in common labor at a \nmill. They described that, hat in hand, the two of them nervously \nwaited for the owner of the company to come by. They would not let them \ngo into the owner's office. Heaven forbid, that is no place for people \nlike you. But the owner was a kind, generous man. When he walked out, \nthey stopped him and explained that they desperately wanted to take the \nholiday off, but they needed their jobs. The owner was a kind, \nsympathetic person, and he said: Take the time off, and you are going \nto be paid for that holiday.\n  That was the beginning days of union representation in this country--\nvery active, very confrontational, very difficult, and sometimes \nviolent. But my father saw and his friend saw that they had to have a \nbetter way to do things than stand hat in hand and beg for a day off. \nFortunately, they found a kind man who listened and gave them the day \noff. But the experience was searing, and they never forgot that working \npeople had to have representation.\n\n  Both of them then became active in union organization. Those were \ndifficult days. We have all heard stories about employees who wanted \nsome representation, wanted a voice in how they were paid, wanted a \nvoice in what conditions were like.\n  My father worked in a mill. My father was a health faddist even in \nthose days. He took very good care of himself. He was a man with \nmuscles. He would go to the gym, and he would lift weights. He belonged \nto the local Y. He never smoked, was light on coffee, and no liquor. He \ndied when he was 43 years old. He contracted cancer when he was 42. The \ncause was almost undeterminable, but they realized that there were \nmaterials they used when they worked with the silk to keep the silk \nbrittle and to keep the machinery working that ultimately caused my \nfather's cancer. His brother died at age 56 also from cancer. Their \nfather died at age 52 also from cancer induced by the environment at \nthe factory in which they worked.\n  The fact is that people who work in places like this should have a \nvoice--and we see disparities, such as taking 10 years to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  It is time to give unions, to give working people a chance to have a \nvoice in their work or their opportunity to take care of their \nfamilies, or the opportunity, as my father said, to\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\nhold your head high, be proud, be proud you are a worker, be proud you \nare contributing something to your country.\n  What we see now is distressing, which is why we are discussing \nfreedom of choice for workers, to give them a chance have their voice \nheard without having to go through a hassle about whether they are \norganized. I have seen what happens. I ran a very big company. When I \nleft the company, it had 16,000 employees. Today it has 40,000 \nemployees, a company I started with 2 other poor kids from the \nneighborhood. We were always very conscious of our responsibility to \nour employees. That is why the company was so successful. It had the \nlongest growth of any company in American history of 10 percent or more \non the bottom line.\n  We had a case in New Jersey where a bus driver was fired for being a \nunion supporter and giving testimony to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Even as we gather here, we see that employers are still using \nall kinds of tactics to harass, threaten, or fire workers who try to \nexercise their right to form a union. Ninety-two percent of employers \nmake their employees sit through one-sided, anti-union presentations, \naccording to a study by Cornell University.\n  The Cornell study also said that 78 percent of employers have \nsupervisors hold repeated closed-door, one-on-one meetings with workers \nto intimidate them to oppose the union.\n  I don't think those kinds of tactics are appropriate. Decent jobs are \never more scarce in this country as we ship so many jobs abroad, as \ntechnology--and I come from the computer business; I know something \nabout technology--as technology takes jobs away from people whose only \nskills are manual skills, and they need a way to make a living. You \ndon't have to be a new immigrant to need a job where you use your \nhands, use your body, or use your strength to make a living. But these \njobs are going further and further afield because of the technology.\n  We should not allow employers to prevent workers from having a \ngreater voice in their workplace on issues of pay and benefits and \nworking conditions.\n  We can improve this situation by passing the Employee Free Choice Act \nto protect workers and to protect their rights--again I use the \nexpression--hold their heads high, know they can provide for their \nfamilies, know they don't have to apologize to their kids for having to \nwork as hard as so many do, two jobs in many cases.\n  The bill that is in front of us will let employees select a union if \na majority signs cards saying they want representation. They don't want \nto take over the ownership of the company. They don't want to deprive \nsenior executives from making their salaries or their benefits. When we \nsee what is happening in America today, there is a frightening specter \nout there, and I talk as someone who came from the corporate boardroom. \nI can be accused of being a tree hugger because I care about the \nenvironment. I can be accused of other things. But I can't be accused \nof not understanding what it is like to run a business, a successful \nbusiness.\n  If people want representation, when we see that there are people in \nthis country making $1.8 billion for a single year's work, and many \nothers earning $240 million or more. The salaries are adequate enough, \nas they said in an article in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago, \nthat if you took the combined wages of people who made $240 million or \nmore in the year, you could pay 80,000 school teachers in the city of \nNew York for 3 years.\n  There are disparities, and what has to happen is that people who work \nfor a living have to understand their work, their effort, their \ncontribution to the country. We have Tom Brokaw here for lunch right \nnow. He wrote a book, ``The Greatest Generation.'' What was it? It was \nworking people who made the contribution. It was working people who on \nD-Day--I didn't arrive in Europe on D-Day; I arrived a little bit \nlater--those who were there, those who were the heroes, those who saved \ntheir companions, working people. They are entitled to be heard.\n  Workers cannot be hassled or harassed to be kept from expressing \ntheir interests in a union. This bill says employees can select a union \nas soon as a majority signs a card saying they want representation. \nCurrent law allows for this majority signup, but only at the employer's \ndiscretion. The employer can instead demand an election and use that \ntime before that election to scare workers away from joining a union.\n\n  The Employee Free Choice Act will protect and enhance the right of \nworkers to join a union, and there is good reason for some to choose a \nunion. As President Bush helps the wealthy get wealthier, helps the \ncorporations develop ever more earnings, I see nothing wrong with that \nas long as there is a fairness, an equity. When a company such as \nExxonMobil earns almost $40 billion in a year, and Americans pull up to \nthe pump and very often they are giving away a significant part of \ntheir purchasing power at that gasoline pump, we have to be sure we \ndon't totally demoralize the working people of this country.\n  Union wages can help low- and middle-wage workers earn their way to \nnew opportunities and financial stability. Everybody knows it costs \nmore to live these days. It costs more to send a kid to college. It \ncosts more to get health care. It costs more for gasoline. It costs \nmore for mortgages. It costs more for everything.\n  We have to make sure that the people who work for a living, who do \nthe building, who do the lifting, are able to make a living.\n  When it comes to wages, union wages are almost 30 percent higher than \nnonunion wages, and union workers are almost twice as likely to have \nemployer-sponsored health benefits.\n  In 2005, 1.3 million New Jersey residents were uninsured for health. \nThat is 300,000 more residents than 5 years ago. Union membership can \nmake a huge difference to them and their families. Hard-working \nAmericans deserve these benefits. We need the Employee Free Choice Act \nso workers can express themselves without intimidation. They have to be \ncertified if they make that kind of choice. But we also want employers \nto be accountable when they violate the law. This bill will strengthen \npenalties for employer violations of the National Labor Relations Act \nso that employers are deterred from breaking the law.\n  Workers deserve an atmosphere where they can choose a union without \nintimidation or coercion. They need a strong law to allow them to make \ntheir own choice without interference from management. The Employee \nFree Choice Act is that law. It will give employees a stronger voice in \nshaping the workplace and will help employees earn more money, \nbenefits, and improve their futures.\n  I am proud to support this bill for New Jersey's and America's \ncurrent union members and for those who want to unionize.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Permit people to make their \nchoice and make it freely and not have to be worried about intimidation \nor harassment. If you want to join a union, simple: Fill out a card. \nWhy should they be deprived from doing so for their future?

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Heroes of Charleston\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, my colleagues have been very kind to me \nin passing on their condolences from the people of their States \nregarding Charleston. I publicly acknowledge all the kindness they have \nshown to me and Senator DeMint regarding the loss of the firefighters \nin South Carolina. It was a huge blow to the community of Charleston. \nNine very brave souls lost their lives trying to protect their fellow \ncitizens. Senator Kennedy spoke very eloquently of the life of a \nfirefighter. Senator Dodd and so many people have offered their \ncondolences.\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n  There will be a memorial service tomorrow in Charleston. I will be \ngoing with other members of the delegation, and we will have a \nresolution before the Senate tomorrow honoring these heroes.\n  I learned, talking with Senators Kennedy and Kerry, that there were \nsix or seven firefighters lost in Worcester, MA, not that long ago. I \nhave been told the Charleston fire was the largest loss of life among \nfirefighters since 9/11.\n  Those who have been to Charleston, SC, know what a wonderful, \nbeautiful community it is. It is one of the most open, welcoming \ncommunities in the country. To the families, we grieve with you. We can \nonly imagine the pain you are going through. I hope you do realize you \nhave so many people in your corner saying prayers for your well-being \nand deeply appreciative of the sacrifice your loved ones made.\n  It is human nature for most people to run away from fires. Only \nfiremen run into them. Thank God people are willing to do that, go off \nand serve in the military, be policemen, EMTs, many of the other jobs \nthat require self-preservation to take a backseat to the common good. \nSelf-preservation is a strong instinct. I know parents would do \nanything for their children, and that is a very understandable emotion, \ntaking care of your loved ones and your family. That probably trumps \nself-preservation--most of the time, anyway. Doing it for somebody you \ndon't know makes you a hero. When you are willing to give your life, \nrisk your life for someone you don't know, that is where the term \n``hero'' applies.\n  To the families who have lost loved ones, I do hope you have some \ncomfort knowing that what your loved one was doing was so important. In \nthis case, there was a belief that a civilian was left in the warehouse \nunaccounted for, so the firemen went back in to look for this person. \nUnfortunately, the worst happened. The building collapsed on them, and \nthere was a tremendous tragedy.\n  There are so many ways to thank firemen, and I am very inadequate in \nthat regard.\n  Similar to most young kids, I thought being a fireman was about the \ntop of the pyramid. It seemed like the neatest job in the world. But as \nyou get older, you realize how dangerous it is. It is one of those \noccupations, such as being a policeman or other occupations--but \nparticularly firemen--that every day is a real risk you take.\n  To the people of Charleston, SC: I know you are banded together. I \nknow you are mourning together. You have the wishes of this body. All \nthe Senators--Republicans and Democrats--very much have you in their \nprayers.\n  To the families: Tomorrow will be a difficult day. It will be a very \ntouching day. It will be a day of remembrance and mourning. It will \nalso be a day of celebration, celebrating the lives of those brave \nfirefighters who represent the best of my State and the best of \nhumanity.\n  I would like to end this statement with the understanding that there \nis nothing we can do to replace your loss. But we can and we will be \nthere by your side as you move forward.\n  God bless.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendments are either nongermane or are drafted improperly and are out \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the majority leader may \nmake a combined point of order against the pending amendments.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendments fall.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the pending business the Reid \nsubstitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1792, as Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 1792 be called up and modified by amendment No. 1843.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1792, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 239, beginning with line 16, strike through line 5 \n     on page 277 and insert the following:\n\n           TITLE V--CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS\n\n     SEC. 501.

Mr. President, the fuel economy compromise that I filed \nyesterday, as now amended, is a step toward addressing our energy \ncrisis. I thank my dear friend chairman Inouye and his staff for \nworking across the aisle to ensure a bipartisan measure. I support the \nnotion articulated by the President in his State of the Union Address \nthat we need to modernize the Nation's fuel economy program, and save a \nsignificant amount of fuel over the next decade. I believe the \nprovision we now consider would effectuate that policy goal in a \nthoughtful and functional way.\n  Once again, our Nation stands at a crossroads in our history. The \nUnited States faces an energy crisis, but we find ourselves trapped in \na vicious cycle which will only make its consequences more severe. \nWhile our Nation is blessed with enormous natural resource potential, \ninconsistent government policies discourage their exploration and \ndevelopment. As a direct result, the amount of oil imported each year \nis increasing, and our Federal lands, including those in my home State \nof Alaska, are being withdrawn from oil and gas development and \nexploration. These policies have been--and will continue to be \ndetrimental to our national security and long-term environmental \neconomic health. The time has come for those of us in Congress, as the \ncustodians of the public trust, to make the difficult energy policy \ndecisions that will serve to benefit future generations.\n  Those who advocate a one-approach-fixes-all solution are misleading \nthe American public. The only way our Nation will achieve energy \nindependence is through a combination of initiatives. Conservation, \ndomestic production, and the development of alternative sources of \nenergy are all parts of the broader solution. The end to our crisis \nlies in the balance between them, and the advancement of each will also \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. One initiative without the others will \nsimply not be enough to achieve our energy objective.\n  The fuel economy provisions of this bill would enhance conservation. \nThe measure would remove the legal ambiguity that for years has \ninhibited the Secretary of Transportation from raising fuel economy \nstandards for passenger cars, and mandate significant fuel economy \nincreases for both passenger cars and light trucks.\n  By providing authority to increase standards for passenger vehicles, \nand challenging automobile makers to invest toward the achievement of a \nspecific fuel economy target, this amendment would provide consumers \nwith fuel savings at the pump, limit our Nation's dependence on foreign \noil, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I am fully aware of the aggressiveness of the target standard set \nforth in this bill and the challenges involved with reaching the fuel \neconomy standard for the domestic vehicle fleet. And I thank Chairman \nInouye for agreeing to allow regulatory flexibility in the event that \nthe targets set forth by this legislation are not feasible. But the \noverall charge to the auto industry set forth in this measure is not \nunfamiliar to the industry during times of geopolitical instability. In \nfact, the CAFE program was born out of very similar circumstances in \n1973, during the Arab oil embargo. At the time, our Nation recognized \nthat it was in our national interest to reduce our dependence on \nforeign sources of oil by demanding better fuel economy from our \nautomobiles. History has now repeated itself and a combination of \nevents, including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and geopolitical \nunrest, has precipitated once again the need for difficult energy \nconservation determinations.\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\n  Mr. President, the terrorist attacks waged on this country on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East have \nbrought into focus the need to reduce our dependence on all foreign \noil. The United States imports almost 11 million barrels of crude oil \nevery day, compared with only 5 million produced here at home. And more \nthan 2 million imported barrels arrive from the Persian Gulf each day. \nDomestic consumption has increased since 1993 from 17 million to 21 \nmillion barrels per day. The savings achieved by increasing fuel \neconomy standards for the entire domestic passenger vehicle fleet is an \nessential component of our comprehensive strategy to increase our \nenergy independence and national security.\n\n  But any change to fuel economy standards requires the careful balance \nof many factors, including national security, consumer preference, \ndomestic employment, as well as the need for powerful and durable \nvehicles in rural America, including my home State of Alaska. While the \nfuel economy provisions in this amendment would set aggressive goals, \nthey would also provide the Secretary the authority to balance these \nmarket and national security considerations, and to make the \nappropriate and necessary fuel economy increases.\n  By significantly improving fuel economy in our passenger vehicle \nfleet, we will inherently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the \ncause of global climate change has yet to be fully determined, its \nspeed and impacts are more evident in Alaska than anywhere in the \ncountry.\n  Many believe global climate change is attributable partly to manmade \nactivities. Temperatures are rising in the Arctic region at more than \ntwice the rate of the rest of the world, according to the 2004 Arctic \nClimate Impact Assessment, and many impacts in Alaska such as erosion \nand flooding exacerbated by climate change require immediate attention \nand planning of responses.\n  Mr. President, our Nation needs a new energy paradigm. The 21st \ncentury will be the proving ground for our commitment to achieve both \nenergy independence and a clean, sustainable environment. The fuel \neconomy provisions in the amendment address conservation and are \nintended as an aggressive first step of a more holistic energy policy.\n  The current energy crisis cannot be resolved through conservation \nalone, and we cannot suspend the law of supply and demand while we \nanticipate alternative technologies and energy sources. I remain \nsteadfast in my belief that allowing for the development of our \ndomestic resources, particularly in my State of Alaska, is an essential \ncomponent of a successful energy policy.\n  While my colleagues in the past have narrowly defeated efforts to \neffectuate that calling, I will not give up on advancing the need for \nsuch production. The development of our domestic resources would \ngenerate billions of dollars for the Federal Government, which could \naid in our quest for alternative sources of energy if we use this new \nrevenue to invest in research efforts and infrastructure development.\n  Mr. President, I ask for action on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1792), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers of the bill, Senators Bingaman \nand Domenici, are now going to try to see if there are amendments that \ncan be called up, so that a quorum call will be entered into. \nHopefully, we can have other amendments in this matter as soon as \npossible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the sponsors of the amendment \nthat has just been adopted be myself, Senator Inouye, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Lott, Senator Kerry, Senator Carper, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, Senator Alexander, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Corker, Senator Dole, Senator Craig, and Senator Sununu, in \nthat order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in this downtime, the managers are working. \nAt this time, what we are trying to do is clear amendments. There are a \nnumber of amendments that have been filed, some of which are germane. \nWe are working to see if we can clear amendments without a lot of \ndetermination at this time as to whether they are germane or not. \nManagers are working on this real hard and speaking to the individual \nSenators and staffs.\n  Senator Domenici has been notified of this situation. Senator Craig \nis here from the committee representing the minority at this time. We \nhope they can expedite the clearing of some of these amendments, and \nthen we will make a determination after that to see if there are any \nother votes we have to have on some of these germane amendments.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on behalf of our colleagues, is it possible \nat this time for the leader to give us some timeframe as it relates to \nthe packaging and possible activity this evening and into tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Idaho very much. I say to my dear \nfriend from a neighboring State of Nevada, we are trying--and I have \nhad a number of conversations this afternoon with the Republican \nleader--to see if we can expedite the time. It is very possible that we \ncould move forward on this legislation and not have to work the weekend \nbecause a lot of the weekend would be spent just standing around.\n  If we can accomplish what we need to do without a lot of standing \naround time, we would be better off, and then we can move early next \nweek to finish the debate on immigration. We have a limited number of \nitems left to do. We have to finish the germane amendments. I have \nalready indicated the managers are willing even to take a look at some \nnongermane amendments. We need to finish the germane amendments, and we \nhave to have cloture on the bill if, in fact, that is required. \nSometimes it isn't. Most of the time it isn't. I said that earlier. And \nthen we would have final passage on the bill. Then we would have 20 \nminutes on card check. That is the time for the vote. There would be no \ndebate on that. I have a strong suspicion that cloture will not be \ninvoked on that legislation. Following that, we would move to \nimmigration.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. REID. One of the proposals, I say to my friend, was to start \nimmigration on Monday and maybe some other odds and ends around here on \nthis matter. The other proposal Senator McConnell and I have talked \nabout is starting everything Tuesday morning. We would arrive at the \nsame end time. It would just be we wouldn't have to be in session with \npeople standing around guarding to make sure somebody isn't going to do \nsomething when the quorum call is on. We could wind up at the same \nplace and accomplish just as much. That doesn't take away how difficult \nit is going to be once we get on immigration.\n  There are meetings being held on that today and progress is even \nbeing made.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold for a minute. We are going to be in a quorum call. If \nsomeone wants to give a speech for 10 minutes, recognizing they will \nspeak as in morning business just for that 10-minute period, that would \ncertainly be appropriate. But we are not going to do any\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nbusiness on this bill until the managers give us some direction.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the floor is available \nfor some discussion while we are waiting for the managers to work on \namendments and perhaps clear amendments, and I wanted to take a few \nminutes along with my colleague Senator Craig to talk about some \ninformation in a piece of legislation we have previously introduced \ncalled the SAFE Energy Act, Security and Fuel Efficiency Energy Act.\n  That legislation represents legislation trying to reduce the oil \nintensity of the American economy. The calculation of where we are with \nrespect to oil in this country is that we are dangerously dependent on \nforeign sources of oil, dangerously dependent on oil that comes from \nvery troubled parts of the world--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, \nVenezuela, and more. That dependence now is over 60 percent. In other \nwords, over 60 percent of the oil we need to run this country's economy \ncomes from other parts of the world, much of it very troubled.\n  If, God forbid, tomorrow a terrorist were to interrupt the supply of \noil coming to this country, our economy would be flat on its back. So \nhow do we reduce the oil intensity in this country? Well, you do a lot \nof things. I mentioned that 60 percent plus of our oil comes from \noutside of our country. About 70 percent of the oil we use in this \ncountry is used in vehicles. So while 60 percent comes from other \ncountries, 70 percent is running through a carburetor or fuel injector \nto make our vehicle fleet go, and we are in a hopeless pursuit of \nbecoming less dependent on foreign sources of energy if we don't make \nour vehicle fleet more efficient.\n  So that is one. You have to make your vehicle fleet more efficient. \nWe have just passed a piece of legislation that moves in that \ndirection. But you need a lot of things: You need efficiency, you need \nconservation, you need renewable energy, you need additional production \nof energy; yes, even fossil fuels, but done in an environmentally \nacceptable way. So conservation.\n  We misuse, we waste, an enormous amount of energy in this country. \nThe cheapest form of energy available to us is through conservation. \nThere is no question about that. Efficiency. Almost everything we do in \nthis country, from the time we get up in the morning until we go to bed \nat night, we are using all kinds of appliances that require energy. We \nflip on a switch and a light bulb turns on. We plug in a razor and \nshave and use electricity. We jump in the shower and that water is \nheated by electricity or perhaps natural gas. But the fact is \neverything we do can be made more efficient.\n  There are strange terms, such as SEER 13 standards for air \nconditioners. Some don't know what that means. I know it is kind of an \narcane language, talking about SEER 13 standards, but it means much \nmore efficient air conditioners. We fought for a long time about that \nand finally got a SEER 13 standard, and it is going to use much less \nelectricity and be much more efficient.\n  So conservation, efficiency, renewables. The bill on the floor of the \nSenate is a significant piece of legislation dealing with renewable \nenergy, solar energy, biomass, wind energy, and then the biofuels, \nincluding ethanol, biodiesel, and all of these issues that deal with \nrenewable energy. That is another significant step toward being less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil. Conservation, efficiency, \nrenewables.\n  But there is another piece that has received too little notice, in my \njudgment, too little notice on the floor of the Senate, and that is \nadditional production. We are going to use additional coal. As chairman \nof the Energy and Water appropriations subcommittee that funds those \nenergy accounts, we are going to use clean power and clean coal \ntechnology to, I hope one of these days, be able to have a coal-fired \nelectric generating plant that is a zero-emission coal-fired electric \ngenerating plant. I believe we can get there through technology and \nbetter science. We have all these issues we are working on.\n  With respect to fossil fuel, coal, oil, and natural gas, we need to \nfind additional ways to produce additional quantities of oil here as \nwell. As I look at this issue, and my colleague Senator Craig and I \nhave evaluated this issue, there are quantities of oil offshore--yes, \nin Alaska and on the west coast, in the gulf--and the largest quantity \nis in the Gulf of Mexico. We know we have passed some legislation in \nthe last 2 years, within the last year and a half or so, opening up \nwhat is called lease 181. It was modified, through the work of the \nSenators from Florida and others, in a way that was acceptable to them.\n  We opened up a portion of the Gulf of Mexico for additional \nproduction. Senator Craig and I believe there are additional tracts and \nsignificant tracts that can be open for additional production of oil, \noil and natural gas, and that such production can be done without \ndestruction of our environment. That production can be done by \nexpanding the supply, which must be part of the answer to addressing \nthis energy problem we have.\n  The oil intensity in our country makes us dangerously dependent on \nforeign sources of oil, and so as we look at how we deal with that, we \ndeal with it in a lot of ways, but one of those ways must, in my \njudgment, include some additional production with proper and certain \nenvironmental protections. That can be done. That should be done, in my \njudgment.\n  Now, Senator Craig and I understand that portion of the plan we \nintroduced here in the Senate that deals with offshore production is \ncontroversial. We understand when you try to do something such as \nthat, people come to the floor and put up a pretty vigorous fight. I \nmight say the Presiding Officer, being from Florida, has been very \nactive and very aggressive in protecting his State's interests, and \nvery effective at protecting his State's interests. Both Senators from \nFlorida have been active and involved in that. We understand that.\n\n  We also understand it is not likely at this point that we have the \nvotes here in the Senate at this moment to expand the kind of \nproduction we wish to expand in the Gulf of Mexico, but that doesn't \nmean we shouldn't be discussing and considering how at some point in \nthe future we access those significant additional quantities of oil and \nnatural gas our country needs, and how we access them with the kind of \ncertain protections for our economy and our environment that would be \nnecessary to accompany that.\n  That is why Senator Craig and I introduced a piece of legislation \nthat has this production side to it, and we feel it has not been much \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate. Everything else has been--\nconservation, efficiency, renewables--all of which I support, all of \nwhich I am excited about, all of which I think advance this country's \ninterest, but the production side has not been discussed in as \nsignificant a way as I believe it should. So I wanted to simply take \nthis moment to say that the proposal offered by my colleague from Idaho \nand myself is one that believes that whether it is now or in the \nfuture, the construct of how we put together a comprehensive energy \nplan to reduce the dangerous dependence we have on foreign sources of \noil must include some additional production, and the most likely place, \nwith the greatest potential, if you look at all of the potential areas, \nis in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor so my colleague from Idaho can \nexpress himself as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor a very succinct presentation about the reality of why we have spent \nthe last couple of weeks debating energy in the Senate.\n  There is another reality check that I think most Americans fail to \nunderstand when it comes to why they are paying $3-plus at the pump, \nand that reality is that clearly demand in this country has outstripped \nsupply by a significant amount. We have increasingly, since the 1950s, \nbegun to have to\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\ngo elsewhere than just in and around our country to meet the \nhydrocarbon or the crude oil needs of our refiners and, ultimately, the \ngasoline needs of our consumers. As that dependency has grown on \nforeign sources of energy, I would argue that America became \nincreasingly less secure.\n  Now, I am one who in the 1980s, and probably the early 1990s, thought \nit would be just production, production, and more production. I have \nchanged. I have spent a lot of time looking at the energy equation of \nour country over the last couple of decades and said, no, you have to \ndo a variety of different things.\n  Production is important. Our President said we are hooked on \nhydrocarbons. We are ``gasaholics,'' if you will. We are and we will be \nfor an extended period of time. We have been there a long while. We \nhave a multi, multibillion dollar infrastructure that supplies that \nenergy out to the suburban access points, and you don't change those \novernight. You don't change the technology that ultimately gets you \nthere, but you do change. And America must change.\n  Some say you don't need anymore production, you can go to efficiency, \nyou can go to new technology, and that alone will change the equation \nfast enough to save America's consumers and the economy.\n  I disagree with that. I think we are going to go there. In fact, the \nSenate by a voice vote a few moments ago passed a new efficiency \nstandard for automobiles that I support. I am a Senator who has never \nsupported that in the 27 years I have been in the Senate. So while I \nmay be asking the Presiding Officer from Florida to change a little bit \nas it relates to the resources that are offshore Florida because I now \nknow the technologies can bring those resources out without damaging \nthe environment, here is a Senator who has changed also because I do \nbelieve that when you get to a fleet that burns less fuel, you are \ngoing to get to an America that needs less hydrocarbons over time.\n  That is why the Senator from North Dakota and I introduced \nlegislation earlier this year that talked about conservation, and it \ntalked about innovation, but it also talked about production and the \nreality of having to get more production out of our own resources \ninstead of relying on one of the most unstable, riskiest areas of the \nworld to gain that production.\n  If the world were at total peace today and the world's oil supplies \nwere managed by companies and not countries, my guess is crude would \nnot be at $60-plus a barrel. It would be at $40-plus a barrel and the \nAmerican consumer would probably be paying a dollar less at the pump. \nBut that is not reality. Reality is reflected at the pump and therein \nlies one of our greatest problems.\n  Earlier in the day, we had a great debate about a tax bill, to tax \nthe oil companies by about $30 billion. Somehow that was going to \nchange the equation; it was going to make the world a safer and better \nplace. It was not going to change the price at the pump, not one dime. \nIn fact it had the potential of taking it up.\n  Here is the reason why. It did not change this equation. What is this \nequation? These are the known reserves of oil on the globe. Here are \nthe big boys, as we think of them--the big companies. Here is Exxon and \nhere is the British Petroleum and here is Texaco and over here is \nMarathon.\n  You can hardly see them on the chart. They don't own the world's oil \nsupply. They manage and own very little of it.\n  Who owns it? Hugo Chavez, Venezuela--who would love to jerk this \ncountry around by its tail--Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq. I have named some \nof the most unstable areas of the world. They own the oil today. We \nneed it because we are dependent on it, because we have done very \nlittle about it. That is why the Senator from North Dakota and I said \nwe have to go where the oil is in our country, and the oil is not \nonshore anymore. The oil is not onshore. It is offshore. We know it is, \nand we know there is a substantial supply of it. But we have allowed \nStates to put on moratoria and establish a political environment that \ndenies the Federal Government access to its own resources, so the \ntaxpayers of Idaho are paying a higher price for gasoline, in part, \nbecause the State of California--the Senator from California is here, \nthe State of Florida, and other States have said you can't drill off \nour shore. No. No. Even though in California, with the old leases, they \nare still drilling in the State waters--not drilling but producing--the \nghost of Santa Barbara is long gone. There are some who still like to \ntalk about it, but my guess is these young folks sitting around here \ntonight, who are our pages, don't even remember Santa Barbara or the \noilspill that resulted from the catastrophe of a wellhead blowing off \noffshore years ago.\n  The reason you don't is because it doesn't happen anymore. The \ntechnology of today, the safety of today, the regulations of today have \nchanged the equation.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about a compromise the Senator \nfrom Florida worked with us on this past year. This is lease sale 181, \nwhere there may be millions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic \nfeet of gas. We don't know. There is a pretty good idea it is there and \nit can be produced and pushed into the current infrastructure and \nAmerica, for a moment in time, will be a little bit more energy secure.\n  What I am proposing and what many are talking about is what about \nthis area? What about the rest of the eastern gulf? Ought we not be \ntalking about that? Looking at it? Understanding what is there, if \ntechnology allows us to produce?\n  Here is where America's oil is being produced today, in the Gulf of \nMexico. We are finding more and more out there as the technologies \nimprove and as we can get deeper into the waters. That is reality. \nThere are those who will give a lot of different arguments about why \nyou should not do it. But I will argue you can do it and that the oil \nis there and America ought to know about it and they ought to be asking \nwhy we are not going there but, instead, why are we increasingly \ndependent upon foreign nations for our source of oil?\n  It is a reasonable question to ask. Right now, America has grown \nincreasingly angry because of the price it is paying at the pump. \nPeople are not accustomed to using their disposable income for the \nprice of energy as we know it today. That is not what we have done in \nan economy such as ours. But that is where we are today.\n  Here is what happens when we rely on other countries to produce our \nenergy for us. We are at war with terrorism today around the globe. \nThis is the French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen in October 6 of \n2002, when an al-Qaida suicide boat hit it and set it afire. Here is \nthe vulnerability of all of our oil moving on water. I suggest the \necological problems resulting from this are greater than from any \ndrilling that could occur offshore America today because we expose \nourselves to a high risk by the shipment of oil on our ocean surfaces \naround the world.\n  That is why I think it is important that we keep talking and allowing \nAmerica to understand we are not without oil and not without oil \nreserves. The progressive and environmentally sound development of them \nover time will help us in this period of transition that will take \nseveral decades to move to flex-fueled cars--hydrogen cars, electric \ncars, all of the kinds of things we think America wants and that in \npublic policy and incentivizing the marketplace we are moving America \ntoward.\n  It will not happen overnight. In that period of time, while it is \nhappening, America remains extremely vulnerable. Our economy is at \nrisk. There is no question about it. What I have said is this picture \ndemonstrates something that ought to be repeated and repeated again: \nThe weapon of mass ``disruption'' in this country is an al-Qaida \nsuicide boat hitting the side of an oil tanker, time and time again. \nThat is the weapon of mass disruption. The high risk involved, the \ndriving up of the oil prices, the movement of gas by $2 or $3 a gallon \nin this economy creates havoc everywhere. Certainly, in my State of \nIdaho it creates tremendous problems.\n\n  It is important that I and other Senators recognize that you do not \nconserve your way out of an energy crisis. You do not innovate your way \nout of an energy crisis. You do not produce your way out. You do all \nthree.\n  I am going to continue to work while I am in the Senate to encourage \nthis\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\nSenate in public policy to do all three. I think it is in the best \ninterests of America, our economy, and our national security that we do \nso. As an American today, I am not only frustrated, I am sometimes \nangered and embarrassed that we, through public policy, have allowed \nour country to become so dependent on other parts of the world.\n  Great nations should not allow that to happen, but we have. Then we \nmake excuses all around us why we can't produce. Petropolitics is a \nfascinating thing. America gets it. The consumer understands it, and \nthe consumer will grow increasingly angry when they understand that \npublic policy doesn't allow the marketplace to do what it can do best \nin an environmentally sound way, to provide our country with the kind \nof energy it needs.\n  Again, as we debate this bill on the floor and finalize it, my guess \nis we will do a lot about conservation, we will do a lot about \ninnovation, but we will do little to nothing about production. In the \nnext 5 to 6 years, production is where it is. As we work on innovation, \nas we move technology from the laboratory to the street to commercial \nuse, production still remains critically important.\n  I call upon my colleagues to stand up and be counted in all three of \nthese areas. It is important for our country. It is important for our \neconomy. Without question, it is important for our national security. \nThe rest of the world should not tell America what its foreign policy \nis or will be based on their willingness or lack thereof to produce the \noil supply our economy needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate works in strange ways. I \nthink there is no question about that. Some of us were upstairs holding \na press conference on the fact that we had come together around a \nsubstitute amendment, and Senator Kerry, who had participated, came \nback up and said the amendment was agreed to.\n  For me, I began this in 1993, so it has been a very long time. \nSenator Snowe and I have worked, first, for the SUV loophole closer and \nthen for this ten-over-ten bill for 6 years now. So it was adopted by \nthe Senate, and there are some people I would like to thank.\n  I would like to begin thanking Senator Snowe, who has been the \ncosponsor of this legislation--10 miles improvement in mileage \nefficiency over 10 years--since we started; the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inouye; the ranking member, Senator Stevens; Senator \nCarper, who was so helpful all the way along; Senator Dorgan, who had \none part of the legislation, who agreed to a change and came into the \ncompromise; Senator Kerry, who worked very hard with Senator Cantwell \non the flex-fuel part of this; Senator Lott, Senator Corker; Senator \nKlobuchar; and many others. You, Mr. President, we thank you for being \na cosponsor of this compromise effort as well.\n  We have pushed the rock for so long I think it is hard to feel \nanything once the rock goes over the hill. But the amendment was \nadopted and it is in the base bill. For this, we are very grateful.\n  I would quickly like to say what this agreement does. It increases \nthe fleetwide average fuel economy for all cars, SUVs, and light trucks \nby 10 miles per gallon over 10 years or from 25 miles per gallon to 35 \nmiles per gallon by model year 2020.\n  Second, it requires the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, which we call NHTSA, to establish an attribute-based \nsystem that sets mileage standards based on size, weight or type of \nvehicle. This is important because it creates a level playing field for \nall automobiles.\n  From 2011 to 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nmust set fuel economy standards that are the maximum feasible and \nratchet these standards up, making steady progress to meet the 35-\nmiles-per-gallon fleetwide average by 2020. The fleetwide average must \nbe met unless NHTSA determines, based on clear and convincing evidence, \nthat a 35-mile-per-gallon fleetwide average would not be cost effective \nfor the Nation.\n  From 2021 to 2030, NHTSA must set fuel economy standards that are the \nmaximum feasible and ratchet even these standards up at a reasonable \nrate.\n  In addition, the agreement establishes a credit system that NHTSA \nwould design, run, and operate. This would allow automakers to buy \ncredits if you exceed the standard, and essentially sell those credits \nto those who cannot make the standards in a given year. So the credit \ntrading program gives an automaker a financial incentive to exceed the \nstandard.\n  It can bank its credits also for up to 5 years. That is insurance if \nit falls below the standard in a later year. If an automaker cannot \nmeet the standard in a given year, it can purchase credits, use banked \ncredits or borrow from projected surpluses in future years.\n  This provision was strongly recommended by the National Academy of \nSciences in 2002. In part of the negotiation we negotiated with the two \nSenators from Michigan, both distinguished Senators, Ms. Stabenow and \nMr. Levin. And I want to say this: There are no two Senators from any \nsingle State that I have seen fight harder for their State's industries \nthan Senator Stabenow and Senator Levin. We could not reach an \naccommodation. Those of us who have watched this fight for CAFE \nstandards and participated in it for the last 13 years, I have just \nfound, for me, the automobile industry has never responded. They have \nfought everything we have proposed every time. When this happens, when \nan industry is not forthcoming and does not come to you and say: Look, \nI cannot support this, but I can support that, could you make some \nchanges, just something--instead, it is a stone wall. It is: No, it \ndoes not work in this agreement, the arena, with those of us who feel \nstrongly.\n  I come from a huge State. We have two nonattainment pollution areas, \nthe central valley of California and the Los Angeles area. We are \nhaving a huge problem meeting the attainment standards. If we do not, \nit can stop everything dead.\n  Therefore, this, which reduces pollution, which reduces carbon \ndioxide, reduces global warming gases, and saves oil to the tune of 1.2 \nmillion barrels a day, is something that is going to happen when you \ntry, try, try year after year and decade after decade.\n  I am very sorry we could not make an accommodation with these two \nSenators. But those of us who have worked on this felt so strongly that \nafter all these years, 23 years, where Detroit has said: No, no, no, \nthe time had come to say: Yes, yes, yes.\n  I, for one, want to help with leap-ahead technology. I, for one, want \nto help with financing, wherever I can, to make it possible. I believe \nI speak for all of the cosponsors of this bill. I believe we all want \nto help. So I hope the next step these Senators will take is to say: \nHere is a bill that we want to help on, that will provide the leap-\nahead technology, and here is something that would help financially the \nAmerican automakers meet these standards.\n  We who have worked on this, we who asked in the early 1990s--I was \nthe one who asked for the National Academy of Sciences study. They took \na period of years to do it. We have read it. I think those of us who \nhave been at that for so long gave up any hope that we could work with \nthe automakers. We do not believe this will stifle the American auto \nindustry. We believe the technology is now available, we believe it is \ncost effective to use this technology. It is not just based on reducing \nweight; there are new materials, new engineering strategies, new types \nof engines that can be employed.\n  I want to summarize by saying with this amendment, 206 million metric \ntons of carbon dioxide will not be pumped into the air in 2020; between \n345 million metric tons and 428 million metric tons by 2025. We \nestimate savings for consumers at the pump, at $3-a-gallon gasoline, to \nbe $55.6 billion in 2020, and $93 billion to $116 billion by 2025. As I \nsaid, oil savings of 1.2 million barrels per day, or 438 million \nbarrels per year in 2020, and between 2 and 2\\1/2\\ million barrels per \nday by 2025. That is about what we import from the Middle East.\n  I thank everybody who participated. There are some of those Senators \non the floor. I want to particularly thank Senator Cantwell for her \nefforts on flex fuel. She is extraordinarily knowledgeable. She is also \ndetermined. She\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nperseveres. Her amendment was added as a modification to the amendment \nthat passed.\n  I thank Senator Carper for his steadfast help. The Senator from \nDelaware has been there every step of the way, in every meeting.\n  Most of all, I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee. What can \nI say about this chairman? Well, I can begin by saying how lucky we are \nto have you, Dan Inouye. You run a fine committee. We are so grateful \nfor your leadership in this matter. I do not believe it would have \nhappened had you not, A, been chairman of the committee; B, been \ncommitted to this legislation; C, wanted us to come together and find a \nsolution. You were so right, because we did come together, and the \nsolution happened quicker than any of us might guess.\n\n  I also want to, if I might, thank your staff. David Strickland is a \ntechnological wizard on this. He also has the dedication. He is sitting \nhere today. I know he has worked very long hours. But we are very \ngrateful for his help.\n  Mr. Chairman, I say thank you very much.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank my staff, particularly John \nWatts, who has been with us for some time, as my environmental counsel, \nand has worked on this issue; and Matthew Nelson, who is new to our \nstaff, but came in and got his feet wet very fast. I am very grateful \nto both of them as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bill Nelson as \na cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I know others want to speak. This is one of the great \ndays in the Senate. When you work on something for a long time, and you \nfind yourself cut out year after year, you are determined you are going \nto persevere to find new ways to do it, and for Senator Snowe and for \nme, it is a very special day. I thank everyone for making it possible \nfor all of us in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. While Senator Feinstein is still on the floor, I would \ntell her: In my life, as I have had a chance to meet great leaders in \nthis country and in other places, other countries, in all walks of \nlife, I have taken over the years to asking those leaders: To what do \nyou attribute your success--whether they happen to be a leader in \nbusiness or academia or government. More often than not they say to me, \namong other things, I work hard. They also say: I don't give up. I \ndon't give up.\n  I say to my colleague Senator Feinstein, to my colleague Olympia \nSnowe: You do not give up. And we are going to be a better country, a \ncountry less dependent on foreign oil because of those efforts, a \ncountry with a cleaner environment, a country and a world less \nthreatened by global warming because of your efforts.\n  If we are smart, we will pull together and find ways to make sure \nthis legislation, rather than being the death knell for the auto \nindustry in this country, can be like a second wind and help to restore \nus to the kind of vigor we once enjoyed.\n  Thank you very much. Thank you for your kindness in giving so many \nother people credit. I echo Senator Feinstein's comments with respect \nto our staffs, committee staff, and there are a bunch of them sitting \nback here. David and the first team are back here. I want to say you \nhave done a remarkable job.\n  I have been in the Senate for 7 years. This is my first year on the \nCommerce Committee. I have never seen staff as helpful, Democratic and \nRepublicans, like one team working together, and Beth Osborne, who \nworks on my personal staff, continues to rave about the great support \nwe get from the committee staff. I think they key off Senator Inouye, \nour chairman, and Senator Stevens, the senior Republican. It is a \nwonderful kind of relationship, the way this place ought to work. When \nit does, we get the kind of results I hope we are going to get with \nrespect to fuel efficiency for our cars, trucks, and vans.\n  I believe it was Thomas Edison who said, and I am going to paraphrase \nThomas Edison, that: Sometimes people miss opportunity. And they miss \nopportunity because it comes wearing overalls and looks a lot like \nwork.\n  There is opportunity in the legislation we are prepared, I believe, \nto pass with respect to fuel efficiencies for our cars, trucks, and \nvans. I think there is an opportunity here for the U.S. domestic auto \nindustry. We have to help make sure that opportunity is not missed.\n  We have all seen the Home Depot commercials where the folks from Home \nDepot say: You can do this; we can help. And with respect to meeting \nthe goal of 35-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency standards for cars and \ntrucks by 2020, that is an aggressive goal. But for the auto industry, \nFord, GM, and Chrysler, it is important for us to be there to help them \nto meet that goal. If you look closely at the legislation we are \npreparing to pass here in the next--maybe tonight, maybe in the next \nday or two--if you look at the legislation, there is a variety of ways \nwhere we do help. I will mention a few of those now, if I might.\n  One of those is the infusion of Federal dollars in research and \ndevelopment with respect to new battery technology. The coolest car I \nsaw at the Detroit auto show in January of this year was a Chevrolet. \nIt is called a Chevrolet Volt. It is a flex-fuel plug-in hybrid \nvehicle. The mileage it will get is probably close to 75, 80, 90 miles \nper gallon. You plug it in your garage at night, go out the next day, \ndrive 40 miles or so on the battery, push on the brakes, and recharge \nthe battery. But also it comes with an auxiliary battery unit. It can \nbe biocell, it could be flex-fuel diesel, it could be flex-fuel ethanol \npowered, internal combustion engine, recharging the battery and getting \nthis remarkable fuel economy from what I call an elegant solution.\n  That is the kind of creativity we have in this country; not just \nChevrolet, not just Ford, not just Chrysler, but all of us together, \nworking together. It is a wonderful concept, as that car is. It is not \ngoing to be a reality in 2010 or 2011 or 2012 if we don't have the next \ngeneration lithium ion battery to be able to plug in the garage at \nnight and provide the kind of charge to carry us 30, 40 miles the next \nday, plug it in at work, and on and on.\n  We have an opportunity, I think we have an obligation as the Federal \nGovernment, to make sure tax dollars are appropriately spent. Fifty \nmillion dollars a year at least for the next 5 years goes to help fund \nthe technologies so that vehicle and other flex-fuel plug-in hybrid \nvehicles can be built and get us, if not ahead of the rest of the \nworld, at least at the starting line with them as we begin this next \npart of the race, the competitive race for market share in the world.\n  One way we can help within the Federal Government is through our R \ninvestment. A second way we can help is by using our Federal purchasing \npower to commercialize these new technologies as they come to market. \nWe do that in this legislation in one way, by calling for the \ndevelopment of major steps toward a game plan as early as 2009 for the \nFederal Government to use its purchasing power to buy new technology, \nhighly energy-efficient vehicles.\n  In the underlying language of this bill, it actually says that 70 \npercent, up to 70 percent of the vehicles that GSA, General Services \nAdministration, purchases on the civilian side for the Federal \nGovernment have to be highly energy efficient, next-generation kind of \ntechnology--70 percent.\n  In a week or two we are going to take up legislation on the \nreauthorization of the Defense bill. If we are smart, we will put a \nsimilar kind of requirement in there for the defense side of our \nGovernment to do what we are preparing to do in this legislation for \nthe civilian side of our Government in terms of purchasing power, to \nsay to the Department of Defense, when they go to the marketplace and \nthey are buying cars, trucks, and vans, and they buy a lot of them, to \nmake sure that early in the next decade maybe 70 percent of what we are \npurchasing on the defense side is these new technology energy-\nefficient, low-emission vehicles.\n  That is a smart thing to do. That is the second thing we can do, use \nthe Federal Government's purchasing power to commercialize new \ntechnologies.\n  The third thing we can do is make sure our tax policy marries up with \nthe goals we are setting for more highly energy-efficient, low-emission \nvehicles.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nIn 2005, we passed legislation that said when people buy hybrid-powered \nvehicles, they can earn a tax credit from about $300 to up to $3,500. \nThat tax credit brings down the cost of the energy-efficient hybrid \nvehicles and encourages people to buy them. Unfortunately, most of the \nhybrids people are buying these days happen to be built in other \ncountries. That is going to change very soon, as GM product comes on \nthe market. Chrysler product comes on the market early next year, and \nwe will have the opportunity to buy not just hybrid vehicles built in \nother countries but a lot of hybrids built here. We have a Tax Code \nthat is set to infuse and encourage American consumers to buy those \nvehicles as soon as they hit the road.\n  There is also a provision in the 2005 Energy bill that incentivizes \nconsumers to buy low-emission, highly efficient diesel-powered \nvehicles. The full effect of that will not be felt until 2009. But \nChrysler, in a partnership with DaimlerChrysler, is beginning to bring \nto the roads a highly energy-efficient, far lower emission diesel that \nincreases performance by 40 percent or more in terms of fuel \nefficiency. It reduces the emission of bad stuff, including \nCO2, into the air. Beginning in 2009, when emissions really \ngo down on diesel, the tax policy is there to incentivize folks to buy \nthose vehicles. That is a smart thing to do.\n  The fourth area we tried to work into this legislation--and we need \nto do more--deals with the kind of infrastructure we have for folks who \nbuy fuel cell-powered vehicles in this decade and the next. We don't \nhave a hybrid highway. It is not as if you can take your fuel cell \nvehicle and go to the corner gas station and fill up, even in this city \nor its neighboring States. We in the Federal Government have an \nobligation, particularly if we want to encourage people to get into \nfuel cell-powered vehicles, hydrogen-powered vehicles, to make sure the \ninfrastructure is there so people can fill up. The same is true with \nbiodiesel, ethanol. It is no good for us to have vehicles run on \nbiodiesel or ethanol if there is no place to fill up. We tried, in the \ncontext of this legislation, to fix that problem.\n  I am sure our present Presiding Officer remembers when we were trying \nto get folks to buy unleaded cars powered by unleaded gas. Finally, we \nsaid: Every gas station has to have at least one pump where you can get \nunleaded gas. We made it a mandate. Today it is hard to find a gas pump \nthat has leaded gas. But it took a while to do that. We need a similar \nkind of approach with respect to biofuels and ethanol, not that they \nwould supplant completely the petroleum products--that is not going to \nhappen any time soon--but to make sure people have the fuel to meet the \nkinds of needs of their vehicles.\n  Those are four things we can do in the context of this legislation. \nWe are going to find ways to do more. The best way to do that is to ask \nthe auto industry: How can we help? We want you to meet these goals. We \nrealize you think they are maybe difficult to achieve, some would say \nimpossible to achieve. I don't think so.\n  This is the United States of America. This is the Nation which \ninvented cars. This is the Nation which invented airplanes. This is the \nNation which invented televisions and CD players. This is the Nation \nwhich invented the Internet, computers. This is the Nation which \nunleashed the power of the atom. This is the Nation which put a man on \nthe Moon, did it in less than 10 years, when we said we were going to \ndo it. This is the United States of America. We are creative, hard \nworking. We are smart. If we are really smart, we will find a way to \nmake this new approach to fuel efficiency for our cars, trucks, and \nvans work; to make it work for the domestic auto companies as well as \nfor others who come to our shores; to make it work for the shareholders \nand for their employees; and, most importantly, to make it work for our \nNation so that we will have reduced our dependence on foreign oil, \nreduced the amount of harmful emissions put into the air, and made this \ncountry a little better place to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator \nFeinstein for her quest over a number of years and thank all of our \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee, Members and staff, for bringing \nthis possibility about. It came about as a result of the other side not \nhaving the votes. All they had to get was 41 votes. Fortunately, that \ndid not occur. It allowed us to come together and massage the bill a \nlittle bit more with these amendments. Thus, we get the end result.\n  This Senator has filed an amendment for 40 miles per gallon. It \nsimply wasn't practical. We weren't going to have the votes for that \nbecause we were trying hard enough to get the votes for 35 miles a \ngallon in 13 years, in 2020, and then with the compromises that were \nmade, instead of thereafter being at a 4-percent increase in miles per \ngallon per year, which would compound, leaving it to NHTSA, with the \ncriteria of what is practically feasible. That is a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  Then totally apart from that, on a separate issue, flex-fuel \nvehicles, wherever we can encourage that, it is certainly to our \nadvantage because the more we can have a fuel that is something other \nthan derived from oil, the better off we are. If we have the vehicles \nthat use E85, then the question is, Do we have the gas stations that \nhave the ethanol distributed to them in order to get E85? We have to \nstart working on that. As a matter of fact, in my State of Florida, we \nhave one company that is seriously thinking about ethanol plants all \nover the State so that it could then have the ability to get the \nethanol distributed to the gas stations.\n  While the chairman of the Commerce Committee is here, I wanted to \nsay, in handing out all of these congratulations, under his leadership, \nunder his tutoring, under his mentoring, and under his encouragement, \nhe has allowed the committee to come forth with this work product that \nis a signal achievement. Now if we can get the Energy bill passed on \nfinal passage and then if we can survive the process, if the House can \npass an energy bill, in conference committee, then, of course, if we \ncan survive not having a veto by the President, this is all doable now \nbecause we are where we are thanks to the leadership of the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee.\n\n  I wanted to make another comment on another subject in response to my \ncolleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Craig from Idaho. Senator Craig \nputs up a chart there as if all the oil in the United States is in the \nGulf of Mexico off of Florida. That is not what the geology says. To \nthe contrary, over the last 50 years where they have drilled, they have \ncome up with a number of dry holes.\n  That was why last year this Senator was willing to compromise for \nthose who wanted a lease sale called 181 that basically had boiled down \nto about 2 million acres, to be able to expand that to 8.3 million \nacres but to keep it away from the coastline of Florida, where we \nhappen to have a $50 billion-a-year tourism industry that depends on \npristine beaches, but equally as important, that kept it away from the \nmilitary mission line, which is the edge of the largest testing and \ntraining area in the world for our military. It is there where we are \ndoing significant testing of weapons systems and new sophisticated \ntechnology, often with live ordnance. Over and over, the Secretary of \nDefense has issued letters and said: You can't drill in this area \nbecause oil rigs are incompatible with live fire and testing of live \nordnance on new weapons systems.\n  Senator Craig in his comments would have us believe the answer is \ndrill, drill, drill. By his chart, he was suggesting drilling off the \ncoast of Florida. That simply is not true. It is interesting that he \nsaid that at the very time in which we are on this Energy bill through \nwhich we are now doing something about lessening the consumption of oil \nby the amendment we just adopted, an amendment that goes to the very \nheart of where we consume most of our oil, and that is in the \ntransportation sector. Where in transportation is it most consumed? It \nis in our personal vehicles. Thus, we are doing something about that \ntonight.\n  I wanted to add these comments while we are still on the Energy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Employee Free \nChoice Act, S. 1041. This bill was introduced by our esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, along with myself and 45 other Members of \nthe Senate.\n  This bill takes the long overdue step of returning to workers a \nmeasure of negotiating power and ensuring that workers have a free \nchoice and fair chance to form a union. Everyone needs an agent, and \nfor too long workers have not had an agent in the Congress or, in many \ncases, in the workplace.\n\n  The bargain this country has promised workers--that if you work hard, \nyou will get ahead--is broken. Hard-working Americans are losing \nground. Real wages are lower today than in 1973, despite the fact that \nproductivity has risen over 80 percent. The benefits of rising \nproductivity are going to the richest members of our society. CEO \ncompensation today is 420 times what it is for our workers. Medical \ncosts have skyrocketed. Good manufacturing jobs are being sent \noverseas. Many workers are squeezed between the impact of corporate \noutsourcing on the one hand and wage-depressing effects of immigration \non the other. In Virginia, real median hourly wages fell by 3.6 percent \njust in the past 2 years. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians, just \nlike millions of Americans, have no health insurance.\n  As I heard so often during my campaign for the Senate last year and \nwhat I continue to hear since I took office, our workers are under \ntremendous pressure. Only 38 percent of the public says their families \nare getting ahead financially, and less than one-third believes the \nnext generation of Americans is going to be better off than this \ngeneration.\n  Our unions have historically provided a ladder for workers to get \nahead. According to a national survey by Peter Hart Research, 60 \nmillion Americans report, right now, they would join a union if they \ncould. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers who belong \nto unions earn 30 percent more than their nonunion counterparts and are \n63 percent more likely to have employer-provided health care.\n  Unfortunately, many workers who try to form unions in this country \nare being blocked by employers. In an analysis of union organizing \ndrives in Chicago, the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of \nemployers tended to fire prounion workers, that 82 percent of employers \nhired consultants to fight union organization drives, and that 78 \npercent of employers required supervisors to deliver antiunion messages \nto their workers. Union membership in this country is now at an alltime \nlow, just comprising 12 percent of our workforce.\n  The ability to form a union should not require heroic efforts. Yet \nAmerican workers all too often face employer coercion and run the risk \nof losing their livelihoods simply because they want to organize their \nworkplace in accordance with existing law. Hard-working Americans \nshould have the freedom to make their own choice about whether to join \na union, and they should be able to make that choice freely and fairly. \nThe best opportunity for hard-working Americans to get ahead is to join \ntheir coworkers and negotiate in one way or another for better wages \nand benefits.\n  We can help workers improve their bargaining position. The National \nLabor Relations Act already permits workers to form unions through \nmajority signup. In fact, more workers join unions through majority \nsignup than through National Labor Relations Board elections. Employees \nof Cingular Wireless joined the Communications Workers of America \nfollowing a majority signup that was supported by the company.\n  This bill makes the much needed change of allowing workers to form \nunions by majority signup where employers oppose the union. This bill \nalso levels the playing field for workers by strengthening penalties \nagainst employers that coerce or intimidate employees. The fundamental \nsense of fairness that runs so deep in our Nation's character demands \nthat we take this step on behalf of our working men and women.\n  Let us measure our success in the Senate by the number of hard-\nworking Americans we bring back to the table, the number of families \nwith health care, the number of workers with pensions and fair wages, \nand the number of children who are able to go to college. Passing the \nEmployee Free Choice Act puts us on the road to achieving this type of \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise tonight because we are on the \nprecipice of passing new energy legislation--new energy legislation \nthat will point our country in a new direction, on an energy strategy \nthat is about cleaner, renewable alternative fuel, and, yes, on \nresearch and development, on many other ways that will help us, as \nAmericans, be energy leaders again.\n  It is exciting to be here tonight on the Senate floor as new \nlegislation is being adopted that does change the direction in ways my \ncolleagues have been fighting for many years and many of the staff who \nare behind me have been fighting for much of their legislative careers \non the Hill. But we are here tonight because Senator Reid, early this \nyear, asked six different committees to come up with energy legislation \nand point our country in a new direction. He asked each of those \ncommittees to put those proposals on the Senate floor by passing them \nout in a bipartisan fashion, and those committees have done so.\n  Now, while we have not gotten all those packages together, we do have \na proposal before us that would save the United States 20 percent on \nthe oil consumption of today. That is a great goal. It does it in two \nfundamental ways: by making sure we produce alternative fuel--and what \nis before us tonight is 36 billion gallons of alternative fuel, mostly \ndone by advanced technologies of cellulosic that will be a much bigger \nreduction of CO2 emissions than corn-based ethanol, and that \nis a huge direction change--and the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia to make sure we have fuel-efficient cars.\n  For the first time in decades, we are passing legislation that will \nallow Americans to get more out of a tank of gas. In fact, with this \nnew standard for fuel efficiency, Americans, when they fill up their \ntank, will be able to go anywhere from 100 to 150 more miles on that \ntank of gas when these fuel efficiency standards are fully implemented.\n  Because we are also including a flex-fuel provision, we are giving \nAmericans a chance to have their automobiles run on two different fuel \nchoices: fossil fuel or new advanced green renewable fuels that will be \na great reduction of CO2 and carbon emissions and will help \nin the reduction of demand for gasoline and thereby help lower the \nprice of gasoline. This is exactly what America wants us to do in a new \nenergy direction.\n  We should also emphasize that the underlying bill tonight also has \nprotections for consumers on price gouging and to make sure the Federal \nTrade Commission stops any manipulative practices. It also has a \nprovision that the Federal Government do its job as one of the leading \nenergy consumers in America. It says they have to use 30 percent less \nelectricity and 20 percent less fuel.\n  Now, while I would like to see the provisions the Finance Committee \npassed that literally take the incentives which have been given to the \nfossil fuel industry in the past--take those and apply those to \nrenewable technologies--we will have to wait another day for that \nbattle to occur.\n  I certainly join my colleagues in wanting to see more of our \nelectricity grid supplied with green energy technology, to incentivize \nsolar, to incentivize wind. I believe this is one of the best ways we \ncan keep our electricity costs down in the future. Right now, we are \ntoo dependent on natural gas, for which we have seen a 70-percent \nincrease in the last several years. Natural gas, which is also used in \nfertilizer as a product, is putting pressure on our electricity grid \nprices. We do not want to be just dependent on natural gas and coal for \nelectricity generation.\n  So coming back to this renewable standard and getting more of our \nnational grid to rely on clean energy is very important to help \nconsumers keep down price in the future. But those two provisions, we \nwill have to come back to. We were not able to reach agreement on \nthose.\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\n  But in this landmark legislation, we are going to give Americans more \nfor their tank of gas by passing fuel efficiency and passing the \nopportunity to fill up their gas tank with something other than fossil \nfuel. Driving down the price of fossil fuel is a great accomplishment. \nWe would not have gotten here if it was not for the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and the ranking member, Senators Inouye and Stevens, \nwho worked very hard to make sure this was bipartisan legislation, as \ndid Senator Snowe, working with Senator Feinstein, making sure this \nlegislation made it the full way through the process.\n  While this is only the Senate taking action tonight, we are clearly \nturning our country in a new direction. This is a greener energy bill \nthan the Senate has passed before but rightly so because the 2005 bill \ndid set us on a course of making sure we were investing in \nalternatives. The fact that we were putting a downpayment on those \nalternatives has led to job creation, not just in my State, Washington \nState, but throughout the country. But it is time for us to accelerate \nthat, to bring job opportunities to Americans across the country, by \nmaking sure these new technologies are implemented. We are well poised \nto do that tonight.\n  I hope my colleagues understand the significance of this new energy \ndirection. I thank all of the chairs of the various committees who have \nworked hard on a bipartisan basis--the Finance Committee, the EPW \nCommittee, the Energy Committee, the Commerce Committee, and even the \nHomeland Security Committee--in making sure our Federal Government is \nmore energy efficient. This is a great time for us to continue the \nbipartisan effort in working not just across the aisle but working with \nthe House of Representatives in making sure this energy legislation \npasses as soon as possible.\n  Again, I applaud the great work of my colleague, Senator Feinstein, \nfor her perseverance over at least 10 years in trying to close the \nloopholes that have existed in CAFE, the car efficiency standards, by \nmaking sure the loopholes for SUVs were closed. Even though she did not \nwin that battle, she persevered tonight to make sure this new \nefficiency standard, applied across the Nation, can bring real savings \nto American consumers.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Crisis in Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the last several months, I have come \nto the floor on a weekly--a regular basis--to remind my colleagues \nabout the crisis in Darfur. I would like to highlight two recent \ndevelopments. Last week, the regime in Sudan finally agreed, after \nmonths of international pressure, to accept a joint African Union-\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force for the Darfur region.\n  If my colleagues will recall, this is a region where our Government \nhas declared a genocide. We know at least 200,000 people, maybe 400,000 \npeople, have been brutally murdered, over 1 million have been \ndisplaced, and the killing and displacement, the raping and the \npillaging continues.\n  For years after the declaration of this genocide, many people around \nthe world have lamented this tragic state of affairs, but so little has \nbeen done. We have tried through the United Nations to send a \npeacekeeping force to protect innocent people from the jingaweit \nmilitia force that is killing on a wanton basis, but we have been \nunsuccessful. There has been resistance from the Sudanese Government in \nKhartoum. Unfortunately, a lot of lip service has been made, but very \nlittle attention has been paid to resolving this issue.\n  Last week the Sudanese said they would accept a joint African Union-\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force for that region. Well, the Government \nof Sudan has agreed to allow 17,000 to 19,000 troops. That is a good \nsign, or at least good words.\n  Let's not forget the Sudanese regime has agreed to similar plans in \nthe past, only to renege on its promises and allow the suffering and \nkilling to continue. It is critical at this moment in time that the \nBush administration and our allies continue to pressure the Sudanese to \ntake actions beyond their words. Darfur has been on the agenda for the \nEuropean Union summit this week, and the Chinese Government made \npositive statements as well. I encourage the Bush administration to \nkeep pressuring all of our allies and the United Nations to act.\n  Next week there is a prime opportunity. Secretary of State Rice has \njust announced plans to attend an international meeting in France that \nwill focus on the crisis in Darfur. Representatives from the Chinese \nGovernment and other places have committed to join her. I urge the Bush \nadministration to use this opportunity to ensure that the global \ncommunity continues to act on this crisis and to fully support the \nrapid and full deployment of U.N. forces to Darfur. Only a unified \nmessage from the international community will succeed in convincing the \nSudanese Government to meet its obligations. Only then will the crisis \nbegin to come to an end. This crisis must end immediately.\n  I have said on this floor many times that as a young college student, \nI found it hard to understand how the Holocaust could occur and people \nwould know of it and not try to stop it. Now I understand. This \ngenocide in Darfur was declared by our Government years ago and little \nor nothing has been done.\n  Last week, the United Nations World Food Programme did launch a \nhighly complex operation to try to bring in emergency food supplies to \nthe over 2,600 refugees from Darfur who recently crossed into the \nremote northeast corner of the Central African Republic. The Director \nof the World Food Programme and the Central African Republic, Jean-\nCharles Dei, said the following:\n\n       These people are in one of the least accessible regions in \n     the world, but they need help now. This is just the latest \n     example of how the conflict in Darfur has a destabilizing \n     effect across the region.\n\n  It is certainly positive that food is on the way to these starving \nrefugees, but the need for this airlift is symbolic of how bad the \ncrisis has become and how destabilizing the situation is becoming for \nthe whole region.\n  The United States and civilized nations around the world who \nacknowledge this genocide and this humanitarian disaster must act.\n  What can we do in the Senate? As a start, we can pass the Sudan \nDisclosure and Enforcement Act. I introduced it 2 weeks ago with \nbipartisan support, and after consultation with the Bush \nadministration. The act provides the administration and all Americans \nwith more resources and information so that we can use our investments \nas individuals and as institutions to strike a nonviolent blow for \npeace in Darfur. It creates real financial consequences for those \ncompanies that bear some complicity in the bloodshed by supporting the \nmurderous Sudanese regime of Khartoum. Most important, it requires \nmembers of the administration and the relevant congressional committees \nto meet in about 3 months' time to reassess the steps that are being \ntaken to end the crisis and decide what we should do beyond them.\n  To repeat what the bill does for the benefit of my colleagues who are \nconsidering supporting it, here is a summary.\n  First, it expresses the sense of the Congress that the international \ncommunity should continue to bring pressure against the Government of \nSudan to convince that region that the world will not allow this crisis \nto continue.\n  Second, it authorizes greater resources for the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control within the Department of Treasury to strengthen its \ncapabilities of tracking Sudanese economic activity and pursuing \nsanctions violations.\n  Third, it requires more detailed SEC disclosures by U.S.-listed \ncompanies that operate in the Sudanese petroleum sector so that \ninvestors can make informed decisions regarding divestment from these \ncompanies.\n  I might add that during the course of researching this issue, I \nlearned that my own company that I have had my family mutual fund \ninvestments with\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nfor 20 years sadly was one of the largest--it was a company with one of \nthe largest holdings in Petrochina, the Chinese oil company whose \nparent company does the most business in Sudan. I contacted this major \ncompany, asked them if they were going to change their policy, and they \nsaid no. I then removed my investments from that company. I am in the \nprocess of making sure they are all transferred to another company. It \nis a small thing, and it probably won't make a big difference to \nanyone, but I feel better that at least I am trying to do a small \npart--and I hope others will too--to ask important questions, whether \nyour brokerage house, your mutual fund has holdings in Petrochina, \nwhich is this Chinese oil company whose parent is the major oil company \nin Sudan whose revenues support this Government.\n\n  Fourth, this bill dramatically increases civil and criminal penalties \nfor violating American economic sanctions to create a true deterrent \nagainst transacting with barred Sudanese companies.\n  Fifth, it requires the administration to report on the effectiveness \nof current sanctions and recommend additional steps to Congress to end \nthe crisis.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut, \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, to send this to the President \nfor his signature.\n  I will repeat again what President Bush said in April:\n\n       You who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat \n     it is to look it in the face and not back down. It is evil we \n     are now seeing in Sudan--\n\n  President Bush said--\n\n     and we're not going to back down.\n\n  I completely agree with President Bush's remarks. The African Union \nand the United Nations forces should be on the way soon, but we still \nmust do more. Every Member of Congress and everyone interested in doing \nsomething meaningful to end this genocide must take action and not \nallow this to continue.\n  The President once said he didn't want the moral burden of this \ngenocide on his conscience, on his watch. The President's watch is \ncoming to a close. It is time for those of conscience and those who \ncare not only in our Government, but around the world, to act to spare \nthose who are victims of this genocide in Darfur.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the successful \nadoption, moments ago, of the Stevens Amendment, which I have \ncosponsored. Its incorporation into the underlying bill clears the way \nfor passage of the most significant fuel efficiency legislation the \nSenate has seriously considered in decades. If this legislation is \neventually adopted by the full Congress, it will be the first time \nsince 1975 that effective fuel efficiency legislation will have been \nenacted.\n  First of all, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Senator \nDianne Feinstein, for her unrivaled leadership on the issue of fuel \neconomy standards. We have worked together for 6 years to bolster CAFE \nstandards and her commitment and passion for implementing critical and \nlong-overdue changes has only grown. Our efforts have culminated this \nyear in the introduction of the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, which is \nthe key component of the underlying energy bill that currently sits \nbefore the Senate. All of us in this fight can be deeply appreciative \nof her voice and her tireless advocacy.\n  I also want to express my deepest appreciation to Senator Ted \nStevens, the author of this amendment, who has shown strong resolve on \nthis issue by working to forge a compromise in the face of obstacles \nthat often seemed insurmountable. I likewise want to thank and commend \nhe chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Inouye, who has been \ninstrumental both as an original cosponsor of the ``Ten in Ten'' bill \nand in deftly shepherding this bill through his committee and on the \nfloor. Both gentlemen have again demonstrated that compromise is \npossible in this body and, without their bridge building, this day \nwould not have been possible.\n  Likewise, I want to recognize the principled leadership of Senators \nLott, Carper, Alexander, Dorgan, Kerry, Cantwell, Klobuchar, Craig, all \nof whom have been critical in arriving at the consensus fuel efficiency \nlegislation which we have before us today.\n  The Senate now stands at a landmark moment. Thirty-two years have \npassed since Congress last took action on fuel economy standards, \ndating all the way back to 1975. It has been an entire generation since \nwe said that--as a Nation--we can and must do better when it comes to \nsaving fuel, saving money at the pump, and saving our environment.\n  We have a lot of catching up to do. From 1985--the last time fuel \neconomy standards were administratively increased for passenger \nvehicles--not by Congress, mind you, but administratively--oil imports \nhave increased substantially from 4.3 million barrels a day to 13.8 \nmillion barrels a day, while our efficiency standards have virtually \nbeen stagnant. Indeed, over the past 25 years, fuel economy standards \nin the ``light truck'' category have only increased by a measly 4.7 \nmiles per gallon--that's an average of two-tenths of a gallon \nimprovement every year.\n  Let me repeat that--it's taken a quarter of a century to wring a \ngrand total of an additional 4.7 miles per gallon out of light trucks--\nwhich currently include SUVs--for a current average of just 22.2 mpg. \nMeanwhile, think about this--in that same period of time since 1982, we \nhave gone from land-lines to cell phones, from record players to CDs to \nIpods, from big mainframe computers to minuscule handhelds, from \nencyclopedias to the Internet. So are we really to believe that over \nthe next 10 years we can't manage an average of 10 additional miles per \ngallon of gasoline across America's entire fleet of passenger vehicles?\n  Indeed, as a Nation built on innovation, built on the ``can-do'' \nspirit, we ought to be asking ourselves exactly how it is we couldn't \nhave done better already--never mind questioning if we can do better in \nthe future.\n  That's why Senator Feinstein and I introduced legislation 6 years ago \nto close the SUV loophole, whereby SUVs were exempt from increased fuel \nefficiency requirements because they were classified as light trucks. \nIt's also the reason we introduced this year a bipartisan measure to \nraise the average fuel economy standards for all vehicles, including \nSUVs, from a combined 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by \nmodel year 2020.\n  As I will explain more in-depth, this legislation was carefully \ncrafted to reflect not what we wish we could achieve, but what we know \nwe can actually achieve. And I'm pleased that mandate was embraced and \npassed in the Senate Commerce Committee; now, it is vital that this \nprovision in the underlying bill be preserved.\n  Now, we have heard mischaracterizations of this measure--there have \nbeen omissions when it comes to describing this bill from those who \noppose this measure--so let me just begin by stating plainly what this \nbill will do. Let me repeat, it requires that the average fuel economy \nstandard for all vehicles under 8,500 pounds reach 35 miles per gallon \nby model year 2020. This bill has no such requirement for vehicles over \n8,500 pounds.\n  With respect to those vehicles, we allow the Secretary of EPA and \nEnergy to determine an appropriate fuel efficiency improvement program. \nAgain, there are no specific mandates for vehicles over 8,500 pounds--\njust a direction that the standards are set at the maximum feasible \nlevel--we assign no numerical goal.\n  Furthermore, we preserve the separate standard for fuel efficiency or \nthe existing light truck category until 2011--recognizing that our \nmanufacturers already have these vehicles in the works for the next \nthree model years and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, \nfor them to reengineer those vehicles at this juncture.\n  After 2011, there will no longer be separate categories for light \ntrucks and passenger vehicles, as the legislation switches to a fleet-\nwide standard based\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\non vehicle attributes such as weight, as I just described. The world \nhas already adopted this system because it is the most efficient \nframework. In fact, Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea have all \nestablished an attribute-based system that is either based on size of \nthe engine or the weight of the vehicle. Now, the U.S. Congress must \nexpand the framework of our attribute-based system to a structure that \ndoes not distinguish between passenger cars and light trucks but that \ndoes create an efficient and logical system.\n  And let me emphasize, this is a change that automakers themselves \nhave sought, because it provides them greater flexibility and choices \nacross product lines to achieve the overall goal of a fleet-wide fuel \nefficiency standard.\n  And let me elaborate on that point. Not only will manufacturers no \nlonger have to contend with specific CAFE targets for specific vehicle \nsegments, they won't even have to meet a specific target for their \nspecific company. So how do we achieve the goal? That will be up to \nNHTSA to determine--not Congress--which is yet another change that the \nauto industry has sought.\n  In other words, the industry has asked that the arbitrary and \nartificial lines between vehicle categories be eliminated; this bill \ndoes so. Even the alternative amendment filed by my friend and \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Arkansas, also incorporates our \n``attribute-based'' approach precisely because that's what the industry \nis seeking. The industry has also asked that the experts--and not \nCongress--determine specifically how fuel economy standards are met, \nand by placing those decisions in the hands of NHTSA this bill does so \non that score as well.\n  The bottom line is, our bill provides our car companies with the \nflexibility they require. It doesn't place a mandate on vehicles over \n8,500 pounds. It absolutely will not mean the end of light trucks. That \nis a red herring, Mr. President, and as I will detail in a few moments, \nthe experts tell us that an additional 10 miles per gallon in 10 years \nover the entire American fleet of passenger vehicles is achievable.\n  Of course, there are some who argue that Congress shouldn't even be \nin the business of setting these fuel economy requirements. Well, first \nof all, let's look back at what happened the last time Congress became \ninvolved.\n  In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, Congress delivered a long-term \nsignificant increase in CAFE standards, which the New York Times has \nlabeled as the most successful energy-saving measure this country has \never seen. The congressional challenge in 1975 worked to reduce our \nNation's demand for energy. Does anyone seriously believe that the fuel \neconomy for America's vehicles would have improved by 40 percent from \n1978 to 1985--just a seven year period--if Congress hadn't stepped in? \nAnd just imagine where we'd be today if our energy independence efforts \nhadn't been dormant for the past 22 years.\n  Moreover, there should be no question of the critical national \nsecurity component to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Every \nday, we import 2.1 million barrels of oil from the Persian Gulf. Every \nday, our rising gas prices shift billions of dollars from the American \nconsumer to authoritarian governments in some of the most volatile \nregions of the world. Reflecting the critical involvement of energy \nsecurity in our national security, an organization called the Energy \nSecurity Leadership Council has formed in an effort to advance a \nfundamental shift of our national energy policy.\n  The Energy Security Leadership Council is a nonpartisan organization \nthat aims to build bipartisan support for policies to reduce our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil and improve our energy security. The \nCouncil is cochaired by Frederick W. Smith, chairman, president, and \nCEO of FedEx Corporation, and Retired General P.X. Kelley, the 8th \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Membership consists of \ngenerals, admirals, and a former Secretary of the Navy. These are \nprominent, experienced, and highly credible leaders who understand the \nconsequences of a reliance of foreign oil. The Energy Security \nLeadership Council has recommended for increasing fuel economy \nstandards, and has endorsed this bill before us. They understand that \nour Nation must finally curtail our energy demand from these volatile \nregions.\n\n  Mr. Smith testified just last week before the Senate Small Business \nCommittee on the impact of rising gas prices. Noting that most oil \nshipments pass through a handful of maritime chokepoints such as the \nSuez Canal and the Strait of Hormuz, Mr. Smith observed that ``a mere 4 \npercent shortfall in global daily oil supplies could push the price of \noil to more than $120 per barrel.'' What's the solution? According to \nthe Energy Security Leadership Council, it is the bill before us today. \nMr. Smith testified that ``the Senate has made great strides . . . \nthrough bipartisan support for'' the Ten-in-Ten bill. Mr. Smith further \napplauded our bill's use of an attribute-based system, noting that \n``[t]his focus on attributes will also ensure that Americans will still \nbe able to purchase different types of vehicles that cater to different \ntransportation needs.'' He concluded, ``This is truly path-breaking \nlegislation that merits broad support.''\n  Similarly, General Kelly has recently articulated, ``Current events \nonly serve to confirm the unacceptable security risks created by our \nextraordinary level of oil dependence. Significantly, reducing the \nprojected growth in U.S. oil consumption must become a compelling \nnational priority.'' We ought to heed General Kelly's assessment and \nprotect American security. I ask my colleagues, since when should \nCongress excuse itself from issues of vital national security?\n  As the 2002 National Academy of Sciences report stated, the trade-\noffs on these vital matters ``rightly reside with elected officials''. \nFurthermore, they also conclude that it is ``appropriate for the \nFederal Government to ensure fuel economy levels beyond those expected \nto result from market forces alone.'' So we ought to get beyond the \nquestion of the proper role for Congress in this debate. We have an \nindispensable and undeniable role to play.\n  Now, there are some who are concerned that we will inadvertently \nlimit consumer choice, and let me say emphatically that we address \nthose concerns.\n  From 1978 to 1985 vehicles did not disappear from the road and during \nthat period we witnessed a 40 percent increase in fuel economy. In \nfact, I would argue the American consumer finally had the opportunity \nto purchase the more fuel efficient cars they wish they had years \nearlier.\n  But most importantly, let me reiterate this bill before the Senate \ndoes not mandate a certain fuel economy for any specific type of \nvehicle. Rather, it ensures that all of America's vehicles improve, in \nthe aggregate, to the 35 mile per gallon standard while leaving the \nspecifics on how to attain that requirement to the experts at the \nDepartment of Transportation and, specifically, the National Highway \nand Traffic Safety Administration. As a result, the engineers and \neconomists at NHTSA are empowered to ensure that we accomplish the oil \nsavings in the most efficient mechanism. And what does this mean for \nconsumer choice?\n  Because the bill doesn't mandate particular fuel economy targets for \nany specific category of passenger vehicle, there is greater \nflexibility in how the 35 mpg mandate can be reached. For example, the \nSecretary of Transportation may decide that pick-up trucks can't \nrealistically achieve any substantial gains, but other segments have \nthat capacity. Manufacturers will have greater latitude in how they \ncontribute to the attainment of the overall target of 35 mpg. So this \nbill will not remove any vehicles from the road, but it will abate the \nsting at the pump.\n  Our approach in this bill also addresses another concern we share--\nthat increased fuel efficiency doesn't translate to unaffordable \nsticker prices on America's new vehicles. Figuring in the cost-savings \nbased on $1.50 per gallon of gas, the 2002 NAS study outlined that any \ninitial cost in additional technology that saves gasoline would be \nrecovered over the life of the vehicle.\n  Of course, with fuel costs now more than double that amount, it's \nlogical to assume the savings on fuel costs of more efficient vehicles \nwill be even greater. In fact, even at $2.00 per gallon, the net \nconsumer savings would be $20 billion in 2020. In short, as the \nCongressional Research Service summarizes the NAS report, it \n``concluded\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\nthat it was possible to achieve more than a 40 percent improvement in \nlight truck and SUV fuel economy over a 10 to 15 year period at costs \nthat would be recoverable over the lifetime of ownership.''\n  If there's any doubt about the importance of this, just take a look \nat the example of the impact of fuel economy--or the current lack \nthereof--on Pottle Transportation, based in Bangor, ME.\n  Owner Barry Pottle stated this past year that their fuel economy has \ndrifted from between 4 miles per gallon to 7 miles per gallon in the 25 \nyears that he has led his company. I have a chart which indicates the \ngallons of consumption over a year for one vehicle and the \ncorresponding cost as a result of current diesel prices. The aggregate \ncost over a year just for an increase of 2 miles per gallon is a \nstaggering $20,000 for each truck. This bill will finally consider \nthese heavy trucks in the fuel economy framework for the very first \ntime in history. As indicated from Pottle Transportation, it is \nperfectly clear that these fuel economy increases will result in \nsubstantial dividends for America's small businesses.\n  The fact is that the current system does not provide fuel efficient \nvehicles on the market for large commercial and heavy duty trucks \ngreater than 8,500 pounds. Just last week before the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, Janet Myhre of Chuckals a company that distributes \noffice products, stated that ``fuel cost impact each and every \ntransaction that our organization manages and is the third largest \nexpense item on our financial statement.''\n  Ms. Myhre was then asked if the company had considered switching to \nmore efficient vehicles or alternative vehicles for their delivery \ntrucks to minimize fuel costs. Ms. Myhre responded that Chuckals had \ninvestigated the market and found that there were ``no commercial \noptions'' available for these vehicles. The market has not provided \ncompanies with the options of utilizing fuel efficient vehicles and for \nthe sake of our Nation's small businesses, this Congress must begin to \nincrease standards for vehicles over 8,500 pounds.\n  Still others have argued that this bill would place our domestic \nautomobile manufacturers at an unacceptable disadvantage, but that is \nsimply not the case it would be regrettable to view this debate in \nterms of fuel efficiency versus the future of our auto industry. When \ndid energy independence and the strength of our domestic companies \nbecome mutually exclusive?\n  For those who say our proposal is unrealistic and unreachable, the \nNational Academy of Sciences reported 5 years ago that it is feasible \nto reach a 40 percent increase in fuel economy in 15 years--and that is \nwith existing technology. Relatively simple improvements such as hybrid \ntechnologies, variable valve engines, high strength steel and aluminum, \nand continuously variable transmissions are all advancements the \nexperts say could be implemented now.\n  So do we really want to argue we don't have the technological \nwherewithal to make our vehicles travel more miles per gallon? Is it \nreally the American Way to say, ``We can't do that?'' To the contrary, \nwe should have already witnessed progress in these areas. If we had, \nperhaps our auto makers would be in better financial shape today. In \nfact, I certainly wish it were an American automaker who had recently \nannounced surpassing the one million mark in sales of hybrids. In fact, \nin 2006, Toyota's Prius was the company's third best-selling passenger \ncar. So someone out there must want to buy more efficient vehicles. \nTalk about providing consumer choice, if anything consumers will have \nmore choices for more cost-effective cars and SUVs and light trucks.\n  Indeed, there are auto company business models that have demonstrated \nthat consumers value fuel economy. In testimony before the House Energy \nand Commerce's Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality on March 14 of \nthis year, Toyota's North American president, James Press, remarked, \n``2007 marks the 10th year of the Prius, our first hybrid. I am happy \nto say the introduction of Prius was a sound business decision.''\n  Furthermore, let me reiterate, we do not mandate any fuel economy \nincrease for any specific model or any specific car company. Rather, we \ncrafted the legislation so that the entirety of America's passenger \nfleet--cars, light trucks, and SUVs--must increase from an average of \n25.2 miles per gallon now to an average of 35 miles per gallon by the \nyear 2020. What we don't mandate is how exactly we get there.\n  Right now, each company is required to meet a corporate average fuel \neconomy. Currently those standards are 22.2 miles per gallon for light \ntrucks and 27.5 for passenger vehicles. However, the problem with fuel \neconomy standards does not reside in one company; it exists throughout \nthe entire transportation sector. As a result, we initiated a fleet-\nwide solution rather than a piece-meal, company-by-company approach. In \nfact, the corporate average fuel economy standard actually ceases to \nexist under this bill; rather, it focuses results for the entire \nindustry--a fleet wide average as opposed to a corporate average. This \nis a much broader and more flexible framework that will help domestic \nautomakers.\n\n  Indeed, some opponents have maintained that any legislation must not \nbe ``discriminatory against our companies,'' and that the ``numbers \nshould be set. . .by experts who understand what can and cannot be done \nfrom a technology standpoint.'' Well, we couldn't agree more--and, once \nagain, this is exactly what our initiative accomplishes by leaving the \ndetails to the experts at NHTSA.\n  Our bill ensures that NHTSA will establish a mathematical function \nthat alters fuel economy requirements based on attributes, like weight. \nBecause I agree that companies that focus on larger vehicles should not \nbe unfairly punished, we have provided maximum latitude to preserve our \ndomestic manufacturers, foster consumer choice, and improve fuel \neconomy.\n  The bottom line is, this measure navigates the narrow waters between \ndoing less than we should, and more than we realistically can. In \ncontrast, the amendment advanced by opponents of this legislation would \nonly raise standards to an estimated fleetwide average of 30.6 by 2020. \nFurthermore, their proposal retains rigid categories for cars and light \ntrucks and assigns different efficiency targets for each--36 miles per \ngallon by 2022 for cars, and 30 miles per gallon by 2025 for trucks. \nBut if you calculate for the entire U.S. fleet overall, accounting for \nthe number of vehicles in each category estimated to be on the road at \nthat time, you arrive at 30.6 miles per gallon by 2020 under this \namendment.\n  In other words, the proposal advanced by my colleague from Arkansas \nis a 5 mpg increase in 10 years, while our proposal is 10 miles per \ngallon in 10 years. And at the end of the day, the amendment would \nsave, at best, merely 400,000 barrels of oil a day in 2020--accounting \nfor just 3 percent of our daily import of oil--a mere drop in the \nbucket. So the ramifications between the proposals are significant, \nwith ours saving 1.3 million barrels each day by 2020. Furthermore, in \nroughly 2023 this bill will save 2.1 million barrels of oil each day--\nthe equivalent to what we are currently importing from the Persian \nGulf.\n  Mr. President. This is clearly not a time for timidity. The current \ngas prices in Presque Isle, ME, right now is $3.13; in Arkansas, $2.99; \nin North Dakota, $3.14. These prices have and are continuing to raise \ntransportation costs and the price of goods and services. Lower-income \nfamilies and small businesses are financially strained beyond their \ncapacity. It's been estimated that every time oil prices increase 10 \npercent, 150,000 Americans lose their job.\n  And the critical relevance to our environment is unambiguous, with \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this year \ndispelling any doubt about the reality of human induced climate change, \nand the reality that while the U.S. represents 4.6 percent of the \nworld's population, we emit 23 percent of the planet's CO2. \nOur legislation would remove 358 million metric tons of global warming \nemissions in 2025 alone. This is nearly the same amount that India's \nentire economy current emits. As the Washington Post stated just \nyesterday in advocating for this bill, ``There's a climate crisis \nbrewing, and the transportation sector, which accounts for 33 percent \nof global warming pollution, must do its part to combat.''\n  Mr. President, shouldn't we be leaving a better legacy than that?\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\nShouldn't we be striving to challenge and harness the innovative and \nentrepreneurial spirit that built America to the greatest extent \npossible, rather than settling for less? Just look at where our Nation \nhas come with cell phones. This technological revolution has occurred, \nwhile our fuel economy standards have stagnated. We can do better. The \nunderlying bill does do better while providing an achievable solution.\n  I applaud today's result and look forward to continuing to push for \nfull adoption of this legislation into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the compromise \namendment that has been offered by Senator Stevens. I appreciate the \nhard work and the long hours expended by the proponents of this \namendment to craft an approach that bridges the significant differences \non this issue. I commend all who were involved for their good work, \ntheir diligent work.\n  This amendment is a good start, and I intend to support it. I also \nbelieve we can and should do more to improve the fuel efficiency of our \ncars and our trucks. With this bill, we have a great opportunity to \nfinally end a 20-year stalemate and accomplish something that will \nbenefit all of us--require our cars to go further on a tank of gas. \nThis is the moment. The window is open, and I believe a bold approach \nis needed to achieve a major reduction in our Nation's dependence on \nforeign oil and the emission of greenhouse gases. A bold approach is \nwhat made all of the difference almost three decades ago when Congress \nfirst established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, program. \nAt the time, auto executives protested, much as they protest today, \nsaying there is no way to increase fuel economy without making cars \nsmaller. One company predicted Americans would all be driving \nsubcompact cars as a result of CAFE. Anyone can see today that some of \nour SUVs are the size of about three or four subcompacts put together.\n  The fact is, CAFE worked. It nearly doubled the average gas mileage \nof cars from 14 miles per gallon in 1976 to 27.5 miles per gallon in \n1985. The increase in fuel economy saves us almost 3 million barrels of \noil per day and prevents the emission of over 1 million tons of carbon \ndioxide per day.\n  But our oil dependence has only gotten worse, and that is why we need \na major improvement in fuel economy standards. Americans are now paying \nmore than $3 a gallon for gas. We are importing 60 percent of our oil, \nmuch of it from the Middle East. Osama bin Laden has identified this \ndependence as a weakness, urging his supporters to ``focus your \noperations on oil, especially in Iraq and the gulf area, since this \nwill cause [the Americans] to die off.''\n  The environmental effects of our oil dependence are also severe. The \noil used in transportation accounts for a third of our Nation's \nemissions of greenhouse gases. Just in the last few months, we heard \nfrom a panel of top climate change experts from around the world that \nglobal warming is a certainty and that most of the temperature increase \nis likely due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations.\n  All this, and yet the CAFE standards have not changed in 20 years. \nThis deadlock deepens our dependence on foreign oil and impedes our \nefforts to address global climate change. Since 1985, efforts to raise \nthe CAFE standards have been blocked by opponents who argued Congress \ndoes not possess the expertise to set specific benchmarks and that an \ninflexible congressional mandate would result in a sacrifice of safety.\n  I am confident we could achieve higher fuel efficiency standards, and \nwe could do this in a cost-effective manner without sacrificing safety. \nAccording to a recent report by the International Council on Clean \nTransportation, technologies exist today that can improve light-duty \nvehicle fuel economy by up to 50 percent over the next 10 years without \nany sacrifice in safety, through improvements in engines, \ntransmissions, aerodynamics, and tires. Fuel savings would be more than \nenough to cover the cost of these improvements when gas is at $3 per \ngallon.\n  Last year, I first joined with Senators Lugar, Biden, Smith, \nBingaman, Harkin, Coleman, and Durbin to introduce the Fuel Economy \nReform Act. This bill set a new course by establishing regular, \ncontinual, and incremental progress on fuel economy standards, \ntargeting a 4-percent annual increase but preserving some flexibility \nfor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine how \nto meet those targets.\n  I also believe we should look for ways to help automakers meet higher \nCAFE standards. The Health Care for Hybrids Act that I introduced is an \nexample of how we can offer constructive assistance. This bill would \nestablish a voluntary program in which automakers could choose to \nreceive Federal financial assistance toward their retiree health care \ncosts in return for investing the savings into developing fuel-\nefficient vehicles. This proposal could jump-start the industry's \nefforts to develop new technology, improve the competitiveness of U.S. \nautomakers in the growing market for hybrid vehicles, and help auto \nworkers to get the health care they have been promised.\n  Today's agreement makes long overdue progress on weaning America off \nour dependence on foreign oil and fighting climate change. It is an \nimportant step forward but bolder action will be necessary if we want \nto solve the dual problem facing our country.\n  I will support this bill and this increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards.\n  Again, I commend all those who have worked so diligently to move this \namendment forward. I do have to say, though, that I regret we have \nmissed an opportunity to do more today. I will continue to work in the \nmonths to come to see if we can make some further progress on this \nfront.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the floor on two very \nimportant issues, issues that really do go to the heart of the kind of \neconomy and future that our Nation will have. One is the Employee Free \nChoice Act, which we will be voting on in the next day or two, and the \nother is the very important Energy bill that we have been debating.\n  With respect to the Employee Free Choice Act, for me, this is about \npreserving, supporting, and growing the American middle class. The \nmiddle class is the backbone of the American economy, and our unions \nare the backbone of the American middle class. It is time we passed \ninto law the Employee Free Choice Act to give unions a level playing \nfield so they can organize for fair wages, safe working conditions, and \nthe hard-won rights and responsibilities that American workers demand \nand deserve.\n  This is a moment of profound challenge for our country. There is a \ndeep sense of concern that I have certainly heard and listened to as I \nhave traveled throughout America. Americans know they cannot win in the \nglobal economy unless the middle class wins, but there is a feeling \nthat some people are betting against the American middle class. Some \npeople have assumed that in a global economy one of the changes that \nwill have to be made is that the middle class will have to shrink; that \ninequity is inevitable; that globalization is a harsh phenomenon that \nwe have to accept. Well, I do not, and our families are right to be \nconcerned.\n  In 2005 all income gains went to the top 10 percent of households. \nThe vast majority of people--the other 90 percent--saw their incomes \ndecline. Health care costs are up, gas prices are\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\nup, the cost of college is up, and for 6 straight years worker \nproductivity, which means how hard people work--because American \nworkers are the hardest working people in the world--has gone up. But \nwages have either been stagnant or falling. 2005 was the first year \nsince the Great Depression that average personal savings were negative \nfor a whole year. There is a sense that we are losing something in \nAmerica; that basic bargain that allowed our country to succeed: if you \nwork hard, you and your family can reach the middle class. You can have \nthat American dream.\n  So it is not surprising that we are seeing the weakening of the \nAmerican middle class at the same time we see unions under assault. In \nthe early years of the National Labor Relations Act, the majority sign-\nup procedure was the presumptively valid way in which employees could \nchoose a union. Over the years, however, culminating in the 1960s, a \nnumber of decisions shifted us to a new regime, a regime where \nemployers can choose to require their employees to vote for unions \nthrough a one-sided election process, dominated by employers, in order \nto secure collective bargaining rights. Some employers even began to \nmake efforts to push unions out of the workplace.\n  Just consider these comparative facts: In the 1950s, companies \nillegally fired or punished during organizing campaigns, or they \notherwise violated National Labor Relations Act rights, fewer than \n1,000 employees. The number increased to 6,000 workers in 1969. And \nnow, today, it is 31,000 workers who have been illegally fired or \notherwise punished for wanting to exercise a fundamental right, one \nthat we believe people should be able to exercise not only here in our \ncountry but around the world. As the number of labor violations have \nincreased, we have seen it become harder and harder for workers to \norganize.\n  In 1956, unions represented 35 percent of the private workforce. The \nnumber today is only 7 percent. Our middle class, which unions helped \nto build in the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s is suffering \nas a result. Studies show that the decline in union membership has been \nresponsible for at least 20 percent of the rise in income inequality \nover the last three decades. I think it is probably much more than \nthat, but that is what we can quantify.\n  It is time, therefore, that we modernize labor laws that are stacked \nagainst working people and stacked against their right to unionize. \nRight now, employers have unlimited access to employees in one-sided \nunion representation elections. Employers are given every opportunity \nto dissuade workers in mandatory one-to-one meetings. They can delay \nvotes for years. There are no fines or penalties or sanctions if an \nemployer illegally fires or discriminates against a worker for \ncollective bargaining.\n  At most, the worker is reinstated with backpay, an award that is, on \naverage, so small that many employers regard it as a cost of doing \nbusiness. Finally, 32 percent of workers who choose to unionize, still \ndo not have a contract after a year of making that choice.\n  The system is broken. It is not only our collective bargaining and \nunionization system, it is our economy as it affects our middle class. \nOur country needs reforms that will bring balance to our labor laws, \nand our workers need the opportunity to unite with their coworkers to \nobtain the protections and benefits of America's labor movement.\n  Union wages are 20 percent higher than nonunion wages. Union members \nare almost twice as likely to be covered by health insurance and to \nparticipate in employer-provided retirement plans.\n  Unions improve safety conditions. For example, deaths in nonunion \nmines are almost twice as likely as deaths in mines where the workers \nare union members.\n  Unions certainly provide opportunities for women and minorities. \nWomen in unions earn an extra $179 per week. African Americans in \nunions earn an extra $187 per week. Latinos in unions earn an extra \n$217 per week. Nonunion employees benefit from the efforts of the \nunions to seek benefits and protections. That is why it is so important \nwe pass the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  It is long past time to enact real financial penalties against those \nemployers who illegally fire or retaliate against workers during an \norganizing campaign. It is long past time to allow employees to decide \nif they want to use majority sign-up to organize.\n  Finally, it is long past time to allow either employers or employees \nto request mediation if they are unable to negotiate a contract after \n90 days of collective bargaining.\n  These changes will finally give employers an incentive to bargain in \ngood faith and to avoid situations where years, and even decades, can \npass without a bargaining agreement.\n  I believe in the basic bargain. I believe that unions help keep that \nbargain for America's working people. I hope this Congress will uphold \nits end of that basic bargain; that this Congress will pass the \nEmployee Free Choice Act; that the Senate will join the House, which \nhas done so, to give employees the real, fair chance to garner the \nprotections and benefits of unions and to give unions the opportunity \nto help bring workers into the middle class.\n  That is part of the equation; to respect and protect the rights of \nthose in the workplace and to give them the opportunity to unionize. \nThe other part of the equation is to have good jobs, good jobs with \nrising incomes. We need a source of new, good jobs in America. That is \nwhy this Energy bill is so important. Much of the debate about the \nEnergy bill has been, rightly so, about the need to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil--which I agree with 100 percent; the need to \nbegin, finally, to address seriously global warming--which I think is \nway overdue.\n  But there has not been enough talk about why this Energy bill is \ncritical to the economy of the United States in the way it will help to \ncreate millions of new jobs. As the Presiding Officer knows, he and I \noffered an amendment, which we are pleased the managers accepted, to \nprovide incentives for training and equipping and preparing the \nworkforce to do what are called green-collar jobs. These are jobs that \ncan't be outsourced, by and large. If we finally get serious--and I \nhope we will get back to visit some of the financial incentives that \nneed to be in this bill that unfortunately we were unable to include--\nwe will begin to join other countries that have gotten smart about \nthis.\n  Germany gets a lot of its electricity now generated by solar--you \nknow, panels on the roofs of residences and offices. The last time I \nchecked, Germany was not a tropical climate, but they have taken \nadvantage of government-incentives to move the market toward using \nsolar.\n  Denmark is also moving toward more wind energy. The United Kingdom, \nwhich went into Kyoto when our country left it, has created tens of \nthousands of new jobs weatherizing homes, installing new energy \ntechnology such as solar, such as wind. We could do this many times \nover. We believe we could create millions of new, good-paying jobs for \nhard-working Americans.\n  Every so often we have to regenerate our job creation in America. \nDuring the 1990s, we had a lot of new jobs that were related to telecom \nand information technology. We saw the creation of 22 million new jobs \nbetween 1993 and 2001. We saw more people lifted out of poverty than at \nany time in our country's history. We saw shared prosperity--not what \nwe are seeing today, where the bulk of the benefits go to a very small \nsliver of us.\n  This Energy bill is about jobs, it is about creating new, good-paying \njobs for hard-working Americans. What I am looking at when I think of \nthe Employee Free Choice Act and when I think of this Energy bill is \nhow we get back into balance, how we get back to where the economy \nworks for everybody, where the market is not stacked against those who \nare not already privileged, where unions can once again be a vehicle \nfor people moving into and staying in the middle class and, comparably, \nwhere we can have a new source of jobs.\n  We also have to recognize how we have to look at the jobs that are \nalready in the economy and how the Energy bill will affect them. I am \nhopeful we will think seriously about lifting the health care costs off \na lot of our labor-intensive, energy-intensive, capital-intensive \nindustries in America, such as the automobile industry, because \nlaboring under the costs of\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nhealth care is an uncompetitive position for them in the global \neconomy.\n  There is a lot to be done. I wish to be sure that as we look at the \neconomy and begin to try to get it back into that balance that works \nbest for America, that we vote for the Employee Free Choice Act, which \nis a way of giving employees the choice to have a better life for \nthemselves and their families. There is a lot to be done in our \ncountry. I am very optimistic we can begin tackling our challenges. But \nso much of what we have to do to create the framework for our people to \nhave that better future has to come from this Chamber.\n  Let's look at the future together. Let's make decisions that will \ngive the tools to our people to show they are the best workers and the \nmost competitive and productive people in the world, to unleash that \ndynamism in the American economy, and to demonstrate clearly that we \nstand with the American middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in this body we are on the brink of \nsomething that is momentous, and that is significant energy legislation \nto reduce our dependence on foreign fuels. The bill before us will \nbreak new ground. We will have fuel efficiency standards increased for \nthe first time since 1975. This is the result of compromise, of \nprincipled compromise that advances the cause of reducing our \ndependence on foreign fuel.\n  Last year I introduced the BOLD act, Breaking Our Long-term \nDependence. That was perhaps the most comprehensive energy legislation \nintroduced in this body all last year. It had many provisions, many \nprovisions to encourage further development of ethanol and biodiesel \nand wind energy and solar energy--all the renewables. But more than \nthat, it had provisions to expand domestic production of oil and gas in \na responsible way; also providing clean coal incentives because, after \nall, over 50 percent of our electricity in this country comes from \ncoal. That is not going to fundamentally change anytime soon. So we \nhave to take measures to increase the environmentally friendly aspects \nof coal usage and to improve our ability to produce and use that \nresource in a clean way.\n  While I am delighted we are on the brink of passing something \nsignificant and the beginning of something that could be much bigger, I \nam very disappointed the provisions that passed the Senate Finance \nCommittee on an overwhelming bipartisan vote did not get the 60 votes \nrequired to advance. Those provisions would have also taken us in a new \ndirection, and they contained many of the provisions contained in the \nBOLD Act that I introduced last year.\n  Those provisions shifted our incentives away from fossil fuels \nbecause, with the high price of fossil fuels, incentives aren't \nrequired there. Instead, we took money that had previously gone to \nfossil fuels and shifted the funds to renewables and conservation--\nagain, in a vote that passed on a bipartisan basis, a very strong vote \nout of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Let me say there are some who have argued it costs too much money to \nhave those incentives for renewables and for conservation. It is true, \nthat bill costs $28.6 billion over the next 10 years--$28.6 billion \nover the next 10 years. But we are going to spend, over that same \nperiod, $3,000 billion on imported oil. In fact, that is probably a \nlow-side estimate because last year alone we spent over $270 billion \nimporting foreign oil, much of it from the least stable parts of the \nworld.\n  Yes, $28 billion is a lot of money over 10 years. But $3,000 billion \non imported oil dwarfs it. It is over 100 times as much. Isn't it a \ngood investment to spend 1 percent of what we are going to spend \nimporting foreign oil to develop our own resources in this country? How \nmuch better would it be for a President of the United States, instead \nof depending on the Middle East, to be able to look to the Midwest of \nthis country to help grow our way out of this crisis by using ethanol \nand biodiesel? Instead of sending $270 billion to places that are \nunfavorable to us, to spend $270 billion right here in America--how \ndifferent would our country look if that money, instead of going \nabroad, was staying at home?\n  No one should think we are not going to have another possibility on \nthe legislation that came out of the Finance Committee. There will be \nanother opportunity. We will have a chance in the House of \nRepresentatives, in the conference committee, to add back those \nprovisions that passed on a strong majority vote, not only in the \nFinance Committee but on the floor of the Senate.\n  We didn't have a supermajority, we didn't have the 60 votes. We had \n57. Of course the leader changed his vote to be on the prevailing side \nso he could move to reconsider. We are missing another Senator because \nof a family obligation and, of course, we are missing our colleague, \nSenator Johnson, because of his illness. But Senator Johnson will be \nback, and the Senator who was missing because of a family obligation \nwill be back. And Senator Reid will switch his vote. Then we will have \nthe 60 votes necessary.\n  No one should be under any illusion that we are not going to take \nthis opportunity to strengthen our country and to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil because we will have that additional opportunity and the \nvotes will be here and we will have a comprehensive energy package to \ntake to the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder, while the Senator is still \nstanding, if I could ask him a question. I was standing someplace where \nI caught an echo on your last 2 or 3 minutes. Could you maybe repeat \nit, because it hit my ear wrong. I did not quite get it. What did you \ntalk about when it went to the House and came back and what?\n  Mr. CONRAD. What I am saying is there will be another opportunity to \nvote on the package that came out of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When is that? When you come back from the House?\n  Mr. CONRAD. When we come back from conference committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The same people who voted here will vote again then, \nwill they not? Are you expecting some Senators to leave in the meantime \nfrom this side?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. It is unfortunate the Senator did not hear my \nremarks. I made it very clear in the remarks what I think will happen. \nWe were missing one Senator because of a family obligation, missing \nanother Senator because of illness. Senator Reid, of course, changed \nhis vote to be on the prevailing side. That will provide the 60 votes \nrequired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think with the passage of time, I say to my colleague \nand friend, we will have more votes as people think about the \nconsequences of the failure to get a stronger package; that there is \ntime now to work out an agreement to add votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see. Well, it would be good if you would add to that \nthere might be a little opportunity to work together on that, too, you \nknow. If you get a few people a little anxious, you might find you \ncould not get cloture again. That could happen.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It could. I prefer to be an optimist. I prefer to think \nof the extraordinary vote we had out of the Finance Committee, a \nbipartisan vote, very strong, and the fact that we have more than a \nmajority here with votes missing. Those votes are going to come back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I hope. I believe before this year is out, we will have a \nchance to have a more comprehensive package than the one we will be \nable to move on this floor in the next several days. I believe it will \nbe a package that will enjoy strong bipartisan support, just as the \npackage did that came out of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, you are inviting some of us not to approve \nanything tonight, to have another cloture, and you have nothing going \nto conference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that would be a tragedy for the Nation, and those \nwho\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nwould engage in that tactic, I think, would pay the consequences.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you know, you and I have been here long enough \nthat we go through these tragedies every now and then. But they get \nworked out. Then as long as you do not try to defy reality--there were \na lot of people who didn't want this to happen; a lot of people did. \nThat is the Senate. Now we will see.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the great thing about our country. Some people do \nnot want to advance on the question of reducing our dependence; some \nwant to stay stuck where we have been; others want to move forward. I \nbelieve those who want to move forward are ultimately going to prevail.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So do I.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is a good thing for this country. I welcome this \ndebate, because I think the American people think it is long overdue \nthat we make this advance, and it is to the credit of this body that we \nare prepared to move forward tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, there is no doubt in my mind we are going to move \nahead. We have had some terrific movement ahead in the past 3\\1/2\\, 4 \nyears. Some of us who are questioning how you think it is going to \nhappen have been part of that over the last couple of years. We are \nnot--nobody is going to sit here and say: There is one way, only one \ngroup of Senators knows how to do this. We did our share in this pretty \ngood bill you voted for a couple of years ago. Had we implemented the \nprovisions of that with financing that went with it, we would already \nbe a long way toward the development of both supply and conservation; \nsupply of the type you want, and supply of the type some others want. \nWe would already have that going. Instead, we do not, because we \nhaven't financed it. We should have. You were with us on the financing. \nIt should have happened.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague and my friend, I was proud to \nsupport that bill. I was proud of the leadership shown by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico on that legislation. I am proud of the leadership shown \nby the Senators from New Mexico on this bill. I just think, at the end \nof the day, we are going to have even stronger legislation before we \ncomplete our work this year. That was the point I was making in my \nearlier remarks. Look, we all know the genius of this body is that \nthere are those who agree and those who disagree; those who favor, \nthose who oppose. Tonight we can celebrate together. We are making \nprogress. That is important for the country, but more needs to be done.\n\n  I don't think any Senator would leave here tonight saying this \nlegislation alone is all we can do. We can do more this year, and we \nshould.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I oftentimes laugh. It is either Iowa, or \nOhio, or Idaho. The other side of that equation with the late Craig \nThomas, I am Larry Craig, Craig Thomas. His wife is Susan, my wife is \nSuzanne. It was not at all unusual that sometimes we would get mixed \nup. People would come to my office looking for Craig Thomas, and would \nfind out they needed to be on the other side of a mountain range and \nout across a rather wide expanse of land toward Casper, Wyoming, \ninstead of Boise, Idaho.\n  But I understand. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I will be brief. We are very close, I believe, toward the final \npassage of an energy bill that many of us have spent a good deal of \ntime with.\n  I want to thank a few folks who have spent a lot more time with this \nissue than I or than the principals on it. Cory McDaniel on my staff, \nlegislative LA for energy, who has spent a great deal of time over the \nlast good many months as we have fashioned the SAFE Act, as we have \nfashioned a clean portfolio standard versus a renewable portfolio \nstandard, I thank Cory for that effort.\n  I also thank Frank Macciarola, the minority staff director, and Bob \nSimon, the majority staff director. We worked closely with them as we \nhave worked our way through this issue. Sam Fowler, counsel for the \nmajority, and Judy Pensabene, minority counsel, have all been very \nhelpful.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Dorgan and his staff. Franz \nWuerfmannsdobler and Nate Hill on his staff have been very helpful; \nalso Colin Jones, a fellow from the National Lab in Idaho on my staff, \nand Darren Parker, a research assistant, have been extremely helpful. A \ncouple of interns, J.C. Dunkelberger and Brian Riga, have been very \nhelpful throughout all of this effort.\n  I think those of us who have been in the Senate a long time know this \nwork gets done certainly by us in some instances but by our staff in \nmost instances. They spend a lot of time, they develop a level of \nexpertise in working with us on some of these issues.\n  I thank these men and woman for their assistance in a complicated \nprocess. I hope we can finish and produce a work product that will come \nback to us in a reasonable form that many of us can support.\n  I am frustrated we are potentially moving a bill out of the Senate \nthat does not have any production. It is all about the future and the \noutyears. I do not think America worries about the outyears when they \ngo to a pump and pay $3 and 10 or 15 or 20 cents a gallon. They worry \nabout tomorrow and next year and the next year. That is what I think \nall of us have voiced in this debate.\n  Somehow it is not right anymore to drill holes in the ground and pull \nout oil and refine it. I do believe that still fits into the equation \nand will for several decades to come, as we move to flex fuel, as we \nmove to hybrids, as we move to hydrogen, as we move to electricity, as \nwe are, and as we will continue to, and we must.\n  But in the meantime, it is a reality that this Nation has to continue \nto produce. As loudly as I and some on the other side have spoken about \nit, the Senate collectively does not want to seem to go there anymore. \nMy guess is the American consumer, tragically enough, is going to pay \nthe price. I hope that ultimately we do get some more production built \ninto this legislation or other public policy as we move down the road \nbecause it is the reality of where we are. While we work our way away \nfrom it and take this great economy and start shifting it and moving it \naround to new economies in the field of energy, it takes a great deal \nof investment that the private sector will make, and it takes the kinds \nof incentives, and it takes a substantial amount of time that I do not \nthink is as reflected in this policy as I would hope, and as I have \nhoped it would be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak tonight as \nwe get close to the point hopefully of passing an energy bill here in \nthe Senate.\n  I first acknowledge the leadership of both Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Domenici. When we look at where we are today on energy, much of \nit started, the bipartisan cooperation, between Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Domenici, in the passage of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. I know \nthere have been critics of that act, but it was a creation that was put \nout in a bipartisan fashion, a significant step forward on energy.\n  This legislation that came out of the Energy Committee, which is \nincluded in the bill which we are about to vote on, in large part is a \nvery good step forward in terms of trying to address the goals we had \nin that particular legislation.\n  I also congratulate both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. I think \nwhen you think about the people who have made such a mark, an imprint \non the Senate today and on our country, two of our national heroes are \nTed Stevens and Dan Inouye. I never get tired of hearing the story of \nSenator Inouye and his service to our country. Every time I see him and \nI remember his great contribution and sacrifice to our country, I \nremember those are the greatest of the greatest generation, and \ncertainly both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye embody that \ngreatness.\n  I also thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nfor their great work. As a member of the Finance Committee, we worked \nvery hard to come up with legislation that would help us move forward \nin dealing with the reality of getting energy independence.\n  While I am disappointed that part of the package is not included as \nwe move\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\nforward toward final passage here, it nonetheless represented the best \nof our thinking about how we could invest in this new imperative of \nAmerica, and gets us to a new energy future for the 21st century.\n  I also thank the rest of my colleagues who were involved in some of \nthe discussions that have been underway today. Let my say that from my \npoint of view, there is no more important issue we must deal with here \nin Washington, here in the Congress, than the issue of energy.\n  If we look at the big issues of our time in the 21st century, I think \nin my mind there are three issues we have to deal with. We have to deal \nwith the issue of foreign relations and how we put the world back \ntogether again and restore America's greatness in the world.\n  We also need to make sure we embark on a new clean energy future for \nthe 21st century.\n  We also need to deal with other issues that are very difficult, the \nenormous challenge that we face with the health care in America today. \nThat issue is bankrupting America's families and America's businesses \nday by day. So how we move forward with those three issues is very \nimportant.\n  But tonight we are at the doorstep of taking a significant step \nforward on one of those huge issues; that is, the issue of energy and \nmoving forward to establishing a clean energy future.\n  Now, when I often talk about energy, I think back to what happened in \nthe early 1970s and through the 1970s with both President Nixon and \nPresident Jimmy Carter, where President Nixon declared the need for us \nto be energy independent, and coined that term.\n  Then following him, President Carter spoke about energy independence \nas being something that was the moral equivalent of war. Well, the fact \nis that in those days the driver for those statements and the coining \nof that term came from the economic volatility that was caused by the \nformation of OPEC and their ability to be able to influence the world \nmarkets on oil.\n  I think today we have three inescapable forces that drive us to look \nat the clean energy future as the imperative of the 21st century. Those \ninescapable forces are, first and foremost, our national security. When \nwe see what is happening in the Middle East with Hezbollah and in \nLebanon with Hamas in the Gaza, you know that terrorist organizations \nsuch as those are being funded by the very oil that is being consumed \nby the free world.\n  So for us to become energy independent is our way of making sure we \nare not held hostage to those kinds of organizations, to the oil barons \nand sheiks of this world. It is an imperative we do that from a \nnational security point of view.\n  Secondly, I think it is now beyond argument in our world today that \nthe issue of global warming is here, and we will have some debate that \nwill come on down the road with respect to how we address the issue of \nglobal warming here in America and across the world.\n  It is inescapable that we must do something about global warming if \nwe are to save civilization for our children and grandchildren and save \nthis planet we have been given the humble privilege of inhabiting. That \nis an inescapable force that will drive us to a clean energy future in \nthe 21st century.\n  Last is the economic opportunity and dealing with the economic \nvolatility that happens when you are hostage to someone who controls \nsupplies such as OPEC can today. The economic opportunity is one that \nyou already see happening throughout our great Nation.\n  In my State of Colorado, where 2 years ago, before passage of the \n2005 act, there was really nothing going on in terms of renewable \nenergy, we have totally turned that around. We have now ethanol plants \nin places such as Fort Morgan and Yuma. We have a number of other \nethanol plants springing up in Windsor and Devon, down in the southern \npart of the State, places which were part of the forgotten rural \nAmerica which had been hanging on by a shoestring just to keep their \ncommunities alive. There is a new breath of activity, a new breath of \nhope and opportunity and optimism in rural America, in large part \nbecause we believe we can grow our way to energy independence.\n  I believe strongly we are headed in the right track with the \nlegislation that has been put forward. I am hopeful that we will move \nforward and conclude our effort on this energy legislation tonight.\n  I want to go back for a minute and reflect upon the legislation that \ncame out of the Energy Committee which was led in a remarkable fashion \nby Senator Bingaman, with the support of Senator Domenici. It was a \nbipartisan effort that focused on three major issues, all of which are \nincluded in the underlying legislation.\n  The first of those was moving forward with alternative fuels. If you \nthink about what we have done with the renewable fuels standard, we \nwill be quintupling the amount of energy we create from biofuels. We \nwill be opening a new chapter with cellulosic ethanol that will make \nthe biofuels targets a reality.\n  Secondly, the efficiency measures are important to make sure we stop \nwasting the energy we consume. When we look at what the experts tell \nus, from the Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Lab, \nwe know we waste 60 percent of the energy that is consumed in America \ntoday. Therefore, the lowest hanging fruit for all of us is to move \nforward with efficiency measures. We are doing that in the part of the \nlegislation that was created in the Energy Committee. We also are doing \nit very much with the CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards \nthat were negotiated today with the leadership of Senators Stevens and \nInouye, Senator Feinstein, and many others who were involved. That will \nhelp us achieve the oil savings targets and goals we have set forth in \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, we take some movement forward in terms of dealing with the \nissue of carbon by making sure that we are dealing with carbon \nsequestration mapping in the United States and that we develop the way \nforward in terms of how we sequester carbon. There has been debate \nabout coal. Not everybody agrees on how we ought to move forward with \nrespect to coal. I believe it is important that we look at coal as a \npossible resource because it currently generates about 50 percent of \nour electricity today and it is the most abundant resource we have in \nthis country. We have enough coal resources for the next 200 years of \nenergy for America's use. Coal is to the United States what oil is to \nSaudi Arabia. So it is important that we not turn a blind eye and say \nwe are a nation that is not going to look at all at coal.\n  Some of the new technologies we have with respect to IGCC--the \ncreation of electricity in a way that can help us with the hybrid plug-\nins--will open a whole new chapter today and build on the 2005 act. \nThat will all be very important. Carbon sequestration needs to be a \npart of the equation. We know there are formations throughout this \ncountry where, in fact, we can sequester carbon. The technology is not \nall that complex. The enhanced oil recovery efforts and the technology \nwe have with EOR is technology that has been used in the oilfields for \ndecades. We know there are formations out there where we can, in fact, \nstore carbon. So we can find ways of utilizing this abundant fuel we \nhave in the United States to help us fuel the energy needs of the \ncountry.\n  In addition to the many Members who have worked on making this a \npossibility--and I hope we do get the 60 votes we need--there have been \na lot of people on many staffs on both the majority side and the \nminority side who have worked to make this happen. I thank each and \nevery one of them for getting us to the point we are today. I know the \ncountless hours and nights and days they have spent working on this \nissue. Without them, we would not be where we are tonight.\n  I thank the people in my office who have been working hard on this \nlegislation for a long time, both in the Energy Committee and in the \nFinance Committee. I say thank you to Steve Black, who has been an \nenormous player on the energy issue, in 2005 as well as today; Matt \nLee-Ashley, Suzanne Wells in my office, Grant Leslie, and Sam Mitchell, \nwho have done an enormous job pulling all of this together.\n  This is a major step we are about ready to take. I look forward to \nbeing a part of the celebration when we get this all done, hopefully in \nthe not too distant future before we go into the wee hours of tomorrow \nmorning.\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\n                            Efficiency Title\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Energy \nCommittee, its chairman and ranking member, in crafting this bill. \nHowever, I have concerns about some aspects of the efficiency title \nspecifically as they relate to regional standards for heating and \ncooling products and the possibility of more than one energy standard \nsuch as SEER or EER being applied to these products. I sincerely hope \nthat we can work on resolving these issues following the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to work with my colleague from Arkansas to \nimprove this bill, and will work with her on this issue following the \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate the chairman's good-faith commitment to \nwork with us on this issue. I raised these concerns when this bill was \nbeing discussed in the Energy Committee, and I continue to have \nreservations about how the language, as written, can be implemented.\n\n\n                                  rps\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would ask the majority leader, through \nthe President, if he is in agreement with me on a matter of some \nimportance. I offered an amendment last week to require that 15 percent \nof the electricity sold in the Nation come from renewable energy \nresources by the year 2020. We have not been able to get an agreement \nto have a vote on this amendment, or on other forms of it that might \nhave provided more flexibility to States in meeting the goals of the \namendment. We would have been agreeable to accepting a supermajority \nthreshold for passage of the amendment. We still could not reach \nagreement. That implies, to me, that opponents of the measure believe \nthat 60 or more Senators support the amendment. I believe that they may \nbe correct in assuming so.\n  This amendment would have been as significant an amendment as we \ncould have added to the bill. Such a standard would increase the \ngeneration of renewables in the Nation from something over 2 percent to \na much greater share of our generation supply. We have tried again and \nagain to provide, in law, mechanisms to allow renewable energy \ntechnologies to take the place in the market that they deserve. The \nSenate has passed similar amendments three times. This provision would \nresult in cleaner electricity generation, be the source of extensive \ncreation of new jobs, enhance our energy security, lower the price of \nnatural gas, and could even result in lower electricity prices.\n  Given the importance of this provision of the Nation, and the clear, \nstrong support for it in the Senate, I would ask if it is the intention \nof the majority leader, should we conclude business on the Energy Bill \nwithout passing it, to seek another vehicle for the passage of the \nrenewable electricity standard?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would answer the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, who has done great work in managing this complicated energy \nbill, that I agree with him as to the importance of this amendment to \nthe Nation, and on the broad support that it enjoys in the Senate.\n  There is little that we could do in the electricity sector that would \nbring more benefits--in terms of consumer savings, reducing natural gas \ndemand, and slowing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. We have \nsought in this bill to broaden the range of energy resources that we \ndepend on for motor fuels to include renewable resources. We must do \nthe same for our electricity supply. I share his strong belief that \nenactment of a national renewable electricity standard is critical for \nthe Nation's efforts to become more energy independent and to reduce \nthe risks of global warming, as well as create new jobs in the clean \nenergy industry. I promise to work with him to see that proposal gets \nfair consideration, a vote and, if at all possible, enacted into law \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, right now, people are at gas stations \nacross America, filling up cars and trucks to get to work, take their \nkids to school, and run their errands.\n  In May of 2002, a gallon of gas cost $1.40. Today that same gallon of \ngas costs $3.22. In just 5 years, the price of gas has more than \ndoubled.\n  Gas isn't the only energy cost that has spiked in the last 5 years. \nIn New Jersey, individuals, families, and businesses are paying 25 \npercent more for electricity than they were just 5 years ago. These \nhigh prices are hurting our families--families whose budgets are \nalready stretched thin.\n  We also know that our energy policies are hurting our environment. \nThe emissions from our cars and trucks, electric utilities, and \nfactories are causing global warming--a fact recently verified by a \nUnited Nations Panel on Climate Change. The energy bill before us marks \nthe first serious attempt in years to address our energy crisis.\n  First, it takes a measured but appropriate approach to improving CAFE \nstandards governing the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. Right \nnow, Japan leads the world in fuel efficiency. Many of their cars and \ntrucks get more than 40 miles per gallon. The United States is far \nbehind. Our passenger cars have been stuck at CAFE standards of 27.5 \nmiles per gallon since 1990--and our light trucks get just 21.6 miles \nper gallon. We must do better, and with this bill, we will.\n  Our energy bill calls for increasing fuel efficiency to 35 miles per \ngallon by the year 2020. As we improve our fuel efficiency, we decrease \nboth the amount of gas Americans have to pay for and the greenhouse \ngases our cars emit. But despite what many think, greenhouse gases \ndon't only come from cars and trucks. Buildings have a significant \nimpact on the environment and on the health of every American--\naccounting for nearly 40 percent of America's greenhouse gases. The \nFederal Government is the largest owner and renter of buildings in the \nNation and is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the \nworld.\n  In addition, poorly designed schools can cause the air inside to be \nunhealthy. This poor air quality increases childhood asthma.\n  More than 67 percent of schools have a design problem that \ncontributes to asthma. For those reasons, I introduced the High \nPerformance Green Buildings Act, which is now included in the Energy \nbill. This legislation focuses on making our Federal buildings \n``green'' and improving the environmental and health impacts of our \nschools. I worked with our former colleague, Senator Jeffords, on this \nbill in the past--and the language now in the Energy bill represents a \ncollaborative effort between myself, Senator Boxer, and Senators Snowe \nand Warner.\n  In comparison to standard buildings, the average green building has \nbetter air quality, uses 30 percent less energy, and results in nearly \n40 percent fewer emissions. Green buildings also have smaller electric \nbills, which saves owners and tenants on their bottom lines.\n  The Federal Government must lead by example and achieve those results \nfor its buildings. Accordingly, my green buildings bill will direct the \nGeneral Services Administration to use a green building certification \nthat all Federal buildings should achieve. It also provides grants and \nvoluntary guidelines for schools to lessen their environmental \nimpacts--and improve the health of the students, teachers, and staff \ninside them.\n  Finally, the bill calls for demonstration projects to show the public \nthat green buildings are environmentally sound, benefit people's \nhealth, and are both cost-effective and practical.\n  The States are doing their part. New Jersey and 21 other States have \nalready signed bills similar to my legislation. Many private companies \nare doing their part as well. For example, Bank of America is building \na new highrise office tower in Manhattan--a building that will be \nentirely green. It is time for the Federal Government to do its part.\n  We need a solution to our energy problems: one that protects the \nAmerican pocketbook, improves our CAFE standards, reduces our \ndependence on foreign oil, and promotes green building. This energy \nbill will be an important step forward toward achieving these goals.st\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1792\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1792, \nfiled by Senators Stevens, Snowe, Alexander, and Carper, and \ncosponsored by Senators Feinstein and Kerry, among others. This \nbipartisan compromise reflects the input of Members, industry,\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\nand consumers, and is good policy for our Nation.\n  I particularly wish to congratulate Senator Dianne Feinstein for her \ndedicated efforts over the years to update our Nation's fuel economy \nstandards. The success of the amendment today is a tribute to her \ntenacious and skilled advocacy.\n  At every step of the legislative process following the introduction \nof S. 357, the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, by Senators Feinstein and \nOlympia Snowe, the authors and cosponsors of S. 357 and members of the \nSenate Commerce Committee have worked together in a bipartisan manner \nto address the concerns of the automotive industry. In particular, this \ngroup worked hard to ensure that automakers will not face a significant \nburden when meeting the first improvements to fuel economy standards in \nmore than 30 years.\n  I am pleased that Members from both sides of the aisle continued to \nwork together to produce the amendment adopted today. While addressing \na number of the concerns raised by automakers regarding the Feinstein-\nSnowe Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act as reported by the Commerce \nCommittee, the amendment preserves the core goals and fuel savings of \nTen in Ten.\n  The amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation to increase \nfuel economy for automobiles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, as in Ten \nin Ten. But in the years that follow from 2021 to 2030, the Secretary \nshall increase fuel economy at a maximum feasible rate instead of at a \npace of 4 percent per annum.\n  If we have a breakthrough in battery technology, then 4 percent per \nyear may well be too low. If there are unforeseen problems, 4 percent \nmay be too high. The amendment will allow the Secretary to set an \nappropriate standard in the future.\n  The Kerry-Cantwell second degree amendment to the Stevens-Carper-\nFeinstein-Snowe-Kerry amendment also directs the Secretary to establish \nand implement an action plan to ensure that 50 percent of the vehicles \nfor sale in 2015 are alternative fuel automobiles. We must encourage \nmanufacturers to improve their fleets' fuel economy by exploring new \ntechnologies and producing alternative fuel vehicles. I commend \nSenators Kerry and Cantwell for developing this compromise amendment \nthat addresses this important goal.\n  By adopting the bipartisan compromise amendment and H.R. 6 as \namended, we will place the country on a path toward reducing our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil, protecting the environment, and \nhelping consumers deal with rising gas prices.\n  Finally, I wish to express my appreciation for the excellent efforts \nof the dedicated staff on the Senate Commerce Committee including David \nStrickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Ken Nahigian, Mia Petrini, and Jason \nBomberg.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pending energy \nbill and the future of energy in the U.S. I commend Chairman Bingaman \nfor crafting this compromise bill and bringing it before the full \nSenate for consideration. Like many of us, he recognizes that the \nenergy crisis we face will be long-term and life-altering, and that we \nmust enlist all Americans, and the cooperation of governments \nworldwide, to solve it.\n  Let's be honest. We have only gotten to this critical point because \nwe have put off for too long momentous energy decisions. In fact, the \nmain answer to our energy dilemma from the party across the aisle while \nthey were in power in Congress was the 2005 energy bill, a scandalous \nmix of billions in drilling subsidies and other giveaways to big oil \ncompanies which even some of them admitted were unnecessary. That \neffort was doomed from the start: While we consume 25 percent of the \nworld's oil, we only hold 3 percent of its reserves--so we can't, we \nnever could, drill our way out of the problem. The results of that bill \nin the last 2 years haven't been surprising: skyrocketing oil and gas \nprices; no slackening of demand; increased U.S. dependence on foreign \noil; underfunding of renewable energy initiatives; and slashed \nconservation funding. This bill takes us in a much better direction, \nwith progressive new policies. And that is critical. If we are to \naddress honestly the threat posed by America's addiction to carbon-\nbased fossil fuels, and especially imported oil, it is long past time \nto move in a better direction, and to make some difficult choices.\n  We have known for a long time about the three-fold threat--to our \nnational security, our economic vitality, and our environmental \nhealth--posed by our over-reliance on foreign oil. To our national \nsecurity, because we now import about 60 percent of our oil from some \nof the most politically unstable regions of the world, governed by \nauthoritarian regimes, some serving as breeding grounds for terror. To \nour economic vitality, through high gasoline prices, rising home \nheating costs, and electricity price spikes which strain family \nbudgets, burden businesses, and make our Nation less competitive. To \nour environmental health, due to smog, climate change, increased asthma \nrisks, cancer and other diseases caused or exacerbated by pollution. We \ncontinue on this path to our peril. A better way forward is to embark \nnow on a course of dramatic change in our energy policies, including \nsetting clear long-term goals and enforceable benchmarks; backing our \nrhetoric on conservation, renewable energy and other initiatives with \nreal funding; scaling back wasteful oil industry subsidies, and \nincluding all Americans in energy conservation efforts. If we do it \nright, Middle East imports will decline and vital U.S. interests will \nbe made less vulnerable; our air will be cleaner; new jobs in the \nrenewable sector will be created, our rural communities will be \nrevitalized through energy innovation, and our relationships with \nallies and overall position in the world will be strengthened.\n  Our over-reliance on foreign oil, especially from the Middle East, \nmakes us vulnerable to price spikes, supply disruptions, and market \nuncertainty. We also, sadly, pay for the privilege of propping up \nauthoritarian regimes that use oil reserves to bolster their own power, \ninsulate themselves from demands for political and economic \nliberalization, and protect themselves from the need to improve their \nhuman rights records--what NYT columnist Tom Friedman calls ``petro-\nauthoritarianism.'' This is why the government of Iran can suppress its \nown people; it's why Russia can crush Chechnya and intimidate its \nneighbors; it's why China, a major owner of Sudan's main oil \nconsortium, can continue to block effective U.N. action on Darfur. We \nare effectively financing them to do it through our oil purchases.\n  And we have been doing this for decades. I was first elected to \nCongress in 1974, in the wake of an energy crisis prompted by an OPEC \noil embargo. It was a summer of gas lines and shortages, of steps large \nand small taken to address the problem. And now here we are, fighting \nanother uphill battle to enact a good energy bill, which contains an \nimportant set of incremental steps to address these problems. I would \nlike us to go much farther than this bill does. But at least with its \npassage we would finally be headed in the right direction.\n  I think almost everyone in this Chamber would agree that the future \nof energy in this country, to the maximum extent possible, should be \nclean, green, domestic, and renewable. We know that our dependence on \nforeign oil leaves us vulnerable, increases our trade deficit, and \ncreates volatility in energy prices and hardships for American \nconsumers and businesses. We know that emissions from fossil-fuel fired \npowerplants cause unnecessary illnesses and deaths. And we know that \nour emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global climate change, \nwhich is leading to higher sea levels, melting glaciers, shifting \necosystems, and ocean acidification.\n\n  Our national energy policy must be retooled to address those threats \ndirectly, and to encourage the development and deployment of \ntechnologies that will encourage the use of clean, domestic, renewable \nenergy. This bill, modest as it is, does that, I applaud Senators \nStevens, Inouye, Feinstein, and others for crafting a compromise on \nfuel economy standards, though we must recognize that it is a \ncompromise: the new fuel economy standards contained in this bill do \nnot do enough to achieve the full potential of current technologies to \nincrease fuel efficiency. Even so, setting the CAFE target at 35 miles \nper gallon by 2020, is\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\nan important advance for a Congress that has not managed to increase \nstandards at all for over 20 years. There was no increase in fuel \neconomy standards to blame for the decline in American auto \nmanufacturers' market share from 73 percent in 1986 to 55 percent in \n2006; the future strength or weakness of those manufacturers will \ndepend far more on the extent to which they transform themselves by \ntaking advantage of new green vehicle technologies in the coming years. \nThe same arguments we have heard for many years--that the technology is \nunavailable to enable these higher standards, that they will make cars \nless safe, that we will hurt our own manufacturers--are the ones made \nin the late 1970's; they are no more true now than they were then.\n  We have spent much of this debate on a few contentious issues, but \nthere are many significant provisions in the bill that have not been as \nwidely discussed, including creating research and demonstration \nprograms for carbon capture and sequestration, substantially increasing \nappliance efficiency standards, and making the Federal Government a \nleader in the use of renewable energy and green construction. Moreover, \nthis legislation puts the Senate on record in our support of engagement \nwith other countries, especially those in the Western Hemisphere, to \nbetter coordinate energy security and assure diverse and reliable \nenergy supplies. While it is not perfect, it is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, let me say a final word about the elephant in the \nroom, which we have scarcely acknowledged thus far in this debate about \nenergy policy: climate change. Climate and energy policy are \ninextricable--any energy policy we adopt will have an enormous impact \non the climate. I recognize that this body is not yet ready to adopt a \ncomprehensive measure to substantially limit emissions of greenhouse \ngases, or to take the bold step of imposing some form of a \ncomprehensive corporate carbon tax. If we were honest with the American \npeople, that is the kind of bold step we would take to help resolve our \nenergy dilemma.\n  The truth is that, on energy and climate issues, Americans are ahead \nof their political leaders. They understand the serious, long-term \ncumulative threat climate change poses to their children and \ngrandchildren; they're willing to make tough choices to address it. \nThey understand that cleaner energy is possible; they know that fuel-\nefficient vehicles and appliances are within reach--but they're worried \nthat American manufacturers are falling behind. Americans \noverwhelmingly support the development of alternative energy, higher \nmileage standards, hybrid vehicles, and incentives to produce and \ninstall more energy efficient appliances. They see the potential for \nsavings generated by energy-efficient technologies, both for their \nfamilies and for a more efficient, more effective use of their tax \ndollars by government. And they want change. They understand that the \nthreats of climate change are not geographically remote or far off in \ntime; they are real and urgent. I hope that the day when we can take up \nand pass tough new controls on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngases arrives soon. But however we address emissions and efficiency, \nconservation, bio-fuels, fuel economy, and other important provisions, \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill, and to start us on the road \ntowards a future of clean, domestic, and renewable energy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support the Energy \nbill that we are voting on tonight. I will vote against cloture on the \nbill and against final passage. There are many good provisions of this \nbill--particularly in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable \nfuels--but at its core, the bill contains CAFE provisions that will \nneedlessly harm the American auto industry.\n  I believe we had a real opportunity to make significant strides in \nimproving fuel economy and reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and \ndoing it in a sensible way that would support American manufacturing \nand American workers. Instead, the bill before the Senate tonight has \nchosen the path that is most likely to harm our workers by combining \ntrucks with cars for new standards that are overly aggressive and \nunachievable and may have a particularly harmful effect on those \nmanufacturers who produce a high percentage of light trucks and produce \nsmall cars in America.\n  America has lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001, over \n200,000 jobs in the automotive sector. Our companies face enormous \ncompetition in the global marketplace without support from the U.S. \nGovernment. Our companies are not competing against companies overseas \nthey are competing against other governments that strongly support \ntheir manufacturing sectors with currency manipulation and trade \nbarriers against our products. American companies must compete against \nthose who are protected from import competition by their government, \nhave cheap labor costs, do not pay health insurance and legacy costs, \nor do not have to meet our strict environmental standards. Our \nmanufacturers can compete with anyone on a level playing field but \nright now that field is tilted against them.\n  Tonight, we are choosing to follow a path that will continue that \nuneven playing field for our manufacturers through our own regulatory \nprocess--no other countries would do that to its companies. The \nproponents of these provisions--a combined car-truck standard of 35 \nmiles per gallon by 2020 claim that these standards will be easy to \nmeet with new advanced technology and suggest that these fuel economy \nnumbers are supported by the National Academy of Sciences. But that is \nsimply not true. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences, in its 2002 \nreport that is frequently cited, specifically stated that the \nconclusions it drew about technologies should not be interpreted as \nfuel economy recommendations.\n  There was a better way. An amendment sponsored by Senator Pryor that \nI cosponsored, along with Senators Bond, Voinovich, Stabenow and \nMcCaskill, offered that alternative approach. Our amendment would have \ntaken bold steps forward to improve fuel economy, reduce our dependence \non foreign oil, and protect the environment. We did that in our \namendment by establishing aggressive, yet achievable, new and different \nfuel economy standards for cars and light trucks and by setting clear \ninterim milestones for reaching these new standards.\n  Our amendment would have required a thirty-percent increase in fuel \neconomy standards for cars by 2022 and a thirty-five-percent increase \nin standards for trucks by 2025, and our amendment would have provided \ncertainty that these standards will be met. It also would have provided \nthe predictability needed by our auto companies to plan ahead and \nutilize new advanced technology to the maximum extent possible. Our \namendment would have provided the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, NHTSA--the agency that would set these standards--tools \nnecessary to establish the standards in a sensible way that would have \nensured the standards would be at the maximum feasible level, even if \nthat level proved to be higher than the number included in this \namendment. To ensure that the technology would be available to meet \nthese standards, our amendment also would have provided a significant \nnew infusion of Federal dollars to support advanced technology \nresearch, development, and demonstration programs across a wide \nspectrum of technologies--from advanced batteries and lightweight \nmaterials to advanced clean diesel, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fuel \ncells. Our amendment also would have put more advanced technology out \non the road immediately by requiring each auto manufacturer to make a \ncertain percentage of their new vehicles either flexible fuel vehicles \nor advanced technology vehicles--increasing to 50 percent of their \nfleets by 2015.\n  To be sure, meeting the new fuel economy standards under our \namendment would have been a stretch and a challenge for all of our \ncountry's auto manufacturers--both our traditional American \nmanufacturers, who built the foundation of the auto industry in this \ncountry, as well as manufacturers such as Toyota, Mazda, and \nMitsubishi. But it would not have pushed our companies to the breaking \npoint, as I fear the provisions of this legislation will do.\n  So I cannot support this bill tonight, and I regret that we did not \ntake a different path. I was encouraged that the Commerce Committee \nleaders were\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\nwilling to take some of our suggestions and make some improvements in \ntheir bill. Through our negotiations, we received a few significant \nconcessions. Specifically, the standards in the final bill are for the \nindustry as a whole and not standards to be met company by company, \nending a procedure which has discriminated against the domestic \nindustry. The bill also makes clear that NHTSA is required to set \nstandards according to an attribute based system that will look at the \ndifferent attributes of cars and trucks, and make clear that the fuel \neconomy standards after 2020 will be set at the maximum feasible level \nrather than requiring an arbitrary and unrealistic increase of four \npercent annually and was true with the Commerce Committee bill.\n  I believe that we can reduce our dependence on oil, reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and improve the overall fuel economy of our \nvehicles on the road while supporting our American manufacturers in the \nglobal market place. To do that, we need a major public-private \npartnership and major investments in leap-ahead energy technologies, \nincluding advanced technology vehicles. We need a huge infusion of \nresources and a commitment from both the private sector and the Federal \ngovernment to support efforts to reach these important goals. At a \nminimum, we cannot have our government act in ways that will unfairly \ndisadvantage our American manufacturers against their global \ncompetitors.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the improvements to vehicle efficiency that are included in \nH.R. 6. It is time for us to make reasonable, achievable, and \nmeaningful increases to the corporate average fuel economy standards.\n  In the past 2 weeks I have spoken repeatedly about the national \nsecurity, economic security, and environmental security implications of \nthe energy debate that we are holding. The converging and growing risks \nof our overdependence on foreign oil are well understood among \nAmericans, who see the impacts of our failed energy policy on a daily \nbasis.\n  At the gas station, consumers see prices spike at OPEC's whim or with \nthe threat of supply disruptions in countries like Venezuela or \nNigeria. In their businesses, Americans feel the pain of soaring oil \nprices--fuel prices for farmers are so high that some do not know if \nthey will be able to complete the harvest in the fall. And in their \nland, air, and natural surroundings, Americans are beginning to \nunderstand the impacts that global warming could have over the coming \ndecades.\n  This week we have already made significant progress in our quest to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. Not only is the underlying bill \nan important step forward, but we have passed several amendments that \nstrengthen the foundations of a new, clean energy economy for the \nUnited States.\n  So far we have increased the oil savings targets in this bill by 50 \npercent, so that by 2016, we are saving as much oil as we are currently \nimporting from the Middle East. We have passed provisions from the \nDRIVE Act that will bring high-efficiency vehicles, such as plug-in \nhybrids, to consumers. And we set a goal of producing 25 percent of our \nenergy from renewable sources by 2025. These are important improvements \nthat will accelerate the pace at which we are moving toward energy \nindependence.\n  Today, though, I want to talk more specifically about a provision of \nthis bill that has been a point of intense debate for some time. \nVehicle efficiency standards in this country have been stagnant for too \nlong. Although our vehicle manufacturers have made impressive \nimprovements to the safety, strength, and power of our vehicles, the \naverage fuel economy of new cars and trucks was actually lower in 2006 \nthan it was 20 years ago. Passenger cars sold in the U.S. only get \naround 27.5 miles per gallon on average.\n  The result? American consumers and businesses are suffering \ndisproportionately from $3-a-gasoline. $50 and $80 visits to the gas \nstation are now the norm, and transportation costs are taking a growing \nslice out of family budgets.\n  People who live in rural areas are hit the hardest by low fuel-\nefficiency standards. They drive around 15 percent more miles than \npeople who live in cities, they rarely have the choice of using public \ntransit, and they use work vehicles, like pickups, that get fewer miles \nto the gallon. As a result, gas bills in rural households have risen \nalmost $1,300 in the past 5 years.\n  The question of how to improve vehicle efficiency standards is not an \neasy one, and is not to be taken lightly. But today the path forward is \nclearer than it has been in some time. Not only is the need for \nimproved efficiency evident, but we have the technological know-how to \nmake these changes to our vehicle-fleet in a safe and cost-effective \nmanner.\n  The bill before us raises the CAFE standards for cars and light \ntrucks to 35 mpg by 2020. This is a reasonable and appropriate goal for \nefficiency. The bill also gives manufacturers tremendous flexibility to \nmeet the standards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, will have the ability to set a national fleet-wide average fuel \neconomy standard of 35 mpg by 2020 that will be tailored to the weight, \nsize, type of use and towing capabilities of each car type. Under this \nflexible system, the standards for light trucks will likely be \nsignificantly lower than the standards for passenger cars, and \nstandards will vary for passenger cars: smaller cars will have higher \nstandards than larger cars.\n  The bill also includes an important exemption for work-trucks between \n8,500 and 10,000 pounds--these are the trucks that are essential to the \ndaily operations of farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.\n  The CAFE standards in this bill are achievable by incorporating a \ngroup of modest, proven conventional technologies into vehicles. The \ntechnologies would add about $1,100 to the price of an average vehicle \nin 2019, an investment that would be recovered in less than 3 years of \ndriving, assuming that gasoline costs $2.00 per gallon. Over the \nlifetime of the vehicle the owner would save a total of more than \n$3,600 in gasoline costs.\n  And the technologies are only getting better. Our national labs and \nuniversities are making breakthroughs in research that will allow us to \nmake even greater advances in fuel efficiency. At the Colorado School \nof Mines, for example, researchers are developing a way to cast metal \nalloy composite materials for high strength, lightweight vehicle parts. \nThis technology will reduce the weight of vehicle components by as much \nas 60 percent without compromising vehicle performance, cost, or \nsafety.\n  While I am a champion for the responsible development of our domestic \nenergy supplies and I firmly believe that we need to make smart \ninvestments in a renewable energy economy, improving efficiency is the \ncheapest, cleanest and quickest way for us to extend our energy \nsupplies, get a handle on rising gas prices, and reduce our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  I am proud of the responsible, bipartisan approach we have taken to \nimproving vehicle standards. I want to again thank Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Domenici for their leadership on this bill and I look forward \nto passing it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, Mr. President, the distinguished Republican \nleader and I apologize to everyone.\n  However, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 p.m. tonight the \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to; the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate vote on cloture on H.R. 6; that if cloture is invoked, the \nSenate vote immediately on passage of the bill with the preceding all \noccurring without any intervening action or debate; further, that the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 800 occur at 11:30 a.m. \non Tuesday, June 26; that if cloture is invoked, the motion be agreed \nto and the Senate vote immediately on cloture on the motion to proceed \nto S. 1639, the immigration bill; that if cloture is invoked, the \nmotion be agreed to; and further that if cloture is invoked on S. 1639, \nit be in order upon the disposition of all postcloture debate time \nthere be\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\n20 minutes equally divided for debate only on a motion to waive the \nBudget Act in response to a budget point of order against the bill made \nby Senator Jeff Sessions or his designee; further, that on Wednesday, \nif the Senate is considering the immigration bill, Senator Sessions be \nrecognized for debate only for up to 2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would just like a few minutes to look at the language.\n  Mr. REID. I renew my consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, and they are concerned about some ability to get in \nconference the cloture motion; that is, the tax aspects of the Energy \nbill that was defeated. It is not part of this matter we are working on \nnow. As I told my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, if he \ncould figure out a way to do it, he should let me know. I want everyone \nto cool their jets. The Republican leader and I have had a pretty good \nagreement on matters that pass this body, as to what goes to \nconference.\n  Now, we have preconferenced--we don't need to run through the things \nwe have preconferenced, but I think the Republican leader will tell \neveryone here that I have been on the level with him, and I intend to \nbe on this matter. So if anyone is concerned about some trick to put \nthis energy tax package in the bill in conference, they need to tell me \nhow to do it because I don't know how. It takes three cloture votes for \nme to get to conference. I have been through that. They are procedural \nvotes. Although I wish I had the magic wand to tell a lot of you how to \nvote on the procedural votes, I haven't been too successful so far.\n  So everyone just relax on that issue. I don't know what more I can \nsay. I have told the Republican leader personally about that. That is \nhow I feel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what I assume my good friend, the \nmajority leader, is talking about is that there are three \nfilibusterable motions prior to going to conference. What he is \nsuggesting here is, in fact, the case, which is that rather than simply \ngoing to conference without any discussion of what might come out of \nconference, the matter could be discussed in some detail before we go \nto conference. I know that is what my good friend, the majority leader, \nwas talking about.\n  Our concern, of course, was that Senator Conrad said, right here on \nthe floor of the Senate tonight--I won't read it word for word, but \nthese are direct quotes from the floor of the Senate tonight--that was \nthe game plan, to simply put the tax component, which was defeated \nearlier today, back in the measure. That created a considerable amount \nof angst on this side of the aisle for obvious reasons. There was \nsubstantial opposition to this massive tax increase which would have \nbeen added to the bill.\n  So we will have a lengthy discussion before going to conference. Let \nme just say, as one of the States that does not find much to applaud in \nthe bill in any event, there are ample reasons for voting against \ncloture. I certainly am going to vote against cloture and would hope \nthat a number of our colleagues, sufficient to deny cloture, would have \na similar vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend the Republican leader, I \nhope we would proceed on the basis--I gave a little speech here earlier \ntoday, after cloture was invoked, talking about a new day having \narrived. I hope people would vote the way they have in the past on this \nissue earlier today. It would be a real bad day for this Congress now, \nafter the progress we have made, not to pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today about the \npassage of H.R. 1429, the Head Start for School Readiness Act. This \nbipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Head Start program, something \nthe Congress has not done since 2003.\n  In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson launched a summer program for low-\nincome children and their families, and called it Project Head Start. \nThe program's mission was simple: prepare low-income, preschool-aged \nchildren for success in school. Today, Head Start serves children and \ntheir families in urban and rural areas across the United States. And, \nsince its inception, more than 20 million children and families have \nbenefited from the Head Start program.\n  Nevada's eight centers range from a Head Start and Early Head Start \nCenter in rural Ely, to larger, more urban centers in Reno, to a Tribal \nHead Start center in Gardnerville. Each of these programs is unique \nand, with the input and involvement of parents and families, help meet \nthe needs of the communities they serve.\n  Head Start currently provides comprehensive early education and \nhealth services to almost one million low-income preschool children to \nhelp them prepare for and succeed in school. Unfortunately, this is \nonly a fraction of the number of children that could benefit from Head \nStart services. In my own state of Nevada, there are just under 10,000 \n3- and 4-year-olds that are eligible for Head Start programs. But, last \nyear, only about 27 percent of those eligible were able to participate.\n  The bill that we have passed will allow many of these children in \nNevada and across the Nation to get the early childhood services that \nthey need, by expanding access and eligibility for low-income children \nand families.\n  The legislation also makes a number of other important changes to the \nHead Start program. It focuses on developing the skills that children \nwill need to enter school ready to learn by aligning Head Start \nstandards and services with state child care and preschool programs and \nlocal public schools, and requiring new research-based standards and \nassessments.\n  And, to ensure that Head Start programs are effective, the bill \nrequires greater accountability through improved monitoring and \nrecompetition for poor performing Head Start centers. Finally, this \nbill strengthens the Head Start workforce by setting new education and \ntraining goals for Head Start teachers and curriculum specialists.\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\n  With proven and lasting results, Head Start is a wise investment in \nour future. I applaud the good work of the HELP Committee, and thank \nSenators Kennedy, Enzi, Dodd, and Alexander for their efforts on behalf \nof low-income children across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8222-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Reid, and all of my \ncolleagues, in congratulating Senator Robert Byrd on reaching yet \nanother historic milestone in his lifetime of public service.\n  To have the privilege of casting even one vote in the U.S. Senate is \nan honor. To cast 18,000 votes in this Senate is a legend.\n  It is a feat that has never been achieved before, and very likely \nnever will be again.\n  His 18,000 votes in this Senate are more than a singular statistic. \nThey are yet another measure of Robert C. Byrd's lifetime of devotion \nto his state, our Nation, this institution, and to the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Senator Byrd is, of course, a great student of history--and the \nauthor of the definitive work on the history of the U.S. Senate. In \nfact, one could say that Robert C. Byrd is Senate history.\n  Think about this: In addition to being the only Senator ever to cast \n18,000 votes, Senator Byrd is also the first U.S. Senator ever to cast \n15,000 votes.\n  Senator Byrd has served with--not under, with--11 Presidents.\n  He has served as majority leader and held more leadership positions \nthan any Senator in history.\n  To help put the length of his service in perspective, consider a few \nfacts: When Senator Byrd cast his first vote in the Senate--on January \n8, 1959 his colleagues included Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon \nJohnson. Vice President Richard Nixon was the presiding officer. Hawaii \nwas not yet a state. And a state-of-the-art computer would have taken \nup half of the space of this Chamber and had roughly the same amount of \ncomputing power as a Palm Pilot.\n  Today, Senator Byrd is a hero among bloggers and so many others \nbecause of his unyielding dedication to our Constitution and his \nobvious love of our Nation and the principles for which it stands.\n  He is the unrivaled expert on Senate rules.\n  He has been a candidate for election 12 times--9 times as a candidate \nfor the U.S. Senate and 3 times as a candidate for the U.S. House. He \nwon every time.\n  And he has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West \nVirginia history. He was named West Virginian of the Century by the \nresidents of his home State.\n  It is an honor to serve with this giant of Senate history, and to \nshare with him this milestone. Again, I commend him and congratulate \nhim.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President. I stand today to honor my dear friend \nand colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  Few of us can truly hold claim to the title of living legend--but \nRobert C. Byrd can. This afternoon he cast his 18,000th vote. A \nremarkable record that reflects his years of dedicated, passionate and \nheartfelt service to the people of West Virginia and the Republic he so \nloves.\n  Eighteen thousand is an impressive number. But what is more \nimpressive is the change that those votes had on America. He voted to \nstrengthen Social Security for all Americans. He voted to turn the \ndream of college education into a reality for all students. He voted to \nensure that those who put in an honest day's work receive an honest \nday's wage. He voted to protect the health and safety of coal miners. \nAnd, he voted to ensure that those who serve in uniform would get the \nbenefits they deserve. Quite frankly, his voting record, and its impact \non the fabric of our country, is immeasurable.\n  Along the way, his votes and his voice became the conscience of the \nSenate. Reminding us all that change is never easy, and that following \nthe rules matters. That we can disagree with each other, even an \nadministration, but we can ill afford to be disagreeable with each \nother.\n  It is impossible to picture the history of the last 50 years without \nthinking of Robert C. Byrd's impact and influence on all of our lives. \nI am incredibly honored to serve every day with my dear friend and \ncolleague--he is an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8222-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        S.

Mr. President, I rise briefly to speak for a few moments \nabout the horrible tragedy we witnessed Tuesday morning in Charleston, \nSC: the death of nine firefighters: Captain Wiliam ``Billy'' \nHutchinson, Captain Mike Benke, Captain Louis Mulkey, Engineer Mark \nKelsey, Engineer Bradford ``Billy'' Baity, Assistant Engineer Michael \nFrench, Firefighter James ``Earl'' Drayton, Firefighter Brendon \nThompson, and Firefighter Melvin Champaign.\n  Clearly, this loss is one of profound sadness for the Charleston \ncommunity and, indeed, for the entire Nation. My thoughts and prayers \ngo out to these firefighters' loved ones, families, friends, and \ncolleagues.\n  These nine brave men died while fighting a horrific multialarm fire \nin which two people were ultimately\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nsaved. In other words, they selflessly gave their lives while ensuring \nthe safety and well-being of others. This is the ultimate sacrifice of \na firefighter--a sacrifice that has been made by 3,148 men and women \nsince 1981.\n  We must never forget the dangers firefighters across our Nation \ndauntlessly face each and every day--dangers that have their roots in \nnature or mankind. Whether responding to fires, natural disasters, or \nacts of terrorism, our firefighters risk and give their lives \nextinguishing fires, delivering lifesaving emergency medical services, \nconducting search and rescue missions, and responding to and handling \nhazardous biological and radiological agents. Our Nation's firefighters \ncertainly do not perform these duties for any self-glorification. They \nperform these duties because each and every one of them answers a noble \ncall to serve this country and protect its people from harm.\n  Woodrow Wilson once wrote that ``. . . loyalty means nothing unless \nit has at its heart the absolute principle of self-sacrifice.'' \nClearly, the loyalty of these nine firefighters--loyalty to duty, \ncountry, and each other--were tragically demonstrated overnight Monday. \nMay we mourn them and draw inspiration from their actions. May we never \nforget them.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow in Charleston will be a citywide \nday of mourning for the nine firefighters who died, rushing into the \nblazing furniture store to try to save a life. I rise to pay my \nrespects to those fallen heroes and to their families.\n  The other day, when I heard the fire chief, Rusty Thomas, say he lost \nnine of his best friends, I know what he meant. So does every Senator \nin this Chamber because firefighters are the best things our \ncommunities have.\n  They risk their lives every day we lay a heavy, heavy responsibility \non them. But think of how many countless lives are saved because of \ntheir dedication, because they will find the people trapped inside a \nburning building.\n  I remember when our former colleague from Charleston, Senator \nHollings, had the terrible fire that burned his home, it was those same \nSouth Carolina firefighters who came to help one of our own.\n  Whether they are in Charleston or the volunteers in Claymont, DE, \nwhere I come from, when they are done putting out a blaze, you can find \nthem organizing the little league teams or grating the baseball \ndiamonds or taking care of the boy and girl scouts. They are the grit \nthat makes this country great.\n  What happened in South Carolina reminds all of us just how important \nfirefighters are to our communities, how brave these people are, and \nhow dangerous their work is.\n  We saw it during Hurricane Katrina, when 1,000 firefighters who \nthemselves lost their homes and their cars, whose whole lives were \nturned upside down, spent day after day rescuing people from rooftops.\n  We saw it on September 11, when that grizzled fireman came out of the \ndebris of human flesh and cement and steel to become the face around \nthe world of America's determination.\n  Three hundred forty-three firemen were lost on that terrible day. And \nthe tragedy in Charleston is the single greatest loss of firefighters \nin the nation since then.\n  Just as the spirit of those firefighters on September 11 helped lift \nAmerica off our knees, I hope that the grief Charleston feels this week \nwill be lifted by the legacy of their fallen heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8223-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8223-S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Michael A. Bechert\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of the brave staff sergeant from \nIndiana. Michael Bechert, 24 years old, died on June 14 from injuries \nsustained on May 30, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq, when his vehicle \nencountered an improvised explosive device. With his whole life before \nhim, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold \nclose to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  An Indiana native, Michael last resided in Germany where he met his \nwife Daniela. In addition to his military service, Michael was a \ndevoted husband and the father of their 20-month-old boy, Branden. ``He \nwas a great father, husband. A young, fresh young man. He fought for \nhis country and died for it,'' said Daniela. Along with his wife and \nson, he leaves behind his father Michael L. Bechert and his \ngrandparents George and Doris Bechert who raised him.\n  Michael was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Infantry Division in Schweinfurt, Germany. He was killed \nduring his second deployment in Iraq, while serving his country in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. During his first tour of duty he was injured \nand deservingly awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Today, I join Michael's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Michael, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Michael was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Michael's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Michael's actions will live on far \nlonger that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Michael A. Bechert in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Michael's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Michael.\n\n\n                Private First Class David A. Wilkey, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of the brave private first class from \nIndiana. David Wilkey, 22 years old, died on June 18th, 2007, from \ninjuries sustained on June 17th, in Baghdad, Iraq, when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol. With an \noptimistic future before him, David risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Although David was extremely proud of his military service, he prided \nhimself most on his family. He was a devoted husband to Melinda and \nloving father of 4-year-old stepson Christian Clark and 1-year-old son \nBlayke. They also have another child due in October. David's love for \nhis family drove him to enlist, in order to continue his support of \nthem. David is also survived by his mother Cindy, his father David Sr., \nstepmother Margaret, as well as two sisters and a brother.\n  David was on his first deployment in Iraq and had been there since \nFebruary 2007. Assigned to D Company, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Infantry Division, Fort Riley, Kansas, he was killed \nwhile serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. ``He had a big \nheart, and he's a son that any father could be proud of,'' David Sr. \nsaid.\n  Today, I join David's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of David, a memory that will burn\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nbrightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  David was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, David will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring David's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of David's actions will live on far \nlonger that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of David A Wilkey, Jr. in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like David's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with David.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8224-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD DAY OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am proud to add my voice in support of H. \nCon. Res. 86, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of a world \nday of remembrance for road crash victims.\n  Each crash might seem to us, in its immediacy, like an isolated \ntragedy, but when we step back, we see that each has its part in a \nglobal crisis that is deepening year by year. The day of remembrance--\nset by the United Nations General Assembly for the third Sunday of \nNovember--is not just for the 40,000 people who die in road crashes \neach year in America. It is for the 1.2 million who die in crashes in \nevery part of the world and for the staggering 20 to 50 million who are \ninjured. In fact, the World Health Organization predicts that, by the \nyear 2020, the death rate from crashes each year will surpass the death \nrate from AIDS.\n  True, many of these crashes are unique disasters, but that leaves \nmany more whose causes are systemic and preventable. Unsafe roads, poor \nmedical facilities, and inadequate driver education all contribute \ntheir share to the death toll. Unsurprisingly, the toll is highest, and \nrising, in middle- and low-income countries. Road safety, then, is an \nissue of economic justice.\n  On the world day of remembrance, we will recall all of the victims of \nroad crashes; we keep their families in our thoughts, and we pray for \nthe full recovery of those still living. But our compassion for \nindividuals must not obscure the bigger picture. ``We have to change \nthe way we think about crashes,'' said Diza Gonzaga, the mother of a \ncar-crash victim in Brazil. ``The majority of people think that crashes \nare due to fate. We have to think of a crash as a preventable event.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8224-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8224-S8225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have always supported organized labor, \nfor a simple reason: When workers join together and act collectively, \nthey can achieve economic gains that they would never be able to \nnegotiate individually. History tells us this: Union members were on \nthe front lines fighting for the 40-hour workweek, the minimum wage, \nemployer-provided health insurance and pensions. Organized labor led \nthe way in passing legislation to ensure fair and safe workplaces and \nin championing many other employee safety nets, including Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Unfortunately, continued forward progress is not inevitable. We have \nseen this in recent years, as union membership has declined, wages have \nstagnated, the numbers of uninsured have risen, and private companies \nhave been allowed to default on their pensions, threatening the \nretirement security of millions of Americans. It is clear to me that to \nrebuild economic security, we must first rebuild strong and vibrant \nunions. And to rebuild strong unions, we must first reduce unfair \nbarriers to union organizing.\n  To rebuild the promise of health care and pension benefits, we must \nreduce unfair barriers to union organizing. A recent study by the \nInstitute for America's Future confirms this. By comparing organizing \ncampaigns in the United States and Canada, the study found that more \nworker-friendly certification rules increase union participation.\n  Of course, this is all just common sense. If you reduce the barriers \nto workers joining unions, more workers will join. But what does it \nmean? Well, as this study makes clear, by passing the Employee Free \nChoice Act, and by making it easier for workers to band together, more \nthan 3.5 million Americans would be able to secure health coverage, and \nnearly 3 million more Americans would have access to employer-based \npensions.\n  Middle class families in this country have an increasingly difficult \ntime making ends meet. More than 47 million Americans lack health \ninsurance--including 251,000 Iowans--and even those with coverage find \nthat if often covers less and less. This should not be happening in \nAmerica. When productivity rises, everyone should see their fair share \nof that gain, but in the past several years, increasing productivity \nhas gone hand-in-hand with a growing wage gap. According to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service:\n\n       Adjusted for inflation, average worker pay rose 8 percent \n     from 1995 to 2005; median CEO pay at the 350 largest firms \n     rose about 150 percent over the same period.\n\n  In my home State of Iowa, real median household income fell by 3.4 \npercent between 1999 and 2005, dropping from $48,142 in 1999 to $46,500 \nin 2005.\n  By passing the Employee Free Choice Act, by giving workers a seat at \nthe table, we can start to reverse this negative trend. Union \nparticipation in the workplace means everybody wins. When employees \nhave a voice--not just to ask for better wages and benefits, but to \nmake suggestions about how to do things better--employers benefit, too. \nUnion employees take pride in their work and work to get more training. \nAnd they are happy to help find other efficiencies in the operation, \nbecause they get a share of the savings.\n  Unfortunately, scaremongers are trying to tell us that the Employee \nFree Choice Act takes away employee rights to a ``secret ballot.'' \nNothing could be further from the truth. This bill does not establish a \nnew election process; it merely requires employers to honor employee \nchoice. Right now, the company gets to decide whether it will recognize \na majority sign-up vote. Under the aptly named Employee Free Choice \nAct, the employees get to decide. If the workers want to use the \nNational Labor Relations Board process, they are perfectly free to do \nso. But, as we know from hard experience, that process can be \nthreatening and intimidating to many employees.\n  In addition to making it easier to form a union in the first place, \nthe Employee Free Choice Act provides for arbitration for the first \ncontract. I know from personal experience how simply stalling \nnegotiations of a contract can bust a union and cause major economic \nhardship for people. My brother Frank was a proud UAW member for 23 \nyears. He worked at the old Delavan manufacturing plant in Des Moines. \nIn 23 years, he missed only 5 days of work--all of them because of \nblizzards. He made a good living. He was a dedicated employee. During \nthose 23 years, there was never one strike or work stoppage. Delavan \nmade good money.\n  But then Old Man Delavan decided to retire and sell the company. A \ngroup of investors bought it. And one of the new owners bragged that, \n``If you want to see how to get rid of a union, come to Delavan, and \nwe'll show you how.''\n  He made good on that boast. When the contract came up, the company \nput forward conditions that no union could agree to in good conscience. \nThe owners refused to budge, and the UAW local had no choice but to go \nout on strike for the first time. When they did, the company brought in \nreplacement workers. It was a long, bitter\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nstrike. And after 1 year as allowed by labor law--they had a \ndecertification vote. Who votes to decertify the union? The workers who \nare there--the replacement workers. They didn't want to lose their \njobs, so they voted to decertify.\n  So after 23 years Frank was out of a job. He lost his union job with \nexcellent pay, vacation time, and a pension. And what does a 54-year-\nold deaf man do in a predicament like that? He got a job as a janitor \nat a shopping mall--working nights for minimum wage, with no benefits \nand no vacation time. It didn't just destroy his livelihood. It broke \nhis spirit.\n  My friends, that is what happens when unions are weakened and \ndestroyed. It jeopardizes our standard of living and our whole middle-\nclass way of life. And, my friends, that is exactly what is happening, \ntoday, to tens of millions of people all across America.\n  I quote a December, 2005 letter signed by 11 Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureates calling for greater international labor rights:\n\n       Even the wealthiest nation in the world--the United States \n     of America--fails to adequately protect workers' rights to \n     form unions and bargain collectively. Millions of U.S. \n     workers lack any legal protection to form unions and \n     thousands are discriminated against every year for trying to \n     exercise these rights.\n\n  It is time to level the playing field for workers in this country. It \nis time to give them a truly free and fair election process to decide \nif they want representation in the workplace. It's time to pass the \nEmployee Free Choice Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8225-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

And just last month, the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council renewed her sentence for yet another year.\n  Yet I am heartened to know that the Senate and the international \ncommunity are coming together to ensure that the abuses and injustices \nof the military junta in Burma do not go unnoticed.\n  Earlier this year, 45 United States Senators signed a letter to \nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban ki-Moon urging him to get \npersonally involved in pressing for Suu Kyi's release.\n  In a recent letter addressed to the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, a distinguished group of 59 former heads of state--including \nformer Filipino President Corazon Aquino, former Czech President Vaclav \nHavel, former British Prime Minister John Major and former Presidents \nBill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--called for the regime \nto release Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  They correctly noted that ``Aung San Suu Kyi is not calling for \nrevolution in Burma, but rather peaceful, nonviolent dialogue between \nthe military, National League for Democracy, and Burma's ethnic \ngroups.''\n  The calls for Suu Kyi's release are also coming from Burma's \nneighbors.\n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, now recognizes \nthat Burma's actions are not an ``internal matter'' but a significant \nthreat to peace and stability in the region. At a meeting of senior \ndiplomats last month, ASEAN made a clear call for Aung San Suu Kyi's \nrelease.\n  Last month, the women of the United States Senate came together to \nform the Women's Caucus on Burma to express our solidarity with Suu \nKyi, call for her immediate release urge the United Nations to pass a \nbinding resolution on Burma.\n  At our inaugural event, we were pleased to be joined by First Lady \nLaura Bush, who added her own voice to those calling for peace and \ndemocracy in Burma.\n  And last week, Senator McConnell along with 58 of our colleagues \nintroduced legislation to renew the import ban on Burma for another \nyear.\n  Our message is clear: We will not remain silent, we will not stand \nstill until Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners are released \nand democratic government is restored in Burma.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8225-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE RALPH BURNETT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of the \nHonorable Ralph M. Burnett, a Maryland district court judge and a \npioneer in the fight against prostate cancer. He was an exemplary \ncitizen of our State, and his contributions to the Maryland judicial \nsystem and the advocacy groups he worked with will not be forgotten. On \nMay 9, 2007, Judge Burnett died from complications related to prostate \ncancer at the age of 64.\n  Judge Burnett was born in 1943 in Seneca Falls, NY. After graduating \nfrom St. Paul's High School in 1961, he earned a bachelor's degree from \nDickinson College in 1965. A Vietnam veteran, Judge Burnett was \nstationed in Korea as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army until 1969. \nAfter returning to America, he enrolled in the Baltimore School of Law, \nwhere he received his law degree in 1972.\n  Judge Burnett began his private practice in Oakland, MD, in 1972 and \nhe lived in the Oakland area until his passing. He served as Garrett \nCounty's State attorney from 1974 until 1978, and in December 1993, he \nwas appointed as an associate district court judge for Garrett County \nby then-Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer. Judge Burnett was a \nmember of the executive committee of the Maryland Judicial Conference \nand served on the editorial board of Justice Matters until his death.\n  After being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1996, Judge Burnett \nbecame a devoted advocate and tenacious leader for the prostate cancer \ncommunity. In 1997, he was elected to the board of the National \nProstate Cancer Coalition, NPCC, and served as chairman of the \norganization from 1999 until 2001. Under Judge Burnett's leadership, \nthe National Prostate Cancer Coalition tripled in size during his \ntenure. After stepping down as chairman, Judge Burnett remained active \nas a member of the board and continued to pursue patient rights and \ngreater treatment options for men with prostate cancer.\n  Judge Burnett was an advocate for Johns Hopkins University's \nSpecialized Program of Research Excellence, SPORE, and also served on \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, research panels. As a member of the DOD \nProstate Cancer Research Program Integration Panel, Judge Burnett \nworked to find the best ways to leverage the Department's investment in \nprostate cancer research. He was also a committed member of the \nConsortium Panel of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research \nProgram, which discovered the lethal phenotype that causes prostate \ncancer.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending \ncondolences to Judge Burnett's family and friends and in expressing \nappreciation for his life of community service and his commitment to \nprostate cancer research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8225-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8225-S8226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF EDINBURG, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

He became the first postmaster of Edinburg when the \npost office was established in 1882. The town of Edinburg was named in \nhonor of the university where Mr. Buck obtained his college education. \nThe first establishments in Edinburg included a blacksmith shop and a \ndrug store.\n  Despite a significant fire that destroyed nearly all of the town's \nbusinesses in 1900, Edinburg has grown and flourished since its \nbeginning. Known as the Bird Capital of North Dakota, Edinburg offers \nmany opportunities for bird enthusiasts to observe nature at its \nfinest.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a very \nspecial Idahoan who has undertaken a very important and challenging \nmission. Many people are moved by a cause; few are inspired to take \naction and leadership in support of such cause. David Joseph Lynch is \none of the few. In 2004, Mr. Lynch was moved by the plight of Israeli \nschoolchildren--Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Bedouin, Baha'i and Christian--\nwho do not have ready access to English language books because of \nlimited financial resources and demands on the Israeli government in \nits ongoing war against terrorism. He read an article about the Jade \nBar-Shalom Books for Israel Project and knew immediately that this was \nhis calling. This grandfather of three and great grandfather of four \nwho will be 89 next\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\nmonth, founded the Idaho flagship of the international Books for Israel \nproject.\n  Between 2004 and 2006, Mr. Lynch gathered over 10,000 books from \nIdaho schools to send to Israel for the schoolchildren there. His goal \nis to have books donated from all the counties in Idaho. Mr. Lynch has \nenlisted supporters from the community including school officials, \nbookstore owners, a restaurant franchise, Office Depot, Boise State \nUniversity, and even members of the criminal justice community in \nBoise.\n  I commend Mr. Lynch on his outstanding efforts and thank him also for \nhis esteemed service in the U.S. Navy before and during World War II. \nClearly, David Joseph Lynch embodies a life of service and a commitment \nto improving humanity. He is an inspiration to all--a man whose \nsingular efforts are felt across the globe by our friends in \nIsrael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8227-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SVIHOVEC FAMILY TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th \nanniversary of the last great wave of homesteading upon the prairies of \nAmerica. Mr. President 1907 was the high water mark of the western \nboom, the last real chance for entrepreneurs and pioneers to capture \n160 acres of free land.\n  Homesteading was one of those singular inventions that proved a \ntriumphant success--one that gave families of modest means a genuine \nopportunity to share in the American dream.\n  Among the tens of thousands who surged west to take part in this \ngreat enterprise was a family of Bohemian emigrants--the Svihovecs. \nThey are particularly intriguing because seven brothers homesteaded \nside by side. While it was not unusual for family groups to homestead \nnear each other, the uniqueness of seven brothers doing so was \nunprecedented in homesteading history.\n  Although only two decades removed from their near feudal farm \nexistence in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Svihovecs were shrewd \nenough to strategically locate their homesteads to nearly surround a \nsection of railroad-owned land, thereby protecting it for their own use \nand future purchase.\n  These brothers and their equally hearty Czech spouses were Frank and \nRose Svihovec, Charles and Anna Svihovec, Vincent and Anna Svihovec, \nJoseph and Annie Svihovec, Emil and Barbara Svihovec, and two single \nbrother, James, and Louis. Their homesteads were in southwestern North \nDakota, along the Hettinger and Adams County line. Two more brothers, \nRudolph--and his wife Nellie--and Edward--and his wife Terezie--opted \nto become businessmen, one in Minneapolis and other in the New York \nCity area.\n  The homesteaders' beginning was inauspicious. There was a train wreck \non the way west. Upon their arrival, they were met by the blackened \ndesolation of one of the great western prairie fires which had burned \nthe expected winter feed for their livestock. Snowbound the first \nwinter, they ran out of food.\n  There were other setbacks and tragedies, but a life was created for \nthemselves and almost 40 offspring, so many children that the school \nbecame known as the Svihovec School.\n  A hundred years later, descendants of these Svihovec pioneers are \nscattered from London to Los Angeles. A number still remain near the \nhomesteads, in the communities of Mott and Hettinger, and one couple, \nJohn and Arlyce Frieze, still actively farm and ranch part of the \noriginal homestead lands. Most of the original homesteads, in fact, \nremain in the ownership of one of the Svihovec families.\n  It is a remarkable saga, a tale of grit and courage, one that \nillustrates the kind of strength of character and hardy determination \nthat has served America so well for so many years. The Svihovec tribe \nhas a proud, vital, and continuing legacy that I am honored to \nacknowledge and salute today in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8227-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SUPHADA ROM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. I want to speak briefly about a remarkable event \nthat happened last Friday, June 15, 2007, in the small town of Windsor \nin my home State of Vermont. But first a bit of history.\n  In January 1989, a member of my staff, Tim Rieser, traveled to the \nThai-Cambodia border to locate a young Cambodian woman whose mother and \ntwo brothers, all of them survivors of the Khmer Rouge holocaust, had \nresettled in Vermont. The woman, Rhumdoul Rom, had been kidnapped and \nsmuggled back into Cambodia, but she had escaped and was in a Thai \nrefugee camp.\n  When Rhumdoul was located she was holding her 5-day-old baby \ndaughter, whose name was Suphada. A few days and several long airplane \nrides later, the two of them arrived in Vermont where they were \nreunited with the rest of their family. Sadly, Suphada's grandfather \nand other family members were among the 2 million Cambodians who were \nmurdered or starved to death by the Khmer Rouge. One of Rhumdoul's \nsisters survived, and is living in Cambodia today.\n  Adjusting to Vermont was not easy. Imagine traveling for the first \ntime on an airplane and arriving from the tropics in a foreign land in \nthe middle of winter, ice and snow everywhere, and not speaking a word \nof English.\n  But the family persevered, supported by the generosity of the Windsor \ncommunity. As the years passed, Rhumdoul learned English, graduated \nfrom high school and then community college, and became a skilled \nmedical technician, at the same time that she was raising her daughter \nas a single mother.\n  Suphada, coming to America so young, learned English easily and over \ntime became an outstanding student and athlete. She won a prize for her \nwriting, learned to play the flute, served meals at a local nursing \nhome, and this year she was the captain of the Windsor girls' \nbasketball team. She is also a very outgoing and friendly person.\n  Recently, tragedy struck the family again, when Rhumdoul's mother and \nSuphada's grandmother, Prak Soy, died suddenly of meningitis. My wife \nMarcelle and I had the privilege of meeting Prak Soy, for whom living \nin the Unites States was not easy. I will always remember her as a \nselfless person who cared deeply for her children and grandchildren. \nThey meant the world to her.\n  This is a family that has experienced great loss, but they are also \nan example for those of us who have never known what it is to live \nthrough something as horrifying as genocide.\n  On June 15, Suphada graduated from Windsor High School, and I \nunderstand that she has been accepted to several colleges, including, I \nam proud to say, my own alma mater, St. Michael's College in \nColchester, VT. It is also the alma mater of another accomplished \nCambodian refugee, Loung Ung, who years ago resettled in Vermont and \nhas since become a world renowned author for her book ``First They \nKilled My Father,'' and a tireless campaigner against the scourge of \nlandmines.\n  I, Marcelle, and my staff would have liked to attend Suphada's \ngraduation, but it was not possible due to the Senate's schedule and \nother commitments. But I want to congratulate her and her mother for \nher outstanding scholastic and athletic achievements, and wish her the \nbest in the coming year at whichever college she chooses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8227-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8227-S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING JOSEPH SIMUNOVICH\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I honor Joseph Simunovich \nfor his leadership, dedication, and accomplishments at Hackensack \nUniversity Medical Center and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Joe \nretired as chairman of the board of these great New Jersey institutions \nearlier this year.\n  Joe's life of public service spans more than three decades. In 1972, \nhe was elected to serve as a Hudson County freeholder, a position he \nheld for 12 years, 3 of them as director/chairman of the board. In \n1986, Joe was appointed by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean to serve on \nthe New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Reappointed by Governors \nJim Florio and Christine Whitman, for a total of six consecutive terms, \nJoe is the longest serving member in the organization's history.\n  In 2002, Joe was chosen by Governor James McGreevey to serve as the \nchairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, where he led the \norganization through the consolidation with\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\nthe New Jersey Highway Authority. Additionally, Joe oversaw the \nremediation of New Jersey's E-Z Pass system, and the introduction of \nExpress E-Z Pass.\n  Over the past 17 years of Joe's service on the Board of Governors of \nHackensack University Medical Center, no one has had a greater hand in \nmaking Hackensack the respected and sought out institution it is today. \nAs chairman of the board, Joe has worked tirelessly to raise money for \nthe expansion of hospital programs. This money means more access to \nmedical treatments, increased technology, and better financial \nassistance for low-income patients.\n  Additionally, Joe has dutifully served on numerous boards of \ndirectors, including New Jersey City University, the New Brunswick \nDevelopment Corporation, the National Association of Water Companies, \nand the National Council for Public-Private Partnerships. As a result \nof his hard work, Joseph Simunovich has helped improve the quality of \nlife for thousands of families living throughout New Jersey.\n  Dedicated to both his community and family, Joe is married and has \ntwo children and several grandchildren. He received his bachelor's \ndegree from Colgate University and masters in business management \nequivalent from Fairleigh Dickinson University, and completed \npostgraduate coursework at the Carnegie Institute and guest lectured at \nRutgers University School of Business.\n  There is no doubt Joseph Simunovich is an exemplary leader and a \nprofoundly committed individual who is a true role model for the \nnation. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Joseph Simunovich, \nand know my colleagues will join in wishing him continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8228-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WARNE NUNN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, one of the privileges of \nrepresenting Oregon in the U.S. Senate is having the honor of serving \nin the seat held for 30 years by Mark Hatfield. During his nearly half \ncentury of service to the people of Oregon as a State Representative, \nState Senator, Secretary of State, Governor, and U.S. Senator, Mark \nHatfield earned a reputation for honesty and integrity. He also earned \na reputation for having an outstanding staff--staff who often went on \nto outstanding careers in public service in their own right.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most distinguished of the \n``Hatfield Alumni,'' Warne Nunn, who passed away earlier this week in \nOregon at the age of 86. Warne Nunn served as chief of staff to Mark \nHatfield during his 8 years as Oregon's Governor, and when Oregonians \nsent Mark Hatfield to the U.S. Senate in 1966, Warne Nunn came east to \nhelp open up the Senate office.\n  Mr. Nunn's heart, however, was in his beloved Oregon, and he soon \nreturned home, where he was to make numerous positive contributions for \nfour more decades. As a long-time executive with Pacific Power and \nLight, Warne Nunn was a respected leader in Oregon's business \ncommunity. It was, however, through his philanthropic leadership where \nWarne Nunn left a legacy that should inspire us all.\n  As a long-time member and chairman of the Willamette University Board \nof Trustees, Warne Nunn was a passionate advocate for quality \neducation. His commitment to education could also be seen in the \nleadership he provided as a long-time trustee of the Meyer Memorial \nTrust, one of the largest and most generous philanthropies in the \nPacific Northwest. During its 25-year history--throughout which Warne \nNunn has served as a trustee or trustee emeritus--Meyer Memorial Trust \nhas donated nearly $420 million to countless worthy causes.\n  Senator Hatfield once told me of a journey he made to the Calcutta \nslums with Mother Teresa. During that journey, Senator Hatfield asked \nMother Teresa how she could go on day after day, knowing that for every \nlife she touched, there were thousands of lost souls she would never \nreach. She responded by saying: ``God does not call us to be \nsuccessful. He calls us to be faithful.''\n  There can be no doubt that Warne Nunn lived a successful life. But \nhis family and friends will tell you that more important to Warne was \nthe fact that he lived a faithful life. He was a faithful husband, \nfather, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was a faithful friend. \nHe was a faithful businessman, public servant, and philanthropic \nleader. Above all, he was a faithful servant of God. I join many fellow \nOregonians in paying tribute to the life and legacy of Warne Nunn, and \nin extending my sincere condolences to his wife Delores and his entire \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8228-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8228-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8228-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Brandon, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills:\n\n       H.R. 923.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado concerning the 2007 Farm Bill, and, \n     in connection therewith, continuing support for the Federal \n     food stamp program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 07-003\n\n       Whereas, the provisions of the federal ``Farm Security and \n     Rural Investment Act of 2002'' (Farm Bill) that govern \n     national food assistance programs are set to expire this \n     year; and\n       Whereas, the Food Stamp Program (Program), our nation's \n     first defense against hunger and a major component of the \n     Farm Bill, bolsters the efforts of the national emergency \n     food assistance system; and\n       Whereas, the Program is efficiently targeted to reach the \n     urgent needs of people who have the most difficulty \n     purchasing adequate food; and\n       Whereas, over 95% of benefits from the Program go to \n     households with incomes below the poverty level, 80% of which \n     benefits go to families with children, and nearly all of the \n     remaining beneficiaries are elderly or disabled; and\n       Whereas, the error rates for overpayment and underpayment \n     to beneficiaries under the Program have steadily declined for \n     the last six years and are now at an all-time low; and\n       Whereas, the federal government fed some 26 million low-\n     income people at a cost of $31 billion, nearly double the \n     federal expenditure for welfare cash assistance programs; and\n       Whereas, $323 million in federal food stamp funds are \n     currently received by Colorado, yet, if an additional 185,000 \n     eligible individuals participated in the Program, as much as \n     an additional $158 million from federal funds would flow into \n     the state; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture \n     estimates that, for every $5.00 in food stamp benefits, an \n     additional $9.20 is generated in local economic activity; and\n       Whereas, the Program pays dividends for low-income \n     consumers, food producers and manufacturers, grocery \n     retailers, and communities; and\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\n       Whereas, as food stamp purchases made with Program benefits \n     flow through grocery checkout lines, farmers' markets, and \n     other outlets, those benefits generate almost double their \n     value in economic activity, especially for many hard-pressed \n     rural and urban communities desperately in need of business \n     and job stimulus; and\n       Whereas, hunger has adverse consequences for all \n     Coloradans, particularly for children and mothers; and\n       Whereas, too many people in our communities lack the \n     resources to consistently put food on their tables for \n     themselves and their families; and\n       Whereas, while the Program has substantially decreased \n     malnutrition in our country and helps prevent the problem of \n     hunger from becoming worse in our communities, the Program \n     currently reaches only about one-half of eligible low-income \n     working families; and\n       Whereas, food stamps outreach and nutrition education \n     programs are useful tools in the fight against hunger, but \n     these efforts need more resources in order to fully reach \n     their potential; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein,\n       (1) That we, the Colorado General Assembly, support the \n     passage of the 2007 Farm Bill;\n       (2) That we strongly urge Congress to place top priority on \n     implementing a section of the Farm Bill on nutrition that \n     would renew the provisions of, and improve upon, the Program; \n     and\n       (3) That we further urge Congress: To improve the adequacy \n     of benefits to help reduce hunger and ensure that everyone in \n     the Program has the resources to assist them in purchasing \n     and preparing a nutritionally adequate diet; to simplify the \n     Program for clients and their caseworkers; and to continue to \n     simplify and streamline the administrative aspects of the \n     Program; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be transmitted \n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, United States \n     Senator Tom Harkin, United States Representative Collin \n     Peterson, the Colorado Anti-Hunger Network, and to each \n     member of Colorado's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-139.

That the Congress of the United States enact and fully \n     fund the proposed vision for space exploration, as submitted \n     to Congress in the fiscal year 2008 budget of the United \n     States government, to enable the United States to remain a \n     leader in the exploration and development of space.\n       2. That the Secretary of State transmit copies of this \n     Memorial to the President of the United States, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives and each Member of the Congress from \n     the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-140. A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Maine urging Congress to \n     raise the weight limit on Interstate 95; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Interstate 95 in the State of Maine, which is part \n     of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways and is governed by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of \n     1956, is central to Maine's commerce and industry; and\n       Whereas, the weight limit on the Interstate Highway System \n     is set at 80,000 pounds by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of \n     1956 and consequently by Maine statute, yet the State of \n     Maine has a 100,000-pound limit on its secondary roads, which \n     does not match the national limit; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has given the State of \n     Maine an exemption from the 80,000-pound limit for the last 5 \n     miles of the Maine Turnpike and Interstate 95, which allows \n     for a 100,000-pound limit, and this exemption matches the \n     limit for the rest of the State; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, take this opportunity to request that \n     the United States Congress allow the State of Maine a \n     100,000-pound limit on all of the Interstate Highway System \n     in Maine, not only the authorized 5 miles, and that the \n     United States Congress review this request when the Highway \n     Bill comes up for reauthorization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-141. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine urging Congress to enact the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is a trust fund that is intended \n     as a compact between generations, yet it has not always been \n     treated in a manner similar to other trust funds; and\n       Whereas, Maine's educators, transportation workers, police, \n     firefighters and other civil servants, as well as their \n     spouses, have collectively contributed tens of billions of \n     dollars to Social Security and should in good faith receive \n     such benefits as have been projected to them annually in \n     their personalized Social Security statements; and\n       Whereas, the federal ``government pension offset \n     provision'' and the federal ``windfall elimination \n     provision,'' enacted, respectively, in 1977 and 1983, have \n     effectively treated state government pensions as if they were \n     a provenance of Social Security, which they are not, and have \n     in this treatment appropriated hundreds of billions of \n     dollars previously entrusted to Social Security by the civil \n     servants of 15 states and by their spouses; and\n       Whereas, by unfairly taking these hundreds of billions of \n     dollars from just 15 states, including Maine, these twin \n     federal policies have adversely and disproportionately \n     affected Maine's ability to attract and retain effective and \n     qualified workers, as well as Maine's overall economy, its \n     schools, its tax base and its taxpayers and other residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine has worked hard, over \n     generations, to attract, retain and provide for its state \n     workers in their retirement and has scrupulously guarded and \n     invested the funds entrusted to its retirement system, \n     bringing those reserves to 100 times the value they had just \n     4 decades ago; and\n       Whereas, federal legislation has been introduced entitled \n     the Social Security Fairness Act of 2007, proposing to repeal \n     these unfair takings from Maine and from other states; and\n       Whereas, all Members of the Maine Congressional Delegation \n     are cosponsors of this legislation, along with more than 200 \n     other members of Congress as of mid-February; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress enact the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2007; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     the President of the Senate of the United State, the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives of the United States and each \n     Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8230-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, without \n     amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

(for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Harkin, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 1673. A bill to facilitate the export of United States \nagricultural products to Cuba as authorized by the Trade Sanctions \nReform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, to remove impediments to the \nexport to Cuba of medical devices and medicines, to allow travel to \nCuba by United States citizens, to establish an agricultural export \npromotion program with respect to Cuba, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation \nwith Senator Mike Crapo, House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel, \nand Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson to help open a promising market to \nAmerican exports. That market is Cuba.\n  For too long, we have maintained ideologically driven restrictions \nthat have undermined our export competitiveness in a market 90 miles \naway from us.\n  Just beyond our shoreline, our trading partners--especially Canada \nand China--are making multi billion-dollar investments in a Cuban \neconomy that is growing at a rate of 7 to 12 percent per year. But the \nUnited States just stands by while these and other countries capitalize \non opportunities in our own backyard.\n  Our economic policy toward Cuba simply is not working. This bill \nchanges that.\n  The greatest opportunities exist in Cuba's agriculture sector. When \nCongress passed legislation allowing food and medicine sales to Cuba in \n2000, some people said Cuba would never buy. Fidel Castro himself \npredicted that Cuba would buy ``not one grain'' from the United States.\n  But Mr. Castro was wrong. Agricultural sales happened. In 2004 alone, \nCubans bought more than $375 million in American agricultural products. \nAnd, today, nearly every state in the union wants to get into the \nlargest agriculture market in the Caribbean.\n  I have worked tirelessly to market Montana's high quality agriculture \nproducts, and it has paid off. In 2003, I inked a $10 million deal with \nCuba. After we completed that deal, I went back to Havana and signed \nanother deal--for $15 million. We have sent Montana wheat, beans and \npeas to Cuba, and that is just the beginning.\n  But it has not been easy. In 2005, the Treasury Department issued a \nrule to undermine the will of Congress. In landmark legislation, \nCongress in 2000 facilitated agriculture exports to Cuba by authorizing \nthe use of cash basis sales. But the Treasury rule made such \ntransactions impossible. Instead, sellers had to resort to foreign \nletters of credit, which are time-consuming, complicated, and \nexpensive, especially for smaller exporters.\n  The Treasury rule stunted what had been meteoric growth in American \nagriculture exports to Cuba. This rule flies in the face of the law, \nand it will not stand.\n  Today's bill overturns the Treasury rule. It clarifies that not only \ndo we intend to let these cash basis sales go forward, we mean to \nexpand and promote them. This bill also ensures that exporters and \ncommodity groups looking to get into the Cuban market get help from the \nDepartment of Agriculture. And it would require our Agriculture \nDepartment to promote American agricultural exports for Cuba.\n  Increased agriculture sales will allow Cubans to become familiar with \nmore and more American branded food products. But a little-known \nprovision of U.S. law--known as section 211--invites Cuba to withhold \ntrademark protection from these and other American food exports. \nToday's bill also addresses that problem.\n  Section 211 bars U.S. courts from hearing claims of foreign nationals \nto trademarks similar to or associated with expropriated properties. It \nalso forbids the United States from allowing foreign nationals to \nregister or renew such trademark rights. In other words, it denies \ntrademark protection to Cuban assets. If we are not going to recognize \nCuban brands, why should Cuba, in the future, recognize American \nbrands?\n  The World Trade Organization has already struck down section 211 as \ninconsistent with U.S. international trade obligations. It is time for \nthis Congress to do the same. My bill repeals this wrong-headed and \nWTO-inconsistent provision. It ensures the continued security of \nthousands of American-owned trademarks already registered in Cuba.\n  I am a big proponent of getting American food products into Cuba. But \nI also fundamentally believe that we should never use food and medicine \nas a weapon against a people, no matter what we think of their \ngovernment.\n  Many of my colleagues agree with me on this. This is why Congress, in \nthe 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, authorized medicine and medical supplies \nsales to Cuba. But, at that time, we didn't get it quite right. We \npassed a law with good intent but loaded it up with so many \nrestrictions that we have made medical sales to Cuba more difficult \nthan medical sales to Iran or North Korea.\n  My bill will correct this lopsided and inhumane policy. It will allow \nCubans access to our medicines and medical products--which are the best \nmoney can buy--on the same terms that we offer to other regimes. There \nis no sound reason to deny our products to our Cuban neighbors but \nallow such sales to Iran and North Korea.\n  I have taken Montana farmers and ranchers to Cuba to explore export \nopportunities. But such opportunities are rare because our government, \nwith limited exceptions, does not permit travel to Cuba. And those \nexceptions are so riddled with red tape as to discourage applicants \nfrom making use of them.\n  Many Americans are ready and willing to travel to Cuba, and not just \nto make agriculture sales. Religious organizations have deep roots on \nthe island--since before the Castro government. They are a lifeline, \nbringing hope, help, and brotherhood to their counterparts in Cuba. \nAmerican academics and professionals engage in thoughtful exchanges of \nresearch and ideas. American students visit with Cuban students, and \nthey learn lessons a teacher cannot imbue.\n  Nearly everyone in Cuba has a dear friend or relative living in the \nUnited States. Tens of thousands of Cubans who found their way to \nAmerica save their hard earned dollars on frequent trips home, their \nbags packed with medicine, vitamins, and clothing.\n  Rather than encourage these meaningful contacts between Cubans and \nAmericans, our government stifles our interaction. Rather than unite \nthe Cuban family, our government seeks to divide it further.\n  Americans do not benefit from this policy. The Cuban people do not \nbenefit from this policy. Only those who seek to keep Americans and \nCubans apart benefit from our misguided policy of isolation.\n  It is time to reach out to the Cuban people. It is time to restore \nAmericans' fundamental right to travel anywhere they want. It is time \nto lift the travel ban.\n  I am proud of our bill. It spells out the right policy during this \nfundamental transition in Cuba. It helps farmers and ranchers in \nMontana and elsewhere seek opportunities in a nearby market. And it \naffords our citizens the opportunity to spread American generosity, \nassistance, and values to Cuba.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Crapo, Chairman Rangel, \nCongresswoman Emerson, and others to put our trade relationship with \nCuba on the right path.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Carper, Mr. Brown, Mr. Casey, and Ms. Stabenow):\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\n  S. 1677. A bill to amend the Exchange Rates and International \nEconomic Coordination Act of 1988 and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Currency Reform and \nFinancial Markets Access Act of 2007 on behalf of myself, Senator \nShelby, Senator Bayh, Senator Carper, Senator Brown, and Senator Casey.\n  Nearly two decades ago, the Senate Banking Committee enacted \nlegislation which required the Treasury Department to identify \ncountries that manipulate their currency for purposes of gaining an \nunfair competitive trade advantage and to take prompt action to \neliminate the unfair trade advantage when manipulation is found.\n  One of the very first actions that I undertook as chairman-elect of \nthe Senate Banking Committee in December 2006 was to write a letter \nwith then-Chairman Shelby to the Treasury Secretary about the report \nrequired under this legislation, the International Economic and \nExchange Rate Policy Report and the inaugural U.S.-China strategic \neconomic dialogue, SED. In that letter, we expressed our concern that \nthe Treasury Department had not cited China, and potentially other \nnations, as currency manipulators.\n  At one of the very first hearings I held as chairman, in January \n2007, Treasury Secretary Paulson provided his first congressional \ntestimony since his confirmation, on the SED and the exchange rate \nreport. At that hearing, Secretary Paulson testified that China did not \nmeet the technical requirement for designation as a currency \nmanipulator and that the SED is the ``best chance to get some progress \n[on the currency issue].''\n  Senator Shelby and I wrote to Secretary Paulson in advance of the \nmost recent exchange rate report and the May SED urging him to consider \nsteps beyond dialogue to eliminate the unfair trade advantage resulting \nfrom China's ongoing currency manipulation and discriminatory market \naccess practices. But instead of taking action, the Treasury Department \nonce again chose not to cite China as a currency manipulator in its \nlatest report to the Senate Banking Committee, despite acknowledging \n``heavy foreign exchange market intervention by China's central bank to \nmanage the currency tightly.''\n  Secretary Paulson's efforts to engage the Chinese through dialogue \nare commendable, but after two meetings of the strategic economic \ndialogue, numerous congressional hearings, and the shortcomings of the \nmost recent exchange rate reports, it is clear that dialogue alone is \nnot enough to make progress and legislative action is needed.\n  Therefore, Senator Shelby and I are today introducing the Currency \nReform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 which will provide the \nTreasury Department and Congress new, tough authority to recognize and \nremedy currency manipulation without ambiguity or delay.\n  Under current law, Treasury claims that no countries meet the \ntechnical finding of intent to manipulate their currencies. Treasury \nreiterated this point in its most recent exchange rate report, stating:\n\n       The Department of the Treasury concluded that, although the \n     Chinese currency is undervalued, China did not meet the \n     technical requirements for designation under the terms of \n     Section 3004 of the Act during the period under \n     consideration. Treasury was unable to determine that China's \n     exchange rate policy was carried out for the purpose of \n     preventing effective balance of payments adjustment or \n     gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade.\n\n  The Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 requires \na Treasury designation of currency manipulation based on objective \ndata, and without regard to subjective factors such as purpose or \nintent, removing a technicality that the Treasury Department has been \nusing to defend its inaction.\n  Once currency manipulation is found, the bill requires the Treasury \nDepartment to submit a detailed plan of action to the Congress within \n30 days of such finding. The plan of action sets specific timeframes \nand benchmarks, with the goal of remedying the manipulation. The bill \nalso requires the Treasury to initiate both bilateral and multilateral \nnegotiations, including immediate IMF consultations and to use the \nTreasury's voice and vote at the IMF to address the manipulation.\n  Our bill also provides new authority for the Treasury to file a WTO \narticle XV case to remedy currency manipulation if the goals and \nbenchmarks for progress are not met within 9 months of designation.\n  If the Treasury continues to avoid designating countries as currency \nmanipulators, our bill creates a new process by which Congress, led by \neither the Senate Banking or House Financial Services Committee, can \noriginate a joint resolution of disapproval of the Treasury's inaction \nand provides for an expedited process for such a motion through the \nfloors of both Chambers.\n  Finally, the Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 \npromotes market access for U.S. financial services firms to level the \nplaying field for American businesses and to help develop the financial \nsector reform needed to support a freely floating currency in China. It \nalso requires the Treasury Department to report on the progress of the \nSED, as well as on opening foreign markets to American financial \nservices firms. It is time for American firms to be afforded the same \nopen and fair treatment abroad that our country provides to foreign \nfirms in the United States.\n  I am confident that in a free and fair environment American business \nand entrepreneurship will flourish. Our bill will require Treasury to \nassume its responsibility as a referee and will fight to level this \nplaying field by identifying and addressing unfair practices and market \naccess barriers.\n  During the SED events in Beijing, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke \ntalked about the market distortions that result from ``an effective \nsubsidy that an undervalued currency provides for Chinese firms that \nfocus on exporting.'' I agree with Chairman Bernanke that undervalued \ncurrency is an export subsidy causing market disruptions and fully \ndealing with such subsidies can involve some trade remedies that are \nnot within the Banking Committee's jurisdiction and hence not within \nthe scope of this bill. But, remedying countervailable export subsidies \nis a policy that could be fully appropriate and supported by myself and \nmy colleagues through other legislative proposals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a one page summary \nof the bill, and letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill also promotes Treasury's role \n     in enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. financial services \n     firms.\n       Strengthens Treasury's ability to find currency \n     manipulation: Strengthens the definition of currency \n     manipulation to identify countries that have both a material \n     global current account surplus and a significant bilateral \n     trade surplus with the United States as currency \n     manipulators, without regard to intent.\n       Requires Treasury to address and remedy currency \n     manipulation: Requires the Treasury Department to submit a \n     detailed plan of action to the Congress within 30 days of a \n     finding by Treasury of manipulation. The plan of action shall \n     set specific timeframes and benchmarks, with the goal of \n     remedying the manipulation; Requires Treasury to engage in \n     bilateral and multilateral negotiations with countries that \n     manipulate their currency. The Treasury must immediately seek \n     IMF consultations when manipulation is found and requires \n     Treasury to use its voice and vote at the IMF to that end; \n     Provides Treasury the authority to file a WTO Article XV case \n     to remedy currency manipulation if the goals and benchmarks \n     are not met within 9 months.\n       Authorizes a Congressional disapproval process: Creates a \n     process by which Congress, led by either the Senate Banking \n     or House Financial Services Committee, can originate a joint \n     resolution of disapproval when Treasury fails to cite \n     manipulation. Provides for an expedited process for such a \n     motion through the floors of both chambers.\n       Promotes market access for U.S. financial services firms: \n     Requires Treasury to annually monitor and report to the \n     Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services \n     Committee on market access barriers for U.S. financial \n     services firms, to identify challenges, and to develop plans \n     to address those barriers; Requires the Treasury's initial \n     report to include the status of the US-China Strategic \n     Economic Dialogue (SED) as it relates to financial services \n     firms. This would become the only congressionally required \n     report on the progress of the SED.\n\n\n                                 The Financial Services Forum,\n\n                                                    June 21, 2007.\n     Hon.

We commend your \n     bipartisan effort to introduce legislation that recognizes \n     the importance of further access for U.S. financial services \n     firms to China's markets.\n       The Forum is encouraged by the Senators' interest in the \n     U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue and efforts to remove \n     market access barriers for U.S. financial services firms.\n       A more open, modern, and effective financial sector in \n     China is a prerequisite to successfully addressing issues \n     that have complicated the U.S.-China economic relationship \n     such as currency reform and the trade imbalance.\n       The fastest way for China to develop the modern financial \n     system it needs to achieve more sustainable economic growth, \n     allow for a more flexible currency, and increase consumer \n     consumption--thereby opening new markets for U.S. products \n     and services--is to import it by opening its financial sector \n     to greater participation by foreign financial services firms.\n       We look forward to working with all of Congress in \n     continuing to draw focus and attention to this key issue for \n     economic reform and financial modernization in China and \n     other emerging markets.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald L.

Hartquist, counsel to the CCC. ``The Treasury Department \n     and the International Monetary Fund should make every effort \n     to discourage and correct protracted undervaluation of \n     countries' currencies as a monetary problem,'' he continued, \n     ``and the Dodd-Shelby bill is a significant help in this \n     regard. We appreciate that Chairman Dodd recognizes that \n     additional legislation may be appropriate to address \n     countervailable subsidies resulting from China's currency \n     manipulation.''\n       ``At the same time,'' noted Hartquist, ``when a currency is \n     seriously undervalued for a protracted period of time, as \n     China's has been since 1994, there are very damaging effects \n     on trade. It is vitally important that the hybrid nature of \n     this sort of exchange-rate misalignment is acknowledged so \n     that both the negative monetary and trade aspects of such \n     behavior by a country are addressed. That is why the CCC \n     continues to urge passage of the Bunning-Stabenow-Bayh-Snowe \n     bill, S. 796, and its counterpart in the House, the Ryan-\n     Hunter bill, H.R. 782. These bills recognize that undervalued \n     exchange-rate misalignment by China or any other country is \n     countervailable prohibited export subsidy under U.S. and \n     international law. The CCC is very grateful to Senators Bayh, \n     Bunning, and Stabenow and to Congressmen Ryan and Hunter for \n     their leadership on this important issue.''\n       The China Currency Coalition's co-chairs are AFL-CIO \n     Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more timely access to home health services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nConrad, Senator Smith, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Inouye, to \nintroduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and disabled citizens \nhave timely access to home health services under the Medicare Program.\n  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, \nand clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important \nroles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural \nand medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be \nin scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in \n1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services \nprovided by these health professionals as long as those services are \nwithin their scope of practice under State law.\n  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered \nnurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home \nhealth services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only \nphysicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for \nMedicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the \npatient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, \nthe certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the \npatient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, \nphysician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse \nmidwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, \nthis requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps \nto the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it \ncan lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home \nhealth care they need simply because a physician is not readily \navailable to sign the form.\n  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician \nassistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for \nMedicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these \nproviders may be the only health care professionals available. For \nexample, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a \nMedicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only \nhealth care professional\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nserving the patient's small rural town, and the supervising physician \nwas located 60 miles away.\n\n  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her \ncollaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. \nAs a consequence, the patient experienced a 2-day delay in getting \nneeded care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another \nphysician. Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous \nthat she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute \nfacility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to \nwait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and \noccupational therapy could continue simply because the home health \nagency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation \nof the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to \nauthorize when the patient was in the facility.\n  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure \nthat our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care they need when \nthey need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, \nclinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives to order home \nhealth services. Our legislation is supported by the National \nAssociation for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, \nthe American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of \nNurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, the \nAmerican Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse \nAssociations of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to sign onto this legislation as cosponsors. I \nask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                                     June 6, 2007.\n     Hon, Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Smith: I am writing on behalf of \n     the American Nurses Association, ANA, to express support for \n     the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007. ANA is \n     the only full- service national association representing \n     registered nurses, RNs. Through our 54 state and territorial \n     nursing associations, we represent RNs across the nation in \n     all practice settings.\n       ANA applauds your efforts to improve access to home health \n     services. Advanced practice registered nurses, APRNs, are \n     playing an increasing role in American health care delivery. \n     Nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and \n     certified nurse midwives can practice independent of \n     physicians in most states. Many studies have shown that APRNs \n     provide cost-effective, high quality care. In addition, they \n     are often willing to provide services in areas where access \n     to physicians is limited.\n       Medicare has recognized the independent practice of APRNs \n     for nearly two decades, and these health care professionals \n     now provide the majority of skilled care to home health \n     patients. Unfortunately, a quirk in Medicare law has kept \n     APRNs from signing home health plans of care and from \n     certifying Medicare patients for the home health benefit. In \n     areas where access to physicians is limited, this outdated \n     prohibition has lead to delays in health care delivery. These \n     delays in care inconvenience patients and their families. In \n     addition, delays can also result in increased cost to the \n     Medicare system when patients are unnecessarily left in more \n     expensive institutional settings.\n       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007 would \n     address these problems by specifically allowing nurse \n     practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified \n     nurse midwives to certify home health services. ANA looks \n     forward to working with you to support the enactment of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\nRose Gonzalez, MPS, RN Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                               Nurse-Midwives,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, June 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the certified nurse-\n     midwife, CNM, and certified midwife, CM, members of the \n     American College of Nurse-Midwives, ACNM, I am writing to \n     express strong support for the legislation you plan to \n     introduce this week to ensure appropriate and timely access \n     to necessary home health services for women that might be in \n     the care of a certified nurse-midwife or other primary care \n     provider.\n       As you know, currently Medicare only allows a physician to \n     order home health services for Medicare beneficiaries. ACNM \n     believes this is an antiquated requirement that fails to \n     recognize the role advanced practice nurses, including \n     certified nurse-midwives, play in the delivery of high \n     quality, primary care services. Your legislation would ensure \n     that a patient under the care of a certified nurse-midwife \n     can receive necessary home health services in a timely \n     manner. This is particularly important for those women with \n     disabilities who are covered by the Medicare program and are \n     of childbearing age. It is also important for senior women \n     who might be under the care of a certified nurse-midwife for \n     primary care services.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     matter. ACNM looks forward to working with you to see this \n     legislation's passage during the 110th Congress. For further \n     information on this matter, please contact Mr. Patrick \n     Cooney, ACNM's Federal Representative, at (202) 347-0034.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Eunice K.M.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Home Care & Hospice, NAHC, I am writing to offer our \n     appreciation and support for the Home Health Care Planning \n     Improvement Act of 2007 that would allow nurse practitioners, \n     NPs, clinical nurse specialists, CNSs, certified nurse \n     midwives, CNMs, and physicians' assistants, PAs, to sign \n     Medicare home health plans of care. We commend you for this \n     much needed legislation that will help ensure timely access \n     to home health services while reducing Medicare expenditures \n     on more costly institutional care.\n       NPs, CNSs, CNMs, and PAs are playing an increasing role in \n     the delivery of our nation's health care, especially in rural \n     and underserved areas, and are providing necessary medical \n     services to Medicare beneficiaries. They are often more \n     familiar with particular cases than the attending physician. \n     In addition, they are sometimes more readily available than \n     physicians to expedite the processing of necessary paperwork, \n     ensuring that home health agencies will be reimbursed in a \n     timely manner and that care to the beneficiary will not be \n     interrupted. Studies have shown that the expanded use of \n     these professionals can result in dramatic decreases in \n     expensive hospitalizations and nursing home stays.\n       We appreciate the outstanding leadership you have shown in \n     helping make home and community-based services more readily \n     available to our nation's elderly population and those with \n     disabilities.\n           With our highest regards,\n                                              Val J. Halamandaris,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Academy,\n\n\n                                       of Nurse Practitioners,\n\n                                     Washington, DC. June 7, 2007.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing in behalf of the \n     American Academy of Nurse Practitioners to endorse the \n     introduction of the Home Health Improvement Act of 2007. This \n     bill will authorize nurse practitioners to order home health \n     services for patients for whose care they are responsible.\n       As you know, nurse practitioners have been authorized Part \n     B Medicare providers since 1998. Under the provisions of this \n     law, nurse practitioners render, order and refer for services \n     under their own PIN and UPIN numbers. They may order physical \n     therapy, occupational therapy, bill as consultant and \n     consultees when providing services through telemedicine and \n     order and bill for performing and interpreting diagnostic \n     tests within their scope of practice. Despite their ability \n     to provide and bill for services in all of these areas, they \n     are still unable to refer patients for home health care.\n       Nurse practitioners have been demonstrated to provide safe \n     and responsible care to the patients they serve. They have \n     expert knowledge that allows them to provide high level \n     assessments of patient needs and recognize when additional \n     care, such as home health care is needed or not needed by \n     their patients. Given their proven track record in the care \n     of the elderly, it is not logical that nurse practitioners \n     are authorized to be Part B providers, but are unable to \n     order home health care and hospice care for their patients.\n       Currently nurse practitioners with patients needing home \n     health care services must locate a physician who will see the \n     patient and write the orders for this care. Not only is the \n     patient's well being jeopardized by the delays that are \n     incurred by this requirement, but added cost is incurred by \n     the Medicare program through extra visits to providers with \n     higher reimbursement rates than nurse practitioners. Passage \n     of this bill will increase the quality and timeliness of care \n     to patients who need home health nursing services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                Jan Towers PhD, NP-C, CRNP, FAANP,\n     Director of Health Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\n                                                 American College,\n\n\n                                       of Nurse Practitioners,\n\n                                                     June 7, 2007.\n     Hon.

A patient's \n     Nurse Practitioner, physicians' assistant, or certified nurse \n     midwife will now have the right to make changes to their home \n     health care plan. Your critical legislation will safeguard \n     the patient's continuity of care by preventing interruptions \n     due to delays in paperwork from an oftentimes off-site \n     physician who may never have even seen the patient.\n       The bill also recognizes the professional training and \n     qualifications of Nurse Practitioners and ensures quality \n     patient care, especially in rural and underserved areas where \n     Nurse Practitioners are often more familiar with particular \n     cases than the attending physician. ACNP thanks you for your \n     ongoing support of the Nurse Practitioner community.

The AAPA \n     strongly supports this important piece of legislation, and \n     looks forward to working with you to secure its passage \n     during the 110th Congress.\n       In 2006, nearly 231 million patient visits were made to \n     physician assistants (PAs) and over 286 million prescriptions \n     were written by PAs. PAs have a longstanding history of \n     providing care in medically underserved communities, and have \n     been credited with improving access to quality and cost-\n     effective health care for many among the nation's most \n     vulnerable patient populations.\n       Although the 1997 Balanced Budget Act extended Medicare \n     coverage of medical services provided by PAs, as allowed by \n     state law, PAs are not able to order home health care for \n     Medicare beneficiaries. At best, PAs and their supervising \n     physicians are forced to go through unnecessary extra steps \n     to ensure that all home health orders are signed by the \n     physician before the care is provided. At worst, Medicare \n     beneficiaries experience needless delays in receiving home \n     health care because a physician is not available on-site to \n     sign the form.\n       The inability of PAs to order home health care is \n     particularly burdensome for Medicare beneficiaries in \n     medically underserved communities where a PA may be the only \n     health care professional available. For example,\n       Needed home health care was delayed by over a week for a \n     Medicare patient in Nevada, because the PA's supervising \n     physician was located 60 miles away. The PA, who holds a \n     full-time job in another part of the state, is the only \n     health care professional for the patient's small rural town, \n     providing care two weekends a month;\n       critical access hospitals in Nevada and other states are \n     having difficulty with discharge planning. By law, critical \n     access hospitals must have a PA or nurse practitioner on site \n     fifty percent of the time. However, Medicare will not accept \n     home health orders that have been signed by a PA;\n       PAs in orthopedic practice regularly work after-hours and \n     on weekends. However, necessary home health care must be \n     delayed for Medicare beneficiaries until a physician is \n     available to sign the order.\n       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007 \n     increases Medicare beneficiaries' access to needed care by \n     allowing PAs to order home health care. The AAPA is pleased \n     to endorse the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of \n     2007.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                        Mary P. Ettari, MPH, PA-C,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1680. A bill to provide for the inclusion of certain non-Federal \nland in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and the Alaska Peninsula \nNational Wildlife Refuge in the State of Alaska, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Izembek and Alaska Peninsula \nWildlife Refuge and Wilderness Enhancement Act authorizes a land \nexchange among the U.S. Department of the Interior, the State of \nAlaska, and the people of King Cove. King Cove is an Alaska Native \nvillage and many of its present day residents descend from the \nindigenous Aleut people who have lived and thrived in this isolated \narea of the Alaska Peninsula for over 4,000 years.\n  This bill provides the land for a road on which to travel to the \nnearest all-weather airport which is located in Cold Bay. The people of \nKing Cove do not have a road to their airport today because a National \nWildlife Refuge wilderness sits between their village and Cold Bay.\n  World War II prompted the construction of a major air facility at \nCold Bay, which is about 25 miles north of King Cove. Today, the Cold \nBay Airport with a 10,000 foot main runway and a 6,500 foot crosswind \nrunway is one of the largest airport facilities in Alaska and is \naccessible 365 days a year. However, the problem for King Cove \nresidents has always been their inability to get to the airport on a \npredictable basis due to constant, ever changing weather conditions, \ncombined with King Cove's topographic constraints.\n  These topographic constraints are directly related to the location of \nKing Cove's small gravel airstrip nestled between 3,000 foot volcanic \npeaks. To access the airstrip in King Cove, pilots must navigate a \nnarrow opening in the mountains.\n  Over the past 30 years, efforts by King Cove residents attempting to \nreach the Cold Bay Airport have resulted in numerous small plane \ncrashes, some fatal. Neither King Cove nor Cold Bay have the sort of \nhospital facilities that are found in Anchorage. When King Cove people \nhave a serious medical condition, they need to be ``medevaced'' to \nAnchorage from Cold Bay. That assumes that they can reach the airport \nat Cold Bay.\n  This legislation accomplishes the goal of providing the King Cove \npeople with a road to the airport. It accomplishes this goal in a way \nthat provides a net gain, rather than a net loss, to wilderness. The \nexchange provided for in this bill will add 61,723 acres to the Izembek \nand Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuges. It adds 45,456 acres of \nwilderness, the first new wilderness areas designated by the Congress \nin Alaska in a generation. Not since the passage of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, ANILCA, has new wilderness been \ndesignated in Alaska.\n  More importantly, this bill will add key areas of wildlife habitat to \nthese two world-class wildlife refuges. Habitat for some of the largest \nand wildest brown bears in the world will transfer from private to \npublic ownership. Other areas include key habitat for internationally \nvalued waterfowl such as stellar eiders and brants.\n  I am sad to say that this is not a new issue for this body. The \npeople of King Cove have been seeking justice in the form of a simple \nroad to Cold Bay for decades. Congress attempted to make things right \nfor the people of King Cove about a decade ago and came up with an \nimperfect solution.\n  This imperfect solution involved the construction of a 17-mile road \nfrom King Cove to a point near the border of the Izembek Refuge \nwilderness and a very expensive hovercraft to ferry King Cove residents \nacross the rough waters of Cold Bay. The community has concluded that \nit cannot afford the cost of the hovercraft solution.\n  This bill will finish the job started by the Congress a few years \nago. This bill provides a wonderful combination of wilderness additions \nin return for a small road corridor within the Izembek Wildlife Refuge \nto permit the current 17-mile road to be completed all the way to Cold \nBay. This is the fairest and most logical process by which the King \nCove residents and the nation can all benefit.\n  I want to commend the parties who have worked on this bill. The State \nof Alaska, has brought nearly 43,000 acres to this exchange. Without \nthis land, the exchange would not be possible. The King Cove Native \nCorporation, which is a Village Corporation created\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nby the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act, ANCSA, is donating \napproximately 2,500 acres of high value wetland habitat in Kinzaroff \nLagoon. This lagoon is part of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and \nwill be designated as wilderness, so that the mouth of this lagoon will \nbe in public ownership. The corporation is also offering another 10,500 \nacres, which will be made part of the Alaska Peninsula Wildlife Refuge \nwhile relinquishing another 5,400 acres of their ANCSA land in the \nRefuge.\n  The only land, which will leave Federal ownership in the area, is \napproximately 206 acres for a narrow road to connect the existing road \nfrom King Cove to the Cold Bay Airport. The route and alignment of the \nroad, within the corridor established by the bill, will be determined \nthrough an inclusive, cooperative planning process.\n  It has been suggested by some that we should not reopen this issue--\nit has always been so controversial. People who fought this battle \nbefore, and still have the scars to prove it, were told that putting a \nroad in a national wildlife refuge creates a bad precedent. I have been \nwarned that every environmental group in the Nation will line up \nagainst me if I pursue the exchange.\n  That may be true but this is how I see it. In the 25 years that have \npassed since the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, \nANILCA, became law, I think most Alaskans have come to appreciate the \nvalue of setting aside land in Alaska for preservation. That \nappreciation took time. Many Alaskans, as you know, resisted ANILCA.\n  In return, it is appropriate for Alaskans to expect the conservation \nsystem units to be good neighbors to the aboriginal communities that \nthey border. That hasn't always been the case. The Aleut people of King \nCove inhabited their lands long before there was an Izembek National \nWildlife Refuge. The King Cove people steadfastly maintain that they \nwere not consulted before the decision was made to make the land that \nstands between their community and the airport a wilderness. It is \ntheir contention that thousands of others across the United States, \nCanada, and Europe were invited by the Federal Govermment to make their \nviews known in this process, yet they were denied a voice in this most \ncrucial decision affecting their native homeland.\n  To me the King Cove road isn't just a matter of transportation. It is \na matter of respect for Native people. That is why I am willing to take \nup this cause on behalf of the Native people of King Cove. I ask my \ncolleagues to join with me and with the Aleut people of King Cove to \nmake their dream of a road to the airport, something that those in the \nLower 48 take for granted, a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Izembek and Alaska Peninsula \n     Refuge and Wilderness Enhancement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) King Cove, Alaska, is--\n       (A) located 625 air miles from Anchorage, Alaska, on the \n     south side of the Alaska Peninsula, on a sand spit fronting \n     Deer Passage and Deer Island;\n       (B) accessible only by air and water; and\n       (C) 1 of the most geographically isolated areas of the \n     State of Alaska;\n       (2) constant adverse weather and limiting physical \n     topography make traveling in and out of King Cove directly by \n     air dangerous and impractical much of the time;\n       (3) King Cove is the homeland of Aleut people who--\n       (A) are federally recognized as indigenous peoples of the \n     United States;\n       (B) have fished, hunted, and subsisted in King Cove for \n     over 4,000 years; and\n       (C) refer to the King Cove community as ``Agdaagux'';\n       (4) the Agdaagux Tribal Council, which is the federally \n     recognized tribal government for King Cove, recognizes that \n     most of residents of King Cove are direct descendants of the \n     original Aleut inhabitants;\n       (5) in the 1940s, an airport capable of access by jets was \n     constructed by the United States Army at Cold Bay, which is \n     approximately 25 surface miles north of King Cove, to support \n     World War II related national security needs;\n       (6) while the Cold Bay Airport, which is now a civilian \n     airport operated by the State of Alaska, is the lifeline for \n     the King Cove people to the outside world, particularly for \n     the life, safety, and health needs of the indigenous \n     residents, there is no surface access between King Cove and \n     the airport;\n       (7) nearly all of the land between King Cove and Cold Bay \n     is--\n       (A) owned by the Federal Government as part of the Izembek \n     National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       (B) managed as wilderness; and\n       (8) the Agdaagux Tribal Council--\n       (A) maintains that the Council and the indigenous Aleut \n     people of King Cove were not consulted before the land that \n     separates residents from the nearest all-weather airport was \n     designated as wilderness, even though approximately 1,292 \n     people across the United States, Canada, and Europe--\n       (i) received notice of the potential designation; and\n       (ii) during 1969 and 1970, were expressly invited by the \n     Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the predecessor of \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to participate \n     in the process of considering whether the land should be \n     managed as wilderness;\n       (B) regards the failure of the Federal Government to \n     consult with the Council and the indigenous Aleut people of \n     King Cove as a ``wrong and troubling action taken by the \n     federal government'';\n       (C) submits that dozens of King Cove residents have died or \n     suffered grave health consequences in the past 30 years \n     because the residents could not reach timely medical \n     assistance in Anchorage, Alaska, that can only be accessed \n     via the all-weather Cold Bay Airport; and\n       (D) has expressed the full endorsement and support of the \n     Council for the construction of a road between King Cove and \n     the Cold Bay Airport as an expression of, and commitment to, \n     self-determination for the Aleut people of King Cove who were \n     not consulted before the land vital to the survival of the \n     Aleut people of King Cove was designated as wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for a paid family and medical leave \ninsurance program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Family Leave \nInsurance Act of 2007 and especially pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Stevens. This bill, which would provide 8 weeks of \npaid benefits to workers who take time off for reasons allowed under \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, is an important step in \ncontinuing to help our Nation's workers to be both productive employees \nand responsible family members.\n  Before the FMLA, workers had no guarantee that their jobs would still \nbe there if they took time off to care for loved ones or recover from \nillness themselves. Millions of Americans were forced into a \nchallenging dilemma: care for their families, or provide for them.\n  That is why I worked to create the FMLA in 1985, and that is why I \nfought for its passage through 7 years of obstruction and two \npresidential vetoes, pointing out that its denial of guaranteed leave \nput America virtually alone among nations, industrialized or otherwise.\n  Finally, on February 5, 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act was \nsigned into law. Under its protection, eligible workers receive 12 \nweeks of leave every year, so that they can watch over a newborn or \nadopted baby, or help a parent through an illness, or get better \nthemselves, knowing that their job will be there when they return. To \ndate, more than 50 million Americans have taken that opportunity. The \nFMLA isn't just good for American workers, it is good for American \nbusiness. Ninety percent of employers have reported that the FMLA had a \nneutral or positive effect on profits.\n  Today, the idea of guaranteed leave seems obvious; but now, it is \ntime to take another step in making that hard-won leave a possibility \nfor even more Americans. In the 21st century, working families should \nnot have to give up the leave they earned because they cannot afford \nit, they deserve paid leave.\n  Why do we offer nothing, when the European standard is 14 paid weeks? \nWhy are we one of only four countries in the world to deny paid \nmaternity leave, leaving us in the company of Swaziland, Liberia, and \nPapua New Guinea?\n  For every worker who can weather a day without pay, three more can't \nafford the loss. To these workers, unpaid leave is a hollow promise, an \nimpossible choice between the family they love and the job they need.\n  I believe it is a choice that no American should ever again be forced \nto make. When Congress passed and President Clinton signed the FMLA, we \naffirmed that health and family should never have to suffer because of \nthe demands of work. I fail to see why that right should only be \nafforded to Americans in a certain income bracket.\n  With the introduction of the Family Leave Insurance Act, we take a \nhuge step toward making family leave a possibility for all Americans. \nIts 8 weeks of paid leave per year will apply to employees who need \ntime off for any of the reasons included in the FMLA: birth of a child; \nplacement of an adopted or foster child; the care for a child, parent, \nor spouse with a serious medical condition; or recovery from a serious \npersonal medical condition. Benefits will be tiered on the basis of \nwages, with the tiers themselves indexed to inflation. This structure \nwill provide the greatest benefit to those with the lowest salaries. \nAnd workers who are covered by the FMLA will retain their health \ninsurance and will be guaranteed a return to their job, or a comparable \nposition, on their return.\n  The act creates a new Family Leave Insurance Fund into which premiums \nare paid, to finance benefit payments, allowing stakeholders to pool \nrisk and lower costs, and funded through small, shared premiums. Those \ncosts will be shared by employees and employers; the Federal Government \nwill pay for administrative costs. Participation will be mandatory for \nall businesses with 50 employees or more; those with fewer employees \ncan choose to participate and receive a discount on premium payments. \nTo reduce administrative burdens for employers and employees, employers \nwill pay leave benefits to employees through their regular payroll, \nwith prompt reimbursement from the Family Leave Insurance Fund.\n  We know that many employers, both large and small, offer very \ngenerous leave policies, exemplifying best business practices. Through \nthis legislation, we seek to support companies who offer paid leave so \nthey continue to do so, and to create an incentive for smaller \ncompanies to offer paid leave. A provision in the bill allows employers \nto maintain their own paid leave plan, if it is certified to be \nequivalent or better to the plan in this legislation.\n  Our bill will also allow States flexibility in maintaining their \nexisting programs. Several States already have systems to provide paid \nfamily and medical leave, and several more have legislation pending to \ncreate such systems. In recent years, more than 25 States have \nintroduced legislation to create paid leave programs. The landscape in \nthe States is changing quickly on policies for working families and \nthere are complex issues around the interaction between this \nlegislation, State programs and employers within States. We look \nforward to collaborating with States so they can maintain maximum \nflexibility, and provide the best leave policy, as the bill moves \nforward.\n  As the FMLA has demonstrated so strongly, family leave benefits both \nworkers and businesses, and that is certainly the case for paid family \nleave. Paid leave cuts down on employee turnover and the high costs of \ntraining replacements; it has been shown to raise morale and \nproductivity; and it levels the playing field by allowing small \nbusinesses to adopt a benefit that many of their larger competitors \nhave been offering for years.\n  Our changing workforce demonstrates the strong need for paid family \nand medical leave. Almost 80 percent of the workforce is made up of\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\ndual earner couples, who struggle to find time to care for their sick \nchildren or their own illnesses. In addition, approximately 40 percent \nof the workforce will be caring for older parents by 2010. For these \nand many other reasons, this bill is the right policy.\n  The FMLA established the principle, and now the Family Leave \nInsurance Act puts it into practice and into reach for more Americans. \nIts passage will bring America closer to the world's standards, help \nour businesses, and protect our workforce. In the lives of millions of \nAmericans, it will help reduce the dilemma of balancing work and \nfamily. Let us continue to work together: Government, business and \nemployees need to continue this conversation and improve our policies \nfor working families and individual employees who need paid leave. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Dodd and I \nintroduced the Family Leave Insurance Act of 2007, which builds upon \nimportant protections established by the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA, of 1993.\n  Our legislation would provide 8 weeks of paid benefits to private and \nFederal employees who take leave for reasons permitted by the FMLA. \nThese include a serious health condition; care for a critically ill \nchild, spouse, or parent; and the birth or adoption of a child.\n  Benefits would be provided to workers based on their annual income \nlevel. As an example, those earning less than $20,000 per year would \nreceive 100 percent of their benefits, while those earning $60,000 to \n$97,000 would receive 40 percent. This scaled approach has two \nadvantages: it will keep program costs low, and offer the greatest help \nto those who need it most.\n  In the past, many have expressed apprehension over the costs \nassociated with family and medical leave. These concerns are valid, and \nsteps must be taken to ensure neither employees nor employers are \nburdened by this or any similar program.\n  As introduced, this insurance fund would be financed by employees, \nemployers, and the Federal Government. Employees would contribute 0.2 \npercent of their earnings, employers would match this percentage, and \nthe Federal Government would pay any administrative expenses not \ncovered by those payments. In truth, these costs are minimal for all \ninvolved. A worker who receives a $1,000 paycheck would disburse just \n$2 to receive full coverage.\n  While my support for this bill is not absolute, it does address an \nimportant shortcoming of the FMLA: employees who need leave often do \nnot take time off because they simply cannot afford to do so. Senator \nDodd has rightly described this as a terrible choice for individuals--\none which forces a decision between ``the job they need and the family \nthey love.'' Those of us in the Senate must do everything we can to \nhelp hard-working American families, and this bill represents a \nsignificant first step in those efforts.\n  As the father of six children, I deeply understand the challenges \nfamilies face following childbirth, in times of sickness, and when \nloved ones fall ill. In Alaska, the majority of parents hold full-time \njobs outside the home, which often makes this pressure even more \nintense.\n  I commend Senator Dodd for his continued leadership on this issue, \nand look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and leaders in \nthe business community to improve this bill as it moves through the \nlegislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/21/senate-section/article/S8242-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 248--HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF DAME LOIS \n BROWNE EVANS, BERMUDA'S FIRST FEMALE BARRISTER AND ATTORNEY GENERAL, \n   AND THE FIRST FEMALE OPPOSITION LEADER IN THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States dependence on oil imports imposes \n     tremendous burdens on the economy, foreign policy, and \n     military of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Energy Information Administration, 60 \n     percent of the crude oil and petroleum products consumed in \n     the United States between April 2005 and March 2006 \n     (12,400,000 barrels per day) were imported. At a cost of $75 \n     per barrel of oil, people in the United States remit more \n     than $600,000 per minute to other countries for petroleum.\n       (3) A significant percentage of these petroleum imports \n     originate in countries controlled by regimes that are \n     unstable or openly hostile to the interests of the United \n     States. Dependence on production from these countries \n     contributes to the volatility of domestic and global markets \n     and the ``risk premium'' paid by consumers in the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Energy Information Administration projects that the \n     total petroleum demand in the United States will increase by \n     23 percent between 2006 and 2026, while domestic crude \n     production is expected to decrease by 11 percent, resulting \n     in an anticipated 28 percent increase in petroleum imports. \n     Absent significant action, the United States will become more \n     vulnerable to oil price increases, more dependent upon \n     foreign oil, and less able to pursue national interests.\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\n       (5) Two-thirds of all domestic oil use occurs in the \n     transportation sector, which is 97 percent reliant upon \n     petroleum-based fuels. Passenger vehicles, including light \n     trucks under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, represent \n     over 60 percent of the oil used in the transportation sector.\n       (6) Corporate average fuel economy of all cars and trucks \n     improved by 70 percent between 1975 and 1987. Between 1987 \n     and 2006, fuel economy improvements have stagnated and the \n     fuel economy of the United States is lower than many \n     developed countries and some developing countries.\n       (7) Significant improvements in engine technology occurred \n     between 1986 and 2006. These advances have been used to make \n     vehicles larger and more powerful, and have not focused \n     solely on increasing fuel economy.\n       (8) According to a 2002 fuel economy report by the National \n     Academies of Science, fuel economy can be increased without \n     negatively impacting the safety of cars and trucks in the \n     United States. Some new technologies can increase both safety \n     and fuel economy (such as high strength materials, unibody \n     design, lower bumpers). Design changes related to fuel \n     economy also present opportunities to reduce the \n     incompatibility of tall, stiff, heavy vehicles with the \n     majority of vehicles on the road.\n       (9) Significant change must occur to strengthen the \n     economic competitiveness of the domestic auto industry. \n     According to a recent study by the University of Michigan, a \n     sustained gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon would lead \n     Detroit's Big 3 automakers' profits to shrink by \n     $7,000,000,000 as they absorb 75 percent of the lost vehicle \n     sales. This would put nearly 300,000 people in the United \n     States out of work.\n       (10) Opportunities exist to strengthen the domestic vehicle \n     industry while improving fuel economy. A 2004 study performed \n     by the University of Michigan concludes that providing \n     $1,500,000,000 in tax incentives over a 10-year period to \n     encourage domestic manufacturers and parts facilities to \n     produce clean cars will lead to a gain of nearly 60,000 \n     domestic jobs and pay for itself through the resulting \n     increase in domestic tax receipts.\n\n     SEC. 502.
