Mr. President, we are getting used to Senators Enzi and \nKennedy. They seem to have been on the floor for several days now, and \nwe have at least 1 more day, maybe part of another day, but I hope \nnot--not because I don't want them here but because we have other \nthings to do.\n  The Senate is going to immediately proceed to S. 1642, the higher \neducation reauthorization legislation. There will be no morning \nbusiness. Under a previous agreement, there will be 8 hours for debate \non the bill and amendments. First-degree amendments are limited to 12 \namendments per side, with 6 for each manager and an additional \nmanagers' amendment, with first-degree amendments limited to 30 minutes \nfor debate equally divided and any second-degree amendments limited to \n15 minutes for debate equally divided. So at approximately 5:15 today, \nwe will begin voting on the pending amendments. We are hopeful we will \nbe able to dispose of all of them this evening.\n  Following the disposition of this bill, we are going to proceed to \nH.R. 2638, the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. I \nhope we can finish that bill quickly. I hope we don't have to file \ncloture on it. If we do, that is what we will do. Hopefully, we can \nfinish the bill. It is extremely important. It deals with homeland \nsecurity. I will tell all Senators, the bill we have calls for more \nmoney than the President's suggestion, but remember, we go to \nconference on all of these bills. The House will have passed by the end \nof this week--certainly by the middle of next week--all the \nappropriations bills. So we need to get some done over here so that we \ncan go to conference. So I repeat, if somebody has a concern about ours \nbeing for more money than the President's, don't worry about it. We \nhave conference to go to, and as we know, in years past, the White \nHouse always has the ability to work with us in conference.\n  When we finish Homeland Security, we are going to go to the \nchildren's health bill, which is extremely important. It is important \nbecause the bill that has been brought before the Senate is one that is \na compromise, a bipartisan piece of legislation, a bill that was \nreported out of the committee by a 17-to-4 vote. That certainly \nsuggests bipartisanship, and it provides health care for millions of \nAmerican children. So I hope we can get consent to proceed to this \nlegislation following Homeland Security. If not, we will file cloture, \nand we will go to it after that.\n  But as everyone has heard me say, this work period, we are going to \ncomplete Homeland Security, SCHIP, we are going to complete the \nconference report on the 9/11 Commission recommendations, we are going \nto complete work on the ethics and lobbying reform, and we are going to \nmove to another appropriations bill, which will be Military \nConstruction and VA. All\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nSenators and staff should be alerted that we may have to work weekends. \nI say plural because it is according to where we are on the procedural \nmatters.\n  This weekend, I know there is a big trip planned to go to Greenland, \nand we certainly hope Senators can go there. It is something everyone \nneeds to see and Senators need to see, with global warming being as it \nis. We will do our best to complete work so that people can have the \nweekend off to go to Greenland and to do whatever they need to do. But \nthere are no guarantees in this business, especially at this time of \nthe year. We worked all night one night last week, we worked until \nearly in the morning one night, and that may be necessary this week and \nnext week. I hope we can break in time for our recess, but, again, as I \nhave said now for weeks, we have to finish this work first.\n  I hope people who have amendments on this bill today will come and \nstart offering them. We are going to make sure that all quorum time is \ncharged against the bill itself so we can finish that time. The time, \nwe are going to finish today; the amendments, we hope to finish today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9670-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9670-S9767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 2007\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am going to speak a little bit about this \nvery important bill, S. 1642, the Higher Education Amendments Act of \n2007. This legislation is a bipartisan product of 3 years of \nnegotiations by the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, or the HELP Committee. It builds on the legislation \nthe HELP Committee passed in the 109th Congress.\n  It is important to note that the legislation before us today is not a \nDemocratic or a Republican bill; it is a bipartisan bill. We worked on \nit carefully. We made sure that parts which were objectionable to \neither side were eliminated or a third way found, and as a result of \nthat very congenial process, it has gotten us to this point where we \nare on the floor with the bill.\n  Following the bill we had last week, which also dealt with higher \neducation--more with the funding issues--this bill covers a number of \nthe other issues. But Republican Senators were able to secure changes \nto the Higher Education Act that were important to them, as were \nDemocratic Senators.\n  Our committee works a little differently than a lot of the \ncommittees. We use the committee markup to see what the objections are \nto a bill, the intensity of those objections, and identify possible \nsolutions. Then, once the bill has been marked up, we will get together \na managers' package that will overcome any remaining objections. I am \npleased with the effort that has gone into this bill since markup. We \nworked together to bring to the floor a piece of legislation that can \nbe supported by the most liberal and the most conservative Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I am pleased we are taking up this bill today. The companion \nlegislation, the Higher Education Access Reconciliation Act of 2007, \npassed the Senate last week, as I mentioned. My colleagues heard me say \nover and over again last week that the reconciliation bill was only a \nsmall piece of the Higher Education Act. Without considering both \nbills, we would only be doing part of the job.\n  I wish to thank my leadership for hearing me and my Republican \ncolleagues on the HELP Committee when we requested that both these \nbills be considered sequentially.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nand sent to the desk the letter several of us sent requesting that both \nthese higher education bills be considered together.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2007.\n     The Hon.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On June 20th the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions reported \n     two separate pieces of legislation: S. 1642 the Higher \n     Education Amendments of 2007, which reauthorizes the \n     discretionary programs within the Higher Education Act; and \n     the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, a reconciliation \n     bill that responds to the Budget Resolution adopted earlier \n     this year. This legislative package takes important steps to \n     make college more affordable, while ensuring American \n     students have the knowledge and skills they need to be \n     successful in the 21st century economy.\n       Both the reauthorization and reconciliation bills must be \n     considered together on the Senate floor as a comprehensive \n     reform of our laws pertaining to higher education and should \n     not be moved separately. If the Senate moves forward with \n     just the Higher Education Access Act, which as a budget bill \n     has a privileged status, we lose an important opportunity to \n     pass essential bipartisan reforms contained in the Higher \n     Education Amendments bill. The reforms in the reauthorization \n     bill include: simplifying the student aid application \n     process; authorizing a year-round Pell Grant to better serve \n     non-traditional students; and expanding graduate programs at \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic \n     Serving Institutions. More importantly, moving the \n     reconciliation bill without the reauthorization bill would \n     result in making significant cuts to education subsidies, \n     while ignoring important ethical, privacy, and disclosure \n     requirements taken from Republican bills. We believe these \n     new requirements as contained in the reauthorization bill are \n     necessary to protect students from those who would exploit \n     loan programs.\n       We will only be doing half our job if we allow the \n     reconciliation bill to move forward without the companion \n     reauthorization bill. Such a piecemeal approach to reforming \n     higher education is inadequate. The Senate must ensure an \n     ample and meaningful debate on both bills at the same time so \n     that the vital reforms to higher education are given the \n     attention and scrutiny that they warrant. We urge you to take \n     a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing \n     higher education and our status as a world economic leader by \n     moving both of these bills together on the floor.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael B. Enzi, Judd Gregg, Lamar Alexander, Pat \n           Roberts, Richard Burr, Orrin Hatch, Johnny Isakson, \n           Wayne Allard, Lisa Murkowski.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today we are going to consider the rest of \nthe higher education pie--the foundation of the programs we discussed \nlast week. I believe that without considering both pieces of \nlegislation, we will not make the changes necessary to help students \nenter into and succeed in higher education.\n  These are all of the pieces of the higher education pie. We see the \nlittle red triangle there; that is the reconciliation piece which we \ndid last week, and it deals with the Pell grant funding, primarily. \nThis bill deals with the other pie pieces we see on this chart.\n  ACG, the Academic Competitiveness grants, and the SMART grants, are \ngrants to students who will specialize in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and some selected languages. These grants provide \nextra support above the Pell grants, and that is so we turn out the \nkind of people we need in technical fields to keep the innovation in \nthe United States going. We passed the America COMPETES package that \nties in with this.\n  Teacher quality. The key to a classroom is the teacher. We had to \nhave a piece in there that would encourage teachers and get them extra \ninstruction so they can be better teachers.\n  FAFSA simplification. There are a lot of people who have not applied \nfor grants because the process is so difficult. You probably saw us \nlast week mention that this was the application--actually, these are \nthe instructions; the applications are equally as long. We have been \nable, through this bill, to reduce that to a very simple form for \nstudents to be able to fill out to see if they can qualify for the \nFederal help that is available. There is significant Federal help \navailable, and we don't want anybody not attending higher education, \nwhether it be college or technical school, because they don't have the \nresources for it. We are trying to provide the resources, and now we \nare trying to make sure the process isn't so difficult that people skip \nthe process and skip higher education. We need the technical skills \nthat are provided by a higher education, a higher level of thought. So \nwe now have a much easier form.\n  You will also find some little improvements, such as if you do work \nwhile you are in junior high and high school and you earn and save some \nmoney, you won't be penalized when you apply for college. We want \npeople to be saving their money, not spending their money so that it \ndoesn't count against them when they go to make the application.\n  Graduate and international education, and loan disclosures are also \nincluded in this bill. There has been quite a bit of emphasis on this \nlately. I was pleased to be able, as an accountant, to provide a lot of \nsuggestions for the ways these problems could be handled so that people \nwould know exactly what is available and so that companies and colleges \ndealing with loans would do the right thing.\n  Pell grants and campus-based aid are a huge part. It complements the \nPell grant work we did last week, which was essential to what we did in \nthe reconciliation bill. And, of course, financial literacy. We \nincorporate that into our work whenever we possibly can. People need to \nknow as much about their financial situation as possible. It is \nparticularly critical for college students. We don't want them winding \nup in an impossible situation when they graduate. We want them to be \nable to take advantage of the resources available before they enter \ncollege.\n  So we have a lot of pieces that will be completed when we finish the \nday today, and I am convinced we will be able to complete this today. \nWe have a limited number of amendments, and many are very reasonable \nand should not be too difficult. We will have discussions on some \nothers. We will have a very bipartisan discussion on what can be put in \nthe bill to complete it, and we will get it done today.\n  Why is that important? This year marks 50 years since Sputnik was \nlaunched. That launch sparked huge turmoil in this country and worry \nabout the knowledge and skills necessary to keep our economy growing \nand competitive. I was in junior high at the time. It was a shock to \nour Nation. Every one of us could recognize it--teachers, parents and, \nprobably as important, students, recognized it. Russia was beating us. \nThey had put a satellite into orbit. It shocked us. But it also brought \nout that American competitive spirit. We said they were not going to \nbeat us. It launched a change in education such as we had not seen in \nthe United States in decades, maybe centuries. We were ultimately the \nwinners of the space race, but it wasn't just the space race; it was an \neducation race. It was the broad range of education the United States \ndelved into and the innovation that was brought about at the time that \nput us ahead of Russia. Of course, the Government probably helped \nconsiderably too. Sputnik had a dramatic effect on our education system \nand made us recognize a high school diploma was no longer just a nice \nthing to have. We could no longer rest on our past successes as a \nNation. We met the challenge of Sputnik through the National Defense \nEducation Act. We looked to education as a path to continued success, \nand we supported an increase in the number of people who would continue \ntheir education beyond high school, particularly in math, science, \nengineering, and technology.\n  We are again being challenged. For millions of Americans, access to \nan affordable college education is the key to their success in the 21st \ncentury global economy. In the 1950s, skilled jobs comprised 20 percent \nof the U.S. job market. In 2000, 85 percent of all U.S. jobs are \ncategorized as skilled. Without some college education, these Americans \nwill not have the qualifications for over 90 percent of the new jobs \nbeing created over the next 10 years. It is estimated that 60 percent \nof tomorrow's jobs will require skills that only 20 percent of today's \nworkers possess. We have a huge challenge, not just in K-12 and higher \neducation but in continuing education. It is estimated the average \nperson leaving college will change careers 14 times. I didn't say \n``change jobs'' 14 times, I said ``change careers'' 14 times. That is \nthe pace at which things are accelerating.\n  Here is an even more important statistic. Of those 14 career changes, \n10 of them don't even exist now. So we are\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\neducating people for a level of jobs that do not exist at the present \ntime. That is quite a challenge. In this decade, 40 percent of job \ngrowth will be in jobs requiring postsecondary education. Those jobs \nrequiring associate degrees are growing the fastest. Learning is never \nover; school is never out. Technology is demanding that everybody \ncontinue to learn and gain skills to remain competitive in the \nworkplace.\n  America's ability to compete in a global economy depends increasingly \non the number of students entering and completing college. Of the 75 \npercent of high school seniors who continue their studies, only 50 \npercent receive a degree in 5 years after enrolling in college. Only 25 \npercent of them receive a bachelor's degree or higher. These numbers, \nincidentally, are even worse for children of low-income families. Among \neighth graders in 1988, only 16 percent from low-income families \nattained a bachelor's degree by 2000. The fact is that over four times \nas many eighth graders from high-income families attain bachelor's \ndegrees than from low-income families. This is using the eighth graders \nfrom 1988 who should have graduated by 2000.\n  On the chart, you can see the level from low to high income who \ncompleted a bachelor's degree based on family income. Some of that is a \nfailure on our part to emphasize to those in the low-income category \nthey can do it and they should do it and how they can do it. That is \npart of what this bill does.\n  It is important to ensure that more students enroll in college \nprepared to learn and that more students have the support they need to \ncomplete college with the knowledge and skills to be successful. \nSlightly less than one-third--31 percent--of all public high school \nstudents are prepared for postsecondary education, as demonstrated by \nthe academic courses they pursue. Well-prepared and well-supported \nstudents are more likely to persist to a degree completion and obtain \nthe knowledge and skills they need.\n  For years, institutions of higher education and employers have \nexpressed their dissatisfaction about the fact that our high school \ngraduates need remedial study or training in order to do college-level \nwork or to participate in the workforce. Nearly one-third of entering \ncollege freshmen take at least one remedial course. Each year, \ntaxpayers pay an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion to provide remedial \neducation to students at our public universities and community \ncolleges.\n  Our goal should be to keep the cost of college down, expand the \navailability of information, help students and parents make more \ninformed decisions, and improve financial literacy across the board so \nstudents and families have a better understanding of how they can \nmanage their loans and monthly payments. Schools and colleges must do \nmore to increase accountability and seek efficiencies that bring down \nthe cost of postsecondary education.\n\n  S. 1642, the Higher Education Amendments of 2007, refines and focuses \nFederal policy on access, affordability, and accountability. It \nattempts to tackle the complexity of the Federal student data system. \nRight now, filling out the free application for federal student aid \nprevents many students from even considering college. That was never \nour intent. This bill, as I pointed out, reduces the number of \nquestions on the FAFSA to those that are necessary to determining the \nneed students have for financial assistance. We are making the FAFSA \nless complicated than filling out tax forms, which has not been the \ncase in the past. The bill puts us on the path of greater coordination \nbetween Federal agencies so students and their families will have the \nopportunity to allow information that is already provided to the \nGovernment through tax forms, be used to complete the FAFSA.\n  Also, it is our responsibility to ensure that students and their \nfamilies have the information they need to make informed decisions \nabout the investment of time and money they are making to secure a \ncollege education. The cost of college has risen dramatically and at \nthe same time the need for a college education has never been greater. \nStudents will receive upfront information about financial decisions \nthey are making. Similar information would be provided to them \nperiodically throughout their college experience.\n  The quality of classroom teacher preparation is critical to the \neducation of our K-12 students. The goal of the teacher preparation \nprograms supported under this bill is to help teachers be prepared to \nmeet the ever-increasing diverse needs of students and to improve \nstudent achievement.\n  The bill also addresses recent concerns that institutions of higher \neducation and lenders have not been operating in the best interest of \nstudents and their families. Although what we have seen are isolated \nincidents, we wish to make sure the confidence in our institutions and \nfinancial aid advisors is not questioned. We have included requirements \nthat institutions establish codes of conduct for how they work with \nlenders and prohibit incentives and other arrangements that would \nappear inappropriate. Students and their parents must have knowledge to \nmake informed choices and financial decisions that will impact their \nlives for years to come.\n  It is no longer an option whether to pursue college or skills \ncertification that is nationally recognized. Everybody needs tools to \nunderstand and shape their future. Higher education is the onramp to \nsuccess in the global economy, and it is our responsibility to make \nsure everyone can access that opportunity and reach their goals. \nWithout a lifetime of education, training, and retraining opportunities \nfor everyone, we will not meet our 21st century needs and challenges.\n  There is tremendous opportunity in the United States. We recently \nwent to India to see why they were winning in some markets and getting \nAmerican jobs, and their method is kind of abhorrent to Americans, and \nit should be. They begin excluding students at very early ages. They \nmake the prize very desirable in the end, and that results in lots of \npeople pursuing and competing and getting those few opportunities for \nhigher education out of that huge population.\n  We believe in higher education for anyone who wants it, and the need \nis there. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this bill and to \nconsider the amendments that will be offered. I thank Senator Kennedy \nfor working with me and my Republican colleagues in order to bring a \nbipartisan bill to the floor. As he mentioned last week, this is \nessentially the bill he and I worked on the past 2 years and wanted to \nbring to the floor, but were not able to. We now have that opportunity, \nand I am pleased everyone is willing to cooperate and get it done \nquickly.\n  As we move forward, I am hopeful we will move forward with both the \nHigher Education Access Act of 2007, the reconciliation bill we passed \nlast week, and this bill. The comprehensive reauthorization of both of \nthese bills will make a huge difference. There is no reason they cannot \naccompany each other moving forward, as they have on the Senate floor. \nEach complements the other, and without both, the changes made in \nreconciliation will be less meaningful. I encourage the Democratic \nleadership to ensure we don't do just a piece of the pie as we move \nforward; otherwise, as was said last week, ``any way you slice it, \nhigher education is left undone.'' We need both pieces to get it done \nright.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy and those on the other side of the \naisle on the committee for their tremendous cooperation, participation, \nfocus, and willingness to figure out what we are trying to solve and \nfind a way to solve it. We have done a very adequate job with what is \nin this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi for their leadership in getting this higher education bill \nto the floor. I know they have worked on it for many years now. As I \nunderstand it, the current Higher Education Act, which we have had to \nextend, was scheduled to expire in 2004. We are now getting around to \nactually passing a reauthorization of that legislation, which I think \nis very important to do.\n  Last week, we overwhelmingly approved the student aid package that \npromises millions of students the ability to afford college. That \npackage included more than $17 billion in student aid over 5 years. For \nmy State of New\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\nMexico, that translated into $177 million of new aid for New Mexico \nstudents and their families over the next 5 years.\n  I was glad to be part of the committee that prepared that \nlegislation. I am glad to see it passed by an overwhelming vote of 78 \nto 18. But financial assistance is only one part of the puzzle, as \nSenator Enzi pointed out. We need to do more, and the legislation \nbefore us today gives us the ability to do more.\n  First, we need to do more to address the increasing cost of attending \ncollege. Second, we need to ensure more students graduate from college \nand are prepared to succeed in this 21st-century global economy. And, \nthird, we need to reform the student loan system so it works better for \nstudents rather than just for lenders.\n  I believe this legislation accomplishes all three of those \nobjectives.\n  These higher education amendments of 2007 have a number of provisions \ndesigned to address the rising cost of college. We have all talked \nabout the rising cost of college. The cost of going to college is 6.3 \npercent higher than it was last year, and the average cost of going to \na 4-year college is $13,000 this year. The bill sets forth a \ncomprehensive approach to addressing these problems.\n  First, the amendments will establish a higher education price index \nto accurately reflect annual changes in tuition and fees for \nundergraduate students. The Secretary of Education will be required to \nreport annually in a national list and in a list for each State a \nranking of colleges according to the extent of changes they have made \nin their tuition and fees.\n  The Secretary is also required to establish a higher education price \nincrease watch list in order to hold colleges accountable for their \nrising costs by publicizing those colleges where increases are the \nhighest.\n  Second, the bill makes significant changes to the financial aid \nprocess. It makes Pell grants available to students all year round so \nthey can take courses during the summer, and they can finish college \nearlier. It will also simplify the forms that these students have to \ncomplete.\n  The bill also removes barriers for students with disabilities and \nstudents with limited English proficiency so they can apply for \nfinancial aid.\n  These amendments provide a number of types of loan forgiveness, \nscholarships, and fellowship opportunities. Let me mention just a few. \nThe bill provides loan forgiveness for early childhood educators, \nincluding Head Start teachers and preschool program instructors, full-\ntime faculty members of tribal colleges and universities, school \nlibrarians, speech and language pathologists, and members of the Armed \nForces. It authorizes graduate fellowships for minority students and \nwomen.\n  We need to increase the number of students who can succeed and \ngraduate from college, and this bill places great emphasis on \nactivities that not only help high school students prepare for college \nbut help those same students succeed in college and graduate from \ncollege.\n  The higher education amendments improve student academic readiness \nfor college by strengthening the GEAR UP and TRIO programs. For \nexample, the bill requires GEAR UP partnerships to systematically \nchange the way schools prepare students for college. It requires States \nand school districts to encourage more students to enroll in rigorous \nhigh school course work and emphasizes activities that will support the \ndevelopment of college prep curricula, including advanced placement \ncourses. The bill also strengthens the TRIO programs by establishing \noutcome criteria for measuring the quality and effectiveness of the \nprograms around the country.\n  The bill includes a provision that I authored that creates a new \ngrant program to assist colleges and universities that serve large \nnumbers of Native American students. Currently, there is no particular \nFederal program to assist nontribal schools that provide educational \nservices and support to large Native American student populations. We \nhave a number of such schools in my home State of New Mexico such as \nSan Juan College, University of New Mexico in Gallup, New Mexico State \nUniversity in Grants, and the Eastern New Mexico campus in Ruidoso.\n  The bill provides grants to such colleges to improve and expand their \ncapacity to serve Native American students through such activities as \ncurriculum development, academic instruction, faculty development, \nacquisition of education instruction, research equipment, and a variety \nof other activities.\n  The higher education amendments also improve programs for students \nwhose families are engaged in migrant and seasonal farm work to enter \nand succeed in college. This is very important.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes funding for the Navajo Technical \nCollege to help pay the costs to operate postsecondary career and \ntechnical educational programs for Native American students. This \nauthorization will significantly increase the Navajo Technical \nCollege's ability to provide high-quality career and technical training \nto ensure that Native American students graduate with the skills needed \nto succeed in this economy.\n\n  I am also very glad this legislation contains provisions from the \nNext Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act of 2007. This is \nlegislation that I introduced, along with Senator Hutchison and others, \nto establish a long overdue Hispanic-serving institution graduate \nprogram.\n  Current law only provides support for 2-year and 4-year colleges. The \npercentage of Hispanic students attending college has increased \nsignificantly in recent years. Unfortunately, Hispanic students are \nwoefully underrepresented in the graduate programs around our country, \nand this legislation will try to help solve that problem.\n  The higher education amendments will also require teacher preparation \nprograms to substantially improve over the next several years.\n  Finally, as we see the price of college rising steadily, an increased \nnumber of students are forced to rely on loans in order to finance \ntheir education. We have seen from recent investigations that some \nlenders in the Student Loan Program, and even some financial aid \nofficers, have been exploiting the student loan system to the detriment \nof the very students they are meant to help.\n  This reauthorization will make a number of very important changes to \nthe Student Loan Program. It will ensure that colleges recommend \nlenders to their students based on the best interest of the students \nand not on the self-interests of the financial aid officers.\n  Further, it will prohibit payments or gifts or other inducements from \nlenders to colleges or to financial aid administrators that constitute \na conflict of interest.\n  Importantly, it will require colleges to establish and follow a code \nof conduct with respect to student loans.\n  Let me reiterate that this is extremely important legislation. I \ncommend the majority leader for bringing it to the Senate floor. I \ncommend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their bipartisan effort to \nmove this legislation forward. Together with the student aid package \nthat we approved last week, this legislation will allow us to make \ncollege accessible to all and affordable for every family in this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Who yields time? The Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2366\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2366.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for the development of a student loan \n                             clearinghouse)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 802. STUDENT LOAN CLEARINGHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Development.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall \n     establish 1 or more clearinghouses of information on student \n     loans (including loans under parts B\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\n     and D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1071 et seq. and 1087a et seq.) and private loans, for \n     both undergraduate and graduate students) for use by \n     prospective borrowers or any person desiring information \n     regarding available interest rates and other terms from \n     lenders. Such a clearinghouse shall--\n       (1) have no affiliation with any institution of higher \n     education or any lender;\n       (2) accept nothing of value from any lender, guaranty \n     agency, or any entity affiliated with a lender or guaranty \n     agency, except that the clearinghouse may establish a flat \n     fee to be charged to each listed lender, based on the costs \n     necessary to establish and maintain the clearinghouse;\n       (3) provide information regarding the interest rates, fees, \n     borrower benefits, and any other matter that the Department \n     of Education determines relevant to enable prospective \n     borrowers to select a lender;\n       (4) provide interest rate information that complies with \n     the Federal Trade Commission guidelines for consumer credit \n     term disclosures; and\n       (5) be a nonprofit entity.\n       (b) Publication of List.--The Secretary of Education shall \n     publish a list of clearinghouses described in subsection (a) \n     on the website of the Department of Education and such list \n     shall be updated not less often than every 90 days.\n       (c) Disclosure.--Beginning on the date the first \n     clearinghouse described in subsection (a) is established, \n     each institution of higher education that receives Federal \n     assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1001 et seq.) and that designates 1 or more lenders as \n     preferred, suggested, or otherwise recommended shall include \n     a standard disclosure developed by the Secretary of Education \n     on all materials that reference such lenders to inform \n     students that the students might find a more attractive loan, \n     with a lower interest rate, by visiting a clearinghouse \n     described in subsection (a).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit a report to Congress on whether students \n     are using a clearinghouse described in subsection (a) to find \n     and secure a student loan. The report shall assess whether \n     students could have received a more attractive loan, one with \n     a lower interest rate or better benefits, by using a \n     clearinghouse described in subsection (a) instead of a \n     preferred lender list.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Mexico in \ncommending Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for bringing this bill to \nthe floor of the Senate. It is important legislation and one that I \nhope we will move to pass very quickly.\n  This is about education. I don't know there is a subject much more \nimportant than education. H.G. Wells once said that human history \nbecomes a race between education and catastrophe. Education is so \nunbelievably important. As I was sitting here, I was thinking about \nthis amendment and about education and what it means to our country. I \nwas thinking about something I have told my colleagues previously.\n  The first week I served in the Congress, I served in the U.S. House \nof Representatives. I went to visit, then, the oldest man serving in \nthe Congress. I read a lot about him and was interested in him. So I \nwent to say hello, to greet him. His name was Claude Pepper from \nFlorida. Claude Pepper was an old man by then but a vibrant man \nnonetheless. He had an office that was very much like a museum, full of \nhistory over the many decades.\n  As I indicated before, one of the things I remember about that \nmorning walking into Claude Pepper's office was seeing all of his \nmemorabilia about his service. But I saw two things that struck me. \nThey were behind his chair looking over his desk. There were two \nphotographs. One was a photograph of December 17, 1903, Wilbur and \nOrville Wright making the first powered human flight to leave the \nsurface of the Earth. It was autographed to Congressman Claude Pepper. \nBefore Orville Wright died, he autographed this wonderful photograph of \nthat little airplane in the wind in Kitty Hawk, NC, leaving the ground. \nIt says: ``To Congressman Claude Pepper, with admiration. Orville \nWright.'' I thought, this is interesting. I am speaking to a living man \nwho has an autographed photograph of the first person to leave the \nground.\n  Beneath that was something just as interesting. It was Neil Armstrong \nsetting foot on the Moon autographed ``To Claude Pepper, with \nadmiration. Neil Armstrong.'' I thought, these pictures are only about \n4 inches apart in frames, but what is the distance between these \nphotographs? From 1903 to 1969, leaving the Earth for the first time in \nhuman-powered flight and then stepping on the surface of the Moon. What \nis that distance measured in? It is measured in education. It comes \nfrom this country's education system--knowledge, engineering, science, \nmathematics, the knowledge to build flying machines, to build rockets, \nto build Moon capsules. The basic knowledge comes from our school \nsystem, from your education system.\n  I know we spend a lot of time in this country describing what is \nwrong with education. But the fact is, we are the ones who have split \nthe atom and spliced genes. We are the ones who invented the telephone \nand the television and the computer. We are the ones who built \nairplanes and then learned to fly them, built rockets and walked on the \nsurface of the Moon, all as a result of the foundation of learning and \neducation.\n  So the bill comes to the floor of the Senate today saying education \nis a priority, and it is, and we have some issues with education that \nwe want to fix because we want to strengthen our educational system. It \nis not that our system is perfect, we know it is not. It needs to be \nstrengthened and improved.\n  With respect to higher education, we want to encourage every person \nin this country who has an urge to get a college degree, to go to a \ntechnical school, to go to a vocational school, to be able to advance \ntheir interests. In doing so, we offer a series of financial \nincentives. For those who have no money, we offer Pell grants. For \nthose who have very little money, we offer Stafford loans and direct \nloans. And for those who perhaps do not qualify for the low-income \ncomponents, they have other loan opportunities from private lenders to \nget the money to go to college.\n  That is what we want in this country. We want every young child to \ngrow up, and as they grow up, to become whatever their God-given \ntalents can allow them to be. We don't want the brakes to exist for \nanybody. We want this to be an opportunity for everybody.\n  I recall one day when my father came home for supper--and my father \nwas a very successful man, very bright man, did very well in his life, \nbut he only went through sixth grade in school because his mother died \nduring childbirth and my father spent most of his time trying to raise \nsome money and work and try to help his brothers and sisters, who had \nbeen farmed out to uncles and aunts and so on. So my dad had only a \nsixth grade education.\n  I recall him coming home one day, never having told our family, and \nannouncing at the supper table that he had just passed the GED. He had \ngotten his high school degree. He was somewhere in his fifties. He had \ngotten his high school degree. I will never forget the look on his face \nwhen he told us: I am a high school graduate. Got my GED.\n  We didn't even know he was doing it, but he did. It meant the world \nto him because he had never gotten the opportunity to go beyond the \nsixth grade. And it means the world to a lot of people, in my judgment, \nto find out: What are my talents? What capabilities do I have? What are \nmy interests to better myself? What kinds of things am I interested in, \nand where can I go to college? How can I finish school and then go to \ncollege and advance my opportunities?\n  Well, that is what the legislation that is brought before us today \noffers us the opportunity to do, to advance those interests. We have \ndone it in steps over many decades, and it is the difference, as the \nSenator from Wyoming said, it is the difference between this country \nand many others.\n  There are many other countries where they separate these kids at an \nearly age, and they say: Well, based on your track record, based on the \nway things look for you, you are going in this direction. You are not \ngoing to college. And based on the way things look, you are going here. \nThey separate them and they channel kids. Not in this country. We want \nevery single kid to have an opportunity to become whatever their God-\ngiven talents allow them to become.\n  So the issue is funding for many kids because many young people don't \nhave the money to go to college unless they get some help--Pell grants, \nStafford loans, direct loans, and other loans. So we have programs that \nwe have put together that provide that kind of assistance through the \nstudent loan process,\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nand this bill, the underlying bill, strengthens programs to prepare \nstudents for college, and it takes important steps to help kids get to \ncollege and then make both kids and colleges accountable.\n  Now, we have rising costs, as everyone knows. Every single parent \nknows that the costs for a college education are increasing \ndramatically. With respect to lending money for students going to \ncollege, we have discovered recently that there are some abusive \nlending practices, and this bill takes some steps to address those \nabusive practices.\n  Some student lenders have undertaken to secure spots on what are \ncalled ``preferred lender lists.'' Some colleges, many colleges, have \npreferred lender lists. They put out a list that says: Here are the \nlenders from which you can get a guaranteed loan. There is a lot of \nmoney in this process for the lenders, and that is why the lenders are \nso anxious to be on these lists.\n  My preference would be that we eliminate the lists altogether--\neliminate the preferred lender lists--but I don't think that is \npossible to get through this Chamber at this point, so I am going to do \nit in another way. I am going to address this in another way with the \namendment I have just offered.\n  The HELP Committee has done an admirable job in digging into this, as \nwell as have, for example, some officials, the attorney general of New \nYork, and others. The HELP Committee has put together some information \nabout colleges and some colleges' financial aid officers soliciting \nfavors, gifts, and financial assistance from lenders in exchange for \nputting that lender on a preferred list. Here is something that came \nfrom the HELP Committee that I noticed when I was looking at this \nissue.\n  A Bank of America employee noted in an e-mail that Larry Burt, former \nDirector of the University of Texas Office of Student Financial Aid, \nhad requirements to get on the UT-preferred lender list. Again, it is \nvery important to get on these lists for these companies that want to \nhave lending opportunities to students. So here is someone who ran the \nUniversity of Texas Student Financial Aid Office. This is a quote.\n\n       Happy hour with UT loan department staff, staff luncheons, \n     lunch and/or dinner with Larry Burt, parties for Larry's \n     family--birthdays, et cetera--invitations to golf \n     tournaments--expenses paid by lender--and free tickets to \n     sports events. Larry loves tequila and wine--since becoming \n     director at UT Austin, he has not had to buy any tequila or \n     wine--lenders provide this to him on a regular basis.\n\n  This was an e-mail from a Bank of America employee from a HELP report \non marketing practices in the lending program. Not all lenders went \nalong with these inappropriate demands. The HELP Committee \ninvestigation said Citibank did not go along with them because they \ndeemed those requests to be inappropriate. And the very next year, \napparently, with respect to this campus and Mr. Burt, Citibank was \ndropped from the UT-preferred lender list.\n  Student Loan Xpress, another major lender, paid $21,000-plus for the \nchief financial officer at Johns Hopkins University to attend an \nexecutive doctorate program at the University of Pennsylvania after the \nfinancial aid officer sent the following lender an e-mail. This is the \ne-mail that went around from the financial aid officer at Johns \nHopkins.\n\n       I have been accepted to a doctoral program at Penn that \n     begins in August. I am searching for \\1/2\\ tuition support--\n     know of any good scholarship programs?? I already know where \n     to get loans--or, why don't you put me on retainer to \n     EdLending.\n  This is an e-mail from Dr. Ellen Frishberg, former Johns Hopkins \nUniversity financial aid director. Once again, I think this is \nimportant information discovered by the HELP Committee. They began to \ninvestigate these issues.\n  An investigation by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo uncovered \na revenue-sharing agreement between Citibank and Syracuse University. \nCitibank was paying Syracuse \\1/2\\ percent of the interest earned on \nstudent loans steered to the bank--a deal worth about $100,000 a year \nto the school. According to Attorney General Cuomo's investigation, \nduring the last academic year, 98 percent of Syracuse students who took \nout loans went through Citibank.\n  Just an unusual occurrence? Doesn't sound like it to me. Many lenders \nhave invited college financial aid officers to serve on advisory \nboards, flying them around the country and various parts of the world \nand on harbor cruises.\n  Now, why do lenders go through all this trouble? Well, the stakes are \nhigh. The student loan business is an $85 billion industry. It has \ngrown 27 percent since 2001, and the lenders listed on the college's \npreferred lender list typically receive up to 90 percent of the loans \ntaken out by students attending that institution. Again, these are \nguaranteed loans--guaranteed by the Federal Government. Lenders fight \nto get to the top of a list--of a preferred lender list--at a college.\n  According to one survey, the first lender on the preferred list gets \nas much as 75 percent of the loan value. So this is big money to \nprivate interests that want to get government-guaranteed loans, move \nthem out to students, and make a lot of money off those loans.\n  Now, I know that the managers of the bill share my concerns. Senators \nEnzi, along with Alexander, Allard, Burr, Hatch, Isakson, Murkowski, \nand Roberts introduced legislation to ban preferred lender lists \naltogether. And Senator Kennedy has worked tirelessly to uncover and \ndocument abusive practices. I, frankly, would like to ban preferred \nlender lists altogether. We don't need preferred lender lists by \ncolleges in which they describe who gets on the list and who gets to \nthe top of the list. I don't think we ought to be doing that. But it is \nquite clear we can't ban those lists at the present time, so I am \noffering a different amendment.\n  The bill before us addresses some of these practices by prohibiting \npayments, gifts, and other inducements that lenders give to colleges \nand student aid officers. The bill also forces schools to explain the \nrationale for selecting preferred lenders, and I think these are \nimportant steps.\n  I don't diminish these steps at all. I am concerned that lenders will \nstill do whatever they can do to get on those lists and get to the top \nof those lists. There are substantial incentives for abuse, and there \nis no evidence--there is no evidence at all--that the lenders on the \npreferred list actually offer the best deal to the students.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time in support of his amendment \nhas expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I was saying, there is no evidence that being on the \nlist or put on the list by the college offers the students the best \nfinancial arrangement, and with the cost of college increasing at twice \nthe rate of inflation, I think we need to make sure that students have \naccess to affordable loans.\n  So I offer an amendment that does the following: It will create a \nclearinghouse of student loans, both Federal and private loans. That \nclearinghouse will put students in the driver's seat, allowing them to \nsearch for a loan that offers the best deal, the best financial \narrangements for them, whether that be the loan that has the lowest \nrate or the loan with the best borrower's benefits. This gives the \nstudents the opportunity to shop in an informed way for the best \nsituation for themselves.\n  This type of clearinghouse will create more competition in the \nstudent loan industry. I can't imagine that many students would go to \nthis clearinghouse and pick the loan with the highest interest rate. \nThis will empower students. It is not a new concept. In fact, some \nschools, including the University of North Dakota in my home State, are \nalready directing students to Web sites that allow the students to \nsearch through dozens of loan options by themselves to pick the best \nterms.\n  But creating a clearinghouse is not enough. We need to make certain \nthat students know that it exists. My amendment would require schools \nto include a disclosure statement on their preferred lending list that \nlets students know that they might find a better deal by visiting the \nclearinghouse themselves.\n  My amendment won't cost taxpayers a dime. The clearinghouse would be\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\nfully paid for by nominal fees that lenders would be charged in order \nto be listed in the clearinghouse.\n  Finally, my amendment would direct the Government Accountability \nOffice to issue a report to Congress about whether students have been \nable to use the clearinghouse and are using the clearinghouse, and it \nwill examine whether students who chose to use one of the school's \npreferred lenders could have gotten a better rate--better financial \narrangements--by visiting the clearinghouse had they done so. It is my \nhope this report will inform our future efforts in this area. If it \nbecomes clear that students can do much better by visiting the \nclearinghouse than by going to preferred lenders, I think we ought to \ntake a hard look at whether the preferred lenders ought to exist at all \nand whether we ought not in the future to prohibit a preferred lender \nlist and develop, instead, a comprehensive clearinghouse that allows \nstudents to find the best arrangements for themselves.\n  I believe this amendment will make the student loan industry more \ntransparent and more accountable to students and their families who \nalready struggle often to pay for these college expenses. So I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is a \nreasonable and measured approach to clean up some of the abusive \npractices and to empower students.\n  Finally, again, I would have preferred to just end the preferred \nlending list, but that is not possible. So this is the step I think \naccomplishes some of the same goals by empowering students, and I hope \nthe Senate will consider this favorably today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \noffering this amendment. I think we will be able to take it on voice--I \nknow we will be able to take it on a voice vote, and I appreciate what \nhe has done to enhance what we have in the bill that deals with more \ntransparency and better information for students and parents on their \nloans.\n  We created a number of new programs and disclosure requirements that \nwill better equip students to make informed choices about how to \nfinance their postsecondary education, which is always desired and what \nwe are always working toward, and we have to find some mechanism \nthrough which that can be done. So I appreciate the way in which the \nSenator from North Dakota has approached this.\n  I appreciate, too, his information. I always learn a lot from \nlistening to him, and the Claude Pepper pictures about the 1903 Wright \nflight and the 1969 Moon landing are particularly interesting. It does \nshow how education is accelerating--learning how to do flight in 1903, \nlanding on the Moon in 1969--but it was the Sputnik event I mentioned \nin 1957 that touched off a lot of that. So it was essentially 12 years \nof development that got us to the Moon.\n  I also want to mention the Grameen Bank. The founder of the Grameen \nBank got a Nobel Peace prize for the work he has been doing loaning \nmoney to poor people. And this is a whole different level of poor than \nwe know about in the United States. His first loan was for 27 cents to \na lady who was then able to go into a weaving business. But the point I \nwant to make is that the reason a lot of people aren't able to get \nloans is because they do not have any collateral. Students fall into \nthat category, unless their parents have money. The student doesn't \nhave money, and the student doesn't have collateral.\n  So what we have provided for in the United States, through the Higher \nEducation Act, both the reconciliation and this act, is a mechanism for \npeople who don't have collateral but just have that collateral of \ndesire; that collateral of a work ethic to be able to get loans and \ngrants to be able to go on to college.\n  The poorer they are, the more grants they qualify for in different \nways. But they can get loans based on their desire to go to college. \nThis mechanism, this clearinghouse, will help people make better \ndeterminations on their loans.\n  We also have a new mechanism which deals with the Parent PLUS loans, \nwhich are about 10 percent of the loans. That is going to be an auction \nprocess. We looked at some ways to be able to auction the rights to \nprovide the loans in order to bring down the costs, particularly the \nFederal Government. What we decided on was taking this one category and \ntrying it. To do the whole thing could disrupt the entire student loan \nprocess, so we are trying it through an auction process on the Parent \nPLUS loans. That will answer some of these questions, too, on \ncertification and perhaps bring down some of the costs. But it will \nincrease the ability of students to get loans.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his effort. At the \nappropriate time, we will do a voice vote on that if that is agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a voice vote will be fine. I don't know if \nwe are able to clear it now. I think it is cleared on our side. If it \nwere cleared on your side, I think perhaps we could proceed to have it \nconsidered.\n  Let me make a point. The Senator mentioned the microcredit issue. I \nhave been in various parts of the world where they are using \nmicrocredit. In many ways, it is the same thing as microcredit in a \ndifferent way--people with no collateral to be able to have some \nfunding to advance themselves. The microcredit approach has been \nunbelievably successful, giving poor people the opportunity to buy \nneedles for crocheting and bicycles for delivery services in various \nparts of the world. It was interesting the Senator referred to that.\n  This approach allows a student who has no collateral of any type--all \nthey have is promise, they have the promise of their capability to do \nbetter in life if they go to college--it allows them to get a loan to \nadvance their interests. I think it is exactly the right thing.\n  If we are able to consider that amendment now, I think it would be \nappropriate.\n  Mr. ENZI. The amendment is cleared on both sides. Would it be \nappropriate to finish it now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2366) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2367\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2367.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To have the Government Accountability Office conduct a study \n     regarding the employment of postsecondary education graduates)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. EMPLOYMENT OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION GRADUATES.\n\n       (a) Study, Assessments, and Recommendations.--The \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall--\n       (1) conduct a study of--\n       (A) the information that States currently have on the \n     employment of students who have completed postsecondary \n     education programs;\n       (B) the feasibility of collecting information on students \n     who complete all types of postsecondary education programs \n     (including 2- and 4-year degree, certificate, and \n     professional and graduate programs) at all types of \n     institutions (including public, private nonprofit, and for-\n     profit schools), regarding--\n       (i) employment, including--\n\n       (I) the type of job obtained not later than 6 months after \n     the completion of the degree, certificate, or program;\n       (II) whether such job was related to the course of study;\n       (III) the starting salary for such job; and\n       (IV) the student's satisfaction with the student's \n     preparation for such job and guidance provided with respect \n     to securing the job; and\n\n       (ii) for recipients of Federal student aid, the type of \n     assistance received, so that the information can be used to \n     evaluate various education programs;\n       (C) the evaluation systems used by other industries to \n     identify successful programs and challenges, set priorities, \n     monitor performance, and make improvements;\n       (D) the best means of collecting information from or \n     regarding recent postsecondary graduates, including--\n       (i) whether a national website would be the most effective \n     way to collect information;\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\n       (ii) whether postsecondary graduates could be encouraged to \n     submit voluntary information by allowing a graduate to access \n     aggregated information about other graduates (such as \n     graduates from the graduate's school, with the graduate's \n     degree, or in the graduate's area) if the graduate completes \n     an online questionnaire;\n       (iii) whether employers could be encouraged to submit \n     information by allowing an employer to access aggregated \n     information about graduates (such as institutions of higher \n     education attended, degrees, or starting pay) if the employer \n     completes an online questionnaire to evaluate the employer's \n     satisfaction with the graduates the employer hires; and\n       (iv) whether postsecondary institutions that receive \n     Federal funds or whose students have received Federal student \n     financial aid could be required to submit aggregated \n     information about the graduates of the institutions; and\n       (E) the best means of displaying employment information; \n     and\n       (2) provide assessments and recommendations regarding--\n       (A) whether successful State cooperative relationships \n     between higher education system offices and State agencies \n     responsible for employment statistics can be encouraged and \n     replicated in other States;\n       (B) whether there is value in collecting additional \n     information from or about the employment experience of \n     individuals who have recently completed a postsecondary \n     educational program;\n       (C) what are the most promising ways of obtaining and \n     displaying or disseminating such information;\n       (D) if a website is used for such information, whether the \n     website should be run by a governmental agency or contracted \n     out to an independent education or employment organization;\n       (E) whether a voluntary information system would work, both \n     from the graduates' and employers' perspectives;\n       (F) the value of such information to future students, \n     institutions, accrediting agencies or associations, \n     policymakers, and employers, including how the information \n     would be used and the practical applications of the \n     information;\n       (G) whether the request for such information is duplicative \n     of information that is already being collected; and\n       (H) whether the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey \n     conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics \n     could be amended to collect such information.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) Preliminary report.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall \n     submit to Congress a preliminary report regarding the study, \n     assessments, and recommendations described in subsection (a).\n       (2) Final report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to Congress a final report regarding such study, assessments, \n     and recommendations.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am offering a very simple amendment \ntoday which I hope will get overwhelming bipartisan support. My \namendment simply instructs the Government Accountability Office to \ncomplete a study regarding the employment of postsecondary education \ngraduates.\n  As my colleagues know, we live in a global economy that is creating \nintense competitive pressure on our workforce. It is more important \nthan ever that our Nation's students, employers, and policymakers have \naccess to good information about the effectiveness of our higher \neducation system as it relates to employment and job placement.\n  One of my favorite books, one I know many of my colleagues have read, \nis ``The World Is Flat'' by Thomas Friedman. According to Friedman, the \nconvergence of advanced technology, the removal of economic and \npolitical obstructions, and the rapid introduction of millions of young \nprofessionals into the global economy have dramatically flattened the \neconomic playing field. Friedman believes these changes are creating \nopportunities for people to tap their full potential, boost their \nprosperity, and live out their dreams. He believes that Americans with \nthe knowledge, skills, and adaptability to compete in this newly \nflattened world can look forward to a bright future, while those \nwithout these skills will be left behind.\n  If our higher education system is going to equip our students with \nthe skills they need to compete, we need to have good information on \ngraduate job performance so other students can pick the best schools \nand the most promising degrees.\n  My amendment would instruct the GAO to study the feasibility of \ncollecting information on the employment of students who complete a \npostsecondary education program. It would also instruct the GAO to \nprovide Congress with recommendations on several important questions, \nincluding whether the current State programs that bring education and \nemployment functions together can be replicated in other States; \nwhether there is a value to collecting additional information about the \nemployment of postsecondary graduates; the most promising ways of \nobtaining and disseminating this information; if a Web site is used, \nwhether the Web site should be run by a Government agency or contracted \nout to an independent organization; whether a voluntary information \nsystem would work, both from the graduates' and employers' perspective; \nhow the information could be used in practical ways; whether the \nrequests for such information are duplicative of information already \nbeing collected or whether the National Postsecondary Student Aid \nSurvey could be amended to collect such information. These are all \nimportant issues we must consider as we seek to expand information on \nthe employment experiences of our Nation's college graduates.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to explain how powerful this information \ncould be in making our Nation more competitive in the global economy. \nIf students could see how graduates from specific schools and with \nspecific degrees have performed in the workplace, they could make \nbetter choices of alternative colleges and universities. If employers \ncould see how graduates of specific schools and with specific degrees \nperformed, they could make better hiring decisions. If colleges and \nuniversities could see exactly how they are performing in equipping \nstudents for the workplace, they could make adjustments to better \ncompete with other higher education institutions. Finally, if lawmakers \ncould see exactly how our education system is performing, it would help \nus all make better policy decisions in this important area.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for his interest in this \nissue and for the assistance he and his staff have provided me. I look \nforward to working with him and the Senator from Massachusetts to find \nways to increase the availability of information we have that connects \nhigher education and employment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his good work on \nthis amendment.\n  The GAO study of the feasibility of collecting employment information \non college graduates can help us find out how effective the program is \nbefore we have another reauthorization. Reliable information on student \nsuccess, particularly employment success--that is our best measure--is \nvery important to the future of higher education. The postsecondary \neducation system needs facts at the State and institutional levels to \nidentify successes and challenges, and consumers need the information \nto make informed decisions about education and training programs. Some \nStates have pretty strong relationships between higher education and \nState agencies to get those employment statistics, but it is not done \nnationally. I think this would be a great step to providing that \ninformation and helping us to see how well we are doing, as well as the \nstudents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for what I think is \nan excellent suggestion. It is an excellent idea. Some years ago, when \nwe had the consolidation of our work-training program, we had 16 work-\ntraining programs in 6 different agencies. Under the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nprogram, we tried to consolidate those. In those programs, we tried to \ndo an assessment of training programs so someone coming will have the \ninformation that will be valuable to them--if they took X program for 8 \nweeks, what their possibilities of getting placed were and what the \npossibilities would be for their income and how that might grow over a \nperiod of time. That would give the various students, at that time, the \ninformation to know, with what options, what the future was going to \nbe.\n  It also is helpful to us on our committee to know in what areas \nindividuals are being trained. We have the responsibility in our \ncommittee to review where the vacancies are in our job markets and how \nwe are going to deal\n\n[[Page S9729]]\n\nwith those. The amendment of the Senator is going to take this to \nanother level in terms of the postgraduate education.\n  I think we will have a chance, when this is achieved, to evaluate \nwhat our national needs are as a country and as an economy and whether \nwe want to incentivize them. We can have that as a matter of public \ndiscussion and debate, as a Congress, in committees, so the American \npeople understand what is going on in terms of graduate students. It \nwill be enormously valuable and helpful.\n  We always have a debate and discussion about our doctors: Do we have \ntoo many specialists in some areas and don't have enough general \npractitioners in others? What have been the defining aspects that get \nthem to go into those areas? That is a constant issue our committee is \ndealing with at any particular time in the reauthorization.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator will have the GAO come back and \nreport. We look forward to working with the Senator when that comes \nback to try to get us greater information. It is a very solid amendment \nand a very useful one. I certainly recommend we accept it, for the \nreasons I have outlined briefly and for the reasons the Senator has \nexplained.\n  If the Senator is ready for a vote on that?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes. A voice vote will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2367) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we thank the Senator. We have made good \nprogress this morning on two very useful and important amendments. As \nwe pointed out during the discussion and debate at the end of last \nweek, we are in an extremely fortunate position. We thank the \nleadership, and I thank Senator Enzi for his persistence, insisting \nthat we deal with the authorization at a time when we are going to deal \nwith the student assistance program. They should be considered \ntogether.\n  We are grateful to the leadership for giving us the opportunity today \nto have a good chance to consider some ideas--as we have earlier this \nmorning--some good ideas on the higher education legislation. This \nlegislation is long overdue, and it is appropriate that we address it. \nWe thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation.\n  Hopefully, we will have a conclusion of this legislation after we \nhave the consideration of some amendments. I have gone through a number \nof amendments. They are very solid and helpful and useful to the \npurpose and thrust of this legislation. We will have a chance to \ncontinue the good progress we have made earlier.\n  I did wish to say a word generally about the legislation and \nhighlight some of the provisions. I start off by again thanking my \nfriend and colleague from Wyoming for his very strong work in this \narea. As I mentioned last week, our committee basically spent a great \ndeal of time on this reauthorization. The legislation we have here \ntoday--with the exception, probably, of the provisions we have added on \nthe student loans and perhaps one or two other important issues--is \nvery much the legislation that would have come through our committee \nunder his leadership.\n  We have worked in a very important tradition and we want to try to \nmaintain that tradition of strong bipartisanship. We have tried to keep \nthis free from some of the other kinds of issues people feel strongly \nabout here on the floor of the Senate because I think both of us \nunderstand that the education of the young people of this country is \nsuch an overwhelming issue for so many families that we want to try to \nmeet our responsibilities to them and do it in a timely and thoughtful \nway.\n  That has been the tradition, certainly marks the tradition of this \nparticular reauthorization legislation. This is a place, I say, to join \nwith members of our committee. Again, we have--I think the Senator from \nWyoming would agree--a committee that spends a great deal of time on \neducation issues. Whenever we have a markup, we have a very well-\ninformed discussion and debate.\n  There has been an enormous accumulation of knowledge--and always of \nconcern--by the members of our committee for these higher education \nbills; people who have spent a good deal of time on the education \nissue, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have wide diversity of our \ncommittee, urban areas, rural areas, and we have tried to respond to \nthose kinds of needs. But this reauthorization is extremely important.\n  Leading to the creation of the Higher Education Act back in 1965, \nPresident Kennedy said:\n\n       Our progress as a Nation can be no swifter than our \n     progress in education, our requirements for world leadership, \n     our hopes for economic growth, and the demands of citizenship \n     itself in an era such as this all require the maximum \n     development of every young American's capacity. The human \n     mind is our fundamental resource.\n\n  Those words rang true then, and they ring true today, as our country \nis once again in a time of war and conflict and faces great economic \nchallenges. Equal access to higher education touches every aspect of \nAmerican life. In order to compete effectively in the global economy \nand ensure a well-qualified Armed Forces, we need to equip all our \ncitizens with the sound education from prekindergarten to college.\n  Each year, 400,000 students do not go on to a 4-year college simply \nbecause they cannot afford to do so.\n  Equally devastating--this is the 400,000--it shows that some 400,000 \ntalented students, these are qualified students, students that \neffectively have the qualifications to gain entrance into institutions \nof higher learning, by and large; it is because of the lack of \nfinancial help and assistance that they do not attend a college.\n  As we have seen during the debate and discussion at the end of last \nweek, we need to make a very strong downpayment to provide help and \nassistance to students and graduates, such as through loan forgiveness, \nso that if they go into public service, which so many of them want to, \nwe provide a forgiveness program for them that will make a large \ndifference.\n  As I mentioned last week, a key element that is going to help those \n400,000 is the work that has been done by the chairman and Senator Reed \nto make the FAFSA application a good deal simpler. As we have time \nthrough the afternoon, if others may wish to address the Senate, I will \nspend a little time going through the contrast between the two, and you \nwill see the dramatic difference in the change we have had.\n  Secondly, our second chart shows the devastating, equally \ndevastating, fact that 47 percent of low-income eight graders will be \nacademically--only 47 percent--will be academically prepared for \ncollege at the time of high school graduation, compared to 86 percent \nof their higher income peers. This is, again, an issue we talked about \nbriefly last week, the growing apart of America.\n  Education is the key. We do not want to have an education system that \nis going to help America grow apart. We have made every effort in this \nlegislation to address that broader kind of issue. We are a better \nnation than that. We are a nation that believes in promise and \nopportunity for all our citizens.\n  This bill expired in 2003. It was last updated in 1998. We cannot \nafford to wait any longer to reaffirm our commitment to higher \neducation in this country and create a framework so our students are \nprepared to meet the challenges of this new economy.\n  I am immensely pleased, and I know our committee members are, that we \nwere able to swiftly move to this bill after the passage of the Higher \nEducation Access Act last Thursday. Together, they make up the \ncomprehensive higher education package.\n  Again, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, for the strong \nsupport in both of these parts of our education program and for \nconsidering them in tandem.\n  The bill we passed last week includes several critical features, \nprovisions to help make college affordable. We mentioned those during \nthe debate. But it is important again to recognize the need-based grant \naid; a significant increase in the maximum Pell grant; the\n\n[[Page S9730]]\n\nrepayment provisions that cap loan payments at 15 percent of monthly \ndiscretionary income; the loan forgiveness if individuals go into \npublic service jobs; the protection for working students so those who \nare working, trying to put themselves through school, are not going to \nearn so much it will make them ineligible for student assistance \nprograms; and the other protections we have provided for, such as those \non active duty, which are Senator Murray's provisions.\n  There is no doubt the student aid in the Access Act is the single \nmost important thing we can do to increase access for college-ready, \nlow-income students. But it is also our responsibility to ensure the \nmultibillion dollar investment of taxpayers we make to student aid is \ndelivered in the most effective and efficient way possible.\n  This authorization bill will take steps to ensure the greatest return \non this investment by addressing rising college costs, reforming the \nstudent loan system so it works for students not banks, simplifying the \nFederal aid application process, strengthening the college preparation \nprograms such as GEAR UP and TRIO and promoting high-quality and \neffective teacher preparation programs.\n  As we provide more aid to students, this bill recognizes that \ncolleges need to do their part to keep college costs down. Costs for \ncollege have more than tripled in the last twenty years, as this chart \nshows. Every middle-income family, who has a child in school or college \nknows this better than the charts can portray.\n\n  The costs have effectively tripled over the last 20 years. So the \nhigher education amendments for 2007 will hold colleges accountable for \nskyrocketing college costs by creating nationwide watch lists of \ncolleges whose costs are increasing at a rate greater than their peers \nand by encouraging the Department of Education and colleges to publish \nmore consumer-friendly information about college costs and programs.\n  To ensure this aid is directed to students, its intended \nbeneficiaries, we must keep them informed about choices and hold \ncolleges and lenders accountable for getting the students the best loan \ndeal possible.\n  The investigation by New York Attorney General Cuomo and other States \nand our committee have found many lenders are entering into sweetheart \ndeals with colleges. Some lenders offer gifts to college employees in \norder to secure their student loan business. We have documented how \nlenders who participated in the Federal student loan program offer \neducational conferences, luxury hotels, free entertainment, free \ntickets to sporting events to college officials in order to entice \nthose officials to recommend the lenders to their students.\n  Our legislation makes these practices illegal and protects students \nby ensuring that when a college recommends a lender, it is based on the \nbest interests of students and nothing else. To ensure that students \nhave access to the Federal financial aid they are eligible for, we \nsimplify the financial aid process for all students by reforming the \napplication for Federal student aid.\n  As you can see, the form is currently 10 pages long and includes more \nthan 100 questions. This chart shows--the people who are watching \ncannot read the individual lines--but this is 10 pages long. Even up \nclose it is difficult to read the questions. But it is enough to \nintimidate and inhibit many of the young people from moving ahead with \nthis program.\n  As I mentioned, thanks to Senator Enzi and Reed, this bill \ndramatically simplifies the FAFSA and examines how we can streamline it \nfurther in the future. Our bill will make the financial aid process \nmore student friendly by immediately creating a 2-page form, what we \ncall EZ FAFSA, for low-income students and phasing out the current long \npaper process. It will also create a pilot program to let students know \nhow they can access Federal aid for college earlier by allowing \nstudents to receive an aid determination or estimate in junior high \nschool so they can gain the information about whether they have a real \nopportunity to go on, to continue on to college, and get the \ninformation in an easy to understand and timely way. That is the \npurpose of this particular effort.\n  Ensuring access to adequate grant aid is one component of solving the \ncollege access crisis. We must also ensure more students are graduating \nfrom high school ready to succeed in college. In 2001, colleges \nrequired a third of all freshmen to take remedial courses in reading, \nwriting or math.\n  Because so many high school students are not learning the basic \nskills to succeed in college or work, the Nation loses more than $3.7 \nbillion a year. This figure includes the $1.4 billion to provide the \nremedial education of students who recently completed high school.\n  In addition, this figure factors in the almost $2.3 billion the \neconomy loses because remedial students are more likely to drop out of \ncollege without a degree, therefore reducing their earning potential.\n  This is extremely important. That brings us to the work our committee \nis attempting on the No Child Left Behind Act. The target of that is \nthe lower grades and high school, but we are interested in trying to \nfind a seamless web, so that we're coordinating with Head Start, with \nkindergarten, coordinating with No Child Left Behind, coordinating with \nthe colleges and universities.\n  We understand this ought to be a seamless web, so to speak. It is \nnot, at the present time, and we are committed to trying to do it. If \nwe have these kinds of gaps in the learning process for our students, \nwe are certainly not serving them well.\n  This bill also includes provisions championed by Senator Brown to \nmaintain the strength of the TRIO and GEAR UP programs which provide \nunderprivileged students with the support they need to go to college \nand graduate from college.\n  The Higher Education Act of 1965 established the National Teacher \nCorps, a federally funded Great Society program to develop our Nation's \nteaching force. This bill continues that tradition by promoting high-\nquality and effective preparation programs for new and prospective \nteachers. We are very committed to retaining high-quality teachers in \nhigh-need schools. This was of particular interest to Senator Nelson, \nGaylord Nelson, who is deceased. He was very much involved in that \nprogram and it was very successful.\n  Finally, this bill will create a new student safety grant program to \nhelp colleges and universities improve their campus safety and \nemergency response systems. As the nightmare at Virginia Tech made us \nall too aware, tragedy can strike anywhere, include college campuses. \nWe have important provisions in this area.\n  This legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in committee. \nI hope we will see that demonstrated today. One final point, when we \nare talking about the cost of colleges, we also encourage that states \nensure students and families know what they're doing to support higher \neducation. In a number of States, for example, my State of \nMassachusetts, in recent years, prior to the election of Deval Patrick, \nunder a previous Governor, we saw substantial reductions of State help \nto colleges, and so the colleges have no alternative but to raise the \nfees on young people.\n  They didn't say these were increased taxes, but effectively they were \nfor these young families. We had a dramatic reduction in terms of state \nappropriations for higher education recently. It is important for the \nAmerican people to understand, are the States helping? Are they doing \ntheir fair share or is the fact that we are seeing an increase in \nparticular States the result of State action? We want to make sure the \npublic understands it and that we understand it as well. We are serious \nabout trying to ensure that college education is affordable and \naccessible to everyone. This is not the final answer. We have a lot \nmore work to do. But I would hope the students and their families and \nthe education community would feel this is a very important and \nconstructive step. It is reflected in a very important bipartisan \neffort on our part to make sure we are going to get help to the young \npeople of this country so our Nation can be strong economically and can \nhave the young people who will make sure that our great institutions \nare going to function to protect our values and our rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that time under the quorum calls during consideration of S. \n1642 be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2368\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer. I welcome the opportunity to offer \nit on her behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 2368.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend provisions relating to the upward bound program \n        under section 402C of the Higher Education Act of 1965)\n\n       In section 403(c) of the Higher Education Amendments of \n     2007, add at the end the following:\n       (7) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Additional Funds.--\n       ``(1) Authorization.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated for the upward bound program under this chapter, \n     in addition to any amounts appropriated under section \n     402A(g), $57,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2011 for the Secretary to carry out paragraph (2), \n     except that any amounts that remain unexpended for such \n     purpose for each of such fiscal years may be available for \n     technical assistance and administration costs for the upward \n     bound program under this chapter.\n       ``(2) Use of funds.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amounts made available by paragraph \n     (1) for a fiscal year shall be available to provide \n     assistance to applicants for an upward bound project under \n     this chapter for such fiscal year that--\n       ``(i) did not apply for assistance, or applied but did not \n     receive assistance, under this section in fiscal year 2007; \n     and\n       ``(ii) receive a grant score above 70 on the applicant's \n     application.\n       ``(B) 4-year grants.--The assistance described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be made available in the form of 4-\n     year grants.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the time on the amendment itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Boxer amendment is to provide additional funding--\n$57 million for Upward Bound Programs. Upward Bound Programs are \nspecial programs, formed by colleges, to help students who come from \nlower income families and who are first-generation college students, \nand who have capacity and capability to continue on to college. It has \nbeen enormously successful. What has happened is there are applications \nsubmitted by Upward Bound Programs in order to get a grant. Depending \non a variety of different factors, those grants are either approved or \nnot. They are scored and then either approved or not. The cutoff time \nat the present time is 92 percent.\n  The Boxer amendment, with an increased authorization which amounts to \napproximately $57 million, will amend the Upward Bound scoring to say \nthat any quality program above 70 on the most recent grant cycle would \nbe eligible to receive funding.\n  This is a valuable and worthwhile effort. I have a chart which shows \nwhat the results of the Upward Bound Program have been. Nearly 90 \npercent of Upward Bound students graduate from high school compared to \nonly 68 percent of all low-income 18- to 24-year-olds. We have gone \nthrough other charts that showed, even if they graduated, those who \nwill be qualified for college. Nearly 70 percent of Upward Bound \nstudents attend college compared to the lower rate of 54 percent for \nall low-income students. Fifty percent of Upward Bound students attend \na 4-year college compared to other low-income students. Upward Bound \nstudents are four times more likely to earn an undergraduate degree \nthan students from similar backgrounds. This shows what all of us \nbelieve, and that is, all students can learn. They may learn at a \nsomewhat different pace or a different time, but they can learn.\n  What we have seen is for a number of different reasons, we find \nparticularly that those who are from the lower income families are \neither discouraged or, because of the costs, because of the \napplication, the system is skewed against them. We are seeing that \neducation, rather than being a factor which is uniting our country, is \nadding to the disparity.\n  One of the most effective programs, of course, is the TRIO Program. \nWithin the TRIO Program is the Upward Bound Program. So Members are \nvery familiar with this program. We all have programs in our own \nStates. I have many in my State--over 50 TRIO programs in \nMassachusetts. I have the list here, and there are programs in just \nabout every single State. These programs are out there and are working \nand providing important opportunities for students.\n  So this is just an authorization, but it is an important one. It is \ntargeting the group of students who need that extra help and \nassistance. It is remarkable that the schools and colleges are so \ninvolved in trying to help secondary school students. We have the GEAR \nUP program, which our good friend, Chaka Fattah from Philadelphia, was \nthe architect of, working through universities. I know in the city of \nBoston many of the high schools are tied into the colleges that work \nwith these students. It is a wonderful relationship. It is the way it \nshould be.\n  These kinds of outreach programs try to help and assist many of those \nstudents who are the neediest and are facing a wide variety of \ndifferent challenges, recognizing they, too, have dreams, hopes, and \ninterests in terms of furthering their education. This is an extremely \nmodest program, but one that is enormously valuable and has \ndemonstrated, time and again, its success.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the Boxer amendment, and I do not believe \nthere is objection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to voice my appreciation for the \npresentation that was just made to give people a fuller understanding \nof what this amendment does. I will make a couple of additional \ncomments on it.\n  One of the problems that brings this particular amendment forward is \nthe appropriators did not appropriate the money that would have \nprovided for all of the people who got a score of 70 or above to \nreceive a grant in fiscal year 2007. Perhaps that has to do with a lack \nof authorization or too low of an authorization. So this one is an \nauthorization.\n  It is an interesting process we have around here. We have the budget \nprocess, which is where the President sends us a bunch of \nrecommendations as to how he thinks we ought to spend money, and then \nwe revise it sort of the way we want to spend money, except the real \nrevision is only in the caps. That is what a budget is, it is how much \ntotal money we get to spend. Then we have an authorization process, \nwhere the committees are involved in the actual legislation for that \narea.\n  In this case, higher education comes under Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions, the HELP Committee. So we get to authorize, which says \nwhat we think ought to happen, kind of in a maximum sort of way. So \nthis amendment does authorize additional funds that would meet the \ncriteria.\n  I do have some small concern. It says this would allow for those to \nreapply who did not apply for assistance. This is a competitive grant \nsituation. For whatever reason, they might not have applied. If they \ndid not apply, for a competitive grant, you simply do not get it. But I \nsuspect that is something I will either better understand or we can \nmake a correction on at a later time. So I do not have any problem with \ntaking this amendment.\n  I do want to emphasize that anybody who wants higher education ought \nto look at the programs that are available out there. One of the things \nwe are trying to do is get more information to more people about what \nis available. We originally called it the TRIO Program because there \nwere three programs that would help students--some in minorities, some \nin lower income situations. But we had three programs.\n\n[[Page S9732]]\n\nNow we are at eight programs, and we keep devising ways so more kids \ncan get more education.\n  What we need, of course, is for the kids to take advantage of the \nprograms that are out there. I certainly would not want to stifle a \nprogram by not authorizing this at this point in time. So I encourage \nus to accept this amendment by a voice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2368.\n  The amendment (No. 2368) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \non this amendment for use in the debate on the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we know a college degree and a highly \nskilled labor force are the keys to increasing earnings and to \nAmericans' competitiveness around the world.\n  When the Senate HELP Committee began work on the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act, my main priority at the time was to ensure \nthat more students could access and afford college and job training.\n  Taken as a package, S. 1762--the Higher Education Access Act that we \npassed early Friday morning--and S. 1642--the Higher Education \nAmendments Act--that we are debating today--truly accomplish these \ngoals and more.\n  Early Friday morning, the Senate increased the maximum Pell grant \naward to assist low-income students to go to college or to get job \ntraining. Then we added additional funding for the neediest of low-\nincome students.\n  I am also very proud that we authorized and appropriated $226 million \nfor the College Access Partnership Grant Program. This is a partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and the States to help more young \nAmericans prepare for, apply to, and succeed in college.\n  We also did good work in the bill in protecting borrower benefits \nthat are provided by State agency and nonprofit lenders.\n  In Alaska, we have a State agency lender that uses their special \nallowance payments, or their SAP payments, to reduce the loan interest \nrates to the lowest in the Nation. They provide outreach and college \nearly awareness to middle and high school students. They provide need-\nbased grants and other very important benefits.\n  Alaska's State agency, nonprofit lender, and others like it in States \nsuch as Wyoming, Tennessee, and North Carolina, are not plowing their \nSAP rate into their profit margin. I am gratified the Senate was able \nto recognize the good work the State of Alaska and many other States \nare doing.\n  Also in the legislation, we ensured that young Americans will not be \nsaddled with unmanageable amounts of debt after they graduate.\n  It is these and other provisions in S. 1762 that go hand in hand with \nthe bill we are debating today, and which I am hopeful we will see \npassage of by tonight.\n  This bill, S. 1642--the Higher Education Amendments of 2007--includes \nmany important and beneficial provisions that will ensure that \nstudents, parents, and American taxpayers get the fairest deal, the \nbest information, and truly the biggest bang for their buck.\n  This legislation makes the cost of college more transparent so \nparents and students can compare the costs of different colleges to \ndetermine which ones will most effectively and affordably meet their \nneeds.\n  It places prohibitions on unauthorized entities using students' loan \nand grant information for marketing purposes. It provides fair, \nsensible, and rigorous ethics reform for financial aid administrators \nand lenders to ensure that the students receive the information they \nneed to make decisions that will benefit them and not benefit \nunscrupulous lenders or postsecondary institutions.\n  Title II of the bill streamlines and strengthens Teacher Quality \nEnhancement grants to bring more accountability to university teacher \ntraining programs. It also directs the Secretary to further simplify \nthe FAFSA the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. When we were \ntalking on the floor last week about the FAFSA application, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming held up that eight-page application and demonstrated what \nit is the students are faced with when they take this on.\n  I am particularly proud of one provision that I worked to include in \nS. 1642. This provision makes it easier for servicemembers--\nparticularly those in the lowest ranks--and their spouses to afford \ncollege.\n  I was in my State at Fort Richardson last winter, and I was visiting \nwith some of the wives of the servicemen deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I asked them in this townhall meeting: What is it that I \ncan do to help you as you wait for your loved one to return home? How \ncan we make your lives better? We talked about quality-of-life \ninitiatives. We talked about greater certainty with deployments. But \none of the wives told me that during this time when her husband was \ndeployed for 15 months, she was trying to take advantage of this time \nperiod to better herself by going on to college. She told me that one \nof the things keeping her from being able to afford to go to college \nwas that the money the military pays to help offset a portion of their \nhousing costs, which is counted toward their income, this allowance \nprevented her from being eligible for a Pell grant. Now, given the low \nrate of pay for many members of the military, particularly those in the \nlowest ranks, this is also a barrier for them in being able to take out \nstudent loans.\n  I soon found out from the National Military Families Association that \nmany military spouses are in this same position. So when I came back to \nthe Capitol, I worked to include language in S. 1642 that would exclude \nthe cost of the basic allowance for housing for servicemembers living \noff base, as well as the value of on-base housing, from being included \nin calculations for financial need.\n  Excluding the basic allowance for housing--which, in the vast \nmajority of cases, does not completely cover military families' housing \ncosts--and the value of on-base housing will benefit the least well-\npaid members of our military and their spouses. These are privates, \nthey are seamen's apprentices, lance corporals, airmen, and corporals \nwhose base pay is less than $35,000 a year. As those who are deployed \nand serving our country, we can help the spouses who perhaps are here \nand looking to better themselves during this period of time as they \nwait for their loved ones to return home. This is a true benefit for \nthem.\n  I could not be more proud to know that this strong woman whom I met \nlast year and potentially thousands like her will have a better chance \nnow of being able to attend college should we be successful in passing \nthis legislation.\n  Overall, I believe we did a fine job in making college and job \ntraining more accessible and more affordable. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, especially Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, for their \ngenerosity and their graciousness throughout this long process and \ntheir true dedication toward the goal of educating all of America's \nyoung people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Virginia will \nwithhold, I wanted to thank the good Senator from Alaska. She has been \na very active member of our committee. Besides her earlier amendment \nthat was on income-based assistance to the students, she had a very \nworthwhile amendment that is going to make a big difference in her \nState and in all of our States in terms of making greater availability \nof information and outreach to students who are qualified to go to the \nschools and colleges but otherwise would not be able to because of lack \nof information and support. That was a key element. Also, she has been \nvery much involved in the grant program which is included in this for \nscience and technology.\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\n  She has been a very active member. We value very much her input and \ninvolvement in the legislation. We thank her for her comments.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, would like to thank her for her \ncomments and her tremendous participation on the committee, \nparticularly with her rural approach to problem-solving, and that rural \napproach affects Wyoming equally--well, maybe not equally to Alaska \nbecause they have a lot more land with a few more people--but she has \ndone a tremendous job in the committee.\n  I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Virginia for a \npresentation of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2371\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer, and I wish \nto particularly thank the managers of this bill. In my 29 years here in \nthe Senate, I have stood on the floor many times with Senator Kennedy, \nbut at this time, we are absolutely joined in this magnificent piece of \nlegislation which I submit on behalf of Senator Kerry and Senator Webb \nand many other Senators who have worked on it through the years.\n  To my good friend, Senator Enzi, I was once on his committee, the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), but \nas we move around here, I just couldn't get on the HELP Committee this \ntime around.\n  I commend Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy and their staffs for their \nvery hard work in preparation of this amendment, and my staff, senior \nmember Angela Stewart. Over the weekend, I was traveling, as many of \nour colleagues were in our respective States, and she and I must have \nhad at least six to eight telephone calls over the period of 2 days, \njust working out refinements and protocol with regard to this \namendment. I think it is a representation of the Senate. No matter \nwhether we are here on the floor or wherever we may be, we constantly \nare working on the legislative proposals that many of us have from time \nto time.\n  Again, I wish to draw attention to the title of this particular \namendment. First, I send it to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mr. Webb, proposes an amendment numbered 2371.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a digital and wireless network technology \n                    program, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of title VIII of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 802. MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS FOR ADVANCED \n                   TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATION.\n\n       At the end of title VIII (as added by section 801), add the \n     following:\n\n  ``PART N--MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND \n                               EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 876.

The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is entitled, ``Minority Serving \nInstitutions for Advanced Technology and Education,'' amendment to S. \n1642, The Higher Education Act Amendments of 2007.\n  I remember in the 1980s, traveling to several of the historically--\nand they referred to them as ``historically Black colleges'' in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, I noticed the absence of so much \ninfrastructure in these struggling institutions that other institutions \noften had in abundance. Having had an engineering background myself, at \nmy old school, Washington Lee University, we had laboratories with an \nabundance of equipment and all types of high technology.\n  I suppose at that time the thoughts in my mind led toward this day, \nand it has been a long climb up the mountain--not by just this Senator \nfrom Virginia but by many, many Senators. I remember Senator Cleland \nwas very interested in this, former Senator Cleland, Max Cleland of \nGeorgia, and my colleague and former Senator George Allen of Virginia. \nFortunately, today, with the two managers of this bill, the chairman \nand ranking member of this important committee, the HELP Committee, and \nwith the help of many others and the primary cosponsor, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and my colleague \nfrom my State, Senator Webb, we are here this afternoon to present this \namendment.\n  I first ask unanimous consent that those Senators who desire to put \nin statements regarding this amendment of course may do so and that \nthey be colocated in the Record following the introduction of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it appears statistically that over 60 \npercent of the jobs in America, all across our land, require not only a \nbasic knowledge but really an advanced skill in what we refer to as \n``information technology.'' Jobs in this area, frankly, pay and command \nhigher salaries. Today, as I said, many of the minority serving \ninstitutions--this covers a wide group of institutions which I will \naddress later in my text, but the minority serving institutions simply \nlack the resources, the necessary capital, endowments, and all types of \nfinancing that go into these institutions to acquire the basic \nequipment, whether it is an actual computer itself, or the technology \nto hook it into systems, and they also need technology capabilities in \ntheir classrooms, dormitories and libraries. It is for that purpose we \nare asking the Senate today to support this bill to provide the sum of \nmoney for 5 consecutive years to form a competitive grant program so \nthis wide range of institutions may compete for this pot of money and \nhopefully obtain it for their respective institutions.\n  We need to bridge--and I use the term the ``digital divide'' to help \nstudents who want to develop the skills necessary to succeed in a \ntechnology-based economy so that they can compete in today's modern \nworld and take these jobs, which, incidentally, are badly needed in the \nworkforce, and therefore get salary and perhaps a step up on the ladder \nof development of their career. This is definitely a bipartisan \namendment and, as I said with the deepest sense of humility, many, many \nSenators have worked toward this day.\n  Specifically, the legislation will establish, as I said, a grant \nprogram for these institutions of higher learning to bring increased \naccess to computers, technology, and the Internet to their student \npopulations. Institutions can use funds to acquire equipment, \ninstrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, digital \nnetwork technology, wireless technology, and infrastructure to develop \nand provide these educational services. In addition, the grants can be \nused for such activities as campus wiring, equipment upgrades, and \ntechnology training. Finally, Minority Serving Institutions could use \nthese funds to offer their students universal access to campus \nnetworks, thereby increasing connectivity and making infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  Moreover, much has been said in this education debate about the \nimportance of math and science education. I remember well, I and other \nSenators 2 years ago were authors of the SMART grant program, which \nprovides stipends to economically disadvantaged students in their third \nand fourth year of college or university training who elect to study \ncritical majors in math, science, and engineering and key foreign \nlanguages. We must now begin to encourage and provide for those \nstudents who want to start earlier than their third and fourth year and \nbegin to enter and study these critical fields, not only of math and \nscience but of high tech.\n  I point out, I remember very well when I came out of the Navy at the \nend of World War II, I had the GI bill, and I went to my university--a \nsmall one--and they had a very small engineering department at that \ntime. The engineering department is now gone because it couldn't take \nthe competition of larger schools. But I remember so well we would go \ninto the laboratories in the afternoon and spend long hours. We didn't \nhave any air-conditioning, so we opened the windows, obviously. You \ncould hear the other students out on the playing fields enjoying all \nkinds of sports and other things while we were there laboring over the \nlaboratory requirements. Then, at night, of course, we all had the \nobligatory homework. It seems to me that those of us who were in the \nhigh-tech and the math--I was a math major and physics major--we would \nspend endless, long hours on our homework.\n  I bring that up not to in any way eulogize myself and my career but \nsimply to say that those students who want to dedicate that extra time \nto study in the high-tech world--and it does require extra time, \nthereby giving up some of the pleasures in life--we ought to have the \nproper equipment available for all of them.\n  The National Science Foundation reports that the percentage of \nbachelor's degrees in science and engineering across America has been \ndeclining. Many a time I and other Members of this body have pointed \nout how America is falling behind, particularly with reference to India \nand to China, as such a higher percentage of their university graduates \nare following the high-tech careers. So let's give a leg-up to those \nyoung people who want to devote that extra time, that extra motivation \nin their studies for these specialties in math, science, and \ntechnology.\n  This amendment also addresses the shortage of qualified professionals \nthat teach courses in these areas. You simply have to have not only the \nhardware within the institution but knowledgeable teachers and \nprofessors, and this amendment provides an inducement for their \ntraining.\n  As I said, I am proud to say that my great State is home to six \ninstitutions that qualify for this grant program. Throughout the years \nthat I have been in the Senate, they have proudly been referred to as \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities, known as the HBCUs: \nNorfolk State University, St. Paul's College, Virginia University of \nLynchburg, Virginia Union University, Hampton University, and Virginia \nState University. Right now, at this point, I thank all of the faculty \nand presidents of those institutions and administrators who through \nthese many years, year after year, have come into my office pleading \nfor this modest program to help them put in the infrastructure and gain \nthe teaching faculty to help the students who want to pursue these \ncareers in science, math, and technology. Likewise, all across America, \nMinority Serving Institutions will\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\nqualify for this grant program. There are over 200 Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions, over 100 Historically Black Colleges outside of Virginia, \nand over 30 Tribal Colleges throughout the United States. In addition, \nAlaska Native-serving institutions and Native Hawaiian-serving \ninstitutions are also eligible for these grants.\n  In the mid-1980s, on the campus of St. Paul's, my first thoughts \nregarding the growing disparity between Historically Black Colleges and \nother institutions of higher education with respect to the \ninfrastructure began leading up to this day.\n  This Senate has addressed similar pieces of legislation in the past \nyear. In 2003, a similar bill passed in the Senate with a roll call \nvote of 97 to 0. In 2005, a similar bill passed in the Senate by \nUnanimous Consent. So I am pleased today, together with Senator Kerry \nand Senator Webb, to offer this not only on behalf of ourselves, but \nthe many Senators who through the years--some who have now retired--\nhave worked hard on this legislation.\n  Again, I salute the faculty and presidents, and so forth, at these \ninstitutions and, most particularly, I salute the students who are \nready and willing to seize the opportunity that this bill will provide \nto advance their intellectual skills to meet the requirements of \ntoday's workforce, so that America can be competitive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, for his excellent presentation, and also for reminding us about \nthe importance of math and science and technology and engineering. As a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, I think his involvement and \nfocus on this is also enormously important because he understands that \neducation is not only a value to the individual, not only a value to \nour economy, but it is an essential aspect in terms of our national \nsecurity. I have talked with him frequently about the National Defense \nEducation Act that made such a difference in terms of availability. \nThat was after Sputnik in the late 1950s, when the country came \ntogether and passed the National Defense Education Act. Still, some of \nthose individuals are in key positions today in both private and public \nsectors. They are individuals who took advantage of that.\n  In the Defense authorization, Senator Collins and I had spoken to the \nSenator when he was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We have \nthe small program that is directly focused on math, science, \nengineering, and technology that he included in legislation in the \npast. We have a number of enormously interested young people who are \ntaking advantage of those scholarships. We remember the amendments the \nSenator offered on the reconciliation that he referenced here \npreviously. So this is an area that he has shown enormous interest in \nand concern about. We are enormously grateful for his intervention.\n  As the Senator knows, we passed the COMPETE Act earlier this year. In \nthat COMPETE Act there are provisions to assist these minority \ninstitutions. Quite frankly, there are a lot of other priorities in \nthat COMPETE Act. I think the fact that the Senator has given us this \nlegislation and this focus is incredibly helpful to us. I thank the \nSenator for all of his efforts. It is no surprise to me that my \ncolleague and friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, is your strong \ncosponsor because I have talked with him about this subject matter on \nmany occasions.\n  I just draw the attention of the Senator to this chart, which I think \nmakes the point the Senator pointed out. The bill provides resources \nfor institutions to build capacity, develop facilities, and improve \ninstruction; expands opportunities for institutions to serve more low- \nand middle-income students; supports greater financial literacy and \nstrengthens the focus on studies in the STEM fields.\n  That is a pretty good summation of what the Senator is trying to do. \nI think it is enormously important that this legislation be included. \nSenator Kerry is very interested in this, as well as Senator Webb. I \nthank all of you for giving this focus and attention. This is a very \nimportant undertaking, very important legislation. I am grateful the \nSenator has taken the time to bring this to our attention.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my friend who has worked with me \nfor these 29 years. Following Senator Enzi, I wonder if I may have 2 \nminutes on one other point.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator, Mr. Warner, \nfor his tremendous effort, and not just on this bill but on the \nprevious bills where his emphasis on science, technology, engineering, \nand math, has resulted in other grants that are available to students. \nWe need to increase awareness among students of these opportunities, \nparticularly in the lower grades, so they have the prerequisites they \nneed to qualify for going to college. The Senator's emphasis on that \nhas had tremendous effect on higher education and on the work we have \ndone before.\n  I also thank the Senator for the comments he made about his staff \nworking through the weekend and ours working through the weekend. This \nis not a 9-to-5 job around here. People don't realize the amount of \ndedication our staffs have. As I say, they work through the weekend for \nthese students. It happened to be a beautiful weekend in Washington, \nand they were indoors making telephone calls and making sure that \neverything works precisely right so we can pass this amendment today. I \nthink we would be willing to take it on a voice vote.\n\n  This will provide up-to-date technology, which is vitally important. \nEverything is operating off of technology today. And I especially \nappreciate the concern for and emphasis on minority-serving \ninstitutions having this opportunity. There is a disadvantage there, \nand we want to equalize that. The Senator has caught the essence of \nthat and has the solution for it. I congratulate him. It will \nstrengthen the national and digital and wireless infrastructure. That \nhelps all of us because it increases national investment in that area \nand makes us all more communicative and to also have a greater ability \nfor education.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the kind remarks \nof the Senators. Mr. President, I will just tell a short story. Senator \nKennedy mentioned the importance of this to the Armed Forces to have a \npool of trained individuals to join the military today. I would like to \ncontrast it to an early experience I had in life. In the winter of \n1945, the war was raging in Europe--although it ended in May, it was \nstill going on, as was the war in the Pacific. Like everybody else on \nmy block, all students who were 17 and 18, we all joined the military. \nI don't claim to have a military career of any great consequence, but I \nwill never forget the first night. We had been on a small train that \nstopped in stations all across the east coast picking up a dozen or two \n17- and 18-year-olds on the train. It was cold as the dickens, and the \ntrain was chugging its way up to the Great Lakes.\n  We arrived at 2 or 3 in the morning. We were tired, cold, and huddled \ninto a great big room. A petty officer, who was quite rotund, got up on \na little platform and screamed at us, ``All you guys who can't read and \nwrite raise your hands.'' I had the benefit of a wonderful education in \nhigh school. I almost flipped out. I did not realize, really, that many \npeople didn't have the basic skills that I had been given.\n  Then the petty officer said, ``All you smart so-and-sos fill out the \nforms for the others.'' About 20, 25 percent of the fellows came out of \nthe coal mines and steel mills of Pennsylvania and up through the \nvalley, where the train went picking up these guys. So we filled out \nthe forms.\n  I want to say that those men had very short training once we got to \nthe Great Lakes. The rest of us were shunted aside for technical \nschools. Within 90 days, they went aboard ships and right into the \nbattle.\n  On those ships in those days there were dozens of jobs that persons \nwho could not read and write could perform, and perform very well. In \nno way do I denigrate their abilities to fight, as they did bravely in \nWorld War II--those who could not read and write. Today's ship in the \nU.S. Navy--take a destroyer. The destroyers today are considerably \nlarger than the destroyers of the past. But the crews are dramatically \nreduced in number, which means that every one of those naval persons \ntoday has to have high-tech skills. It is true also in the Army and \nMarine Corps.\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n  When you visit Iraq and see the troops there, as most of us have, \nthey are all working with high-tech equipment. There is no place \navailable today in the military for one who is not skilled in high-tech \nwork. So it is a changed society, albeit my story dates back more than \na half century. They were fighters then, but in today's military we \naccess those in the military with high school equivalent. The ones who \nshow a technical proficiency are immediately moved into advanced \ntechnical courses.\n  So this legislation is laying the foundation for those in these \ninstitutions who so desire to join the U.S. military, and they will \narrive on the first day not requiring a fellow soldier, sailor, airman, \nor marine to fill out their form. They are all smart and able to work \nwith the high-tech equipment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the Warner amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2371) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time \nbe charged to the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I \nwill make be charged against the bill rather than the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin said:\n\n       Genius without education is like silver in the mine.\n\n  What he was saying is that silver still in the rock, in the ore, is \nworthless until it is mined, taken out of the rock. It is the same with \neducation. Genius without education is akin to silver in a mine.\n  We have, I am sure, a lot of geniuses who have not been educated, and \nthat is too bad. That is what this legislation is all about. It is \nunquestioned that a college education is the single greatest weight on \nthe scales of success. Yet today, more and more working-class Americans \nare shut out from the promise and opportunity of a college education \nbecause the price is out of their reach.\n  Last week, we took a significant step to restoring that promise to \nhundreds of thousands of American students by passing the bipartisan \nHigher Education Access Act. It should not go unnoticed that the $17 \nbillion in new student aid and benefits represents the largest increase \nin college assistance since Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights more \nthan 50 years ago.\n  The bill we passed last week did this in a comprehensive way by \nincreasing grant aid, expanding the number of students eligible for \nFederal aid, making loan debt more manageable, and expanding loan \nforgiveness options for those professions that we all recognize are \nimportant to society--teaching, social work, law enforcement, and \nhealth care.\n  Today, in considering the higher education amendments, we authorize \nremaining programs and funding in the Higher Education Act. This bill \nis not weeks overdue or months overdue, it is years overdue.\n  First, this legislation addresses the recent student loan scandals. \nWith provisions in the bill--increased disclosure requirements, \nprohibiting payments and gifts from lenders to colleges and financial \naid administrators, and new restrictions on preferred lender lists--we \nare finally putting an end to these unacceptable practices and making \nsure the student loan system works in the interests of our students.\n  As importantly, we tackle the rising costs of college. Despite the \nbillions in new student aid and benefits in the bill we passed last \nweek, if college costs continue to rise at the rate they have been--\ntripling over the past 20 years--higher education will continue to \nremain further and further out of reach for too many Americans.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation. I am also pleased students \nin Nevada have the good fortune of a State university system with some \nof the lowest costs in the Nation. But the same is not true everywhere, \nand this bill will hold colleges accountable if their costs increase \ntoo dramatically. It also ensures students and parents have information \nthey need to make objective decisions based on the cost of college.\n  Finally, the bill phases out the unnecessarily complicated Federal \nfinancial aid form which is currently 7 pages long--and probably more \ncomplicated than filing out a tax return--with a much simpler 2-page \nform.\n  Again, thanks to Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the work they have \ndone and the rest of the HELP Committee for their work in the \nformulation of this bill which, when combined with their efforts last \nweek, reaffirms our commitment to making higher education affordable \nand accessible to America's students.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, we thank \nhim so much for scheduling this legislation, both the underlying \nlegislation we passed last week, which will make a difference to \nstudents, and the authorization. I know my friend and colleague from \nWyoming, as well as others, knows we saw this authorization expire some \n3 years ago. So this is long overdue.\n  The idea that we passed both these pieces of legislation together is \ngoing to make a major difference, not only to the students, about whom \nwe are primarily concerned, and to their families but also to the \ncolleges and universities and to all the other entities in the \neducational community.\n  We are moving along with these amendments. We are very thankful for \nall the cooperation we have received this afternoon. Hopefully, we are \nable to conclude this bill either late tonight or tomorrow. This will \nbe a very significant and important time in terms of educational policy \nfor our country.\n\n  I thank the leader very much.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, and my friend from Wyoming, we did not have \ntime to do this legislation, but we had to take time to do this \nlegislation. This is an example of how committees working together can \nget work done. Committees do a lot of work, but much of what comes out \nof the committees is done on a partisan basis. Democrats vote for it, \nRepublicans vote against it. Frankly, we cannot get those bills to the \nfloor. We cannot get them done.\n  I repeat, we did not have time to do this legislation. We have so \nmuch to do. We have appropriations bills we need to do. As soon as we \nfinish this bill, we are going to move to Homeland Security \nappropriations, which is essential. SCHIP legislation, we have to do \nthat. We have to do the conference report on the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. We have to complete the work we have done and gone so \nfar down the road on ethics and lobbying reform.\n  This is an example, and I say this to all committees, to work \ntogether such as these two men have worked together and we can get \nthings done. That is how we were able to get the Energy bill passed \nearlier. We took those provisions from the Energy Committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich there was unanimity, everyone agreed. I took those provisions and \nput them in a package, and that was the bill we passed in the Senate.\n  I appreciate Senator Kennedy mentioning my name, but the work was \ndone by this committee last week and arriving at the point where we can \nhave this legislation completed today. This is important legislation.\n  I heard Senator Warner on the floor today talking about when he went \nin the military. They had those who couldn't read or write during World \nWar II raise their hand. Twenty-five percent of the people on the ship \ncould not read or write. We don't have that situation today. But we do \nhave a situation where there are many people, such as the example I \ngave, who have the intellect to have a college education and simply \ncannot do it. It is as\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\nBenjamin Franklin said, when the silver is still in the mine, it \ndoesn't help anybody. When we have the people who have the ability to \nbe educated who cannot be educated, it doesn't speak well of our \ncountry.\n  We have to continue down that road of educating our students, and \nthis legislation, tied in with what we did last week, is a giant step \nforward.\n  I again express my appreciation to Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the \nmembers of the committee for allowing us to get to the point where we \nhave time to do a bill that we don't have time to do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii was on the floor \na moment ago. We are expecting his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2372.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To include Native Hawaiians as groups underrepresented in \n        graduate education for purposes of the Ronald E. McNair \n                 postbaccalaureate achievement program)\n\n       At the end of section 403, add the following:\n       (i) Additional Amendment to Postbaccalaureate Achievement \n     Program.--Section 402E(d)(2) (as redesignated by subsection \n     (e)(2)) (20 U.S.C. 1070a-15(d)(2)) is further amended by \n     inserting ``, including Native Hawaiians, as defined in \n     section 7207 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965, and Pacific Islanders'' after ``graduate education''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  In our United States, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders \nare far less likely than the average American to earn a bachelor's or \ngraduate degree. This makes Native Hawaiians and other Pacific \nIslanders drastically underrepresented in higher education. \nUnfortunately, Pacific Islanders are left with fewer opportunities to \nlift themselves out of underrepresentation because, unlike African \nAmericans, unlike American Indians, unlike Alaska Natives, and unlike \nHispanics, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have been largely \nexcluded from programs such as the McNair Achievement Program based on \na determination that they are not an underrepresented group.\n  The McNair program is designed to prepare young men and women from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds who have demonstrated strong academic \npotential for doctoral studies through involvement in research and \nother scholarly activities. However, until the underrepresentation of \nNative Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders is addressed, the promise of the \nMcNair program to help the underrepresented achieve their dreams of \nhigher education will remain only partially fulfilled.\n  According to a study conducted by the Pacific Islander Access \nproject, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders have difficulty \ngaining access to programs for underrepresented minorities in higher \neducation, such as the McNair Program. In fact, the study reported that \nmore than 80 percent of these scholarship programs did not recognize \nNative Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders as underrepresented. This \nis due, in part, to a misconception that Native Hawaiians and other \nPacific Islanders are not a distinct group but are, instead, an Asian \nsubgroup. This misconception is, to a large extent, rooted in the \nFederal Government's policy from 1977 to 1997 to lump Asians and \nPacific Islanders into one category. Fortunately, in 1997, this Federal \npolicy was changed to recognize that Pacific Islanders and Asians are \nseparate and distinct groups. However, many programs, including the \nMcNair Program, have yet to catch up with this Federal policy.\n  It is to our Nation's credit that we have developed programs such as \nthe McNair Program in response to the needs of our country's minority \nstudents, and my amendment in no way excludes other underrepresented \ngroups. Rather, this amendment simply ensures that Native-Hawaiian and \nother Pacific-Islander students are also allowed full access to the \nopportunities afforded the McNair Program, which has opened the door to \nan advanced degree for so many in our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help young Native \nHawaiians and other Pacific Islanders achieve their potential.\n  I wish to thank the chairman for his zealous attitude in which he has \ntried to help all those in the United States who need help in \neducation, and I commend him for that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Hawaii for \nbringing this to our attention, this situation which works to the \ndisadvantage of Pacific Islanders and specifically Native Hawaiians. He \nquite appropriately points out that other groups are included as \nunderserved populations but the Native Hawaiians are not and the \nPacific Islanders are not. In many respects, the fact that they are not \nable to participate in these programs works to the disadvantage of the \npopulation generally from being included in terms of the life of not \nonly their communities but the communities of our country. All his \namendment does is to make sure they are going to be included in this \nprogram.\n  What is this program? This program is really a helping hand to those \nstudents who are going on to college--in this case, it would be the \nHawaiians and the Pacific Islanders--a helping hand in counseling, \ngiving guidance to these students so that they might participate in \nthese other programs which offer real hope in terms of technology in \nthe future. Effectively, his amendment says that Pacific Islanders and \nNative Hawaiians will be included so as to qualify for these programs \nin ways that mean students, who otherwise would be excluded from \ngetting counseling--the helping hand--could continue for graduate \ndegrees. It seems to me they should be included, and the amendment \nmakes a good deal of sense.\n  For those reasons and the excellent reasons the Senator mentioned \nearlier, I thank him for bringing this to our attention. I must say, I \nwas not aware those groups had been excluded, quite frankly, from the \nprogram. I don't know how this originally happened, but we always learn \na good deal from our colleagues here in the Senate, and we have learned \na good deal about this issue today. As always, the Senator from Hawaii \nis out front when it comes to issues on education and opportunity for \nNative Hawaiians and for Pacific Islanders, and we are very grateful to \nhim for bringing this to our attention.\n  Hopefully, we will accept this and make sure it is a part of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, wish to thank Senator Akaka for \nbringing this to our attention. That is one of the reasons we have 100 \npeople in the Senate and 435 people on the House side, so that we bring \nall these various backgrounds together, so that something which may \nhave been overlooked can be corrected, and the amendment process is one \nof the places where we correct that.\n  As Senator Akaka has said, this amendment would provide Native \nHawaiians and Pacific Islanders with eligibility for the Ronald McNair \nPost-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, and that is a program which \nprovides assistance to disadvantaged students who are pursuing doctoral \ndegrees. The students in the McNair Program get research opportunities, \nthey get seminars, they get summer internships, they get tutoring and \nacademic counseling, and they get assistance in securing graduate \nadmission and financial aid mentoring. Those are all things, of course, \nwhich increase the probability and the possibility that a person will \nget their doctoral degree.\n  I am sure it wasn't anyone's intention to leave these groups out, so \nthis amendment, of course, would include the Native Hawaiians to the \nlist of students eligible for this program. So, in his usual way of \ntaking a careful look at things, I appreciate his doing this and enjoy \nall the times we have worked together on financial literacy.\n  I think there is still someone taking a look at the exact wording on \nthis, so hopefully we can get that done and get to a voice vote a \nlittle later.\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Am I correct in understanding that Senator Akaka was a principal in \nan elementary school.\n  Mr. AKAKA. That is true. I was a principal in an elementary school.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In an elementary school.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How many years were you a principal in an elementary \nschool?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I was a principal for 6 years, before I was moved into the \nGovernor's office.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Good. Well, I thank the Senator.\n  Senator Akaka brings many different qualities to his service, but the \nfact that he was a principal in an elementary school reflects that he \nunderstands the importance of education, and he knows this community.\n  It gives us additional information to understand his strong \ncommitment in this area of opportunity for Pacific Islanders and for \nNative Hawaiians.\n  I think, Mr. President, we will hold up, but I expect we will pass \nthis amendment in a short while. So I think at this time we are just \ngoing to hold, if we could.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be charged to \nthe amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Burr, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2373.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Federal student aid is a tangled web of tax, \ngrant, loan, and savings programs with rules and regulations that are \nso complicated, many prospective students don't know that they really \ncan afford to go to college. Families have to fight their way through a \nmaze of paperwork. We have talked about this several times, the \ndifficulty of the present financial aid form. Nearly 10 million \nprospective aid recipients must file that form each year, and \nsubmitting the form is the only way for families to determine their \neligibility for Federal grants and loans.\n  The free application for federal financial aid is longer and more \ncomplicated than a Federal tax form. It has 5 pages and 127 questions, \nso it is longer than the form 1040EZ, which is 1 page and 37 questions \nfor filing your taxes, or the form 1040A, which is 2 pages and 83 \nquestions. It is comparable to the form 1040, with 2 pages and 118 \nquestions. The contrast between the tax forms and the financial aid \nforms is especially informative. With a third of the financial aid form \nquestions and a fifth of its pages, the IRS captures the information \nneeded to determine tax liability for the very population targeted by \nthe Pell grant.\n  Financial aid officers and education specialists typically explain \nthat the complexity of the form is a necessary evil, without which we \ncould not target aid to students with the greatest need. The FAFSA, \nfinancial aid form, is long, it is argued, so that it can precisely \nmeasure who most needs aid. However, a few economists have recently \ncompleted research that measured empirically how much complexity in the \ncurrent aid system contributes to its targeting. They found this \ncomplexity adds very little to the targeting of aid to those who most \nneed it. Only a handful of questions on the FAFSA determine eligibility \nfor Federal aid, and most of these questions are currently found even \nin the 1040EZ, the tax form.\n  In response, a small but growing number of researchers, economists, \nand leaders in higher education have offered proposals to reduce the \nFAFSA to one page and to prepopulate a student's FAFSA with the data \ntheir families have already submitted to the IRS. Such an approach \nwould reduce the time-consuming and confusing FAFSA paperwork which \nrequires parents and students to report to one Federal agency--the \nDepartment of Education--data they have already submitted to another \nFederal agency--the IRS.\n  Two North Carolinians--Senator Burr, on whose behalf I have submitted \nthis amendment, and Erskine Bowles, who is the President of the \nUniversity of North Carolina System, teamed up in the belief they could \nmake applying for financial aid simpler and easier. President Bowles \nknows simplification of Federal applications is possible. As \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration in the 1990s, \nErskine Bowles reduced the inch-thick SBA loan application to one page.\n  After a conversation between the two this spring, President Bowles \nput together a task force across the State of North Carolina and gave \nthem 90 days to come up with a one-page form which made better use of \ndata parents had already reported to the IRS. This June, President \nBowles delivered the mockup of this one page to Senator Burr. So North \nCarolina showed we can and should work more rapidly to simplify the \nprocess of financial aid, both by reducing the length of the \napplication and making better and more efficient use of data parents \nhave already submitted to the Federal Government through their IRS \nforms.\n  I would mention we have had a task force, largely my staff, who has \nbeen working on reducing it. We have it down to a one-page form. But \nSenator Burr's amendment speeds up the time we study included in the \nhigher education bill, so the relevant offices: Education, Comptroller \nGeneral, Treasury, Office of Management and the Congressional Budget \nOffice and representatives of higher education and State higher \neducation executive officers who have a demonstrated commitment to \nsimplifying the application for financial aid, report back to Congress \nin 1 year, how we could simplify the application and make even better \nuse of data parents have already submitted to the Federal Government.\n  America's students and parents should not have to wait any longer \nthan necessary for simplification. One stage of simplification should \nnot preclude another stage of simplification. We do want to see that \nthose who need the money the most have the highest priority. We want \nthat to be done as simply as possible, so it doesn't discourage people \nfrom applying.\n  I appreciate this amendment to try to speed up the time to do a \nfurther simplification of FAFSA. I am pretty sure there are no \nobjections on the other side of the aisle. We will leave the time open \nfor further debate on that as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and allocate the time to the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2374\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for several years I have been looking at \nthe question of student loans and the abuse that often exists in that \nprocess. Also, another issue that has concerned me is America's lack of \nphysicians in numbers sufficient to meet our current demands and the \ndemands we may have in the future. So I have an amendment today that, \nhopefully, the bill managers, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, might feel \ncomfortable supporting. It deals with both of those issues, I think, in \na way that takes us in a positive direction.\n  The Association of American Medical Colleges, after the \nrecommendation of Dr. Jordan Cohen, their president a couple years ago, \nrecently stated it is their official policy that medical school \nenrollment should be increased by 30 percent. Most American medical \nschools are now already beginning to increase enrollment, some at about \nthe rate of 15 percent, which can be done in most colleges without \ngreat expense. But as you get closer to a one-third increase, it \nactually begins to put a bite on people's programs. They have to have \nfaculty, perhaps buildings, and other capabilities that may incur \nsubstantial costs.\n\n  One of the things that has concerned me--and I am not sure most \nAmericans are fully aware of it--is that a shortage of physicians is \nbeing filled by an increasing number of graduates from foreign medical \nschools. Many of these are offshore schools in the Caribbean--for-\nprofit schools. Many of them don't require test scores to get in, and \nthey are not up to the standard of American schools. That is a fact. We \nhave the finest, most magnificent medical schools in the world. We have \na tremendous teaching and training program. We have some of the best \nequipment any schools could imagine in our country. So it is a special \nthing.\n  But I have been concerned that perhaps we have been too tough on \nenrollment, requiring too high of test scores, sometimes denying good \npeople with good leadership skills, such as class presidents and \ncaptains of the football team, who scored a little bit below someone \nwho had a higher physics or\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\nchemistry score, and they don't get in. So I think we need to expand \nthe number of people who come into medical school, and we ought to be \nopen to qualities that are proven to further medical success, frankly. \nSo I am concerned about that.\n  The interesting development I have discovered that goes to the \nquestion of our Federal dollars and how we are supporting medical \neducation is indicated by this chart. It deals with the number of loans \ncertified for U.S. residents who are attending foreign schools. In \ngeneral, whether you are going for a semester abroad to Italy or Brazil \nor England or wherever, this shows that during the 1993-1994 academic \nyear, there were under 4,600 loans, and ten years later there were over \n13,000 loans. That might make one think this is a good thing, that more \nAmericans are taking a semester abroad, as is common in a lot of \nschools. They encourage students to take a semester abroad, and it is \nan enriching experience--maybe even a year abroad. One might think that \nis what that issue deals with. But let's show what is happening here.\n  Look at this chart. Of the 13,000 students who attend foreign \nschools, about 9,000 of those are attending foreign medical schools. \nAbout 75 percent of the total study abroad loan volume of 2003, or \nabout $170 million--and I am sure that number has gone up--is now for \nloans to students who attend foreign medical schools. That is a rather \nshocking number and a dramatic number. It comes from a GAO report, \ndated July of 2003. That is a matter I would call attention to.\n  What about these loans? Are these people attending top Paris medical \nschools or what? Look at them in terms of the volume of loans, first. \nLet's look at No. 1, the No. 1 school in the world where students \nreceive U.S. Federal loan money is a medical school in Dominica. They \nonly have one medical school on that island in the Caribbean, and they \nreceive $35 million in loan volume, with 1,700-plus students receiving \nloans to go to that school.\n  The next one in volume is Grenada. Remember during President Reagan's \npresidency, when we had an invasion of Grenada, where we had American \nmedical students and their safety was of great concern to us when that \ninvasion took place. Grenada has one medical school. It gets $30 \nmillion and has 1,500 students attending.\n  The third country to receive Federal loan money for medical school is \nMexico. They have 11 schools and they get $27 million. England is \nfourth. They have 182 schools in England, but they only get $25 million \nin student loans, and they have quite an advanced medical program \nthere.\n  The next school on the list--the next country is the Dominican \nRepublic, another island school. The Dominican Republic has six \nschools, and they receive $20 million in student loans each year. The \nnext one is St. Maarten, another Caribbean island, $16 million. Next is \nCanada. We would think that would be up there at the top, would we not? \nCanada, our neighbor. Canada has 108 schools and they get only $15 \nmillion. The next one is another island school in the Caribbean, St. \nKitts, they have two schools and they get $14 million.\n  I think that begins to show the problem we are dealing with. I would \nsuggest we need to take some real interest in it.\n  So I have offered an amendment that would deal with it. I send my \namendment to the desk, as modified, and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2374.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n   regarding graduate medical schools located outside of the United \n                                States)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. FOREIGN MEDICAL SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Percentage Pass Rate.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 102(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)(bb) (20 U.S.C. \n     1002(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)(bb)) is amended by striking ``60'' and \n     inserting ``75''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect on July 1, 2010.\n       (b) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall--\n       (A) complete a study that shall examine American students \n     receiving Federal financial aid to attend graduate medical \n     schools located outside of the United States; and\n       (B) submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     conclusions of the study.\n       (2) Contents.--The study conducted under this subsection \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) The amount of Federal student financial aid dollars \n     that are being spent on graduate medical schools located \n     outside of the United States every year, and the percentage \n     of overall student aid such amount represents.\n       (B) The percentage of students of such medical schools who \n     pass the examinations administered by the Educational \n     Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates the first time.\n       (C) The percentage of students of such medical schools who \n     pass the examinations administered by the Educational \n     Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates after taking such \n     examinations multiple times, disaggregated by how many times \n     the students had to take the examinations to pass.\n       (D) The percentage of recent graduates of such medical \n     schools practicing medicine in the United States, and a \n     description of where the students are practicing and what \n     types of medicine the students are practicing.\n       (E) The rate of graduates of such medical schools who lose \n     malpractice lawsuits or have the graduates' medical licenses \n     revoked, as compared to graduates of graduate medical schools \n     located in the United States.\n       (F) Recommendations regarding the percentage passing rate \n     of the examinations administered by the Educational \n     Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates that the United \n     States should require of graduate medical schools located \n     outside of the United States for Federal financial aid \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So to briefly summarize what the amendment does, it \nattempts to deal with this issue in a balanced but effective way. It \nseeks to protect taxpayers' dollars from subsidizing foreign medical \nschools that are failing to show positive results, and we have a way to \ndetermine which ones are showing results. Currently, in order to \nqualify for student financial aid, we have a rule in effect. That rule \nis that the foreign medical school must show 60 percent of its \ngraduates pass the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical \nGraduates' Examination. This is a test you have to take after you \ngraduate to become licensed to practice medicine in the United States. \nSo, currently, that rule is 60 percent. This amendment would raise the \nbar from 60 to 75 percent, to be implemented in 2 years' time. It would \ngive them 2 years to prepare for this.\n  I believe it is a reasonable change because approximately 90 percent \nof U.S. medical school graduates pass medical licensing examinations on \ntheir first attempt. That is a big difference. It is indisputable that \nthe test failure rate is indicative of the quality of the instruction \nthat one receives at a school.\n  During the next 2 years, prior to implementation of the new 75-\npercent standard, the amendment also requires the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a study on the amount of Federal aid \ngoing to offshore medical schools, the percentage of foreign medical \ngraduates who pass the examination on the first try or after multiple \nattempts, the percentage of recent foreign medical school graduates \npracticing medicine in the United States, and a description of where \nand what type of medicine they are practicing and asking for \nrecommendations for the examination passage rate the United States \nshould require of foreign medical schools who wish to qualify so that \nthey can receive U.S. Federal student aid.\n  I am also modifying the amendment by adding a portion of the study to \nexamine the rate of malpractice lawsuits and of lost or revoked medical \nlicenses from graduates of foreign medical schools as compared to \ngraduates of U.S. medical schools.\n  Now, the study we have, the GAO report, would involve this. It would \nexamine what is happening with students of foreign medical schools \nafter they leave in order to determine how effective the schools are. \nWhile many of these schools likely do a pretty good job, and some I \nthink do, there is no way to know for sure, as they are not licensed or \naccredited by any American entity.\n  Many foreign medical schools do not use cadavers--do not use \ncadavers--but instead have students perform procedures that would be \ndone, preferably on\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\ncadavers, by simulation on a computer. I don't know about you, but I \ndon't want a doctor operating on me who has been practicing using a \nmouse and a keyboard.\n  In fact, an article in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review earlier this \nyear quoted Dr. Cameron Wilkinson, medical director of Joseph N. France \nHospital in St. Kitts and supervisor of clinical rotations for two \nmedical schools on the island as saying this--this is at St. Kitts in \nthe hospital there, the training school, and he said this: ``No medical \nschool here would have a cadaver.''\n  He said: ``It would be great,'' but he explained the schools in the \nislands aren't equipped to work with them. This was in reference to a \nschool on the island that was actually found to have cadavers for \nclinical instruction, but they kept them in black bags in an unsterile, \nunlocked, air-conditioned room. They were not following protocol for \nthe use of cadavers and lacked the necessary documents to have them \nshipped from the United States. They also did not smell like \nformaldehyde, which is one reason I didn't go to medical school, having \ngone into a place where something was kept in formaldehyde. But that is \na great concern, as formaldehyde preservation is standard procedure for \ninstitutions that utilize cadavers in medical research. Thus, this \nschool was handling cadavers inappropriately.\n  But this story also makes clear that schools on the island, for the \nmost part, never use cadavers. Many of these schools do not even \nrequire that students take the MCAT; that is, the Medical College \nAdmission Test. Standards at some of these schools are much lower than \nstandards at American medical schools in regard to MCAT scores and \nGPAs--grade point averages--if they have those requirements at all.\n  The Association of American Medical Colleges states that about--get \nthis--this is the Association of American Medical Colleges. They have \nfound that about one in four physicians practicing in the United States \ntoday, and about one in four physicians in training in the United \nStates today, are foreign medical graduates. This is a remarkable \nstatistic, when we have this magnificent medical school system in our \ncountry. We have gotten out of sync.\n  These foreign medical school graduates are, in many ways, needed to \nfill the gaps that currently exist in the American medical school \neducation system. In June of 2006, as I said, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges recognized this shortfall and formally \nrecommended a 30-percent increase in medical school graduates by 2015. \nThat expansion would allow for 5,000 new medical students each year \nbeginning in 2015.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 15 minutes provided \nfor him under the order for the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would note that the U.S. population is \nincreasing by 25 million each decade. The number of people over 65 will \ndouble by 2030. We expect more and more out of health care. We must \nhave additional medical physicians, and we need to increase our own \nsystem and reduce the amount of money, taxpayer money, going to medical \nschools that are below par.\n  This bill would make changes and move us in that direction. I ask our \nleaders to consider that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to urge that the Senate accept \nthe Senator's amendment. It has been a number of years since our HELP \nCommittee got into looking at the foreign medical schools, as the \nSenator pointed out. I think there are a number that are exceptional \nand incredibly good. Others are moderately good, and there are others \nthat don't pass muster. It is, I think, useful to get that kind of \ninformation. We have a health care crisis. Personnel is a key aspect of \nthe health care crisis. We have a concern about what the specialties \nare in different areas in this country. The amendment the Senator is \noffering is going to help us understand what is happening with these \nforeign medical schools. The amount of financial aid they receive--we \nought to be updated on that. We ought to know the percentage of \nstudents that are going to pass that exam. We ought to know what \nspecialties they are moving into and where they are practicing, the \ntypes of medicine they are practicing; that is exceedingly important \nand useful.\n  The Senator has other references in here, too, in terms of the number \nof times to take the exam and medical licenses that are revoked. I \nthink it would provide important information, certainly, for our \ncommittee. We ought to have an update of information on what is \nhappening. Also, I think it is important for the American taxpayer to \nunderstand what is happening as well, in terms of this kind of \ninvestment, so I thank the Senator. This is an important area. We have, \nas the Senator knows, programs to provide medical personnel--this is \nrelated but not directly on subject--in underserved areas in the United \nStates, which has worked quite well. That is not the target of this \nparticular program. But it is important that we have this kind of \ninformation. It will be useful for our HELP Committee to have it. So I \nhope the Senate will accept it. I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue. I think it is useful and important. We hope we can persuade our \nHouse Members to accept it at the appropriate time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2374) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to accept the \nAkaka amendment, if there is no further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2372.\n  The amendment (No. 2372) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to move on with the \nBurr amendment as well. That is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2373.\n  The amendment (No. 2373) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have remaining time on the amendments \nwe have dealt with previously. I believe we have 15 minutes. I am glad \nto yield it to the Senator from Oregon. He wants to talk on another \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                                  chip\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Wyoming for their thoughtfulness.\n  This is especially appropriate, since Chairman Kennedy and the \ndistinguished ranking minority member are on the floor. Both of them \nhave great interest and involvement in health care. I thought it would \nbe appropriate to talk for a few minutes about the upcoming CHIP \nlegislation, the legislation that deals with the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which is so important to America's youngsters.\n  There was a markup in the Senate Finance Committee last week and it \npassed out overwhelmingly, to a great extent because of the very \nimportant and laborious work done by Chairman Baucus, Senator \nRockefeller, and also the senior Republicans on the committee, Senators \nGrassley and Hatch. I commend them greatly for their toil.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes today to talk about the issue \nbecause the administration has indicated that at this point they would \nveto the legislation, which came from the Senate Finance Committee by a \n17-to-4 vote. I\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\nam very hopeful they will choose not to veto this legislation because I \nfelt it was striking in the Finance Committee last week that Senator \nafter Senator on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Conrad and \nSenator Lott, for example--leaders of their respective parties on \neconomic issues--they concurred that the system in this country is \nbroken. The health care system cannot control the costs. Millions fall \nbetween the cracks. Administrative expenses are soaring. We have \nlargely sick care rather than health care. This is something Democrats \nand Republicans alike agree on.\n  The administration has the view that one of the key changes that \nneeds to be made is the Federal tax rules as they relate to health \ncare. I share their view that these rules are a mess. But it is not \ngoing to be possible to get to the question of broader reform until you \nfirst get bipartisan cooperation on the urgent and immediate needs of \nthis country's youngsters.\n  Frankly, I came out of the markup last week very encouraged about the \nSenate's interest and desire, on a bipartisan basis, to move ahead to \nfix health care. I think the clear feeling in the Senate Finance \nCommittee is that this country cannot afford to wait to fix health \ncare. I know there are a lot of people, particularly in the media, \nthink tanks, and others who think: Let's wait a couple of years for \nanother Presidential election. Let's wait 2, 3 more years.\n  That is sort of the way it goes for the political class. But for \npeople who are hurting in this country and businesses that are \nstruggling to meet the health needs of their workers and are dying to \noffer them coverage and cannot afford it, I don't think it is \nacceptable to say let's wait around a couple more years. It strikes me \nas pretty callous to say let's wait for another election, when we have \nall those needs of workers and businesses in parts of the country where \nthere have been tremendous layoffs. They say: Well, they can wait a \ncouple more years before anybody talks about fixing health care.\n  That is not what I heard in the Senate Finance Committee last week. I \nheard Senator after Senator--not just Senators Conrad and Lott but \nSenators Crapo, Salazar, and other colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--making it clear they share my view that the health care system \nis broken. Now, for the first time in more than 13 years, the Senate \nhas an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to fix health care.\n\n  Senator Bennett, a member of the Republican leadership, has joined me \nin legislation--the Healthy Americans Act--that has been able to pick \nup support of labor and business. We have structured it so all our \ncitizens can get health care coverage, such as their Member of Congress \ndoes, through the private sector, at no greater cost than we are \nspending as a nation today. The bill has been put together so workers \nand employers win with the very first paychecks that are offered. I \ndon't see why America should wait any longer to fix health care. What \nwe should be doing is building on the important work of Chairman Baucus \nand Senator Grassley, Senators Hatch and Rockefeller and move to get \nCHIP passed in a bipartisan way and meet the immediate needs of this \ncountry's youngsters and then move on to do what I have heard members \non both sides of the aisle on the Finance Committee call for last week \nand that is to fix American health care.\n  The reality is--and you and I have had a chance to talk a bit about \nit, Mr. President--the system we have today was largely designed more \nthan 70 years ago. It was set up after World War II. There were wage \nand price controls. Our troops were coming home. We wanted them to get \ngood benefits. So we put it off essentially on the employer, and the \nTax Code would change to make that possible. Well, a system designed \nfor the 1940s surely doesn't make sense for 2007, when the typical \nworker changes jobs seven times by the time they are age 35.\n  The current Tax Code is regressive and it promotes inefficiency. If \nyou are a high-flying CEO, you can get a designer smile put on your \nface and write off the cost of that operation on your taxes. But if you \nare a hard-working woman in a furniture store and your company has no \nhealth plan, you get practically nothing.\n  Now, my sense is, when the administration talks about changing the \ntax rules for health care and you look at what Senators were saying in \nthe Senate Finance Committee about the system being broken, there is a \npretty good opportunity to work in a cooperative way--not 2 or 3 years \nfrom now but to move forward in this session of Congress. To make that \npossible, it is going to be essential for the Bush administration to \nback off from this threat of vetoing the children's health program and \nto work with Members on both sides of the aisle so that this \nlegislation can get passed, and it would be possible, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to move on to fix our health care system.\n  We have a lot to work with. Certainly, we have seen great interest at \nthe State level. A number of States are already moving forward with \ninnovative programs. Mr. President, as you and I have discussed, no \nState can fix problems they didn't cause. No State can deal with the \nregressivity and inefficiency of the Federal tax rules on health care. \nNo State can deal with Medicare. No State can deal with what is called \nthe ERISA Program, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act, \nwith respect to large employers and multiemployer programs. No State \ncan deal with that. We are going to have to have bipartisan action at \nthe Federal level.\n  I have been very pleased that Senator Bennett has joined me in this \nbipartisan effort. My sense is there is something of an ideological \ntruce coming on health care. We see a lot of bipartisan cooperation. \nToday, in fact, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \nand Chairman Kennedy are cooperating on issue after issue.\n  Senator Bennett and I have said on health care that Republicans have \nmoved a long way on coverage. We recognized that to fix health care, \nthe people who are uninsured cannot just keep passing the bills on to \npeople who are insured. We have to cover everybody, and Republicans \nhave acknowledged that fact.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, have been making it clear that they do \nnot think we can just turn it all over to Government. We cannot turn \neverything in health care over to Government and expect everything to \ncome out well. We have to have some private choices, choices in a fixed \nmarket, where insurance companies cannot cherry-pick and just take \nhealthy people and send sick people over to Government programs more \nfragile than they are.\n  We have to fix the private marketplace, but there ought to be choices \nin the private sector. That, too, is an opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate to work with the Bush administration once we \nget beyond the question of the children's health program.\n  I am convinced that we are right on the cusp of being able to move \nforward on health care in a bipartisan way. In the other body, the \nHealthy Americans Act that Senator Bennett and I have been working for \nin the Senate will be introduced this week on a bipartisan basis. So \nthat would then mean the Healthy Americans Act would be the first \nbipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation to fix American health care \nin more than 13 years.\n  Colleagues are going home every time there is a recess and talking \nwith folks at home about health care. People are saying we know the \nsystem is broken and it is not enough to try to just take one small \npart. We really need to step back and make changes, for example, in the \nemployer-based system which is hurting the competitiveness of so many \nof our companies. We need to have some health care rather than sick \ncare because the system is biased against prevention. We clearly need \nto help those who are falling between the cracks.\n  Above all, we have to contain the costs. The costs are rising, \naccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers, at far in excess of inflation, \nestimated to be about 12 percent this year. There is no way that is \nsustainable. It is not sustainable when we look at today's population \ntrends and costs and the disadvantages our employers face.\n  I was very pleased last week that not only was the Senate Finance \nCommittee able to pass the CHIP legislation on a 17-to-4 basis through \nthe hard work of our bipartisan leadership, but I was impressed because \nso many Senators on both sides of the aisle said\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\nthey want to go further and to fix a broken health care system. To do \nthat, we are going to have to work in a bipartisan way. We are \ninterested in working with the Bush administration on that issue.\n  I and others have said we can have differences of opinion with \nrespect to how we straighten out this mess of a Tax Code as it relates \nto health care, but by and large, the administration is onto the key \nissue. To do this, we are going to have to recognize, first, that \nAmerica cannot afford to wait any longer to fix health care. It is not \nenough to say let's just deal with it after the next election. That is \nnot enough for people who are hurting in Virginia and Oregon and \nWyoming. They want to see action in this session. That is what they \ngive us an election certificate to do, to act on big issues and not \njust put them off for another 2 or 3 years.\n  So let us work together, Democrats and Republicans, in this body with \nthe administration to pass the children's health program and then to \ncontinue that spirit of bipartisanship and fix American health care in \nthis Congress.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have made very good progress during \nthe morning and early afternoon on the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act. We have a pretty good idea now of the remaining \namendments. We are getting in touch with our colleagues who intend to \noffer those amendments. I expect we will have votes, as the leader \nindicated, in the early evening, and this probably will necessitate \nthat we will have a few votes in the morning tomorrow. But we will wind \nup this higher education reauthorization bill, which is really the good \nnews.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise when I have 1 \nminute left.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to review again exactly where we are \non the two pieces of legislation, one of which we passed on Thursday \nnight, which is the historic increase in the need-based grant aid, the \nlargest increase in grant aid since the GI bill after World War II. We \nhave also assisted in the management of these loans, the indebtedness, \nby offering loan forgiveness and by putting a limit on loan payments at \n15 percent of the discretionary income. Discretionary income also takes \ninto consideration if there are children and, obviously, that reduces \nthe discretionary income.\n  We have the loan forgiveness for borrowers who work in the public \nservice jobs. If you become a teacher and work with special needs \nchildren, or work with the disabled or the elderly, and you do that \nover a 10-year period, you will not pay more than 15 percent and \nqualify for the loan forgiveness.\n  The bill also protects working students, so that if they work hard \nand gain some money to be able to buy some books, that they are not \ngoing to break through these caps, need-based caps, and they are going \nto be able to buy the books and use those earnings. This is a realistic \nand important aspect of the legislation.\n  So this is assistance to the neediest students, assistance for those \nstudents from working families with middle income, and assistance for \nidealistic students who want to work in public service. All of that is \ngoing to be possible under this legislation.\n  Under the reauthorization, the other part which we are now on the \nfloor of the Senate debating, we are also making sure that the student \nloan system is going to meet the ethical requirements and is going to \nensure that the best interest of the students and the loan system is \ngoing to be protected.\n  We have had too many stories of inappropriate kinds of actions in the \ndevelopment of the loan system, which makes it more difficult for the \nstudents and, obviously, compromises the colleges and universities. So \nwe have addressed that issue in this part of the program.\n  We are publicizing the cost information so that parents will \nunderstand and get real information as to what the cost is for the \nschools. We are going to also publicize what the States are providing. \nIf they cut back, as they have in my own State, which has meant the \nfees have gone up, parents will know who is responsible. We hope this \nwill make a difference in terms of the total cost of education.\n  The application itself, what they call the FAFSA, we have simplified \nthat so it will no longer be a discouraging document. It will be one \nthat will be easier to read and be easier to utilize, particularly for \nthose students who don't have the kind of support systems that help \nthem fill out those forms.\n  Finally, we have helped in the areas of the GEAR UP and TRIO programs \nto help improve preparation for higher education. For one reason or \nanother, some students need a helping hand to continue their education \nand succeed in school. That has been true for the TRIO and GEAR UP \nprograms and other programs that work with children who come from \neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds but are talented and hard \nworking students. This helps provide an outreach for those students.\n  Lastly, we have the programs to support higher quality teacher \npreparation. We understand at the end of the day the teacher in the \nclassroom is the one who makes all the difference. Each and every one \nof us in this Chamber can all remember our favorite teachers, the one \nwho inspired us, helped us, coached us, and really encouraged us to \nmove ahead and grasp the opportunities of furthering our education.\n  Mr. President, this is a very meaningful piece of legislation. It \nrepresents the best judgment of Republicans and Democrats alike. We are \nenormously indebted to our Republican and Democratic colleagues and all \nof the staffs who have worked very long and hard on this legislation.\n  We are going to have more to say on these particular amendments, but \nI think it is useful to just give a summary of what this legislation is \nall about. We have added to this legislation over the course of the day \nin some very useful and meaningful ways. So we are going to look \nforward to getting a good vote on the final passage.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2375\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Burr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Burr, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2375.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 with respect to \n                          teacher development)\n\n       After section 205 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as \n     amended by section 201 of the Higher Education Amendments of \n     2007), insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 205A. TEACHER DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Annual Goals.--As a condition of receiving assistance \n     under title IV, each institution of higher education that \n     conducts a traditional teacher preparation program or \n     alternative routes to State certification or licensure \n     program and that enrolls students receiving Federal \n     assistance under this Act shall set annual quantifiable goals \n     for--\n       ``(1) increasing the number of prospective teachers trained \n     in teacher shortage areas designated by the Secretary, \n     including mathematics, science, special education, and \n     instruction of limited English proficient students; and\n       ``(2) more closely linking the training provided by the \n     institution with the needs of schools and the instructional \n     decisions new teachers face in the classroom.\n       ``(b) Assurance.--As a condition of receiving assistance \n     under title IV, each institution described in subsection (a) \n     shall provide an assurance to the Secretary that--\n       ``(1) training provided to prospective teachers responds to \n     the identified needs of the local educational agencies or \n     States where the institution's graduates are likely to\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\n     teach, based on past hiring and recruitment trends;\n       ``(2) prospective special education teachers receive \n     coursework in core academic subjects and receive training in \n     providing instruction in core academic subjects;\n       ``(3) regular education teachers receive training in \n     providing instruction to diverse populations, including \n     children with disabilities, limited English proficient \n     students, and children from low-income families; and\n       ``(4) prospective teachers receive training on how to \n     effectively teach in urban and rural schools.\n       ``(c) Public Reporting.--As part of the annual report card \n     required under section 205(a)(1), an institution of higher \n     education described in subsection (a) shall publicly report \n     whether the goals established under such subsection have been \n     met.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is a teacher amendment. Teachers are \nthe most important factor to a child's academic achievement. Student \nachievement will not improve unless we can ensure that all children \nhave access to qualified teachers. Many of our schools, however, are \nlacking in a steady and ample supply of qualified teachers.\n  The current state of affairs for high schools and middle schools is \nespecially troubling. Nationally, 24 percent of all high school classes \nare taught by teachers lacking in either a college major or minor in \ntheir field of teaching. However, for students in high-poverty schools, \nthis number jumps to 34 percent in comparison to 19 percent in low-\npoverty schools.\n  Nearly 50 percent of math classes in high-poverty high schools are \ntaught by teachers with neither a major nor minor in math or a math-\nrelated field, such as engineering, physics, or math education.\n  Schools and districts for too long have been forced to depend on \nteacher pipelines that are not producing sufficient numbers of \nqualified individuals to teach in high-need areas such as math, \nscience, foreign language, special education, and English language \nproficiency, and in hard-to-staff schools both in urban and rural \nareas.\n  The Bipartisan Commission on No Child Left Behind, led by Tommy \nThompson and Roy Barnes, though concentrating primarily on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, recognized the critical \nconnection between higher education--colleges of education--and K-12 \neducation, for improving the supply of qualified teachers.\n  As one of its recommendations, the No Child Left Behind Commission \nrecommended amending title II of the Higher Education Act to require \ninstitutions of higher education that prepare prospective teachers to \nset annual goals for increasing the number of prospective teachers in \nshortage areas, such as math, science, special education, and \ninstruction of limited English-proficient students, and for more \nclosely linking the instruction colleges of education provide \nprospective teachers with the needs new teachers will face in the \nclassroom.\n  Additionally, the Commission recommended having institutions of \nhigher education provide an assurance to the Secretary that, No. 1, \nteacher training responds to the needs of the school districts and \nStates in which new teachers graduate; No. 2, regular education \nteachers are provided with training in teaching diverse populations, \nincluding special education students, limited English-proficient \nstudents, and low-income students; No. 3, prospective teachers receive \ntraining to teach in urban and rural schools; and, No. 4, special \neducation teachers receive training on instruction in content areas.\n  Senator Burr's amendment puts into statute these important Higher \nEducation Act recommendations made by the bipartisan, nonpartisan No \nChild Left Behind Commission. Senator Burr, on whose behalf I offer \nthis amendment, and I share the belief we must forge stronger \nconnections between higher education and our K-12 schools and that \nhigher education has a responsibility to ensure that the pipeline of \nprospective teachers grows and responds to the needs of American \nstudents and schools.\n  All our children, regardless of background or neighborhood, must have \naccess to high-quality teachers. So I am going to urge everyone to \nsupport this important amendment, which is offered by Senator Burr. \nThis amendment requires teacher training programs to report to the \nSecretary of Education on how they are responsive to the needs of their \ngraduates once they reach the classroom.\n  I am particularly pleased this amendment recognizes the special \nskills new teachers need when teaching in rural areas. Today's teachers \nneed training to meet the needs for diverse student populations--\nranging from students with disabilities to English language learners to \ngifted and talented students.\n  Finally, this amendment does not impose additional mandates on \ninstitutions with teacher training programs. It simply requires them to \nreport on how they are meeting the needs of prospective teachers in \nlocal school districts, and I am sure they are working on that on a \ndaily basis to figure out how they can meet the needs in the best way \npossible. Sharing that with us will help us in our work. So I ask that \nwe adopt the Burr amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from North \nCarolina for offering this amendment. I had the opportunity to travel \nto North Carolina and to visit with their education department about \ntheir innovative and creative ways of trying to bring in highly \nqualified teachers in a lot of underserved areas. They have done a very \ngood job.\n  This amendment doesn't surprise me. It is extremely worthwhile and \nreminds us of what the current situation is. If you have math students \nin high-poverty schools, they are more likely to be taught by out-of-\nfield teachers. That means that over 33 percent of the math classes in \nhigh-poverty schools are being taught by a teacher without a degree in \ntheir field compared to less than 18 percent in low-poverty schools.\n  So as we have discussed during this entire debate, both last week and \nthis week, this is a good example of our efforts to reduce the \ninequities in education, particularly when we are talking about the \nneeds of developing skills in math, in science, engineering, and \ntechnology. This is a pretty good indication, the fact that if children \nare going to high-poverty schools, this is the chance they have to \nlearn from a well-qualified teacher. It isn't always the case, but \nthese statistics demonstrate the point the amendment is trying to make.\n\n  This is in science. If you take science students in high-poverty \nschools, they are more likely to be taught by out-of-field teachers. It \nis 56 percent in the high-poverty area, and only 22 percent in the low-\npoverty areas. This is repeated in other subjects as well.\n  Among other things, what the amendment is trying to do is hold \ninstitutions of higher education accountable for the quality and \nprogress of teacher preparation and alternative certification programs. \nWe have serious need for math and science teachers, especially in low-\nincome and high-need schools. We ought to be encouraging our teaching \ninstitutions to help produce those teachers. That is really a very \nsubstantial part of what this amendment does. It helps high-need \nschools recruit and retain high-quality teachers so we give \nencouragement to schools to produce these teachers, and then help the \nhigh-needs schools to recruit and retain the highly qualified teachers \nand also help promote innovative models such as induction and teaching \nresidency programs.\n  We have seen that some of these programs have been enormously \nsuccessful in retaining teachers in high-poverty areas. These programs \nalso encourage more accountability in teacher preparation. That is very \nconsistent with what we are trying to do in this legislation.\n  Senator Burr has spoken of this issue. The Senator from Wyoming, you \nwill remember, spoke about this during our discussions in the \ncommittee. We indicated a desire to work with him. This legislation is \nright on target with what we are attempting to do, recognizing what I \nsaid previously, and that is the key to education is the well-trained \nteacher. This is going to be helpful to make sure we are going to have \na well-trained teacher in those areas of shortage. Clearly, math, \nscience and engineering are very important, critical areas. As are \nteaching students with disabilities and English language learners. The \namendment will help make this stronger legislation as a result of its \nacceptance.\n  I am more than glad to urge our colleagues to accept it. I will \nfollow the lead of the Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his comments. It \nis something he and I have talked about extensively. We do know \nteachers are the key to education.\n  I am not aware of any disagreement on either side. I am ready to wrap \nup the debate on it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. We ask the time left on the amendment be yielded to the \nbill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2375) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio, I understand, is \non his way. We expect him shortly. He has an important amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2376\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2376.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for a Federal supplemental loan program)\n\n       At the end of title IV of the bill, add the following:\n\n               PART H--FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 499. FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n       Title IV (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 499B. FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Program Authorized.--The Secretary shall carry out a \n     Federal Supplemental Loan Program in accordance with this \n     section.\n       ``(b) Eligible Individuals.--An individual shall be \n     eligible to receive a loan under this section if such \n     individual attends an institution of higher education on a \n     full-time basis as an undergraduate or graduate student.\n       ``(c) Fixed Interest Rate Loans and Variable Interest Rate \n     Loans.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Beginning with academic year 2008-2009, \n     the Secretary shall make fixed interest rate loans and \n     variable interest rate loans to eligible individuals under \n     this section to enable such individuals to pursue their \n     courses of study at institutions of higher education on a \n     full-time basis.\n       ``(2) Fixed interest rate loans.--With respect to a fixed \n     interest rate loan made under this section, the applicable \n     rate of interest on the principal balance of the loan shall \n     be set by the Secretary at the lowest rate for the borrower \n     that will result in no net cost to the Federal Government \n     over the life of the loan.\n       ``(3) Variable interest rate loans.--With respect to a \n     variable interest rate loan made under this section, the \n     applicable rate of interest shall, during any 12-month period \n     beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30, be determined on \n     the preceding June 1 and be equal to--\n       ``(A) the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills \n     auctioned at the final auction held prior to such June 1; \n     plus\n       ``(B) a margin determined on an annual basis by the \n     Secretary to result in the lowest rate for the borrower that \n     will result in no net cost to the Federal Government over the \n     life of the loan.\n       ``(d) Maximum Loan Amount.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make a loan under \n     this section in any amount up to the maximum amount described \n     in paragraph (2).\n       ``(2) Maximum amount.--For an eligible individual, the \n     maximum amount shall be calculated by subtracting from the \n     estimated cost of attendance for such individual to attend \n     the institution of higher education, any amount of financial \n     aid awarded to the eligible individual and any loan amount \n     for which the individual is eligible, but does not receive \n     such amount, pursuant to the subsidized loan program \n     established under section 428 and the unsubsidized loan \n     program established under section 428H.

Mr. President, a couple of months ago a distraught mother \nfrom Cincinnati wrote me about the private loan her daughter had taken \nto go to college. Her daughter had borrowed $21,000, was facing a bill \nfor over $100,000 as a result. She sent me the disclosure sheet on the \nloan represented in this chart because she could not believe what she \nsaw.\n  She took out a loan for $21,000 for 2 years of school. That loan \ngrew, at an 18 percent interest rate, to almost $35,000 because there \nwas a deferral on payback of the loan during her 2 years in school.\n  So she ended up owing $67,000 for the life of the loan. That is why \nshe ended up paying $102,000 because of this incredibly high interest \nrate for student loan, 18\\1/4\\ percent.\n  I have shown this statement to a loan officer at a bank and also to \nmy attorney. They both expressed to me they had never seen anything \nsuch as this and there must be a mistake. Unfortunately, the only \nmistake is Congress has failed to act to restrain the costs of these \nloans, which as we have seen, can carry interest rates sometimes in \nexcess of 18 percent.\n  It is not an isolated problem. Private loans have been growing at an \nannual pace of some 27 percent, meaning that because tuition continues \nto grow at a rapid rate, and the Federal Government has not met, \nthrough the Direct Student Loan Program or the Guaranteed Student Loan \nProgram, has not met that increase, the amount that students need has \ngrown at such a rapid rate that private lenders have come in charging \ninterest rates similar to this, 18 percent, 16 percent, 17 percent, \nwhatever.\n  The cost of college has climbed so much that we have seen this kind \nof growth. In Ohio, the median house income increased 3 percent between \n2000 and 2006. Tuition went up 53 percent at 4-year public schools, 28 \npercent at 4-year private schools. Tuition went up 28 percent for some, \n53 percent for others. Yet the average wage in our State went up only 3 \npercent.\n  The Federal loan limits have barely budged over the past several \ndecades. In 1972, a freshman could borrow $2,500 in Federal loans. Last \nyear, that number barely moved to $2,600, even though, in real terms, \nthe limit on borrowing would amount to $12,000, if it kept pace with \ninflation. To be fair, the law changed this month. A freshman can \nborrow $3,500 for school. But even though the limits in the first 2 \nyears have been increased somewhat, the overall cap on borrowing \nremains the same, $23,000 for a dependent undergraduate. This bill does \nnothing to change the cap because the HELP Committee decided, correctly \nin my view, the bulk of savings we could achieve should be plowed back \ninto Pell grants. I applaud Chairman Kennedy for doing that.\n  With the price tag for 4 years of college at $120,000 for private \nschools, $50,000 for public schools, there is obviously a big gap for \nmany students.\n\n[[Page S9746]]\n\nThat gap gets filled in many ways: savings, work, grants, PLUS Loans, \ncredit cards, you name it. But for more students, private loans are \nplaying a bigger role.\n  According to testimony before the Banking Committee last month, \nSallie Mae made $7 billion in private loans and $15 billion in Federal \nloans. In other words, one out of three college student loan dollars \noriginated by the biggest student lender in the country is a private \nloan subject to much higher rates.\n  As this chart indicates, the private loan program may well outstrip \nthe Federal program over the next decade. What we have done on this \nchart is use the growth rates of the two programs over the past several \nyears to predict how large they will grow if current trends continue. \nThe darker reddish-purple there is the unregulated private bank loans \nthat students are getting, growing more than 20 percent a year. You can \nsee how within 7 or 8 years, they will overtake student loans.\n  More and more students are forced to go through private banks for \nprivate loans at higher and higher interest rates every year. Think \nabout these numbers: A 28-percent increase in tuition over the last 6 \nyears for private 4-year institutions, 53 percent for public 4-year \ninstitutions. Yet the average wage has only gone up 3 percent.\n  Congress very often legislates through the rear-view mirror. We wait \nuntil a problem becomes close to unmanageable before we feel compelled \nto act. Today we can take a different approach. We can act to address a \nproblem before it becomes widespread. This amendment I am offering will \ncreate an alternative for the fastest growing segment of the student \nloan industry, private loans.\n  My amendment creates a supplemental loan program that would be run by \nthe Federal Government. It would provide one more option for students \nto finance their education. Over the years, my Republican colleagues \nhave defended the private guaranteed student loan program by arguing \nthere should be competition between the guaranteed and the Direct Loan \nProgram and that the competition made both better. Right now there is \nno competition for these private loans with the results that students \nhave been charged in excess of 18 percent.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining in favor of the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There is 15 minutes divided between Senator Enzi and \nmyself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to, if the Senator would yield on my \ntime.\n  Is it not true that there is sort of three major components of paying \nfor the cost for higher education? We have one aspect of it, which is \nthe student loan program, which is the Federal student loan program. \nIncluded in that program is the authorization program, that we are \ngoing to deal with this issue.\n  Then we have the private loan programs which the Senator from Ohio is \naddressing. So as we are on the floor of the Senate, and middle-income \nfamilies are watching us, we say we want to do something about the cost \nof tuition, certainly we make a downpayment on that in the \nreconciliation bill, where we have taken some $17 billion out of the \nlenders in order to provide more Federal grant aid to needy students. \nWe have helped the neediest students.\n  But the Senator from Ohio has put his finger on what is happening at \nthe other end; that is, the dramatic increase in the students borrowing \nat these exorbitant rates of 18 percent.\n  Does the Senator share my belief that we will never get a handle on \nthe cost of tuition for colleges and universities until we get a handle \non that program as well?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think that is exactly right, what Senator Kennedy said. \nBecause of the efforts of Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, in a \nbipartisan effort in this body last week, to move money that has been \nsubsidizing those private companies into Pell grants and into better \nrates and better payback periods and all of that for students, we have \ngone a big part of the way.\n  But on this chart, as Senator Kennedy suggests, the dollars students \nwill need continue to skyrocket, and the only place they can go is \nthese private banks.\n  Mr. ENZI. Parliamentary inquiry: It is my understanding of the time \nthat it was equally divided by the pro and the con on the amendment \nrather than----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. Rather than half to the presenter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me ask the Senator from Ohio, if you look at the \nleft part of that chart, that is 1996; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. This is actually 2005.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So what you are pointing out is what has happened in the \nlast 6 years; am I not correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, we also had a chart earlier that showed that \nincrease of 20-plus percent, up until now, in real dollars. If the \npercentage increase continues, and there is no reason it would not, it \nwill grow similar to this. But we have had several years of this \nalready.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the point I am making is this is a relatively new \nphenomenon that has taken place, correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As we try to get a handle on trying to provide need-\nbased assistance, we've seen a cutback in the proportion of grants \ncompared to loans in Federal aid. We've seen the huge increase in \nFederal student loan debt--more and more students must borrow to afford \na college education. At the same time we are seeing the explosion of \nprivate student loans, which often carry interest rates as high as 18 \npercent, which the Senator has talked about.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me, if we are really serious about \ndealing with the cost of tuition for students, we ought to deal with \nall of those components? As I understand, the Senator from Ohio is \ndoing that with his amendment, to make sure we are going to, as a \nresult of his amendment, help the neediest students in terms of Pell \ngrants, and we are going to get help managing student loan debt by \noffering loan forgiveness to those in public service and by capping \nmonthly loan repayments. We are using some $17 billion that we take \nfrom the lenders, and we are going to make sure that students will get \nthe best possible loan--even if it's a private loan.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct. We are not regulating the banks. We are \nsimply setting up a program so that the Government will break even. It \nwill not cost taxpayer dollars. We are setting up a program to compete \ndirectly with private lenders, which we are certain, as my Republican \nfriends have said, with the direct student loan program, that \ncompetition will make both operate better.\n  I will briefly summarize the amendment and then reserve our time.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary of Education to offer two types \nof loans, a fixed rate and a variable. Each type of loan would be \noffered for borrowers with or without cosigners. The Secretary would \nthen have the discretion of designing the program to mirror other \nfeatures offered by private loans such as delayed payment until after \ngraduation or deferment for certain hardships. This amendment will \nclearly stop situations like this one from happening to a student, \nwhere a student goes in with a $21,000 loan and has to pay $500 monthly \nfor 179 times and ends up paying $102,000 for a $21,000 student loan. \nWe will see a competitive situation which will save those students \ndramatic amounts of money, working with what Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi did last week on debt forgiveness, on the Pell grants--all \nthat will absolutely matter for students.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is providing competition; am I correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So this isn't just mandating. This is creating \ncompetition, if they want competition in this area; am I correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. This creates a competitive situation similar to what we \nhave had since 1939 but for students who have to borrow money beyond \nthe $23,000 limit. It doesn't regulate the banks. It doesn't tell the \nbanks what to do. It simply sets up a competitive situation from which \nall of us will gain.\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. There are \nsome statements that I would like to clear up a little bit. I would not \nwant anybody to think that this is increasing competition. This is \nincreasing Government price fixing. It is requiring the Secretary of \nEducation to do the price fixing. She is the one who sets the interest \nrate, or he, as the case might be at the time it was put into effect. \nThat is not the person with the expertise to know what kind of interest \nrate ought to be charged on anything.\n  I also have objection because this amendment has neither been through \nthe Education Committee nor the Banking Committee. This is something \nthe Banking Committee would strongly believe should be in their \njurisdiction. I am glad we are having the discussion because it is very \nimportant for people to hear that you can borrow money at 18 percent, \n$21,000, defer all payments for 2 years, and pay off the loan in equal \ninstallments after that and wind up paying $100,000. If you are buying \na car at $21,000 and you have to pay 18 percent interest and you don't \nhave to pay anything for the first 2 years, that car is going to cost \n$100,000.\n  That comes under the subject of financial literacy. It is important \nfor us to impress on young people today what the cost of interest \nmeans, what the cost of deferring interest means. There are people \nbuying houses under that kind of a proposal right now. They are very \nsurprised at how much they owe on their house. We are trying to do as \nmuch as we can in the bill on financial literacy. Part of that \nfinancial literacy would be to encourage the parents to have a home \nequity loan to provide for the student, and that way it is deductible \non their income tax. There are a number of different ways of doing \nthis, but I don't think having the Secretary of Education determine an \ninterest rate would intentionally bring down the cost of interest. \nHopefully, we can get banks to be responsible on the interest rates \nthey charge. But when there is no Federal backing, no Federal guarantee \non the loan, they are actually providing the loan at very high risk to \na student with no collateral, which is why the interest rates come in \nat 18 percent. There are other ways to correct the problem other than \nputting this in the hands of the Secretary.\n  We had some experience with this before. There was a tuition credit \nthat was initiated in 1978 to solve a huge problem at that time. It was \nsupposed to apply to both elementary and secondary education and higher \neducation, but it was focused on tuition tax credits for parochial \nschools. Almost all of the public attention was on the higher education \npart of it. The Carter administration very quickly came up with a two-\npart plan, automatic Pell eligibility for every family if their income \nwas below $25,000, and automatic eligibility for a student loan to any \nstudent who wanted one regardless of family income. Of course, one of \nthe things that Money magazine pointed out was that even a Rockefeller \ncould get a loan at 9 percent. That is what the Government set the loan \nrate at, 9 percent.\n  What is the problem with that? If we had a Secretary of Education \nright now, and they happened to set the loan rate at 9 percent, I am \nsure the press would say that was absolutely terrible. On the other \nhand, if it was a Democrat who set it at 9 percent, they would probably \nsay it was great. But this was the case where the Government set the \nrate at 9 percent. What is the problem? It was a time when interest \nrates were climbing through the roof and were on their way to 21 \npercent prime. So there was an incentive to borrow money at a fixed 9 \npercent rate, which is what the student loan interest rate was, and \nthat didn't have to be repaid until after college when interest rates \nwere going through the roof.\n  So students borrowed the money, put the funds in a money market, and \npaid it back as soon as the repayment began, having made a tidy profit \non the float.\n  Other students borrowed money and used it to finance cars and other \nthings unrelated to college. In fact, parents were encouraged to borrow \nand do home improvements and other things because they could get this 9 \npercent money from the Federal Government. The amount of money being \nborrowed jumped from $1.7 billion in 1977 and 1978 to $67.2 billion in \n1980-1981, an increase of 265 percent in 4 years. Federal costs \nassociated with student loans grew from $480 million to $2.5 billion \nwhich was also growth of 420 percent.\n  Under the Brown-Sanders amendment, a student attending an expensive \nprivate college could borrow the entire cost of attendance, as much as \n$45,000 a year, on highly favorable terms. Repayment would, indeed, \nstart right away, but if families have college money in the bank, they \ncan pay off the loan gradually and earn on the interest, as they do, \nthe same as we had a problem with before.\n  The amendment also will encourage students to have their children \nborrow money for college rather than finance it through the PLUS loans \nor other mechanisms that would put the burden on the adults. In some \ncases, of course, parents will have the student take out the loans and \nwould repay it for them.\n  I am suggesting this is something we haven't reviewed enough to do \nyet; that it would put some of the present loans in jeopardy. We have \nbeen very careful in both last week's bill and this week's to be sure \nthat there was some competition between direct loans and the private \nloans. But those were reviewed over a period of time, looked at with \nsome history, and this one doesn't have the history.\n  I hope we will vote against it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 3 minutes remaining. \nThe Senator from Wyoming has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would prefer to close, if the Senator \nfrom Wyoming has any more time he would like to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. Does he choose to use more time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I will use some more of my time. I haven't used all of it \nyet today, and I probably will not on this one either.\n  I do have a letter I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord. It is from the American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the United \nStates Student Association.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of students and institutions of \n     higher education we urge you to oppose the Brown amendment to \n     create a new supplemental loan program and eliminate all \n     federal student loan limits. We share the desire to help \n     students avoid risky and expensive private loans to pay for \n     college. However, by eliminating all limits on federal \n     student loan borrowing, this amendment may allow states to \n     pass on more of the cost of college to students.\n       Federal Stafford loan limits for undergraduate students are \n     currently set at $23,000 for dependent students and $46,000 \n     for independent students. Students can borrow additional aid \n     through the Perkins loan program and parents are eligible to \n     borrow up to the cost of attendance through the PLUS loan \n     program. Independent students, and in certain circumstances \n     dependent students, are eligible to borrow PLUS loans when \n     their parents do not. Despite the availability of federal \n     student loans a growing number of borrowers are turning to \n     the private loan market to finance their education.\n       The Brown amendment would create a new supplemental loan \n     program designed as an alternative to these more expensive \n     private loans. About 5% of undergraduate students take out \n     private loans to finance their education each year. However, \n     the Brown amendment would allow all students to borrow \n     federal loans up to the cost of attendance minus other \n     federal aid.\n       By eliminating all federal loan limits, the Brown amendment \n     could have serious, negative unintended consequences on state \n     investment in higher education. Over the past decade states \n     all across the country have cut funding for higher education \n     or restrained funding increases when faced with tight \n     budgets. States have compensated by increasing the cost of \n     college to students. Making available such a massive source \n     of new funds, without any limitations, may have the \n     unintended consequence of facilitating tuition increases in \n     states across the country.\n       We urge you to oppose the Brown amendment to S. 1642.\n       For questions please contact Luke Swarthout at U.S. PIRG or \n     Brittny McCarthy.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities \n     (AASCU).\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG).\n       United States Student Association (US SA).\n\n  Mr. ENZI. A few of the highlights:\n\n       Dear Senator,\n       On behalf of students and institutions of higher education \n     we urge you to oppose the Brown amendment to create a new \n     supplemental loan program and eliminate all federal student \n     loan limits.\n       By eliminating all federal loan limits, the Brown amendment \n     could have serious, negative unintended consequences on state \n     investment in higher education.\n\n  I also have a letter from the Financial Services Roundtable. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Financial Services Roundtable,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate considers S. 1642, the Higher \n     Education Amendment of 2007, the Roundtable is writing to \n     express our opposition to the amendment by Senator Sherrod \n     Brown. The Financial Services Roundtable would urge you to \n     oppose the Brown Amendment, which would ultimately be \n     detrimental to student borrowers.\n       The Brown Amendment would create a new federal-run student \n     loan program, in addition to current programs that would \n     offer loans currently being made by private student lenders. \n     This new government system with the ability to borrow money \n     at government rates would essentially supplant lenders \n     offering private student loans. The policy implications of \n     such a program are broad and the unintended consequences are \n     numerous.\n       The private market and competition most efficiently serve \n     consumers. There are many lenders in the private student loan \n     marketplace and competition among lenders benefits students. \n     S. 1642 supports competition in the private student loan \n     market, while the Brown Amendment eliminates competition.\n       This expansive new government bureaucracy created by the \n     Brown Amendment would drive private lenders out of the \n     student loan marketplace. Students would essentially have no \n     alternative to the federal government for student loans. The \n     federal government is not able to respond to market demands \n     like the private market and having one lender on which \n     student must rely is potentially problematic.\n       We urge you to oppose the Brown Amendment.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Steve Bartlett,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I will mention, again, a couple of highlights. They, of \ncourse, express their opposition and point out that it would ``create a \nnew federal-run student loan program, in addition to current programs \nthat would offer loans currently be made by private student lenders. \nThis new government system with the ability to borrow money at \ngovernment rates would essentially supplant lenders offering private \nstudent loans. The policy implications of such a program are broad and \nthe unintended consequences are numerous.''\n  Once again, I reiterate that this hasn't been tested. It hasn't been \nvetted through the committees. Of course, when it goes through \ncommittee, that is an opportunity for a diverse group of people to put \ntheir opinions behind it, as well as to meet with stakeholders and get \nan outside opinion.\n  I would ask that Members oppose the amendment.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire wish to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes 24 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains to the offeror of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 3 minutes and wishes \nto sum up.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, when we structured the arrangement between \ndirect student lending and private lending back in the 1990s, when \nSenator Kennedy was chairman of the committee, there was considerable \nopen dialog about the fact that we were going to set an even playing \nfield where we would allow the marketplace, essentially the students \nand the schools, to decide who was going to win, who would be used more \noften, direct lending or the private market. That was the theory.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Indiana, at that \ntime Mr. Coats, and I worked on this at great length. We worked out an \narrangement where this was the way we would approach it. But ever since \nthen, or at least in the last year, there has been an attempt to tilt \nthe playing field significantly toward direct lending and to make the \nGovernment the lender of first resort and last resort for most \nstudents, even though in most instances that has been rejected both by \nthe students and the education community.\n  This amendment is just an extension of that effort and is arguably an \nextremely expensive extension because even though the scoring rules may \nreflect a zero scoring--and I am not sure it will--we know those rules \ndon't adequately reflect the cost to the Government of having \nparticipated in these types of lending programs.\n  What we are doing now under this amendment is saying not only do you \nhave these base lending amounts that are available under direct \nlending, but you are going to be able to borrow up to the full cost of \nyour education. So it dramatically skews the system to favor direct \nlending and especially to allow students and parents, as has been \npointed out by the ranking member on the committee, to arbitrage that \nmoney and encourages high cost schools to become even more expensive.\n  One of the things we have seen is that there appears to be a direct \ncorrelation between tuition going up at schools and federally supported \nlending and Federal grants being increased. So the students are not \nusually advantaged by this expansion of direct lending and, many times, \ngrants. It is, rather, the schools that are advantaged, especially \nhigh-end schools which simply raise their tuition to absorb whatever \nnew money is flowing in out of the Federal Treasury. It has become a \nfairly cynical game on the part of many academic institutions, but it \nis exactly what has happened.\n  This amendment needs a hearing. It needs to be vetted very \naggressively in committee, as the Senator from Wyoming, the ranking \nRepublican, pointed out. It basically, in my humble opinion, right up \nfront, undermines three of the basic principles we should be trying to \nresist occurring.\n\n  The first principle is we not unduly tilt the playing field in favor \nof direct lending over private lending or private lending over direct \nlending. Last week's amendment, which I think took a significant amount \nof money out of the subsidy for private lending, was a good step in the \ndirection of not allowing private lending to get an advantage. This \namendment should not be passed because it gives direct lending an \nunfair advantage.\n  Secondly, it should not create an atmosphere where students are \npushed toward higher income schools, higher cost schools, and where \nparents and students are allowed to basically game the system through \narbitraging funds--borrowing at one rate, lending at another rate--\nassuming they had some other sources of revenue.\n  Thirdly, it should not encourage this process which is occurring out \nthere of giving significant resources without any discipline to higher \neducation facilities so they can then raise their tuition, at the \nexpense of students who do not have these types of resources to pay \nthese loans or who do not qualify for these loans and end up with \neducation becoming more expensive simply because the higher education \ninstitutions see there is easy money out there to capture, and they do \nnot have to be disciplined in managing their education systems.\n  So there are a lot of issues this raises--a lot of issues. Now, I \nknow the basic goal of some on the other side is to move the whole \nthing to direct lending. Unfortunately, that has become the cause \ncelebre around here, and the purpose. Much like universal health care, \nthey would like to have universal Federal lending policies around here. \nBut the private sector plays a significant and constructive role in \nmaking college affordable for American students, and has.\n  The original agreement, which was reached in the 1990s to make the \nplaying field balanced and fair and to keep it balanced and fair, is \nthe way we should proceed. We should not be putting in place, out of \nthe clear blue sky, a brand-new major direct lending program which will \nundermine some of the\n\n[[Page S9749]]\n\nmajor tenets and efforts we have undertaken in higher education \nlending.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time for the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents of the \namendment have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those opposed have 49 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair. I will close.\n  We know several things. We, first of all, know that my amendment sets \nup a competition. It does not set up, it does not run the system. It \nsimply sets up a competition. It does not tilt the playing field. It \nmakes the playing field even so interest rates will not continue to be \nat a usurious rate of 16 and 17 and 18 percent.\n  We know the Direct Loan Program works. We have seen the Government \ninvolved in the Direct Loan Program, as in Pell, as in Stafford. The \nGovernment, in fact, has negative subsidy rates of 7 percent and 4 \npercent. In other words, the Government has done these so efficiently \nthat the Government either breaks even or actually makes money.\n  We know my amendment does not take effect until students have \nexhausted up to $23,000. There are other opportunities to get financing \nfor college. It only goes there. It is not a new program that simply \nwill take people in because it is tilted, as my friend, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, says. We also know if we do nothing, as USA Today \nsaid: There is just one problem. The efforts short of this amendment \nwould do little to rein in the fastest growing area of the market--\nloans that are not federally backed whose rates can generally rise \nwithout limit. Bills in Congress would not affect rates on these loans, \nalso often called private loans, until this amendment.\n  The ranking member said he hopes the banks charge lower interest \nrates. The fact is--as the Senator from New Hampshire talked about \ngaming the system--the banks are gaming the system. That is why this \nwoman from Cincinnati had to--on a loan of $21,000--pay $102,000 back, \nat 18 percent interest.\n  We just want some competition. I do not want to see the easy money--\nthe Senator from New Hampshire talks about the easy money. It is easy \nmoney for the banks. It is huge profits for the banks.\n  This is really a decision that comes down to, are you going to \nsupport students in giving them the opportunity to go to school? This \nis not buying a car. This is not making car loans. This is providing an \nopportunity for a lot of students. It is their first chance to go to \ncollege.\n  My wife went to college, enrolled at Kent State University 30 years \nago. She was the first one in her family to go to college. She probably \ncould not do that today because the loans and the grants are not \navailable the way they were 30 years ago. She probably would have \neither not been able to go to school because she could not have put the \nfinancial package together or she would have seen a situation where she \nwould have been burdened with such huge loans, huge debt when she \ngraduated.\n  There is the choice, are you voting for students in this country--\ngiving opportunity to middle-class students, opportunity to working \nfamilies--or are you going to vote to support the banks so they can \ncontinue to charge these kinds of 15, 16, 17, 18 percent interest \nrates?\n  Mr. President, I ask for support of the Brown amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe Consumer Bankers Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Consumer Bankers Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 23, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to let you know of the strong \n     opposition of the Consumer Bankers Association to an \n     amendment that will be offered by Senator Brown to the S. \n     1624, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 2007. The Brown \n     Amendment would create a new ``Federal Supplemental Loan \n     Program.''\n       The effects of this program are hard to ascertain as it is \n     being proposed with little input from anyone involved with or \n     affected by student financial assistance programs. There have \n     been no hearings or other public discussion of this massive \n     proposal. We understand that student and school groups oppose \n     the legislation, and we urge you to read letters to that \n     effect from their representatives.\n       The loan program envisioned by this legislation would \n     enlarge the government by tens of billions of dollars a year \n     and represents an attempt to fully nationalize student \n     lending, putting all responsibility for making and collecting \n     tens of billions of dollars in new loans every year into the \n     hands of the Department of Education and its contractors.\n       A private student lending system already exists; it is \n     competitive and serves the needs of millions of students \n     every year. The Brown Amendment is attempting to replace this \n     system with a government-only monopoly that will eliminate \n     students' and parents' choice of lender. This will only put a \n     stop to innovation and improvement while doing nothing about \n     the high cost of higher education.\n       We urge you to oppose the Brown Amendment to S. 1624.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Belew,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the benefit of Members, I think \nwe will have a rollcall vote on the Senator's amendment. We will work \nout with the leadership the time for that vote. I think that is going \nto be the way we are going to proceed.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois on the Senate floor now who has an \namendment and, hopefully, we will be able to address that at the \npresent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2377\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the John R. Justice \nProsecutors and Defenders Incentive Act as an amendment to the Higher \nEducation Act of 2007.\n  This amendment would create a targeted student loan repayment \nassistance program that will bolster the ranks of attorneys in the \ncriminal justice system in America.\n  I think the need for this amendment is clear. Prosecutor and public \ndefender offices throughout the country are having serious difficulties \nrecruiting and retaining qualified attorneys.\n  In a recent survey, over a third of prosecutor offices nationwide \nreported problems with keeping attorneys on staff. Over 60 percent of \nprosecutor offices that serve populations of 250,000 or more reported \nserious problems with the retention of attorneys.\n  The story is the same for public defender offices. Another recent \nsurvey found that over 60 percent of State and local public defender \noffices reported difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention.\n  When prosecutor and defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or \nkeep experienced ones, their ability to protect the public is \ncompromised. Caseloads become unmanageable, cases can be delayed or \nmishandled, crimes may go unprosecuted, and innocent defendants may sit \nin jail.\n  Why is it that prosecutor and defender offices are struggling to keep \nattorneys on staff? I will tell you one major reason: student loan \ndebt.\n  Over 80 percent of law students take out loans to finance their legal \neducation. The average educational debt for law school graduates in the \nclass of 2005 was almost $79,000 for private school graduates, and \n$51,000 for public school graduates. Two-thirds of law students also \ncarry additional debt from their undergraduate experience.\n  In light of this, it is not surprising that two-thirds of law \nstudents in a recent national survey stated that student loan debt \nprevented them from even considering a public interest or Government \njob--two-thirds of law school graduates. Of those dedicated law \ngraduates who initially accept criminal justice jobs, many cannot stay. \nThey just cannot afford to do so with the student loans they face.\n  The higher education reconciliation bill we passed last week does \nmuch to address student loan debt in general for those who have already \nbeen in public service for 10 years. There is student loan forgiveness. \nThere is a cap on how much a graduate would have to repay for a period \nof time, and at the end of 10 years there is student loan forgiveness.\n  But, unfortunately, it does not go far enough to address the urgent \nneed to help our criminal justice system recruit and retain qualified \nattorneys.\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\nWe need a special solution to provide immediate assistance.\n  My amendment, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive \nAct, is a tailored solution. My amendment would establish, within the \nDepartment of Justice, a program of student loan repayment assistance \nfor borrowers who agree to remain employed for at least 3 years as \nState or local criminal prosecutors or as State, local, or Federal \npublic defenders.\n  I should point out that Federal prosecutors are already eligible for \nloan relief through existing programs.\n  Under my amendment, borrowers could enter into another agreement, \nafter the 3-year minimum, for an additional period of service. \nAttorneys who participate in this program can receive student loan debt \nrepayments of up to $10,000 annually, with a maximum over time of \n$60,000. Repayments would begin with the first year of service. But, \nremember, there is no repayment unless there is a pledge to work at \nleast 3 years, and then an opportunity to come back for another 3 \nyears. So a commitment has to be made.\n  The program gives priority in repayment benefits to attorneys who \nhave the least ability to repay their loans. It ensures a fair \nallocation of benefits among prosecutors and defenders nationwide.\n  If an attorney receives loan repayments under this program but does \nnot complete the agreed-upon period of service, they have to pay back \nthe money.\n  The John R. Justice Act is modeled on existing loan repayment \nprograms that cover Federal executive branch employees and the \nDepartment of Justice. They have been demonstrated to be a great \nsuccess as an attorney recruitment and retention tool.\n  Simply put, a targeted loan repayment assistance program such as this \none would make criminal justice careers more feasible and more \nattractive to qualified attorneys.\n  Let me say, this bill has passed out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee twice. It has strong bipartisan support. It was brought to me \nby the prosecutors and the defenders in our criminal justice system. As \nwe read in the news about case after case where those in prison have \nhad their prosecutions reevaluated, we understand that competent \ncounsel is the bedrock of a good system of criminal justice. We need \nthe very best attorneys on both sides of the table--prosecuting those \nwho have been accused of a crime and defending those who have that \npresumption of innocence in America.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support, with 38 Senate cosponsors. \nCompanion legislation in the House passed by a vote of 341 to 73. It is \nsupported by prosecutor, defender, and criminal justice organizations. \nI urge my colleagues to support their State and local prosecutors and \ndefenders, and to support this legislation.\n  It has, among others, the support of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators, the \nNational Legal Aid and Defender Association, the National Association \nof Criminal Defense Lawyers, the American Council of Chief Defenders, \nthe National Juvenile Defender Center, the American Bar Association, \nthe Conference of Chief Judges, and the American Law Deans Association.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask, is there an amendment currently \npending on this legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an amendment pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside and I send this amendment to the desk. Then, of course, I \nwould agree to step back in line and defer to the chairman and ranking \nmember as to the sequence of amendments that will be called later. So I \nask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2377.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I will defer to the chairman and ranking \nmember as the sequence of amendments are considered on the bill. My \namendment, I assume, is currently pending, but I understand if there is \na different sequence both of these Senators would seek.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator being willing to \nallow us to go back to the previous amendment or on to another \namendment. We have one more that will be presented on our side. I think \nthere is another one that will be presented on the Democratic side.\n  I do have to oppose this amendment. I understand the importance, the \ndesire, but I would oppose it on the basis that we spent a lot of time \nlast week doing this same thing. I appreciate the time the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, took to explain to everybody what we were \ndoing in a very general way so we did not have to pick one profession \nover another profession so we could give some reduced loan repayments \nand then forgiveness to public prosecutors, defenders, teachers--a \nwhole category, a whole bunch of service sector people. There was a lot \nof support, although we spent more time debating that part than we did \nseveral other parts of the bill, showing there is some discomfort with \ndoing that, but also support for doing that, but in a general way.\n  When we start picking out one particular area of Federal service over \nothers, what we are doing is touching off a whole raft of people coming \nin with their particular public service and asking for the same kind of \na reduction. Of course, if we do that for everybody, we have increased \nthe cost considerably. We ought to start with the proposal that is in \nthere, and after that works, make modifications to it, rather than \nencouraging every specialty of public service to come in and do that as \nwell.\n  I know the Judiciary passed it. That does not surprise me. That is a \nspecial Judiciary category. If it were a category coming through one of \nthe other committees that dealt with their committee, it would get that \nsame kind of support. But what we tried to do is come up with a way we \ncould have fairness between professions. Each of the professions we \ntalked about have some special needs, and we would be able to encourage \nand incentivize people to go into those professions earlier, quicker, \nand with less debt if we have this same kind of proposal for them. So I \nhope we will resist separating the prosecutors and public defenders at \nthis point in time when we have included them in other language with \nloan forgiveness. Although it is not as short a period of time as the \nSenator might like, I think it is what we ought to do at the present \ntime, and we shouldn't be increasing the program and then leveraging \neverybody else at the same time.\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Wyoming. I wish \nto make sure we understand what happened last week. It was a good \nthing. We basically kept the amount that all student borrowers would \npay based on the income they receive. As I understand the bill that was \npassed last week, which I was happy to support, there is a cap at 15 \npercent of the discretionary income of graduate students for those \nloans that are either in the Direct Loan Program or consolidated into \nthe Direct Loan Program.\n  Basically, what it means from the chart I saw is that students, \ninstead of paying back $600 or $700 a month, might face half that \namount they would pay back because of the limit they would pay each \nyear of 15 percent discretionary income, which I understand to be gross \nincome less 150 percent of poverty for the student or the graduate in \nthat category.\n  The reason I have come back this week to offer this is because we are \ntalking about a group of individuals who are in an exceptional \ncircumstance. They are people who will face an even greater debt than \nmost college graduates. In addition to their undergraduate debt, they \nhave the debt of a law education, which, as I noted here, can be \nsubstantial--almost $80,000 for those who have gone to public law \nschools, and $50,000 for those in private law schools on top of their \nundergraduate debt. Then we find that two-thirds of these students \ncannot seriously consider taking any job in public service or \nGovernment work because of the amount of their debt. So we have \nprosecutors coming in from all over the United States--and I would bet \nfrom your own State--saying: We are having some difficulties here. We \ncan't attract the kind of talented young men and women from law \nschools, because of their debt, to come work as prosecutors and \ndefenders in the criminal justice system and once there, we can't keep \nthem. As soon as they have a good offer to go with a private firm, they \nleave. One of the compelling reasons is the fact that their student \ndebt is so high.\n  So even though the bill passed last week is a good step, it is not \nadequate to the task. These particular graduates face more debt--\ndramatically more debt--than ordinary undergraduates or even graduate \ndegree students in America. We have a special need. I would say to the \nSenator from Wyoming, I guess you can argue that this is special \ninterest because it deals with our system of justice, but I think we \nall concur that as legislators, we can pass the best laws in the world \nin the criminal justice system, but if we don't have well-trained and \ncompetent lawyers prosecuting those cases on behalf of the people of \nthis country, defending those charged on behalf of those who have been \nnamed defendants, then our system of justice will not work as well as \nit should.\n  I will concede that this goes after a special group, but I think \nthere are special circumstances that warrant it.\n  So I hope the Senator will reconsider his opposition to this. As I \nsaid, it has bipartisan sponsorship because I think\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\npeople realize that if we don't do this, we will diminish this branch \nof our Government which is so important for our democracy.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his explanation. I \nwould suggest that the phones are probably ringing off the hook over in \nmy office saying: My public service profession is as important as those \npublic defenders, and that is probably what this phone call was on the \nfloor over here earlier as well.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2369\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2369 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2369.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To certify that taxpayers' dollars and students' tuition \n          support educational rather than lobbying activities)\n\n       At the end of title I of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. DEMONSTRATION AND CERTIFICATION REGARDING THE \n                   ABSENCE OF PAYMENTS FOR INFLUENCE.\n\n       Each institution of higher education or other postsecondary \n     educational institution receiving Federal funding, as a \n     condition for receiving such funding, shall annually \n     demonstrate and certify to the Secretary of Education that no \n     student tuition amounts or funds from a Federal contract, \n     grant, loan, or cooperative agreement received by the \n     institution were used to hire a registered lobbyist or to pay \n     any person or entity for influencing or attempting to \n     influence an officer or employee of any agency of the Federal \n     Government, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of \n     Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in \n     connection with any Federal action.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi for allowing me to offer this amendment. Everything I try \nto do is toward transparency in our Federal Government, because what \nyou cannot measure, you cannot manage.\n  This is a very simple amendment. What we know is that in the last 7 \nyears, the cost of a 4-year college education has doubled. It has gone \nfrom $2,700 to $5,800 at State universities. It has gone from about \n$10,500 to $23,000 at private universities. The costs have doubled. It \nis the only thing in this country that is rising twice as fast as the \ncost of health care. We ought to ask ourselves why.\n  This amendment is very clear. What it says is if you are a university \nand you are lobbying Congress, you have to certify to Congress that you \nare not spending tuition money or other Federal money that you have \ngotten for a project for your students or for your university in terms \nof lobbying to get more money.\n  This, by the way, was excluded from the lobbying and ethics bill we \nconsidered. I have some experience on it because last year, as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government \nInformation, Federal Services, and International Security of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I queried 500 \ncolleges and universities in this country, asking them about their \nearmarks. I asked them how they spent the money. The interesting thing \nis only 50 percent of them replied, and of the 50 percent that replied, \nonly half of them actually knew where the money went. The other half \ndidn't dare reply, either because they didn't know where the money went \nor the money didn't go for the purpose it was earmarked. So we have a \ngrave problem in terms of earmarks.\n  Let me give my colleagues some statistics about what has happened. \nFirst of all, in 2005, $127 million were spent by universities to lobby \nour institution to get earmarks--$127 million. Divide that and see how \nmany kids we could educate in this country with that amount of money \nthat was spent on lobbying.\n  What we do know is between 1996 and 2005, the number of earmarks at \nthe Department of Education increased by 29,375 percent. I wonder if \nthat has anything to do with this marked increase of 14.5 percent per \nyear in the cost of a college education.\n  Those earmarks--the overall cost of the earmarks came to a half a \nbillion dollars a year last year--a half a billion dollars in earmarks. \nWhat we also saw--that was in the Department of Education. Then, \nseparate earmarks for separate universities and colleges in the same \ntime period increased from 369 to 1,964, up to $2 billion a year. Now, \nyou would think that for $2.5 billion a year, we ought to be able to \nsee where the money is spent. We ought to have transparency to see.\n  There are several problems with our earmarking, and the biggest \nproblem is we choose to pick winners and losers. When we do that on \nresearch and development at our universities, which are the ones we \nwant to do it to, when we do it, we say that the peer review scientific \ncommunity shouldn't have any input. That is what we are saying. \nConsequently, when we spend $2.6 billion on earmarking specific \nprojects at universities, what we are doing is getting a whole lot less \nvalue for our money. What we do know is if we let the scientists, \nthrough peer-reviewed guidance of scientific discovery, tell us where \nto go next, we will get two to three to four times return on our \nresearch than when I, as a Senator from Oklahoma, decide to earmark a \nspecific research project at a university in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Now, the question we should be asking--similar to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois--where is the money going to come from? The \ntrue deficit last year was $434 billion. That is not what we told the \nAmerican people, but that is how much our debt increased, so that is \nwhat the actual increase in expenditures over the increase in revenues \nwas. If I was a prosecutor, I would love Senator Durbin's amendment, if \nI owed the money.\n  But the principle we should be thinking about is this: Why are we \nhaving trouble getting the best into the offices of the public \ndefenders and the prosecutors? Because we don't pay enough. What \nSenator Durbin is attempting to do is a State function. It is an \nindirect payment. We are going to pay off loans, we are going to have \nloan forgiveness for this group of people when, in fact, the way we \nshould be enhancing that is having States choose to increase \nreimbursement for people who fulfill that very worthy task.\n  So what we are actually doing is jumping all over States' rights, \nbecause States haven't increased those fees, as they should, because \nthey don't evidently value it the way the 38 cosponsors of the Durbin \namendment do, and we are saying: Time out. It is not your \nresponsibility; we are going to do it. It is the same type of thing we \nhave in terms of earmarks.\n  This amendment is very simple. Certify to Congress, if you are \ngetting Federal funds and you want more Federal funds in terms of \nearmarks or grants, that you are not going to spend that money or your \nstudents' tuition to come up here to get more money. What you ought to \ndo is use your endowment.\n  There are some very interesting statistics on endowment that I would \nlike to alert my colleagues to so everybody can be aware. I commend to \nmy colleagues a 2006 National Association of College and University \nBusiness Officers Endowment Study.\n  The top 25 universities in this country have $178 billion in \nendowments. Now, if they earn 6 percent on that, that is $9 billion a \nyear that they have funds available to them to do research with, or \nwhatever else they want to do. If you take the entire group of \nendowments, which is some 20 pages long, what you find is a massive \namount of money that is endowed.\n  Why do people give to universities? They give to universities to \nsecure their future because they felt rewarded by the gift they gave \nthem of education. Yet we have almost $1 trillion in endowments in this \ncountry in universities, and we are saying we need earmarks. We need \nextra moneys. Fine. If we do need extra moneys for research, let's let \nthe peer-reviewed scientific community tell us where to go. Let's put \nthe research at the place that it is going to get us the best return, \nrather than one that has the greatest\n\n[[Page S9753]]\n\npolitical pull. That makes absolute sense to anybody outside of \nWashington.\n  Now, it doesn't make sense if you are trying to get something for \nyour university, and University X obviously has the expertise, but you \nwant it at your university. So what do we do? We end up paying double. \nWe are going to fund one that is not as efficient, not as capable, and \nnot as successful at the expense of the university that is far more \ncapable of doing that.\n  A lot of the university earmarks came about because it was stated \nthey couldn't compete on the grant process; that the major \nuniversities--those top 25 research universities in the United States--\ncould outcompete them all on grants. So we did some things when we \ndoubled NIH funding. We did allow for things. What has happened is a \npox on our house. We have gone to this large number of earmarks, 2,000 \nearmarks a year for universities, and we are not getting our money's \nworth for them.\n  I come back to one of the reasons I would like for us to consider \nthis amendment: How do you tell a student who is working a second job, \nwho can't afford a tutor, he has borrowed student loans up to his gills \nand is trying to make it, that a percentage of his university's budget \nout of his tuition is coming up here to get another earmark that is not \nnecessarily going to be efficient or not going to enhance or advance \nhis education or her education?\n  So it is real simple. Transparency creates accountability.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four case \nstudies--one from the University of Alaska, one from the University of \nNorth Carolina, Chapel Hill, one from the University of Georgia, and \none from Iowa State University--on what they have done with earmarks \nand how they have spent them. It is remarkable.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Lobbyist confirms that academic earmarks are indeed a \n     ``gateway drug on the road to spending addiction'': Earmarks \n     are the ``gateway drug to the spending addiction.'' A \n     lobbyist for one of the universities polled (the University \n     of Alaska) agrees. According to a profile of this lobbyist in \n     the Chronicle of Higher Education, ``She equates getting \n     earmarks to having a heroin addiction. `Once you start \n     getting them, it's hard to let go.' '' It's noteworthy that \n     this same lobbyist advised her institution not to respond to \n     the Subcommittee's oversight request on the University of \n     Alaska's past earmarks.\n       ``Martha Stewart, director of federal relations for the \n     University of Alaska, is one who said her institution would \n     not respond.\n       ``Stewart said she showed the Coburn request to the Alaska \n     Congressional delegation, including the office of Stevens, \n     whose clout as an appropriator and earmarker is legendary.\n       ``Answering the letter `would be providing someone with \n     bullets to shoot you,' said Martha Stewart, director of \n     federal relations for the University of Alaska system. She \n     said she assumes that Senator Coburn would use the \n     information to try to block Alaska's requests for earmarked \n     projects--which she declined to describe--from appropriations \n     bills for the 2007 fiscal year, which begins October 1.''\n       Lobbying for academic earmarks is on the rise: In 2003, it \n     was reported that:\n       ``[T]he brisk rate of growth has outpaced almost all other \n     sectors that pay for lobbyists. That has made higher \n     education one of the biggest players on the lobbying scene in \n     Washington, on a par with defense contractors and ranking \n     ahead of some other large, influential interest groups such \n     as lawyers, labor unions, and the construction industry, \n     according to rankings compiled by Political Money Line, a \n     company that tracks lobbying reports . . . By far the single \n     biggest reason for the spurt appears to be the appetite \n     colleges have for pork-barrel projects. The burst in lobbying \n     came at a time when Congress was quadrupling spending on \n     directed, noncompetitive grants from $495-million to $2-\n     billion. Such earmarks were rare 20 years ago, but the \n     floodgates opened in the late 1990s.''\n       Even though universities claim to be lobbying innocently \n     for general education funding increases, in fact, this \n     lobbying is often for specific projects: In response to the \n     Subcommittee's questions, a number of universities reported \n     that the lobbyists they hire are to help them reach out to \n     Congress for general issues related to academia and the need \n     for more federal research dollars. But there's some evidence \n     that schools are lobbying for specific projects:\n       ``The Chronicle collected and analyzed lobbying-disclosure \n     reports for all colleges, universities, and other academic \n     institutions for the 1998, 2001, and 2003 calendar years. . . \n     . While the reports are supposed to state the purpose of the \n     lobbying, the wording often mentions federal appropriations \n     generally, not specific projects.\n       ``The reports do show that not all of the academic lobbying \n     is for earmarks . . . But at many colleges, officials don't \n     feel compelled to pay lobbyists to spend lots of time on \n     those and other policy issues because they know places \n     like Yale and Rutgers are already making the case, as are \n     higher-education associations like the American Council on \n     Education.\n       ``Most institutions apparently prefer to concentrate their \n     lobbying dollars on getting earmarks.'' [Emphasis added.]\n       The resistance universities show to disclosing information \n     about their lobbying activities suggests that they recognize \n     the unsavory nature of this sort of spending. The \n     Subcommittee specifically asked about the use of lobbyists to \n     help obtain earmarks.\n       The response--or lack of it--was surprising. Despite \n     receiving taxpayer money for special projects, some \n     universities were still unwilling to answer the question. Of \n     the top 50 pork recipients for 2003, and the top 50 R \n     ranked universities questioned: 23 wouldn't respond to \n     whether they retained a lobbyist--they simply skipped the \n     question or did not write a letter response at all; 6 said \n     they had ``considered'' hiring a lobbyist, but didn't respond \n     whether they had actually hired a lobbyist or not, and two \n     said they had ``no plan to retain a federally lobbyist at the \n     moment''; 22 stated that they retained a contract lobbyist; \n     14 stated that they had not hired a contract lobbyist; and 5 \n     stated they had hired a contract lobbyist in the past, but \n     not at the time of their response.\n\n\n                   Case study: University of Georgia\n\n       Which comes first--the lobbyist or the earmark? And is \n     either actually a value to a student? At the University of \n     Georgia--it's hard to tell. The university retains a lobbyist \n     who seems to be an expert in the peanut and Vidalia onion \n     industry, among other things, and the University has received \n     federal earmarks for research on Vidalia onions and peanuts. \n     However, because the University is hiding information on \n     those particular earmarks, it's hard for students and \n     taxpayers to judge the educational value of the projects.\n       In fact, the university tasked its lobbyist with responding \n     to the Subcommittee inquiry. The response was sent from the \n     email account of ``C. Randall Nuckolls, Washington Counsel, \n     University of Georgia, McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP.''\n       According to the Center for Responsive Politics' \n     OpenSecrets.org website, Mr. C. Nuckolls' firm, McKenna Long \n     & Aldridge, earned $160,000 in 2006 from its contract with \n     the University of Georgia.\n       In addition, data compiled by the Center for Responsive \n     Politics shows that the University of Georgia also paid \n     another lobbyist, Robert Redding, Jr., $40,000-$60,000 each \n     year for the years 2000-2006. In 2006, the University paid \n     $20K for the main university campus and $20K for the \n     University of Georgia School of Agriculture & Environmental \n     Sciences. Robert Redding, Jr., also represents the Georgia \n     Peanut Commission, the National Association of FSA County \n     Office Employees, and the Vidalia Onion Business Council, \n     among others.\n       In response to the question about its past earmarks, the \n     university supplied the subcommittee with a three page \n     attachment with the titles of only 9 earmarked projects from \n     2000-2006, the amount of funding, the funding agency, and a \n     short description of the earmark projects. The total value of \n     projects listed was $62.117 million. That's 9 earmarks \n     reported, for the 7-year period from 2000-2006.\n       However, the Chronicle earmarks database tells a different \n     story. The database lists 53 earmarks distributed over just \n     four of the years in that 7-year period, worth nearly $41 \n     million to the University of Georgia. Information after 2003 \n     is unavailable because earmarks grew so much that the \n     publication no longer had the resources to keep track of \n     them.\n       Meanwhile, the Congressional Research Service has refused \n     to conduct research in this area, despite repeated requests.\n       Two earmarks the University failed to report to the \n     Subcommittee come from the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development's (USAID) budget. One earmark, for $200,000 in \n     2000 was ``for support above what the agency would otherwise \n     have spent, to promote the availability of food in developing \n     nations by educating leaders to manage natural resources.'' \n     The second earmark, for $200,000 in 2000, was for ``for \n     support above what the agency would otherwise have spent, to \n     improve the production, processing, and marketing of peanuts \n     in developing nations as a high-protein food source.''\n       Even when the university did report earmarks, it grouped \n     them in vague categories, particularly those from the \n     Department of Agriculture. The Chronicle database is more \n     forthcoming about what the university merely described as \n     ``Ag special research grants.'' These types of earmarks come \n     from a pork-slush-fund at USDA, and include the following for \n     the University of Georgia: $16 million from 2001-2003 to \n     conduct ``research to combat fusarium head blight, or scab, a \n     fungus that damages wheat and barley''; $170,470 in 2003 to \n     ``develop the cultivation and marketing of grass-fed cattle \n     raised in the Appalachian region''; $488,615 over three years \n     for ``research on predation by small mammals, such as \n     raccoons and foxes, on ground-nesting game birds''; $657,000 \n     over two years for ``research on pests, soil quality, and \n     water quality related to the cultivation of peanuts''; \n     $800,000 over two years for research on the ``quality of \n     cotton fibers'';\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\n     $493,000 over two years ``to study the quantity of water used \n     in agriculture in Georgia''; $1,972,000 over four years for \n     ``research on canola''; $1,800,000 in 2000 for ``unspecified \n     research''; $1,091,000 over three years for the for the \n     National Center for Peanut Competitiveness, ``which works to \n     improve peanut-production methods and product safety''; \n     $694,000 over three years ``for research on tomato-wilt \n     virus, which damages peanuts'' $350,000 over three years ``to \n     develop pungency-testing procedures to improve the quality \n     and ``sensory consistency'' of Vidalia onions''; $64,000 in \n     2000 to ``to develop better methods of monitoring and \n     controlling termites and ants''.\n       That's 12 projects under one vague category reported to the \n     Subcommittee as one item. What else is the University of \n     Georgia hiding?\n\n\n                  Case study 2: Iowa State University\n\n       When asked by the Subcommittee to provide a list of past \n     appropriations from the year 2000 to present, and the amount \n     of assistance received, Iowa State University apparently did \n     not have this information available in any form that could be \n     presented to the Subcommittee. The university asked for \n     additional time to comply with the request, along with \n     answering a few of the questions in the initial response.\n       The university was granted more time by the Subcommittee to \n     complete a response. Three months after the original request \n     date, the university sent a second response letter, a \n     notebook containing summaries of Iowa State University \n     Congressionally directed funding 2000-2006 (minus the \n     requested actual funding amounts), and 6 boxes containing, \n     according to the letter, ``540 published reports, studies, \n     and other materials that had been produced throughout the \n     requested timeframe.''\n       Quotes from second response:\n       ``I want to thank you for making this request, because \n     compiling this information has proved very useful to the \n     university. We have added this information to our own on-\n     campus process of evaluation and review of federally \n     appropriated projects. To that end, we took great care to \n     make sure that we collected and reviewed all relevant \n     information for our own purposes as well as your request. We \n     regularly go to great lengths to assure the merit and value \n     all university research, but I am also aware of the \n     importance of additional informed review. Following this \n     letter is a compilation of the congressionally directed \n     funding that Iowa State University has received from FY2000 \n     through FY2006.''\n       The second response from Iowa State University was heavy on \n     detail when it came to lists of published reports (provided \n     only for some projects; others included far less detail), but \n     not when it came to requested information. Only one of the 31 \n     earmark summaries included in the notebook sent by the \n     University contained a table breaking out funding streams by \n     sponsoring agency for the earmark in Question. but even that \n     table did not include the years the university received \n     funding for the project, and the table was rife with acronyms \n     (a practice well known in D.C. and apparently also in the \n     academic world) and therefore not easily decipherable. Only \n     one other project included a paragraph describing the history \n     and origin of the earmark, and some information on the \n     funding stream, as well as details on significant oversight \n     by the lead agency from which the funding originated.\n       Despite the reams of paper provided by the university, The \n     Chronicle database lists a significant number of earmarks \n     which do not appear in the project summaries provided by Iowa \n     State University. However, what is even worse is the \n     university's lack of responsiveness on the funding for the \n     earmarks they chose to highlight to the subcommittee: the \n     total value of the earmark funding from the Chronicle \n     database for the years 2000 through 2003, is over $83 \n     million. Information after 2003 is unavailable because \n     earmarks grew so much that the publication no longer had the \n     resources to keep track of them.\n\n\n       Case study 3: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\n       In response to the FFM Subcommittee's oversight request, \n     the university provided a list of 17 earmarks spanning six \n     years, from 2001-2006, worth a total value of $17.7 million. \n     The university included brief, one sentence ``program \n     objectives'' for each earmark it listed its response. These \n     cursory sentences do not answer the Subcommittee's request \n     for detailed descriptions, findings and accomplishments for \n     each project.\n       According to the University, 8 of those projects were \n     funded from earmarks handed out over the years 2001-2003 with \n     a value of $6.975 million. However, in contrast, over the \n     same timeframe, the Chronicle database lists 10 non-shared \n     earmarks, and two shared earmarks distributed over 2001-2003, \n     with a total value of a little over $14 million.\n       According to data in the Chronicle earmarks database, for \n     the three years 2001-2003, the university failed to include \n     and report on the following earmarks funding 6 projects with \n     a total value of $12.593 million. Without Chronicle data, who \n     would know the difference--and who knows for the years 2004 \n     through 2006 since information after 2003 is unavailable \n     because earmarks grew so much that the Chronicle no longer \n     had the resources to keep track of them. Here are the six \n     projects: $3.5 million over three years from the Department \n     of Defenses for ``Research on improving logistics management \n     for the military and businesses, and to develop an executive-\n     education project''; $223,537 from the Department of Defense \n     in 2002 for ``personnel, student internships, research, and \n     other expenses to expand technological education and \n     applications through its KnowledgeWorks Institute''; $2.4 \n     million through NASA over 2002-2003 for ``academic programs \n     at the Science Discovery Outreach Center''; $4 million in \n     2002 through the Department of Defense for the ``Southeast \n     Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing System (to be shared with \n     the University of Miami)''; $969,000 from the Department of \n     Energy for ``mathematical and computational research and \n     software development to solve environmental problems''; $1.5 \n     million in 2002 through the Environmental and Protection \n     Agency to ``advance the `one-atmosphere approach' to \n     determining the health effects of air pollution for the \n     university's schools of public health and medicine''\n       FFM Subcommittee staff received calls and faxed \n     communications from the university's lobbyist, James E. \n     Hyland, who helped to coordinate the response and who \n     forwarded the university's first interim response via fax. \n     According to the Center for Responsive Politics' \n     OpenSecrets.org website, James E. Hyland, ``Career Client \n     List, 1998-2006,'' works for Greenberg Traurig LLP, which had \n     a contract worth in $120,000 in 2006 alone with UNC.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. With that, I will cease discussing this other than to say \nwe ought to figure out why a college education and the costs thereof \nare growing twice as fast as health care, which is four times as fast \nas everything else in this country. Something isn't right. Transparency \nis the key to getting accountability for that problem. To vote against \nthis amendment would be saying you don't want the universities to be \ntransparent, to be accountable. I believe they should be accountable \nand certify to us that not one penny of tuition, one penny of Federal \nmoney is spent back here. Mr. President, $127 million was spent last \nyear to lobby this body on university grants and earmarks. We ought to \nchange that. That could educate a ton of our young people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Senator would help \nclarify his amendment for me. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me know after I have used 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be good enough to answer some \nquestions?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was reading through the amendment. As the Senator \nknows, we have at the present time on the bill the Byrd amendment, \ntitle 31 of the U.S. Code, which forbids what I imagine is much of this \namendment. Under the law, recipients of Federal contracts--whether \nthrough grants, loans, or cooperative agreements--are barred from using \nthose funds to lobby, to extend, or modify a Federal award.\n  I am trying to understand what you include that his amendment doesn't \ninclude. Let me ask the question: if the President of a university or a \ngovernment affairs person of the university called a Member of Congress \nabout the student loan program, is that considered to be part of a \nlobbying effort? This is on my time.\n  Mr. COBURN. No. What I am looking at is for them to, in a positive, \nforward way, assert that as they take Federal funds, those funds are \nnot used to, in fact, pay a lobbyist. When a university President calls \nyou, he is not calling as a lobbyist. He has a right to lobby this as \nan individual. My amendment is fairly narrow in that those funds are \nnot spent to lobby, i.e. lobbying payment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was interested, if there is a government affairs \nperson at one of our fine universities--for example, Tufts University \nin Massachusetts, which was in touch with us about loan forgiveness. In \ngovernment affairs, they have an interesting program where they had a \ngood deal of loan forgiveness for students, and they were calling \nasking about how their program fits in with this bill. It was a \ngovernment affairs figure who called us about this, signaling that they \nthought their program was better than the one we had. Is that \nconsidered lobbying by the government affairs person?\n  Mr. COBURN. No.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If there were inquiries on No Child Left Behind, on the \nspecial needs of disabled children, or they\n\n[[Page S9755]]\n\nwanted to find out about bilingual programs and about grants from the \nNIH--there is this concern, as the Senator knows, about cuts in the NIH \nbudget, and I have had calls from some of the great research centers in \nmy home State, from universities and in some instances from presidents \nand in some instances from government affairs people, about their \nconcern about where we are going as a country in terms of NIH and in \nterms of the future. Does it affect any of those?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, sir.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Even though the universities may be affected by some of \nthese cuts. Is it just that the lobbyists--the hiring of the lobbyists \nand the lobbyists then speaking to the Member--I am trying to get what \nthe Senator is driving at.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am trying to get to this paradigm where we pay $200,000 \na year for lobbyists, and the lobbyists work to get an earmark for the \nuniversity back in that is out of the priority of the peer review, \nscientifically evaluated, and at the same time, some of that $200,000 \nsomehow ends up in campaign coffers, for some reason. I cannot figure \nout why, but it seems to. This doesn't stop it. What this says is they \nare going to just certify that the money they used for that wasn't \ntheir students' tuition and other Federal dollars that were designed \nfor another purpose and coming back against that. It doesn't mean they \ncannot pay a lobbyist or hire a lobbyist or that anybody in there \ngovernment affairs office cannot contact us to lobby for a particular \nposition, which is their right. This is very narrowly defined to say: \nDo not spend the money you get from us, or your students, to hire the \nlobbyists to earmark something that is outside the peer review.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think that might be wrong. I thought that was the \npoint of the Byrd amendment. In your language you have on page 2, ``any \nperson or entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer \nor employee of any agency of the Federal Government, a Member of \nCongress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a \nMember of Congress in connection with any Federal action.'' I am trying \nto understand this. Can a government affairs person at a university--I \nam a Member of Congress--talk to me about support for the NIH and NIH \nfunding?\n  I hear what the Senator wants to do. I would be interested in where \nyou get the $127 million. I will accept what the Senator says on this.\n  I had thought, when we passed the Byrd amendment, Senator Byrd spoke \nvery eloquently about what I think the Senator is dealing with, and \nthat is lobbyists getting part of the action when they have the \nearmark. I thought that is the effect.\n  It goes further than that, but I am concerned about--and I have said \nthis in my questions--whether you have a person representing a \nuniversity or a government affairs person calling a Member of Congress \nabout a lot of the matters that we are considering in this legislation, \nwhether it is a student loan program or the NIH or whether it is the \nregulations that are guiding some of the education programs, the \nprograms dealing with disabled student--let me ask you, how would this \naffect a university? If there was a conference by one of the agencies--\nthe Department of Education--and they were having a conference on the \nsubject of higher education, can the university send any individuals \nthere to express their views on education policies? Say they want to go \ndown there and see more laboratories built because they want additional \nresearch, and they speak to the Department of Education about those \nkinds of items.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. It does not limit that in any way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator's responses are helpful. I don't know \nwhether the Senator is familiar with the Byrd amendment. If it is not \ninterfering with colleges or universities or institutions dealing with \na wide range of educational issues or some of the fine schools that \noffer criminology wanting to call the Justice Department to try to get \ngrants to deal with the problems of violence in the communities. But \nthe Senator has given assurance that is not the area he is trying to \nget at. It is basically the lobbyists. I don't know whether the Senator \nis familiar with title I of the Byrd amendment, which prohibits, as I \nunderstand it, a great deal of what the Senator spoke about with great \neloquence in the earlier program.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to.\n  Mr. COBURN. What we are trying to get is this. It is true that the \nByrd amendment makes that illegal. The problem is that nobody has to \ncertify it. So whether it is illegal or not, it is obviously happening. \nYet we don't have any proactive basis going on at the universities for \nthem to certify that they are not doing it. That is the difference \nbetween this and the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just to continue, Mr. President, there are penalties \nwith the Byrd amendment, civil penalties on the Byrd amendment. Maybe \nit is enforcement. The Byrd amendment says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by any Act may be expended \n     by the recipient of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or \n     cooperative agreement to pay any person for influencing or \n     attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, \n     a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of any agency, a \n     Member of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in \n     connection with any Federal action described in paragraph (2) \n     of this subsection.\n\n  Then it goes on:\n\n       (2) The prohibition in paragraph (1) of this subsection \n     applies with respect to the following Federal Actions:\n       (A) The awarding of Federal contract.\n       (B) The making of any Federal grant.\n       (C) The making of any Federal loan.\n       (D) The entering into of a cooperative agreement.\n       (E) The extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or \n     modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or \n     cooperative agreement.\n\n  If the Senator says this is pretty good language but not enforceable \nand he has ideas about how we can try to enforce it, I am certainly \nopen to it and would welcome it. I don't have a problem.\n  My concern was looking at the Senator's amendment and seeing that \nlanguage talking about ``to pay any person or entity for influencing or \nattempting to influence an officer or employee of an agency of the \nFederal Government, a Member of Congress. . . .'' My office has \nfrequent phone calls from universities and colleges, certainly as the \nchairman of the HELP Committee, particularly as we are dealing with \nthis education issue--from scores of universities and colleges. They \nexpress strong views about different aspects of this. We have heard a \ngreat deal from the lending institutions--Sallie Mae and the others--\nthat have a direct financial interest in this. I think it is valuable \nto have clarity in this area so we know what is permitted and what is \nnot permitted. These were some of the areas of concern that I had, and \nthe Senator has been helpful.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator will yield, it put forth a parliamentary \nidea that the Byrd rule applies on bills consistent with \nreconciliation, if I am correct. What this is intended to do is \nproactively have--this does two things: It requires the university to \nknow what they are doing, which is one of the things we found in my \nsubcommittee--that they didn't know what they were doing. They weren't \naware of where the money was going or how they were spending the money. \nIt makes them look at that. Two, it makes them proactively say they are \nwithin the law in terms of how they are spending the student money and \nthe Federal money.\n  I appreciate the colloquy on this issue. I hope we have clarified the \nintent of the amendment. I am more than happy to accept a second degree \nthat would clarify it more and that would give Senator Kennedy the \nsafeguards he is concerned about. Nevertheless, there is a gigantic \nproblem out there today, not the least of which is that it is hard to \nfind in the Constitution where we should be earmarking $2.6 billion a \nyear to private and State universities for education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator is quite correct. The Byrd \nrule applies to reconciliation. The Byrd amendment applies to this. Let \nme just say that I listened and there is much to what the Senator says. \nThere are also some concerns. In 1980, we had, for example, a very good \nprogram to help colleges, large colleges and small, to develop research \ncenters at the colleges and universities. What we had seen in our \ncommittee at that time was\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\nthe deterioration of laboratories and research centers. We passed a \nvery good bill. We had close to in excess of a billion dollars that was \ngoing out for peer review. That program was effectively eliminated. The \nbudget cutters eliminated it. They eliminated the program but not the \nneed. I haven't been very successful. I have done my best to try to \nhelp outstanding colleges and universities that are in need in terms of \nresearch, that are doing some of the breakthrough research, that are \nmaking progress in health and other areas, that are trying to get \nassistance. I am proud of that fact.\n\n  I share the view that in a perfect world, we have peer-reviewed \nscience. There is a lot to what he says. In other areas, we do the best \nwe can with the circumstances we have.\n  I will take a look at what we have in terms of whether an amendment \nor clarification would be the best way to proceed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 4 minutes 48 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I can be recognized, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy makes my point. In 1980, \nwe had a program that was designed on merit, scientific, and peer-\nreviewed analysis. We had no earmarks then. Now we have 2,000 earmarks, \nand about 1 out of every 3 accomplishes something, and then not to the \nlevel of what it should because most of the money did not go to the \nbest place to get the research done.\n  The Senator makes my point. We have a corrupted process in how we \nfund much of the money that goes to universities. Personally, the \nSenator from Massachusetts recognizes, I believe, that is not \nnecessarily a legitimate role for the Federal Government, but it is one \nthat is there. So if it is there, it ought to be transparent. We ought \nto be able to hold all universities accountable, and we ought to know \nwhere the money goes, how it is spent, and what money was spent to \naccomplish the receipt of that money in the first place.\n  Those who vote against transparency like the status quo. You cannot \nfight against transparency. The facts are the facts. You cannot put a \npolitical spin on it. The facts will be the facts. The American \npeople--actually, our American grandchildren, against whom we charged \n$434 billion this last year, ought to have the right to know where \ntheir money is being spent, and the devil is in the details on whether \nthey are taking Federal money and using that Federal money to turn \naround to hire a lobbyist to get more Federal money. That is a corrupt \nsystem, and transparency will clean that up.\n  I ask consideration of the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, is there an order in which the votes are \ngoing to roll this evening? Can this be combined into those votes? I \nthank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2328, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Reid amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my intention--this has been cleared \nwith the two managers--to have two votes tonight and finish whatever \nvotes remain in the morning. It is my understanding that in the morning \nthe first vote will be on the Dodd amendment. He is involved with other \nmatters tonight. We will give him 5 minutes, and if there is \nopposition, they can have 5 minutes, or should we split 5 minutes, I \nsay to my friend from Wyoming? I am not asking consent now--we will do \nthat later--but I am giving an idea.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we should have some time for debate because \nI don't even know what amendment he is offering.\n  Mr. REID. We will talk with the managers in more detail about that \nsituation. Likely, what we will have is on the Dodd amendment, 5 \nminutes equally divided, and on other amendments, there will be 1 \nminute of explanation, for or against, and after that, 10-minute votes. \nWe understand there could be three to five votes in the morning or \nthere could be more. Whatever, we will finish in the morning. We will \ncome in at 10 o'clock because of the leadership meetings that take \nplace in the Capitol. There will be no morning business. We will go \nright to the bill and dispose of these amendments before we have our \nregular work sessions on Tuesday.\n  Does that seem reasonable to my friend from Wyoming?\n  Mr. ENZI. That sounds reasonable to me. I assume we are going to have \na couple votes tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is what I said, we will do two votes tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to speak in favor of the \nDurbin amendment. I thank my colleague from Illinois for introducing \nthis important amendment. It gives us an opportunity to provide for \nequal access to justice in this country.\n  There is a problem today in our legal system, and it is the cost of \nlegal education. The average attorney who graduates from law school \nwill have $70,000 of debt in addition to the $16,000 of average debt in \nattending an undergraduate school. When you have that type of debt, it \naffects your career choice.\n  Today, we want to make sure we get the best qualified attorneys going \ninto public interest law, whether it is as a prosecutor or whether it \nis as a public defender. I think Senator Harkin will be here, either \nlater tonight or tomorrow, to talk about the civil legal services, and \nthe average starting salary for a legal aid attorney is $36,000 a year. \nFor a public defender or for a prosecutor, it is not much higher than \nthat. How can you possibly take a career in those fields and still be \nable to pay off your loans?\n  The Durbin amendment does something about it. It came through the \ncommittee on which I have the honor of serving, the Judiciary \nCommittee. I think it is a well-balanced approach. I know we will \nprobably have a chance to vote on this tomorrow--I don't believe we \nwill vote on it tonight--but there will not be debate time available \ntomorrow, and I wanted to come to the floor and urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  If Senator Harkin offers his second-degree amendment that deals with \ncivil legal services, I hope this body will also support that \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Maryland for his support. I \nmight also say, during the course of the debate he raised an important \nissue--legal aid attorneys. These are attorneys who work primarily in \nthe civil area, representing people of limited means. They are not very \nwell paid. Many of them come out of law school facing debt on their \nown. We want to make sure that people, regardless of their economic \nstatus in America, have access to good legal counsel. So I have pledged \nto him--and I renew the pledge--that if there is a way for us to help \nthe legal aid attorneys as well as defenders and prosecutors, we \nshould.\n  It is in the best interests of our country to have competent counsel \navailable for all Americans in terms of our civil and criminal justice \nsystems. Think about how much we count on prosecutors to take the bad \nguys off the street and keep them off. We don't want somebody bungling \na trial because of lack of experience or lack of skill. We want the \nbest and brightest as prosecutors. Similarly, if the system is going to \nwork and work well, there is a good attorney across the table defending \nthe person who has been\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\ncharged so there truly is a contest that is respectful of our judicial \nsystem.\n  The same thing for legal aid attorneys. Whether they are representing \npeople of modest means who are dealing with the daily drudgery of \ndivorce or wills or landlord-tenant issues or small claims court, we \nwant to make certain that those who are of modest circumstances in this \ncountry do not lose because the race always goes to the swift; that is, \nto those with more money.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland for his commitment to this \namendment and his general commitment to justice in this country.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleague for his leadership on this issue. I \nknow he has been working for many years to get this accomplished, and I \nhope this is the vehicle on which we will get it done. I had the chance \nto chair the Maryland Legal Services Corporation and chaired a \ncommission in Maryland looking to services for our population, and \nthere are not enough attorneys who will handle poverty law. There are \nnot enough attorneys who will handle public defender cases. It is \ndifficult to get experienced prosecutors today because you can go into \na private law firm and make a lot of money, much more than you can as a \npublic defender or legal aid attorney or as a prosecutor.\n  The Senator's legislation gives us a chance to say we want to make \nsure every citizen in our State has equal access to justice in our \nState. I applaud him for it. I think this is what we need to do. We \nhave a chance in this bill to get it done. I thank the Senator for \nbringing it to the floor, and I support his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In my hometown of Springfield, IL, we have an appellant \ndefender program. These are young men and women who handle cases on \nappeal after the trials and work for a government salary. When I \nannounced this amendment--that we had the possibility of student loan \nforgiveness--two young women came to the press conference. One of them \nsaid to me that she has plotted out how long it will take her, working \nas an appellate defender, to pay off her student loan. She said, ``I \nwill be paying when I qualify for Social Security.'' That is hard to \nimagine, but it is a fact. The debt these young lawyers incur to get \nthrough law school, unless they are lucky enough to grab the brass ring \nand go to a big law firm, is so large that it haunts them for a \nlifetime. It colors their life decisions as to where they will work, \nwhether they can own a car, whether they can finally have an apartment \nof their own and move out of their parents' homes. All of these things \nare associated many times with student debt.\n  Whether we are talking about appellate defenders or prosecutors or \npublic defenders, I think we want to make sure these young people are \nspared some of this financial worry and some of this financial burden \nif they are willing to dedicate themselves to public service. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  I think this is a noble calling, and I have to recall it has not been \nbut a few weeks since a Justice of the Supreme Court testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. This Justice came and said he thought \nthe current pay for Federal judges was inadequate in America. That pay \nis in the realm of $165,000 to $200,000 or maybe more, certainly more \nat the Supreme Court level. We asked how much more he thought these \nFederal judges should receive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time limit on this amendment, and \nthe time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2380 to Amendment No. 2377\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order to bring up \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, No. \n2377.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nnow pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to Durbin amendment No. 2377.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2380 to amendment No. 2377.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 in order to provide \n     funding for student loan repayment for civil legal assistance \n                               attorneys)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       In part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended \n     by the Higher Education Amendments of 2007, insert after \n     section 428K the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 428L.

I will take a minute. I understand we are getting ready \nto vote very soon. But I cleared this, of course, with Senator Durbin. \nHe was fine with the second-degree amendment.\n  This amendment that I offered would be to provide for loan \nforgiveness for young attorneys who go into civil legal practice, legal \nservices. Now, the Durbin amendment provides for loan guarantees for \nthose going into prosecution, or I should say criminal work, \nprosecuting attorneys, district attorney's offices, that type of thing, \nwhich is fine.\n  But we also need them for civil legal attorneys, those who are going \ninto legal services. They make the bottom of the ladder. I mean, even \nthe district attorney's offices pay them more than legal services. So I \nthink it is needed in both areas.\n  Right now, with the costs of law school and with the need we have for \nlegal services attorneys, this amendment is drastically needed. Right \nnow, about 50 percent of the people eligible for legal services, which \nmeans they had household income for a family of four of $25,800 or \nless--$25,000 a year or less--only 50 percent of them were able to get \nhelp from a legal aid program. That is 50 percent of the people who \nactually went and sought help. You can imagine how many more there are \nout there who, for one reason or another, did not seek the help.\n  Estimates are that closer to 80 percent of low-income Americans have \nunmet civil legal needs. Right now there is 1 legal aid attorney for \n6,800 low-income Americans. One legal services attorney for every 6,800 \nlow-income Americans. Compare that to 1 attorney for every 525 middle-\nincome Americans.\n  Well, again, the key reason for this is the inability of the legal \naid programs to recruit and retain attorneys. Given the financial \nrealities, many law graduates who are able to take positions with legal \naid leave after 1 or 2 years. One Midwestern program cited a turnover \nrate of 60 percent over a 2-year period of time, with an average tenure \nfor new attorneys of 17 months.\n  So what my amendment does is it builds on the existing loan repayment \nand retention programs for Federal prosecutors and 29 other Government \nagencies, including the Department of Justice and the Congress. All we \nare saying is, if we are going to do it for people who come to work \nhere or the Department of Justice, why not for civil legal aid \nattorneys?\n  This would provide for up to $6,000 a year in loan repayments. You \nwould have to sign it, you would have to be at least 3 years as a legal \nservices attorney to get that, with a maximum lifetime benefit of \n$40,000. The amendment authorizes up to $10 million to do this. We know \nhow many there are. We are only talking about 1,200 nationwide. So we \nknow it does not cost a lot of money, but it is sorely needed. Time and \nagain, people who have unmet civil legal needs, whether it is child \ncustody, divorce proceedings, it could be landlord-tenant problems, \nthese people do not have access to the civil legal system. Then they \ntake the law into their own hands, they do something else.\n  By providing good legal services to low-income people, we basically \nkeep people from doing things they otherwise would not do if they had \nsome legal help available to them. People get desperate. I can tell you \nthis, that the strongest bulwark against domestic violence is legal aid \nattorneys.\n  What happens is, when someone is in an abusive relationship and they \nneed legal help and they cannot afford it, that is when you get \nproblems. Now, I can speak about this from experience. I started out my \nlife as a legal services attorney. That is what I did when I got out of \nlaw school.\n  I thought it was a great opening. I thought it was a great thing to \ndo. You get the cases no one else takes. You get people who are at the \nend of their rope. Maybe they have tried to get legal help and they \ncannot get it anywhere else. You are sort of the last hope they have \nfor settling something civilly.\n  I can tell you from my time as a legal services attorney, we had a \nlot of people who got in a lot of trouble simply because they did not \neither know we were there or they could not access the civil legal \nsystem. You have domestic violence. Some people go to jail. Or you have \nchild custody battles that go on.\n  I have had landlord-tenant cases where people are at the end of their \nrope, maybe they have a dispute with the landlord, they cannot get it \nresolved, so they sort of take the law into their own hands and do \nsomething rash.\n  To me, while it is important to encourage young lawyers to get into \ncriminal prosecution, I think it is equally as important for us to \nprovide some help for young lawyers who want to be legal services \nattorneys.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont who has been a strong supporter of our \nlegal services program. I know of his commitment to this. I yield to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I rise in support of the Senator's amendment. If we are \na nation of equal justice under the law, then low-income people must \nhave legal representation. Legal aid does a phenomenally good job. In \nVermont, the wage scale for legal aid workers is embarrassingly low. \nAny young person who graduates law school with the kind of debt we are \ntalking about would find it almost impossible to work at a legal aid \nsalary. We should be supportive of legal aid. I strongly support the \nSenator's amendment, and I thank him for offering it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Check with the American \nBar Association, with the State bar associations; they all support \nlegal services. They know this is one way in which we can provide, as \nthe Senator from Vermont said, access to equal justice under the law. I \ncan remember when I was a legal services attorney in the 1970s, the \ncase files we received. I mean, there were so many. We were there late \nat night. We were actually working weekends on some of these cases. You \nfeel that maybe you are not serving their interest well because you \nhave so many cases and so many case files.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the Senator. I hope we can get good \nsupport on the vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2381 to Amendment No. 2369\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send up a second-degree amendment to \nCoburn amendment No. 2369 to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold, it requires \nunanimous consent to send up a second-degree amendment to that \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to returning to the Coburn\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\namendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2381 to amendment No. 2369.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     114. RESTRICTION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS\n\n       (1) No Federal funds received by an institution of higher \n     education may be used to pay any person for influencing or \n     attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, \n     a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or \n     an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any \n     Federal action described in paragraph (2) of this section.\n       (2) The prohibition in paragraph (1) of this section \n     applies with respect to the following Federal actions:\n       (a) the awarding of any Federal contract;\n       (b) the making of any Federal grant;\n       (c) the making of any Federal loan;\n       (d) the entering into of any cooperative agreement;\n       (e) the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or \n     modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or \n     cooperative agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I don't intend to press this amendment \nthis evening. I have talked to the Senator from Oklahoma. I would hope \nwe would have a chance over the evening to work with him to address the \nsubstantive matter of his amendment. I don't intend that we will have a \nvote on that amendment this evening, but for the benefit of the \nmembership, I wanted to be able to at least file this amendment. I have \ntalked to the Senator from Oklahoma earlier, about 45 minutes ago. We \nhad a good conversation. He was working on some language. But we do \nbelieve that we are probably getting fairly close to a vote on the \nBrown amendment.\n  We wanted to be able to at least indicate to the membership that \nthere may very well be a vote tomorrow. Hopefully, we will have a \nchance to work through the evening and get a chance to work that \namendment out.\n  The reason I offer this amendment is, I agree with the Senator from \nOklahoma that Federal funds should not be used for lobbying. That is \nthe current law. I would support the clarifying language in the law \nthat prevents it. But there are very important reasons for institutions \nto communicate with Members of Congress, and I am afraid this amendment \nwould have the unintended consequence of restricting universities and \ncolleges from advocating for research grants and protections for their \nstudents. It would make it possible for universities to comment on \nFederal regulations of the Department of Education. It may very well \nhave impact regarding communications with Members of Congress whether \nwe ought to increase NIH funding. It would require that universities \nuse private or foundation dollars to share findings with Congress, and \nthis would especially harm small institutions, rural institutions, \nhistorically Black colleges, and other institutions with limited \nresources.\n  I am worried that the Senator's amendment goes too far. It is \nimportant we make very clear that Federal funding should not be used \nfor lobbying, and if we need to do more to ensure that it is enforced, \nI am happy to work with the Senator from Oklahoma to do so. That is \nwhat my second degree amendment does. It is a restatement that no \nFederal funds received by any institution may be used to pay any person \nfor influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee or \nany agency, a Member of Congress.\n  It says:\n\n       No federal student aid funding may be used to hire a \n     registered lobbyist or pay any person or entity for securing \n     an earmark.\n\n  Then it continues: Any person who makes a prohibited expenditure \nshall be subject to a civil penalty of not less and not more than a \nmillion dollars, and the Secretary of Education shall take such actions \nas necessary to ensure these provisions.\n  I would hope as part of an enforcement effort, that we would get a \nstatement or attestation of colleges that they are not using these \nfunds and report back to the Congress if universities are not doing it. \nWe will try to work with the Senator from Oklahoma, but I wanted to at \nleast include that second degree as we work with him through the \nevening.\n  That is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, so tomorrow we will be voting on whatever is \nneeded to be voted on on Coburn, and then we will be voting on Durbin \nand then final passage, but we also have the second-degree amendment \nthat Senator Harkin has offered. Does that preclude anybody from \nputting in more second-degree amendments?\n  I thought we had that whole issue done last week when we dealt with \nloan forgiveness. I think that would have been a more appropriate place \nto deal with loan forgiveness. Now we have some special cases. I doubt \nthat anybody in public service doesn't consider themselves to be a \nspecial case. There are some people who consider themselves to have \nspent a lot of money.\n  I guess people can turn in amendments, second-degree amendments, for \nvirtually any profession they want by tomorrow morning, and we will \nvote on each of those separately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2382\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have the managers' amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the managers' \namendment be dispensed with and the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment (No. 2382) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:40 \ntoday, the Senate--would the Senator want 1 minute? Would that be \nagreeable, 1 minute on each side on the Brown amendment?\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:41 today the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the Brown amendment No. 2376; that no amendments be in \norder to the Brown amendment prior to the vote; and that time in the \nnext 2 minutes be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for support for the Brown amendment. \nWe know in the last 5 years the cost of public education has gone up \nfor a 4-year degree 53 percent. We know the cost of private education \nfor a 4-year degree has gone up 28 percent. We also know that wages \nhave gone up only 3 to 4 percent for the average person during this 5-\nyear period. The Federal Government is not keeping up with helping \nstudents get the opportunity to go to college. We have seen students \nhave no alternative. They have exhausted what they can do with Pell \ngrants. They have exhausted what they can do either through the direct \nloan program or other federally backed programs. The fastest growing \npart of their student loan availability is going to private \ninstitutions with a 16- to 18-percent interest rate. This amendment is \nno cost to the Government. It competes with banks.\n  We reauthorize every 5 to 7 years the Higher Education Act. This is \nan opportunity we should not pass up. The problem is only getting \nworse. I ask for support of the Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as Senator Gregg and I have both explained, \nthis amendment is very problematic. It has not been to a committee. It \nhas not been heard. There has been no vote on it. It creates another \nloan program. It creates a different loan program than any we have ever \ndone because this says the Secretary of Education will set the loan \nrate and the requirements on it. We have never had that kind of a \nsituation.\n  Most problematic, the system of education in this country is \nsuccessful because it is a partnership between the private and public \nsectors. This one moves it all to private. It off-balances the direct \nloan versus the private loan market. We should not be supporting this \namendment. The Secretary is not in a position to make the kind of \ndecisions this calls for. We do have to have a private market. This \nwould eliminate it.\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\n  We also have a previous example of where this kind of loan was used \nback in the 1970s, but that was because the interest rates were about \n21 percent in the regular market, and the Secretary set it at--well, it \nwasn't the Secretary, but the loan rate wound up being set at 9 \npercent. People borrowed it for everything except education.\n  I ask Members to defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2376.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator \nfrom Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), \nand the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Reed) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would ask through the Chair to the \nmanagers, would it be appropriate now to speak on the bill or would \nthey prefer to go ahead with other business that they have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes and that following me, Senator Menendez be allowed to \nspeak for----\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. For about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi and the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee for their work on this bill. I have been around \nawhile, but I have not been in the Senate for very long, and we have \nbeen working on this bill since I came to the Senate, which was 4 years \nago. It needed to be reauthorized some time ago. But similar to some \nother things, it has gotten a little better with age, and it is a very \ngood bill.\n  Although we have been working on this bill for some time, I believe \nit has gotten better over time. It has a number of excellent provisions \nin it. There is one major concern I have which I intend to speak on. \nLet me say what that is at the outset before I begin to talk about what \nI like about the bill. My late friend, Alex Haley, used to say, ``Find \nthe good and praise it,'' and I can do that with this bill, but I do \nhave one concern. My concern is the creeping regulation of higher \neducation.\n  I believe the single most important thing we could do to help improve \nexcellence in higher education in America, which is already pretty \ngood--the best in the world--is to deregulate, not add more federal \nregulations. Unfortunately, with this bill, we significantly add to the \nstack of regulations that college and university presidents all over \nAmerica have to wade through every year in order to accept students who \nreceive Federal grants and loans.\n  Let me talk about some of the good things about this bill. In the \nfirst place, it was an excellent decision to separate this piece of \nlegislation from the work we acted on last week--what we call the \nreconciliation bill. This reauthorizes the Higher Education Act for the \nnext 5 years, and it has separate provisions which deserve separate \nattention. For example, it increases the amount of Pell grants from \n$4,300 to $6,300 over the next 5 years. Pell grants are for the lowest \nincome students. They don't help the middle-income families very much \nbecause the dollars don't get up to that level. Those families are \neligible for other aid from universities and other grants and loans. \nBut $6,300 for a Pell grant is a significant amount of money.\n  For example, if you go to Harvard, it doesn't come close to paying \nthe cost, but if you go to the University of Tennessee, it pays almost \nthe entire tuition for the year. In fact, if you go to the University \nof Tennessee with a Pell grant, you are very likely to show up with \nwhat we call a HOPE scholarship, which also pays for tuition. So you \nwould start off with a HOPE scholarship of--I think the amount is about \n$4,000--plus your $6,300 from the Pell grant, if you needed that \nadditional amount of money. So the Pell grant would be increasing from \nits current level of $4,310 to $6,300. If there are families across the \ncountry who are watching our debate and thinking they can't go to \ncollege, it is important for them to know that the community colleges \nof America cost several hundred dollars a quarter, and that the great \nState universities of America typically cost $5,000 or $6,000 or $7,000 \na year in tuition. Now, that does not include living expenses, but we \nall pay living expenses, whether we are in college or we are not in \ncollege.\n  This decision to move up the Pell grant to $6,300 is a big help. I \nhope it sends a signal across this country to families without means \nthat their son or their daughter may start their higher education, for \nexample, at a community college for 2 years, living at home and paying \na few hundred dollars and letting the Pell grant pay for the total cost \nof the tuition, the total cost of the books. So there will be zero \ncharge for that family for 2 years, and then after 2 more years, go on \nto a State University, where the tuition might not be very much more \nthan the Pell grant. In addition, the Pell grants will be even larger \nfor students who are majoring in math, science, critical foreign \nlanguages, and thereby encouraging students to pursue those fields.\n  This Congress is taking a number of steps to try to refocus our \ncountry's attention on our brain power advantage, to make sure we keep \nthat so we can keep our good jobs from going overseas. Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Enzi and Senator Frist last year changed the law and \ncreated the SMART grants to focus on our competitiveness, and the \nincrease to the Pell grants do that significantly more in this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, this legislation, in an overdue way, recognizes the \nimportance of a year-round Pell grant. Many people still have in their \nmind the idea of the traditional college student on the traditional \ncampus. That life has changed. Many of the students who take Pell \ngrants have to work. They are older. They may be moms going back to \nschool to get the training to get a better job or a dad doing the same, \nand they may not have time to take the summer off, or that might not \nfit their schedule. The way the law has been, they couldn't get the \nPell grant, if there were, say, three quarters, they could only get it \nfor two. This says that--and Senator Clinton, I congratulate her for \nworking on this as well. A number of Senators have worked on\n\n[[Page S9761]]\n\nmaking the Pell grant a year-round opportunity.\n  I am also delighted about legislation I introduced, again with \nSenator Clinton, to expand Teach For America. Teach For America \nattracts some of the brightest young men and women in our country who \nhave a passion for serving. There are many ways to serve our country. \nSome of our most valued are in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others are in the \ninner city helping children who haven't had a chance to learn to read, \nto learn to compute, and learn to have a chance in this country. As \nLyndon Johnson used to say, we want people to be equal at the starting \nline, but we need to help some people get to that starting line, and \nthrough Teach For America, young men and women can do just that. This \nwill build a corps of young college graduates who will spend 2 years in \nthose schools, and it will expand the group of influential alumni of \nTeach For America who care about our public schools.\n  I actually think that what may end up being more important about \nTeach For America than their service for 2 years in the inner city \nschools is that we will expand these young men and women who will grow \nto be the leaders of this country in a relatively short period of time. \nThen they will always have within their personal missions the idea of \ngiving every student an opportunity to go to a first-class public \nschool. Having a corps of Americans who value education and who value \npublic schools, especially, will do our country more good than almost \nanything I can think of.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have the best colleges and universities \nin the world. We don't just have some of them, we have almost all of \nthem. They have their problems, but we should recognize the asset that \nthey are. One of my primary goals as a Senator is to relieve the \nburdensome, oppressive paperwork that the Federal Government places \nupon our colleges and universities, freeing up scarce dollars to spend \non improving quality teaching and research rather than paperwork.\n  The higher education system--and I want to be careful saying this \nbecause I don't want to drive anyone away from this idea--is a \nRepublican's dream, a conservative's dream. We have 6,000 autonomous \ninstitutions. Some are public, some are private. Some are religious, \nsome are secular. Some are historically Black, some are Native \nAmerican, some are Jewish. Some are in cities. There is Harvard and \nthere is the Nashville Auto Diesel College. There are 6,000 autonomous \ninstitutions that compete. We don't give money directly to those \ninstitutions, for the most part. We give the money to the students, and \nstudents take those vouchers--one-half of America's college students \nattend our autonomous institutions with a Federal grant or loan that \nhelps them to pay for college, and they are flat out vouchers.\n  I have introduced several times a Pell grant for kids, saying that is \nwhat a voucher is for K-12, but we will reserve that discussion for \nanother day.\n  Since World War II, quite by accident, we have said to the world: \nHere is the way we organize our education. It is a marketplace of 6,000 \ninstitutions, where (1) colleges compete for students, (2) Government \nmoney follows those students to the institution of their choice, and \n(3) the Federal research money is, for the most part, competed for in \npeer-reviewed efforts. The rest of the world is scrambling to catch up \nwith our system.\n  In China, they are deregulating. In France, they are deregulating and \ncreating a more competitive system and trying to emulate the model that \nwe have.\n  So what concerns me about our Government's attitude toward higher \neducation is the number of forms each institution has to fill out. I \nhave a stack of forms this tall in my office. I didn't bring it here to \nthe Senate floor. Every institution has to fill that out in order to \naccept students who bring with them Federal grants or loans, which are \nalmost all of the students. That means the small church-related schools \nhave to hire somebody else. They have to go through all that. The \nPresident of Stanford--not a small, church-related school--said 7 out \nof 10 cents of every tax dollar is spent on complying with Government \nregulations.\n  Would it not be better if we allowed Stanford and the small schools \nand the Nashville Auto Diesel College, as well as Harvard, to use more \nof their money to help students and less to comply with paperwork?\n  With passage of this bill, we will require the Advisory Committee on \nStudent Financial Aid to review regulations imposed under the act and \nreport to the Secretary and Congress ways to reduce regulation, \nstreamline procedures, and simplify for the benefit of students. That \nwill be one small force moving in the right direction.\n  It would create a discretionary grant program for an institution of \nhigher education to maintain a Web site that keeps track of Federal \nregulations that have an impact on institutions of higher education. A \nsmall, church-related college might only have to hire a person who \nspends half of his or her time keeping up with the rules and \nregulations because the Web site might have done it for them.\n  We require the Secretary to develop an annual compliance calendar for \ndisclosures required by the Higher Education Act.\n  These provisions might seem not very important, but I can guarantee \nyou, as a former president of a university, they can make a lot of \ndifference. I would like very much to have spread out before me a \ncalendar from the Government that said we have listed all of the rules \nand regulations and forms and papers that you have to file. That would \nmean I knew what it was and that would save me a lot of time in \nfiguring it out.\n  Despite that good news, I am afraid there are, nevertheless, problems \nin this bill. Currently there are 24 reporting categories and 74 \nreporting requirements with hundreds of data points. That is today, \nbefore this bill passes. My staff has identified 26 new categories and \nover 100 new reporting requirements imposed on higher education with \nthis law, and that is even before the department starts its \nregulations.\n  So I hope we can figure out a way to create competitive forces in \nfavor of deregulation. It is as bad on our side of the aisle as it is \non that side of the aisle. Very often, my Republican friends say, for \nexample, prices at colleges have gone up, so let's put on price \ncontrols.\n  When the pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts, they said we know what \nreligious oppression is, so let's practice it ourselves. We are \nsupposed to be for markets and choice and less Federal regulation. So \nlet's apply that to Federal higher education.\n  I have worked on a number of provisions in the bill, and I thank \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi for permitting me to do that, working with \nothers, including Senators Gregg and Reed, and I have worked on \nprovisions that have been included that simplify the application form \nfor students who apply for grants or loans.\n  As I mentioned, I worked with Senator Clinton to help allow students \nwho have Pell grants to use them year-round so they can finish earlier \nand get back to work and back with their families, rather than the \nantiquated requirement that they may only use them part of the year. I \nmentioned the compliance calendar to make it simpler for colleges, and \nthe Teach for America plan, which Senators Harkin and Reid and others \nhave cosponsored.\n  There is an accountability research grant and a state data system \npilot project. I thank Secretary Spellings for agreeing with these. As \na result of her study of higher education, which pointed out a number \nof important things, we do have a fine system of higher education, but \nit needs to be challenged if we are going to keep our advantage. I felt \nthat the Secretary, in her recommendations, was going too far in \nfederalizing higher education, whether it be transfer of credit \nprovisions, or whether it might be proposals mandated from Washington \nabout student accountability. I thought that was a good goal but the \nwrong way to go about it.\n  So Secretary Spellings has agreed to step back and focus instead on \nchallenging our State boards of education and our college boards of \ntrustees and our university presidents and our Governors and \nlegislators to do their own on accountability. We are not going to kick \nit to Washington, DC, and let us conduct oversight of how they are \ndoing their jobs, rather than to try to\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\nimpose more of the one-size or a few-sizes-fit-all ideas from \nWashington. A part of doing that would be these new grants from the \nDepartment.\n  In this bill, we have provided grants from the Secretary to create \nnew measures for assessing student achievement in higher education. \nThere is a difference in the Harvard classics department and the \nNashville Auto Diesel College. I mention that because Harvard classics \nmight be the best department for classics. I know the Nashville Auto \nDiesel College is the best training for mechanics. There is no need for \nus to figure out what is the appropriate accountability at those \ninstitutions.\n  With great respect to the chair and Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the \nDepartment of Education, the institutions of higher education know more \nabout accountability in higher education. We ought to make sure they \nare doing their job, not try and do it for them from here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a consent agreement?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe I have time remaining. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remaining time be given to the Senator from New Jersey--I \nbelieve I have 5 minutes left--and I ask that he be given an additional \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is yielded back.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Wyoming. Another example of what I would call the \npropensity to federalize education is to regulate the transfer of \ncredit policy that individual institutions have. If we are going to \nhave a marketplace, and if students are going to have choice, then it \nis the job of the students to find out from the colleges and \nuniversities what their rules are. Otherwise, we go to a European \nsystem or a Chinese system, or a system like our K-12 system where we, \nknowing all, tell everybody what to do, what the transfer of credit \npolicies might be.\n  So I strongly resist saying that the Federal Government ought not to \nhave anything to say about whether the Nashville Auto Diesel College \nought to be required to accept a transfer of credit from the Harvard \nclassics department. I am not sure that a graduate or student in \nHarvard classics would know anything about a Nissan engine in \nNashville, and vice versa. I am pretty sure we don't need to interfere \nwith that, particularly if so much of the excellence in our system \ncomes from this competition, and these autonomous institutions and this \nmarketplace that allows students, followed by Government money, to \nchoose and allows researchers to compete to see who deserves the money.\n  So my hope is that as time goes on we can have a serious discussion \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and in the \nEducation and Labor Committee in the House about deregulation of higher \neducation. We all have good ideas about what to do. Some will be voted \non as amendments tomorrow. If we all impose our good ideas from here, \nthen they add up to another stack like this, and our higher education \nsystem begins to be smothered.\n  I have had the privilege of working at several levels in higher \neducation. When I was president of the University of Tennessee, I had a \nlot of oversight. The Governor was chairman of the board. The \nlegislature approved the largest share of money that I received. I had \na board of trustees to which I had to respond. There was a faculty \ncouncil to which I paid a lot of attention. In terms of student \naccountability, the professors graded students on a regular basis. The \ndean graded the professors. The trustees, the president, the provost, \nthe Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the Governor, and the \nlegislature all had their say. There is plenty of supervision of higher \neducation based on my experience. So we need to be careful. We have \nbeen wise since World War II with our loans and grants that half of \nAmericans use to go to college to say here is the money.\n  If the college is accredited, a student can take their choice. You \nmay go to Notre Dame or to the community college down the street. You \nmay go to the University of Tennessee or to Rhode Island. That is your \nchoice, as long as it is accredited. Of course, some mistakes are made. \nI am sure that at the fringes some colleges are teaching goofy courses. \nSome schools are better than others.\n  Overall, we don't have any enterprise in America that today has \nconsistently outperformed the rest of the world as well as our system \nof higher education--not our automobile business, not our aluminum \nbusiness, and not our K-12 system. Even the Senate rarely raises above \nthe level of the Baghdad Parliament when it comes to getting consensus \non the war in Iraq. But the system of higher education, with all its \nsometimes stuffiness and its disagreeable political correctness, and \neven with the lengthy vacations and even with more tenure than probably \nis deserved, as a whole, is by far the finest in the world; and more \nregulation, as a whole, will make it worse, not more excellent.\n  There is one other provision I want to mention. I am glad the \ncommittee included this. It is a statement about the protection of free \nspeech.\n  Willie Morris, who wrote the ``North Toward Home'' about his days in \nMississippi and the University of Texas and New York, wrote an eloquent \nstatement about how the American Association of University Presidents \nrose up about the political correctness at the time he was a student. \nThat was in the 1950s--I guess early 1960s. At that time, the political \ncorrectness in part of Texas, or all of Texas, was segregationist, very \nconservative, and oppressive to those who had different points of view.\n  Today, the shoe is often on the other foot. Some deny that, but we \nknow that is true. There are not many conservative speakers at college \ngraduation ceremonies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Often legitimate speakers with different points of \nview are booed and not welcomed in the academic environment.\n  I testified about this situation before Secretary Spellings' \ncommittee on higher education. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record following my remarks my testimony in Nashville last year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I hope my friends in the university \ncommunity will see in me someone who values higher education, who \ndefends the importance of it in our society, who is working hard to \nkeep our brainpower advantage in the world marketplace, who supports \nfunding it generously, but who also believes that the greatest \nAchilles' heel of our system of higher education today is political \ncorrectness and a failure to take it seriously.\n  Colleges and universities are places where people ought to be allowed \nto say even outrageous things from the right and from the left. It is \nnot a free and academic environment if you are only allowed to say \noutrageous things from the left.\n  Without belaboring that point, I conclude my remarks by expressing my \nappreciation once more to Senators Kennedy and Enzi. This is a first-\nrate bill. It will help students. It will help our country. It has a \ngreat many good ideas in it, and I hope there are others in this body \nand in the House of Representatives who will join me in recognizing \nthat along with political correctness, the greatest threat to quality \nof higher education, in my view, is overregulation by the Federal \nGovernment, and perhaps over time we can find some sensible ways to \ngive it a little more freedom from this big stack of regulations that \npiled up over the years.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Remarks of Senator Alexander to Commission on the Future of Higher \n                    Education, Nashville, Tennessee\n\n       Thank you for the time you are giving to this Commission's \n     work, and thank you for inviting me to testify.\n       I've seen higher education from many sides, so I'm \n     sometimes asked, ``What's harder: being governor of a State, \n     a member of a president's cabinet, or president of a \n     university?''\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\n       My answer is, ``Obviously, you've never been president of a \n     university, or you wouldn't ask such a question.''\n       I have six suggestions for recommendations you might make:\n       First, I hope you will urge the Administration that \n     appointed you to make the National Academies' ``Augustine \n     Report'' a focus of the President's State of the Union \n     address in January and of his remaining three years in \n     office.\n       This 20-point, $10 billion a year report is the National \n     Academies' answer to the following question that Senator Pete \n     Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman and I posed to them in May: \n     ``What are the ten top actions, in priority order, that \n     federal policy makers could take to enhance the science and \n     technology enterprise so the United States can successfully \n     compete, prosper and be secure in the global community of the \n     21st century?'' The report was written by a distinguished \n     panel of business, government and university leaders headed \n     by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin.\n       As 2005 ends, we Americans--who constitute just five \n     percent of the world's population--will once again produce \n     nearly thirty percent of the world's wealth.\n       Most of this good fortune comes from the American advantage \n     in brainpower: an educated workforce and our science and \n     technology. More Americans go to college than in any other \n     country. Our universities are the world's best, attracting \n     more than 500,000 of the brightest foreign students. No \n     country has national research laboratories to match ours. \n     Americans have won the most Nobel Prizes in science, and have \n     registered the most patents. We have invented the Internet, \n     the automobile and the computer chip, television and \n     electricity. From such advances have come a steady flow of \n     the world's best paying jobs.\n       As one scientist has said, we don't have science and \n     technology because we're rich. We're rich because we have \n     science and technology.\n       Yet I am worried that America may be losing its brainpower \n     advantage. Most Americans who travel to China, India, \n     Finland, Singapore and Ireland come home saying, ``Watch \n     out.''\n       The Augustine panel found I am right to be worried:\n       Last year, China trained 500,000 engineers, India 200,000, \n     while the U.S. trained 70,000.\n       For the cost of one chemist or engineer in the U.S., a \n     company can hire five chemists in China or 11 engineers in \n     India.\n       China is spending billions to recruit the best Chinese \n     scientists from American universities to return home to build \n     up Chinese universities.\n       They also found signs that we are not keeping up:\n       U.S. 12th graders performed below the international average \n     of 21 leading countries on tests of general knowledge in \n     math.\n       In 2003, only three American companies ranked among the top \n     10 recipients of new U.S. patents.\n       Of 120 new chemical plants being built around the world \n     with price tags of $1 billion dollars or more, one is in the \n     U.S. and 50 are in China.\n       Among the Augustine Report's 20 recommendations were:\n       Recruit 10,000 new science and math teachers with 4-year \n     scholarships and train 250,000 current teachers in summer \n     institutes.\n       Triple the number of students who take Advanced Placement \n     math and science exams.\n       Increase Federal funding for basic research in the physical \n     sciences by 10 percent a year for 7 years.\n       Provide 30,000 scholarships and graduate fellowships for \n     scientists.\n       Give foreign students who earn a PhD in science, \n     engineering and computing a ``green card'' so they can live \n     and work here.\n       Give American companies a bigger research and development \n     tax credit so they will keep their good jobs here instead of \n     moving them offshore.\n       Some may wince at the $10 billion a year price tag. I \n     believe that the cost is low. America's brainpower advantage \n     has not come on the cheap. This year, one-third of State and \n     local budgets go to fund education. Over 50 percent of \n     American students have a Federal grant or loan to help pay \n     for college. The Federal government spends nearly $30 billion \n     per year this year on research at universities and another \n     $34 billion to fund 36 national research laboratories.\n       Just this year, Congress has authorized $75 billion to \n     fight the war in Iraq, $71 billion for hurricane recovery, \n     $13 billion in increased Medicaid spending and $352 billion \n     to finance the National debt. If we fail to invest the funds \n     necessary to keep our brainpower advantage, we'll not have an \n     economy capable of producing enough money to pay the bills \n     for war, Social Security, hurricanes, Medicaid and debt.\n       Aside from the war on terror, there is no greater challenge \n     than maintaining our brainpower advantage so we can keep our \n     good paying jobs. That is the surest way to keep America on \n     top.\n       I have attached an executive summary of the Augustine \n     Report to my comments.\n       Second, I suggest that you recommend that presidents of the \n     United States appoint a lead adviser to coordinate all of the \n     Federal government responsibilities for higher education.\n       My greatest regret as U.S. Education Secretary was that I \n     did not volunteer to be that lead person. Secretary \n     Spellings, with the appointment of this commission, has \n     assumed at least some of that responsibility. But the \n     authority of the Secretary of Education over higher education \n     is somewhat like the authority of the U.S. Senate majority \n     leader or a university president: overestimated. Almost every \n     agency of the federal government has something to do with \n     higher education, tens of billions of taxpayer dollars are \n     invested every year and someone should be looking at all \n     of this in a coordinated way.\n       Third, I urge you to join me on the bandwagon for \n     deregulation of higher education.\n       The greatest threat to the quality of American higher \n     education is not underfunding. It is overregulation. The key \n     to the quality of our higher education system is that it is \n     NOT a system. It is a marketplace of 6,000 autonomous \n     institutions. Yet, thanks largely to the last two rounds of \n     the Federal Higher Education Act, each one of our 6,000 \n     higher education institutions that accepts students with \n     Federal grants and loans must wade through over 7,000 \n     regulations and notices. The president of Stanford has said \n     that seven cents of every tuition dollar is spent on \n     compliance with governmental regulations.\n       I have attached to my testimony remarks I made to the U.S. \n     Senate in June when I introduced the Higher Education \n     Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005, much of which \n     was incorporated in the Higher Education Act reauthorization \n     bill this year.\n       Fourth, I urge the Congress to overhaul the Medicaid \n     program and free states from outdated federal court consent \n     decrees so that states may properly fund colleges and \n     universities.\n       You have two charts before you that tell the story. \n     Nationally, during the five year period from 2000 to 2004, \n     State spending for Medicaid was up 36 percent, while State \n     spending for higher education was up only 6.8 percent. As one \n     result, tuition was up 38 percent.\n       The story in Tennessee was worse. Medicaid spending was up \n     71 percent, while higher education was up only 10.5 percent, \n     and tuition was up 43 percent.\n       By the way, during this same four year period, Federal \n     spending for higher education was up 71 percent.\n       When I left the governor's office in 1987, Tennessee was \n     spending 51 cents of each State tax dollar on education and \n     16 cents on health care, mainly Medicaid. Today it is 40 \n     cents on education and 26 cents on health care, mainly \n     Medicaid.\n       To give governors and legislatures the proper authority to \n     allocate resources, Congress should give States more \n     authority over Medicaid standards and more ability to \n     terminate outdated Federal court consent decrees that remove \n     decision-making authority from elected officials.\n       In addition to the two charts on spending trends, I have \n     attached my remarks when Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas and I \n     introduced the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act.\n       Fifth, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest \n     disappointment in higher education today: colleges of \n     education. ``At a time when America 's schools face a \n     critical demand for effective principals and superintendents, \n     the majority of programs that prepare school leaders range in \n     quality from inadequate to poor.'' Those are not my words, \n     but those of a new report by Arthur Levine, the president of \n     Teachers College, Columbia University. Or ask Richard Light, \n     the Harvard professor, who is working with university \n     presidents trying to find and inspire a new generation of \n     leaders for our colleges of education. Sometimes colleges of \n     education are even roadblocks to the very reforms they ought \n     to be championing. In 1983, when I asked colleges of \n     education to help me find a fair way to pay teachers more \n     for teaching well (which not one State was doing at the \n     time), they said it couldn't be done. So we invented our \n     own system for thousands of teachers, with virtually no \n     help from the very people who are in business to figure \n     out such things. And still today, despite the good work of \n     Governor Hunt and others, the lack of differential pay is \n     the major obstacle to quality teaching.\n       I have attached an executive summary of Dr. Levine's \n     report, ``Educating School Leaders.''\n       Finally, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest \n     threat to broader public support and funding for higher \n     education: the growing political one-sidedness which has \n     infected most campuses, and an absence of true diversity of \n     opinion.\n       To describe this phenomenon, allow me to borrow some words \n     from the past, which may sound familiar to your chairman, \n     Charles Miller, who was once Chairman of the Board of Regents \n     of the University of Texas: ``systematic, persistent and \n     continuous attempts by a politically dominant group to impose \n     its social and educational views on the university.'' This \n     was what the American Association of University Professors \n     (AAUP) called it in its censure of Texas Governor Pappy \n     O'Daniel's Board of Regents when the Board fired University \n     of Texas President Homer Rainey in the 1940s. This is \n     reported in Willie Morris' book, ``North Toward Home.'' Then \n     the AAUP was talking about one-sidedness imposed by the \n     right, instead of by the left--but political one-sidedness is \n     political one-sidedness, no matter from what direction it \n     comes.\n       There is more to this charge of one-sidedness than the \n     academic community would like to admit. How many conservative \n     speakers are invited to deliver commencement addresses? How \n     many colleges require courses\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\n     in U.S. history? How many even teach Western Civilization? \n     How many bright, young faculty members are encouraged to earn \n     dissertations in the failures of bilingual education or on \n     the virtues of vouchers or charter schools?\n       I am not surprised that most faculties express liberal \n     views, vote Democratic and that most faculty members resist \n     authority. That is the nature of most university communities. \n     But I am disappointed when true diversity of thought is \n     discouraged in the name of a preferred brand of diversity. \n     This one-sidedness is not good for students. It is not good \n     for the pursuit of truth. And it undermines broad public \n     support for higher education. The solution to this political \n     rigidity lies not in Washington, D.C., but in the hands of \n     trustees, deans and faculty members themselves.\n       Last year Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas invited \n     former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to join \n     a small group of U.S. senators in the majority leader's \n     office for a discussion. Dr. Cardoso was completing a \n     residency at the Library of Congress.\n       ``What memory of the United States will you take back to \n     your country?'' Senator Hutchison asked Dr. Cardoso.\n       ``The American university,'' he replied immediately. ``The \n     uniqueness, strength and autonomy of the American university. \n     There is nothing like it in the world.''\n       I salute Secretary Spellings and this Commission for \n     undertaking to preserve and improve higher education, \n     America's secret weapon for its future success.\n       In coming to your conclusions, I hope that you will urge \n     the President to adopt the Augustine Report and to designate \n     a lead advisor for higher education, that you will jump on \n     the bandwagon to deregulate higher education and preserve its \n     autonomy, that you will urge Congress to overhaul Medicaid \n     and Federal court consent decrees so States can properly fund \n     higher education, and that you will urge trustees to revamp \n     colleges of education and ensure a campus environment that \n     honors true diversity of opinion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I also rise in strong support of the \nhigher education reauthorization bill before the Senate today.\n  I first thank my colleague, the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, a true champion for education in our \ncountry. Senator Kennedy's vision for higher education will help make \nsure college is more accessible and affordable to all our young people \nregardless of their race, their class, or their income. It is because \nof the vision of Senator Kennedy, of Senator Pell before, and others \nthat the doors to college have been opened to millions of Americans who \notherwise would not have had access to that American dream.\n  I appreciate Senator Enzi's leadership as well in bringing and moving \nthis bill on the floor. I salute him for all of his work, both on the \nbill we had last week and now the bill we have today. It is a \ntremendous testament of what we can do when we join in a common cause.\n  As someone whose dreams of college could not have been realized \nwithout the power of the Pell grant and without other Federal aid, I am \nproud to be able to support legislation that will open the doors for \nthe next generation of students in this country. Without the critical \nassistance I received, I would never have been able to be the first in \nmy family to graduate from college, then later from law school, and I \ncertainly wouldn't be speaking here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The bill before us takes great steps toward improving and leveling \nthe playing field for all students so that more students are able to \naccess and afford a higher education. Today, all students do not have \nan equal chance to attend college. As an example, Latinos and African \nAmericans are less likely to be able to afford college and, therefore, \nmore likely to qualify for Federal financial aid. Latinos and African \nAmericans are 40 to 60 percent less likely to earn a bachelor's degree \nin their lifetime than other students. By also expanding Federal aid \nopportunities for minorities, the bill will help improve those numbers \nand close the gap in higher education.\n  My own story of growing up poor yet having the opportunity to fulfill \nmy dream of attending college because of Federal aid is still true as a \nchallenge for so many of our young people today, and it will continue \nto be for the young people of tomorrow.\n  The changes in this bill come at a critical time. It is projected \nthat by the year 2015, 8 short years from now, college enrollment of \nAfrican-American students will increase by 23 percent, and for Latinos \nthat number will increase by a whopping 73 percent. Moreover, 75 \npercent of undergraduate students are nontraditional students, meaning \nthey either are attending part time and working full time, non-high \nschool graduates, or have dependents, among other characteristics. The \nstudent populations of our Nation's colleges will increasingly reflect \nthe changing landscape of our country. So this bill is going to help \nall of our students.\n  More and more of our students will not be the sons and daughters of \nprevious college graduates. The student of tomorrow will be a mother \nwho juggles a full-time job and attends community college part time at \nnight so she can gain skills that will lead to a better job and provide \nher children economic security.\n  The student of tomorrow will be a naturalized U.S. citizen who, with \nthe help of Federal aid, can fulfill his dream of becoming an engineer \nwho can give back to this country by helping build new infrastructure.\n  The student of tomorrow will be a foster child who is able to attend \ncollege with Federal aid and fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse so \nshe can not only live a stable life but give back to a system that \nsaved hers.\n  The student of tomorrow will be a bright high school student who \nworks part time through college and despite his family's low income can \nattend the college of his choice because of Pell and Perkins.\n  These are the students who will help define the students of our \nNation--the first-generation students breaking through new barriers, \nthe parents working to improve life for their children, the naturalized \ncitizen building a better life in this country. They will each be \ncharting their own path, able to realize their dreams because of the \nopportunity only a college education can provide.\n  How well educated they are will not just determine how successful \nthey are in the workforce but how successful our Nation is in the \nglobal economy. As a nation, I am convinced that the single greatest \nasset we will have in this global economy is our collective intellect. \nTo be a leader globally, we will have to be at the apex of the curve of \nintellect. That means the most highly educated generation this Nation \nhas ever known. To get there, our education pipeline must be accessible \nand affordable to a great cross-section of young people.\n  However, rising costs, combined with far too stagnant growth in \nfamily income and declining Federal aid, have effectively priced out \nmany students. Even with student loans and work study, today's students \nhave thousands in unmet financial need they often cannot afford to pay. \nAs a nation, we simply cannot afford to have our students priced out of \na college education. Our Nation's future depends on it.\n  The legislation before us will make key changes to help ensure the \ndoors to college remain open to all, not just those who can afford it \nout of pocket. This bill realizes that improving access to college does \nnot just mean increasing funding. Improving access to college means \ncurbing rising tuition costs so that young people will be able to \nbetter afford a higher education. This bill will hold colleges \naccountable for rising tuition costs by making tuition data public and \navailable so students and their families can compare costs. By \npublicizing costs to prospective families, colleges will need to \njustify tuition increases that far exceed those of comparable \ninstitutions.\n  Improving access to college means reforming the student loan system \nso students get loans that are fair, not loans that wash them away in \ndebt. Outrageous loan debt is forcing borrowers to delay either buying \na home in the future or taking the dream job of their choice after \ncollege simply because it will not pay enough. This bill reverses this \ntroubling trend by not only expanding Federal aid but ensuring students \nare getting the best possible deal when they take out a loan.\n  Improving access to college also means starting at the first step--\nfilling out the forms. As someone who had to fill out the FAFSA form by \nmyself, it was pretty daunting. For any student facing this process on \ntheir own or for families with income, language, or other barriers, the \nfinancial aid process itself can be overwhelming. By reducing the FAFSA \nfrom 10 pages to 2\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\npages, we make it easier for students to accomplish the very first step \nnecessary to get financial aid.\n  By improving access to college, it also means helping students get on \nthe right path early by strengthening and expanding programs such as \nGEAR UP and TRIO, by promoting quality teacher preparation programs, \nand helping high-needs public schools recruit and retain high-quality \nteachers. This bill takes low-income and first-generation students \ncloser to their dreams of college.\n  We also need to expand access beyond the undergraduate realm. I am \nparticularly pleased that this bill expands funding for minority-\nserving institutions and specifically supports the creation of graduate \nprograms at Hispanic-serving institutions, a proposal I have supported \nfor a long time. Latinos currently make up less than 6 percent of \ngraduate students, and by expanding opportunities at Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions which enroll more than 50 percent of all Latino students \nin this country, this expansion is an important step to ensuring the \nNation's graduate and doctorate students reflect the diversity of our \nNation.\n  Ensuring our students are prepared to be the next generation of \ninnovators, business owners, and leaders requires a serious commitment \nto making college affordable and accessible. This means making \neducation work for all students. That is why we must take the steps to \nincrease critical grant aid and strengthen key programs to help open \nthe doors to college for all our young people. We must ensure our young \npeople are getting the best possible deal when they apply to college \nand that every student who is willing to work hard has the opportunity \nto graduate from college.\n  I believe that in this Nation in which this challenge for us globally \nis so significant, in which an engineer's report is created in India \nand transmitted back to the United States for a fraction of the cost, \nin which a radiologist's report is done in Pakistan and sent to your \nlocal hospital, read by your local doctor, if you have a problem with a \ncredit card, as I recently did, you may end up in a call center in \nSouth Africa, in the pursuit of human capital for the creation of a \nproduct for the delivery of a service; we are globally challenged. That \nis why this ability to have a generation that has the greatest \neducational achievement is so important to the Nation's competitive \nfuture.\n  I want to make sure that the opportunity I had as someone who had \nchallenges is an opportunity that can be met by every student who is \nwilling to work hard, has the ability, and gives something back to \ntheir country. This bill is going to make that happen. I think this \nbill takes us significantly in the right direction. I hope it will have \nincredibly robust support when its final passage comes up for a vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  As the reauthorization process continues, I want to highlight the \nimportance of Hispanic serving institutions, and the role they play in \neducating our young people.\n  Hispanics should have equal opportunities to receive a first-class \neducation, acquire the great jobs available in America, and pursue \ncareers in any field they desire whether it's in medicine, law, \nbusiness, education, or any other area.\n  According to the Census Bureau, Hispanics account for 1 out of every \n2 people who are added to the Nation's population, and the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor estimates that 1 out of every 3 new entrants into \nthe job market is Hispanic.\n  The percentage of Hispanic students attending college has also \nincreased significantly over the past few years. Because the pace of \nbachelor's degrees earned by Hispanics is accelerating rapidly, we must \nkeep pace by increasing the capacity of our institutions of higher \neducation to serve these students.\n  Our Hispanic serving institutions are able to do this.\n  HSIs continue to grow in stature and importance. They are home to \nmore than half of all Hispanic college students, and are often the only \nviable opportunity for individuals of modest economic backgrounds to \nattend college.\n  I applaud HSIs for their vast contributions in providing quality \neducational opportunities to all Hispanic and non-Hispanic students who \nattend their institutions, and I remain committed to opening the doors \nof higher education to all Americans and keeping our country \ncompetitive in the global marketplace.\n  I have been proud to serve as cochair of the HSI Coalition with my \ncolleague Senator Bingaman of New Mexico. The success we have had over \nthe past 11 years has us headed in the right direction.\n  From 1995-2006, we have helped increase Federal funding for HSIs from \n$12 million to $95.8 million.\n  The Third Higher Education Extension Act of 2006 removed two barriers \nharmful to Hispanics and HSIs. It eliminated the 2-year wait-out period \nbetween HSI grant funding cycles, as well as the requirement that 50 \npercent of the Hispanic student population must be low-income for the \nschool to qualify for HSI eligibility. This allows HSIs to gain funding \nwithout costly gathering and reporting of individual Hispanic-student \nincome documentation, which was often impossible for universities to \nobtain.\n  Despite the positive increases in college student matriculation, \noverall, too few Hispanic-Americans graduate from high school or \ncollege. If we fail to properly educate one-half of America's future \nworkforce, there will be disastrous economic and social consequences \nfor the entire nation.\n  As we debate the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I want \nto make sure that our federally-designated HSIs are not left behind.\n  I have ensured that the language of the Next Generation Hispanic \nServing Institutions Act is included in the Higher Education Act. I am \nan original cosponsor of this legislation, which I introduced with \nSenator Bingaman on February 13, 2007.\n  This bill provides fellowships and support services for graduates, as \nwell as facility and faculty improvements at HSIs. It provides new \ntechnology for distance education and collaborative arrangements with \nother institutions.\n  In addition, the legislation increases the authorization of the \ncurrent HSI program to $175 million and authorizes $125 million for the \nnew HSIs graduate program for fiscal year 2008.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nhigher education amendments before the Senate. This bill works toward \none of the most important responsibilities elected representatives \nshoulder: opening the doors of educational opportunity for each \nAmerican child and every American family.\n  Last week, the Senate took a critical step toward making college more \naffordable by passing the Higher Education Access Act, legislation that \nincreases Pell grants, caps student loan repayments, and provides loan \nforgiveness for those who enter and stick with careers in public \nservice.\n  But we must actually control college costs if we hope to make \npermanent progress on college affordability. The legislation now before \nthe Senate would not only allow the Secretary of Education to highlight \nthose colleges and universities whose tuition increases are out of line \nwith their peers, it would allow the Secretary to study what factors \nare driving soaring higher education costs in this country and identify \nwhat measures could be utilized to bring them under control.\n  Even with this effort and the important measures passed last week, \nmost students and their families in Maryland and around the Nation will \nstill have to borrow money to make their college dream a reality.\n  Today, that means completing lengthy and confusing Federal and \nschool-based student aid applications. Once those applications are \nsubmitted, families must decipher various colleges' price estimates and \nvarious banks' descriptions of loan terms and conditions. Financial \naward letters often contain inconsistent definitions and formats to \ndescribe the cost of attendance, the financial aid offered, and the \ncosts associated with various types of loans. Too many banks provide \ninadequate information about their rates and terms. As a result, \nfamilies are unable to shop around for the financial\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\naid package or best loan rates and are ill-prepared for post-graduation \nmonthly payments. Jim Guest, president of the Consumers Union, has said \nthat ``[f]inancing a house or car can be confusing, but it's nothing \ncompared with trying to pay for a college education.''\n  In the face of such confusion, many students and their families turn \nto financial aid officers to guide their choices. But throughout this \nyear, thanks to the New York Attorney General and my distinguished \ncolleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, we have learned that some financial aid officers, including, \nunfortunately, some from Maryland, were not giving families honest \nadvice. Some financial aid offices were receiving expensive gifts, \ntravel and other kickbacks from lenders and in return recommended those \nlenders to students, even if the product was not in the students' best \ninterest.\n  This important legislation takes critical steps to reform the entire \nstudent loan system so that students and their families will receive \ntimely, accessible, and reliable information and can make wise college \nfinancing decisions.\n  First and foremost, the legislation would simplify the financial aid \nprocess for all students and their families.\n  The bill reforms the Federal financial aid application. The Free \nApplication for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, is currently 10 long pages \nfull of complex questions. Its length and complexity create an \nunnecessary obstacle for low- and middle-income students seeking the \naid they need to attend college. The higher education amendments \nsimplify the FAFSA by creating a new two-page EZ-FAFSA for low-income \nstudents, and phasing out the current seven-page FAFSA for all \napplicants within 5 years.\n  Further, the bill creates a pilot program that allows students to \nreceive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high \nschool. Rather than making complicated decisions in a frenzy of paper \nand options, the bill facilitates student planning, giving families \ntime to investigate their financing options.\n  This critical bill makes sure that those options are easier to \nunderstand. The bill requires the Secretary of Education work with \ncolleges and universities to develop several model price calculators \nthat would give students an institution's actual net price. With these \nbottom-line prices in hand--in clear and consistent terms--families \nwill be better equipped to make the right college and financing \nchoices.\n  Plus, the bill requires lenders clearly disclose the terms of their \nloans and again asks the Secretary of Education to develop a consumer-\nfriendly format so that families receive information in a consistent \nand accessible way.\n  But critically important, the bill protects students by ensuring \ncolleges recommend lenders based on students--not banks' or financial \naid officers'--best interest.\n  The bill requires that colleges adopt and enforce a code of conduct \nthat prohibits the college or any of its employees from accepting any \nsignificant gifts, trips, services, or other benefits from lenders, \nperiod. If a college chooses to select a ``preferred lender,'' it must \nprovide the Secretary of Education and the public a clear report \nexplaining why the preferred products are in the best interest of \nstudents or their parents.\n  These provisions take critical steps towards cleaning up the student \nloan industry by removing the conflicts of interest that compromised \nthe advice and integrity of too many financial aid offices and \nofficers.\n  Beyond the student loans, the higher education amendments make more \ngrant aid available to students in Maryland and around the nation. This \nbill expands eligibility criteria for Academic Competitiveness Grants, \nACG, and National Science Mathematics Access to Retain Talent, SMART, \ngrants; expands critical opportunities and services provided for low-\nincome, first generation, and homeless college students under Federal \nTRIO Programs; increases grants to States to provide its young \nscientists and mathematicians with scholarships; and increases \ncolleges' ability to reach out and prepare younger students for college \nthrough partnership programs. The bill makes it easier for colleges to \nuse grant money to provide financial counseling and for students to \nengage in public service opportunities as part of their work-study \nobligations.\n\n  Grant programs encourage colleges to build partnerships with the \nbusiness community to address the Nation's workforce needs and to build \nprograms that teach all students, and especially minority students, \nforeign languages and encourage them to enter international service \nfields. The bill creates a new grant program for predominantly Black \ninstitutions to enhance their capacity to service more low- and middle-\nincome Black American students; and a new grant for colleges to develop \nand improve their campus safety and emergency response systems in the \nwake of the terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech.\n  What do these changes mean for Maryland students? Well, instead of \nfilling out a seven-page monstrosity, students will have access to a \nsimpler two-page form, and eventually an on-line smart form that \ntailors later questions as a student answers earlier ones and may even \nbe able to populate information from forms submitted to the IRS and \nother Government agencies.\n  Students will know their financial needs by their junior year of high \nschool, enabling their family to examine straight-forward and honest \ndocuments outlining financing options. Families will be able to rely on \nfinancial aid officers for honest advice and will have greater access \nto financial aid counseling. Expanded grant eligibility requirements \nwill give Maryland students increased access to grants and a better \nability to pursue their dreams. St. John's students in Annapolis, for \ninstance, will now be able to apply for SMART grants whereas this \nunique institution's absence of formal majors was a barrier to student \neligibility in the past. Students who choose to go to school year round \nwill be eligible for a second Pell grant. The books and supplies \nallowance for Federal work-study students will go from $450 to $600.\n  Perhaps most important, this bill takes steps toward addressing one \nof the most critical education problems we have in this country: a \ngrowing teacher shortage. As you know, Mr. President, teachers are our \nmost valuable resource when it comes to educating our Nation's \nchildren. According to research, teacher quality is the schooling \nfactor with the greatest effect on student achievement. Good teachers \ncan make up to a full year's difference in learning growth for students \nand dwarf the impact of any other educational investment, even smaller \nclass sizes.\n  But between the retirement of hundreds of thousands of baby boomers, \nefforts to reduce class sizes, and the No Child Left Behind law's \nraised standards for new teachers, school systems across the Nation \ncan't find enough qualified recruits to fill their class rooms.\n  Maryland is no different. In 2006, the Maryland Higher Education \nCommission found that the State ``is not producing or attracting enough \nteachers to fulfill the staffing requirements of the State's school \nsystems, especially in high need certification fields.'' High turnover \nonly makes the problem worse.\n  It is widely accepted that it takes 5 years to master the complex art \nof teaching. But one-third of new teachers leave the profession within \n3 years, half within 5 years, and attrition is greater in schools in \nlow-income, urban districts. Of the estimated 6 million people in the \nU.S. with teaching backgrounds or credentials, only 3 million are \nactually teaching. Not only does the turnover leave our classrooms \nwithout teachers, but recruiting and training new teachers costs the \ncountry $7 billion a year.\n  Because research shows even modest monetary incentives lower teacher \nattrition, especially in high-risk school districts, I introduced the \nMaster Teacher Act of 2007 to reward ``master teachers'' with a 25-\npercent Federal tax exemption on their salary for 4 years if they agree \nto teach in a school that is not meeting No Child Left Behind's annual \nachievement goals. That legislation is now before the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  But more must be done to attract our best and brightest to teaching \nand then keep them there. Most professions, require new entrants go \nthrough extensive formal or informal apprenticeships before taking on \nthe profession's full responsibilities. Not many graduate\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\nlaw school and the next day walk into a courtroom and try a death \npenalty case or graduate medical school and immediately walk into an \noperating room to perform open-heart surgery. Those professions require \ndecades of training post-graduation. Teaching is an equally complex \nprofession, melding academic theory and practice, and carries enormous \nresponsibility for children's personal and our Nation's collective \neconomic future.\n  But too many teachers are thrown into a classroom with their own \nstudents, many with complex social, emotional, and learning needs, \nwithout sufficient training or support. And too many leave the \nprofession feeling frustrated, defeated, and disheartened. Studies have \nshown a connection between support in the first year and teachers' \nmoving between schools and leaving the profession. A helpful mentor, as \nreported by teachers, significantly reduces the chances of quitting in \nthe first year. Common planning time and collaboration with other \nteachers are strong predictors of teachers' decisions to stay in a \nschool and the profession.\n  The higher education amendments will improve teacher quality, \ntraining, and retention by promoting high-quality and effective teacher \npreparation programs for new and prospective teachers, and help high-\nneed schools by focusing on recruiting and retaining high-quality \nteachers in high-need schools.\n  The bill creates competitive grants for innovative teacher \npreparation programs that address the need for stronger teaching \nmethods and better teacher support. The bill provides a competitive \ngrant for college level preparation programs that include evidence-\nbased teaching methods, mentoring programs for the teacher's first 2 \nyears in service--called induction programs--and new accountability \nmeasures to allow programs to improve the training offered.\n  The bill also provides grants to teaching residency programs, \nprograms that provide participants a 1-year stipend to engage in a \nguided teaching apprenticeship with a master teacher that integrates \ntheory and practice and includes master's degree coursework. These \nresidency programs must place participants in high-needs schools and \nwork with local school districts to develop an induction program to \nprovide continued support to residents once the program ends. These \nprograms must also contain accountability measures methods that allow \nfor program evaluation and improvement.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the \nrest of my colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee for all their hard work and leadership in bringing \nsuch a comprehensive and innovative bill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I first ran for elected office in my home State of \nMaryland at the age of 22. I sought elected office because I believed \nthat government can make a difference in people's lives. This bill, \nreauthorizing the Higher Education Act of 1965, does just that, and I \nam proud to offer my support.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, due to the delay of my flight from Rhode \nIsland, I was unavoidably absent for vote No. 273, the Brown amendment \nto create a new Federal Supplemental Loan program.\n  Had I been present, I would have supported the Brown amendment No. \n2376. We know that more and more students are taking out private loans \nwith high interest rates. Senator Brown's amendment seeks to provide an \nalternative for those students who have exhausted their grant and \nStafford loan aid and continue to need assistance in meeting their \ncollege cost of attendance. I have heard concern that such a program \ncould provide a disincentive to States to provide additional grant aid, \nbut I believe we must address the fact that too many moderate- and low-\nincome students take out high interest private loans, which creates an \nunmanageable loan burden for these students and their families. The \nBrown amendment is an attempt to rectify this situation and although \nnot perfect, it is worthy of inclusion in the committee's deliberation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the pending order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Kennedy second-\ndegree amendment to the Coburn amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2377\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to return to the \namendment I filed earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Chair if there is a pending second-degree \namendment by the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Chair, for those Members following, \nthere has been agreement reached, and there will be no objection to the \nadoption of the second-degree amendment to my amendment and then the \nadoption of my amendment, both by voice vote.\n  So at this point, I urge the adoption of the second-degree amendment \noffered by the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2380) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Now, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Durbin \namendment, as amended by the second-degree amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as amended, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2377), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2381\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will celebrate the first \nincrease in the minimum wage in 10\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\nyears--in 10 years. That will be the first increase in the minimum \nwage. It will be increased to $5.85 an hour, followed by an additional \n70 cents one year later, and an additional 70 cents one year after \nthat.\n  This will mean new hope and opportunity for 13 million men and women. \nPrimarily women, because almost 60 percent of minimum wage workers are \nwomen. It will benefit some 6.4 million children because more than half \nof the women who will benefit from the increase have children. So it \nwill benefit the children. This means hope is on the way.\n  It has been a long time, Mr. President. We have heard those who say: \nWell, the increase in the minimum wage is going to cost jobs, and it \nwill work a hardship on these people. Of course, that is what they have \nsaid on every increase there has been. This is the 10th increase in the \nminimum wage, and they have been wrong each and every time. Currently, \nthe second largest economy in Western Europe is Great Britain--they are \npaying $10.97 as a minimum wage. They have lifted almost a million \nchildren out of poverty. At the present time, Ireland also has one of \nthe strongest economies in Western Europe and their minimum wage is \n$11.25 an hour, and they have the strongest economy in all of Western \nEurope. They have reduced child poverty by 40 percent, and their \neconomy is strong. So $5.85 in this great country at this time is just \na statement that many of us believe that work should pay, and that \npeople who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should not live \nin poverty.\n  So tomorrow will be an important day, Mr. President, and it is \nappropriate that the Senate be reminded of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9768-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VOTE-ARAMAS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last Thursday night, in an embarrassing \ndisplay, the Senate engaged in the perennial and painfully ridiculous \nbudget vote-arama.\n  This is the process where the Senate considers either a budget \nresolution or reconciliation bill, and, under the rules of the Budget \nAct, Senators are permitted to offer and secure votes on amendments \nafter the statutory limitation on debate has expired. By consent, \nSenators are usually allocated 2 minutes to describe their positions \nfor and against an amendment before the Senate votes. Because Senators \nare not required to file their amendments in advance, far too often, \nSenators cannot read an amendment before a rollcall vote begins. We \ncannot even get an inkling of some of the mischief contained in many of \nthese amendments. Many times, the amendments being considered would \nrequire sweeping changes to current law, and Senators are forced to \ncast their votes on these complex matters without the benefit of \ndebate, an understanding of the costs, or even the chance to peek at \nthe text of the amendment.\n  In recent years, the budget vote-arama has come to signify an \nabsolute breakdown in the deliberations of the U.S. Senate. The vote-\narama is a degrading process that sullies the reputation of the Senate \nevery time it occurs. I can only imagine, and I cringe at the thought \nof, how the Senate must appear to the American people, voting on \nmatters without debate, and without even something as simple as a copy \nof the amendment.\n  Last Thursday night, during the debate on the Higher Education Access \nAct, the so-called education reconciliation bill, the process \ndeteriorated even further, into something appalling. The Senate fell \ninto a political tit-for-tat, with Senators offering, at first, an \nunrelated amendment regarding the Federal Communications Commission, \nand then a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, and then an unrelated amendment to alter the \ncollective bargaining rights of American workers. The free-for-all \nfurther deteriorated when an amendment was offered urging the President \nnot to pardon the Vice President's former Chief of Staff, I. Lewis \n``Scooter'' Libby, and then a retaliatory amendment was offered \nregarding the pardons granted by President Clinton. And on it went.\n  Amendment after amendment was offered, each completely unrelated to \nthe education bill before the Senate, and subject to multiple \nviolations under the Budget Act. And, yet, each side continued to raise \nthe stakes, taking political shots at the opposing side, while the \nSenate suffered through a humiliating night of political ping-pong. \nCooler heads finally prevailed, thanks to the intervention of the \nmajority leader, and, at least, the amendments regarding Presidential \npardons were withdrawn. Nevertheless, the soap opera of last Thursday \nnight underscores the dangers of the budget reconciliation process--\nwhere bills are considered under expedited procedures, where debate is \nalmost nonexistent, where vote-aramas occur, and where Senators are \ncalled upon to cast votes on nearly anonymous amendments that amount to \nlittle more than colorful sloganeering.\n  The spectacle also underscored the absolute necessity of the Byrd \nRule. Section 313 of the Budget Act--the Byrd Rule--prevents extraneous \nmatter from being added to reconciliation bills, and being jammed \nthrough the Senate on party-line votes, like the ones we saw last \nThursday night. The Byrd Rule was designed to prevent passage of \nexactly the kind of amendments that were being offered.\n  As the hours ticked by, I believe that many Members were embarrassed \nby the performance of the Senate, as it got dragged into a political \ngame of tossing zingers. In hindsight, we have to admit that matters \ngot carried away, and that this body drifted far from its \nconstitutional responsibility to legislate for the American people, and \nnot the political media. Last Thursday night, the Senate displayed an \nutter lack of seriousness and appreciation for the depth and complexity \nof the issues before this country. I opposed every amendment that \nviolated the Byrd Rule--regardless of whether it was offered by a \nRepublican or Democrat, and regardless of how I viewed the subject \nmatter--because I was so appalled by the deterioration in the Senate's \ndeliberative processes. I can say honestly that I took no part in the \nmessage-mongering amendments that were extraneous to the underlying \nbill, and that showed this institution in such a shameful light.\n  Last Thursday night's spectacle ought to cause every Senator to \nreevaluate the budget process in the U.S. Senate. I will renew my \nefforts to do away with these pernicious vote-aramas, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9768-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9768-S9771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REFUGEE CRISIS IN IRAQ ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post included \ndetails from a memo by our Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, in which \nhe makes a strong case that we need to do more to make it possible for \nIraqis employed by our government to come to the United States.\n  Ambasador Crocker emphasizes the growing danger facing these Iraqis, \nwho as he states ``work under extremely difficult conditions, and are \ntargets for violence including murder and kidnapping.'' According to \nthe article, Ambassador Crocker has called for establishment of an \nimmigrant visa program for these Iraqi employees.\n  In fact, Senators Smith, Biden, Hagel, Lieberman, Leahy, Levin, and I \nhave introduced legislation which establishes a program to do precisely \nwhat Ambassador Crocker calls for.\n  Our legislation establishes an immigrant visa program for Iraqis who \nhave worked for or directly with the United States government for at \nleast 1 year. Our Government now provides such special immigrant visas \nbut only for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters. Our bill \nexpands it to include Iraqis in other professions who have been \nemployed by us or who have worked directly with us.\n  In addition, our legislation creates additional options for Iraqis \nwho are under threat because of their close association with the United \nStates to apply to our refugee resettlement program.\n  The Senate is obviously divided on the best overall policy to pursue \non the war. I thought it was a mistake from the beginning. That is no \nsecret. Some of our colleagues are convinced that continuing the use of \nmilitary force in Iraq is necessary to protect our national security.\n  But our divisions on that issue should not obscure the fact that all \nof\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\nus on both sides of the aisle agree that America owes an immense debt \nof gratitude to these Iraqis, and we have a special responsibility to \nhelp them. They have supported our effort, saved American lives, and \nare clearly at great risk because of it.\n  David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, recognized \nthis obligation and called for action in a June 12 article in ``The \nHill.'' He recalled a Vietnamese friend who did not make it out of \nVietnam when the U.S. left, and said, ``There are in Iraq today untold \nnumbers of people like my Vietnamese friend who rushed to our aid when \nwe arrived and have worked with us since. If we abandon them, they may \nnot be so lucky.''\n  Similarly, in a June 24 op-ed in the Washington Post, Julia Taft \ncalled for swift action to assist Iraqis whose lives are in danger \nbecause of their work with our government. Ms. Taft served as director \nof the Interagency Task Force for Indochinese Refugee Resettlement in \nthe Ford Administration and was later Assistant Secretary of State for \nPopulation, Refugees and Migration. She wrote about an Iraqi couple \nworking for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad who had been kidnapped and \nexecuted.\n  She said:\n\n       They are among the most recent of thousands of cases in \n     which Iraqis affiliated with the United States have been \n     forced into hiding, tortured or, often, killed . . . I found \n     myself thinking of this husband and wife last week . . . and \n     struggling with a terrible contradiction. The United States \n     is the world's most generous contributor to refugee relief, \n     and we have always taken the lead on resettling refugees. Yet \n     our country has done the bare minimum to help these Iraqis \n     facing death and exile.\n\n  In her call for action, Taft said, ``The administration and Congress \ncannot waste any more time. Their lack of political will has cost too \nmany people their lives. . . .''\n  In a July 19 op-ed in USA Today, Michael Medved, a conservative \nRepublican who supports the ongoing war effort, and Lanny J. Davis, a \nliberal Democrat who supports the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, \ncalled for swift and bold action to help Iraqi refugees.\n  They wrote:\n\n       One issue should bring together all factions of the ongoing \n     debate, and that is America's moral obligation to open our \n     doors--immediately--to Iraqis who face danger and death \n     because of their assistance to our forces.\n\n  They specifically called for action on our legislation, saying:\n\n       Last month, a bipartisan group of senators, including \n     Kennedy, who is anti-war, and Lieberman, who supports the \n     war, introduced legislation that would provide special \n     refugee status for Iraqis who are in danger because of their \n     association with the United States or its contractors. This \n     legislation, or something like it, needs strong support from \n     the administration as well as from citizens across \n     ideological and partisan lines. . . . days, even hours, could \n     mean the difference between life and death for people who did \n     nothing wrong other than help Americans.\n\n  Many Iraqis have been working with our Armed Forces, our diplomatic \nmission, and our reconstruction teams in Iraq and have performed \nvaliantly, and their lives are at risk. Many have lost their lives and \nmany more have lost their homes, their property, and their livelihood. \nFor some, it will be too dangerous to ever return home.\n  America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who \nnow have a bulls-eye on their back because of their association with \nour Government.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will establish the kind of process that \nAmbassador Crocker, David Keene, Julia Taft, Roy Medved, Lanny Davis, \nand many others have called for to help these Iraqis who have \nsacrificed so much for the United States. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Washington Post article and other articles I have mentioned be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our legislation, S. 1651, to keep the \nfaith with the many brave Iraqis whose lives are in great danger \nbecause they have the courage to work with the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 2007]\n\n                Envoy Urges Visas For Iraqis Aiding U.S.\n\n                          (By Spencer S. Hsu)\n\n       The American ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan C. Crocker, has \n     asked the Bush administration to take the unusual step of \n     granting immigrant visas to all Iraqis employed by the U.S. \n     government in Iraq because of growing concern that they will \n     quit and flee the country if they cannot be assured eventual \n     safe passage to the United States.\n       Crocker's request comes as the administration is struggling \n     to respond to the flood of Iraqis who have sought refuge in \n     neighboring countries since sectarian fighting escalated \n     early last year. The United States has admitted 133 Iraqi \n     refugees since October, despite predicting that it would \n     process 7,000 by the end of September. ``Our [Iraqi staff \n     members] work under extremely difficult conditions, and are \n     targets for violence including murder and kidnapping,'' \n     Crocker wrote Undersecretary of State Henrietta H. Fore. \n     ``Unless they know that there is some hope of an [immigrant \n     visa] in the future, many will continue to seek asylum, \n     leaving our Mission lacking in one of our most valuable \n     assets.''\n       Crocker's two-page cable dramatizes how Iraq's instability \n     and a rapidly increasing refugee population are stoking new \n     pressures to help those who are threatened or displaced. As \n     public sentiment grows for a partial or full American \n     withdrawal, U.S. Embassy officials are facing demands from \n     their own employees to secure a reliable exit route, and the \n     administration as a whole is facing pressure from aid groups, \n     lawmakers and diplomats to do more for those upended by the \n     war.\n       With Iraqi immigration to the United States stuck at a \n     trickle, however, it appears that humanitarian concerns have \n     been trumped so far by fears that terrorists may infiltrate \n     through refugee channels. Bureaucratic delays at the \n     departments of State and Homeland Security have also bogged \n     down the processing of immigration requests by Iraqis fleeing \n     violence.\n       Skeptics contend another reason the administration has been \n     slow to resettle Iraqis in large numbers is that doing so \n     could be seen as admitting that its efforts to secure Iraq \n     have failed. The intense pressure for visas ``reflects the \n     fact that the situation is pretty dire,'' said Roberta Cohen, \n     principal adviser to the U.N. secretary general's \n     representative on internally displaced persons.\n       The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says \n     that about 2 million Iraqis have been displaced inside the \n     country so far, and that an estimated 2.2 million others have \n     fled to Syria, Jordan and other neighbors, where they \n     threaten to overwhelm schools and housing, destabilize host \n     governments and provide a recruiting ground for radical \n     unrest. Each month, an additional 60,000 Iraqis flee their \n     homes, the U.N. agency said.\n       Overall estimates of the number of Iraqis who may be \n     targeted as collaborators because of their work for U.S., \n     coalition or foreign reconstruction groups are as high as \n     110,000. The U.N. refugee agency has estimated that 20,000 \n     Iraqi refugees need permanent resettlement.\n       In the cable he sent July 9, Crocker highlighted the plight \n     of Iraqis who have assumed great risk by helping the United \n     States. Since June 2004, at least nine U.S. Embassy employees \n     have been killed--including a married couple last month. But \n     Iraqi employees other than interpreters and translators \n     generally cannot obtain U.S. immigrant visas, and until a \n     recent expansion that took the annual quota to 500 from 50, \n     interpreter-translator applicants faced a nine-year backlog.\n       As a result, Crocker said, the embassy is referring two \n     workers per week to a U.S. asylum program. Outside analysts \n     and former officials say the number of Iraqi staffers at the \n     embassy has fallen by about half from 200 last year, while \n     rough estimates place the number of Iraqi employees of the \n     U.S. government in the low thousands.\n       A 43-year-old former engineer for the U.S. Embassy who gave \n     his name as Abu Ali said Iraqis working with Americans at any \n     level must trust no one, use fake names, conceal their travel \n     and telephone use, and withhold their employment even from \n     family members. Despite such extreme precautions, he said \n     they are viewed as traitors by some countrymen and are still \n     mistrusted by the U.S. government.\n       ``We have no good end or finish for us,'' said Ali, who \n     quit the embassy in June and moved to Dubai with his four \n     children.\n       Kirk W. Johnson, who served as regional reconstruction \n     coordinator in Fallujah in 2005 for the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, said the damage to the United \n     States' standing in the Muslim world will be long-lasting \n     if the country's immigration officials are unable to tell \n     friend from foe in Iraq--between terrorists and those who \n     have sacrificed the most to work and fight alongside \n     Americans.\n       ``If we screw this group of people, we're never going to \n     make another friend in the Middle East as long as I'm \n     alive,'' said Johnson, who is advocating the resettlement of \n     Iraqis who have worked for coalition forces. ``The people in \n     the Middle East are watching what happens to this group.''\n       The State Department declined to comment on Friday about \n     Crocker's proposals or his cable, a copy of which was \n     obtained by The Washington Post. But Homeland Security \n     Secretary Michael Chertoff said last week that he would like \n     Iraqis who worked for the United States or who have been \n     vouched for by American authorities to be processed ``as \n     quickly as we can, because I think we have a responsibility \n     there.''\n       Kenneth H. Bacon, president of Refugees International, who \n     has urged broader U.S. resettlement efforts, said that ``the \n     U.S. does\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\n     have an obligation to be fair to the people who have served \n     it, whether in Iraq or elsewhere. That's what Ryan Crocker \n     wants to be able to promise.'' Bacon was among several \n     refugee experts who said that Iraqi employees seeking \n     immigrant visas have already shown their trustworthiness by \n     exposing themselves to brutal attacks over their work in the \n     Green Zone and elsewhere.\n       But such Iraqis are only a small part of a broader refugee \n     problem that Washington confronts as a result of the war. In \n     recent months, the U.N. refugee agency has referred 8,000 \n     Iraqi refugee applications to the U.S. government. About \n     1,500 of them have been interviewed, and about 1,000 \n     ``conditionally approved'' pending security checks and travel \n     arrangements, a DHS official said. The State Department \n     expects 4,000 more interviews to be completed by October.\n       But State and DHS are unlikely to admit more than 2,000 \n     Iraqi refugees by October, U.S. officials said. Since 2003, \n     the year of the U.S. invasion, the United States has admitted \n     825 Iraqi refugees, many of them backlogged applicants from \n     the time when Saddam Hussein was in power. By comparison, the \n     United States has accepted 3,498 Iranians in the past nine \n     months.\n       Smaller countries have also done more. Sweden received \n     9,065 Iraqi asylum applications in 2006, approving them at a \n     rate of 80 percent, although it recently announced tighter \n     restrictions.\n       By past standards, the U.S. response also has been meager. \n     Washington admitted nearly 140,000 Vietnamese refugees in \n     eight months in 1975, although only after the U.S. defeat in \n     South Vietnam became clear.\n       A DHS official blamed the State Department for paperwork \n     delays. Assistant Secretary of State Ellen R. Sauerbrey said \n     officials are speeding up processing and anticipate ``a \n     significantly larger number'' of admissions. ``The people who \n     are in the pipeline will be admitted by next year or, \n     hopefully, the end of the calendar year,'' she said.\n       But DHS has opposed boosting the U.S. intake of Iraqis. In \n     a June 26 memo to Congress, the department opposed a \n     legislative proposal to allow applications by Christians and \n     other Iraqi religious minorities, saying it would ``vastly \n     increase'' the number of refugees. ``No vetting process is \n     perfect, and even a strong vetting process can be strained by \n     rapid growth or high volumes,'' the memo stated.\n       U.S. officials declined to discuss details about security \n     checks for Iraqis, but said that, under special rules, \n     applicants are subjected to interviews, fingerprinting and \n     examination of their family histories. The information is \n     checked against military, FBI, State and Homeland Security \n     databases.\n       But DHS rules sometimes pose problems peculiar to the Iraqi \n     conflict: Those who pay ransom to free relatives kidnapped by \n     insurgents, for example, are sometimes viewed as providing \n     material support to terrorists.\n       Homeland Security officials say they have worked hard to \n     adjust their policies, but Chertoff said in the interview \n     that Washington will not compromise on screening quality. \n     ``What we can't afford to do and what would be devastating \n     for the program would be if we were to start to allow people \n     in who actually were a threat,'' he said.\n       Years ago, Chertoff added, Europe had more relaxed asylum \n     standards, and it ``wound up admitting a bunch of people who \n     are now the radical extremists who are fomenting homegrown \n     terrorism.''\n       Congress is nonetheless stepping up pressure on the \n     administration to do more, with Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) \n     and Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Gordon Smith (R-\n     Ore.) introducing separate legislation to expand U.S. refugee \n     and immigrant visa programs for Iraqis, including for those \n     threatened because they helped coalition or reconstruction \n     efforts.\n       ``The Administration has ignored this crisis for far too \n     long, and its response is inadequate,'' Kennedy said in a \n     written statement. ``We can't solve this problem alone, but \n     America has an obligation to provide leadership and resettle \n     greater numbers of Iraqis who are targeted by the assassin's \n     bullet because they assisted us in the war.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the American Conservative Union, June 12, 2007]\n\n                          Returning the Favor\n\n                          (By David A. Keene)\n\n       I had a Vietnamese friend who didn't make it out when we \n     abandoned his country more than 30 years ago. I wondered for \n     years what happened to him amid reports of the deaths of \n     hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who had worked with and \n     trusted us to stand by them in their fight against the \n     communists.\n       One can only imagine the sense of abandonment he and his \n     friends must have felt as they watched the last of our \n     helicopters, with desperate and panicked Vietnamese clinging \n     to their skids, lift off from the abandoned U.S. Embassy in \n     Saigon. The footage of that scene remains burned into the \n     consciousness of many of those who watched it from the \n     comfort of their homes back then, but many more of us simply \n     changed the channel and chose to forget what happened to \n     those left behind.\n       It turned out that my friend was one of the ``lucky'' ones. \n     He wasn't executed, but was sentenced to three years in one \n     of Ho's camps, which he somehow managed to survive. Once he \n     got out, he rounded up his family and fled, eventually making \n     it to this country, where he lives to this day.\n       There are in Iraq today untold numbers of people like my \n     Vietnamese friend who rushed to our aid when we arrived and \n     have worked with us since. If we abandon them, they may not \n     be so lucky.\n       My daughter is in the Army and recently returned from a \n     year in and around Baghdad, where she and fellow members of \n     her unit worked closely with an interpreter they came to know \n     as ``Timmy.''\n       When she told me about what might await Timmy if we leave \n     his country, I was reminded of my Vietnamese friend.\n       In many ways, Timmy is much like thousands of other Iraqis \n     who threw in with us in the fight against tyranny and \n     terrorism after our troops arrived in his country. At age 21, \n     Saddam Hussein's goons arrested him as an enemy of the regime \n     and sentenced him to four years in prison, where he was \n     tortured and witnessed the deaths of thousands of his fellow \n     prisoners.\n       After the arrival of U.S. forces and the fall of Saddam \n     Hussein, he joined the New Iraqi Army's Special Forces. In \n     the next couple of years his unit suffered heavy casualties \n     and he won numerous medals.\n       By 2005, Timmy had been promoted, but after being \n     reprimanded on several occasions by superiors who caught him \n     saluting ``infidel occupiers,'' he left the army and signed \n     on as a contract interpreter, or ``terp,'' as our troops call \n     people like him.\n       Offered a choice of assignments, Timmy picked the most \n     dangerous forward operations base in Baghdad because, as he \n     put it, ``It's where I can do the most good.'' That's where \n     he met my daughter and those who served with her.\n       ``Terps'' aren't armed, but Timmy put his own life at risk \n     on a daily basis, saved the lives of many of our people and, \n     as a result of just one such incident, was nominated by Gen. \n     George Casey for the secretary of defense's ``Medal for \n     Valor.''\n       Timmy was married at the time he decided to work with us \n     and his wife was expecting, but when her father learned what \n     he was up to, he had her kidnapped and the marriage annulled. \n     Timmy has never seen his child and is now so well-known in \n     Baghdad that those who work with him say he will be killed \n     within days if we leave.\n       My daughter called me before she left Baghdad to tell me \n     she and those who served with her want Timmy out. ``If we \n     leave him,'' she said, ``we will be sentencing him to death \n     and we can't do that because he's one of us and we owe him \n     our lives.'' Then she put Timmy on the phone, introduced us \n     and before she hung up said, ``I wanted you to say hello to \n     him so that you'll remember that he's a person and not just a \n     name on a piece of paper.''\n       Sadly, we have allowed very, very few Timmies into this \n     country. He and thousands like him have risked everything in \n     a common struggle for which many here and in Iraq have no \n     stomach. But we have allowed fewer than 800 of them into the \n     U.S. since 2003.\n       Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Republican \n     Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut want to expand that \n     number. H.R. 2265, which they introduced, would help us \n     deliver on Undersecretary of State Paula Dobriansky's promise \n     that ``we are committed to those Iraqis who have provided \n     assistance to the U.S. military and embassy.''\n       It's the least we can do for Timmy and those like him who \n     have risked everything to help us.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Fleeing Our Responsibility: The U.S. Owes Succor to Iraqi Refugees\n\n                            (By Julia Taft)\n\n       Last month an Iraqi couple working for the U.S. Embassy in \n     Baghdad were kidnapped and executed. Their deaths were not \n     acknowledged by the State Department, and the media made \n     little mention of the murders. They are among the most recent \n     of thousands of cases in which Iraqis affiliated with the \n     United States have been forced into hiding, tortured or, \n     often, killed.\n       I found myself thinking of this husband and wife last week, \n     as World Refugee Day passed, and struggling with a terrible \n     contradiction. The United States is the world's most generous \n     contributor to refugee relief, and we have always taken the \n     lead on resettling refugees. Yet our country has done the \n     bare minimum to help these Iraqis facing death and exile. \n     Instead of clearing the way for their resettlement, we have \n     blocked their path to safety with bureaucratic barriers and \n     political hurdles.\n       President Bush should look to another Republican president, \n     Gerald Ford, as an example of executive leadership in \n     addressing refugee crises. In 1975 President Ford asked me to \n     direct an interagency task force charged with resettling \n     Indochinese refugees in the United States. Between May 1 and \n     Dec. 20, 1975, we evacuated and resettled more than 131,000 \n     Vietnamese who were at risk of persecution.\n       We rescued these people in the face of fierce political \n     opposition. Initially, for example, California Gov. Jerry \n     Brown announced that he wanted no refugees in his state. We \n     overcame his reluctance and all other obstacles because the \n     president had committed to doing everything possible to save \n     the lives of the Vietnamese who had stood beside us. Ford \n     persuaded Republicans and Democrats in Congress to \n     appropriate emergency funds, and he visited refugees awaiting \n     resettlement at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. American families, \n     churches and synagogues responded to the president's\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n     leadership with offers to sponsor refugees in need. At \n     staging grounds in the South Pacific, our immigration \n     officers worked 14-hour days.\n       Why is there no similar sense of urgency for the 4.2 \n     million Iraqis displaced and in danger? President Bush \n     himself has yet to speak of the crisis. Although members of \n     his administration claim to have made Iraqi refugees a top \n     priority, admission numbers tell a different story. Only one \n     Iraqi refugee made it through our process to safety in the \n     United States in May, and only one made it the month before. \n     The United States has committed to reviewing 7,000 cases and \n     admitting 3,000 refugees by the end of this fiscal year, in \n     September. That is as many as our team processed in a single \n     day back in 1975.\n       What has happened to our leadership on this issue?\n       The administration and Congress cannot waste any more time. \n     Their lack of political will has cost too many people their \n     lives. A bill introduced last week by Sens. Edward Kennedy \n     (D-Mass.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), the Refugee Crisis in \n     Iraq Act, would begin this process by swiftly providing \n     increased resettlement options and visas for those at risk \n     because of their association with the United States. The \n     president also should direct that 20,000 unallocated refugee \n     visas from this year be used for Iraqis. Finally, we must \n     increase aid to countries in the Middle East that combined \n     are hosting 2 million Iraqis; this would help ensure that the \n     refugees can stay and that the host countries remain willing \n     to keep their doors open.\n       Administration officials say that the best solution to the \n     Iraqi refugee crisis is a stable homeland to which refugees \n     can return. No one wants that solution more than the refugees \n     themselves, but conditions in Iraq are not heading in that \n     direction. The humanitarian crisis must not become a pawn in \n     political pronouncements about the state of our efforts in \n     Iraq. This was true with respect to our rescue of Vietnamese \n     refugees, and it is true now. No matter your view of the war, \n     welcoming the persecuted and standing by our friends is the \n     right thing to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the USA Today, July 19, 2007]\n\n                One Iraq Issue That Should Unite Us All\n\n                 (By Lanny J. Davis and Michael Medved)\n\n       Iraqis who have aided the U.S.-led mission are already \n     targets. Once the American troops pull back--and they \n     inevitably will--entire families will be left to fend for \n     themselves. We still live with the haunting images from the \n     Vietnam War. This country must not let history repeat itself \n     in Iraq.\n       The war in Iraq has inspired bitter divisions--over whether \n     America should have intervened, how we conducted the \n     conflict, and how we should get out. But one issue should \n     bring together all factions of the ongoing debate, and that \n     is America's moral obligation to open our doors--\n     immediately--to Iraqis who face danger and death because of \n     their assistance to our forces.\n       Anna Husarska, a senior policy adviser at the International \n     Rescue Committee, recently offered a chilling report of two \n     Iraqis--a husband and wife team--who worked for the U.S. \n     Embassy in Baghdad and were killed. As Husarska wrote, ``A \n     statement on the Internet made clear why: `The swords of the \n     security personnel of the Islamic State in Iraq . . . are \n     with God's grace slitting the throats of crusaders and their \n     aides and lackeys.' ''\n       Another young Iraqi was more fortunate. Several weeks ago, \n     he lost his job as a contractor on a U.S. Army base. Security \n     rules forced him to leave the base immediately. Driven from \n     the safety of an American enclave within hours, he faced the \n     likelihood that his association with coalition forces would \n     lead almost immediately to his murder--if not by the anti-\n     American insurgents then by his own family, who believed he \n     had dishonored them.\n       On the other side of the world, a group of U.S. lawyers \n     working pro bono for this young man (including Lanny J. \n     Davis, the co-author of this commentary) learned of his \n     dilemma and interrupted a sunny spring afternoon to try to \n     save his life. SOS calls to congressional VIPs, including \n     staffers of Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., Edward Kennedy, D-\n     Mass., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., produced a surprisingly \n     quick response. Graham interrupted his weekend and called a \n     senior government attorney in Iraq (late in the evening Iraq \n     time) who had legal authority on this type of situation. A \n     Washington lawyer close to U.S. Army senior officials reached \n     top brass. The result: This Iraqi was placed in another job \n     and allowed to stay on the base.\n\n                            A Constant Risk\n\n       This loyal young man continues working at the U.S. facility \n     in Iraq, but he can't leave or he'll be killed. That is \n     because under current immigration policies, despite his \n     service to our country, he can't find refuge in the land of \n     the free.\n       Regardless of one's views on the Iraq war, all people of \n     goodwill must recognize that we owe a debt to those Iraqis \n     who risked everything to assist the U.S. dream of a pro-\n     Western democracy in the heart of the Middle East. Recently, \n     the assistant secretary of the State Department's refugees \n     bureau, Ellen Sauerbrey, announced spots for up to 25,000 \n     Iraqis who can qualify for refugee status, but most of those \n     slots remain unfilled.\n       According to Husarska, 11 were admitted to the USA in \n     February, eight in March, one in April and one in May. \n     Considering the direct peril to some of our closest \n     associates among Iraqis, we need to improve on this pathetic \n     record.\n       In 1975, we shared the revulsion of nearly all Americans at \n     the awful scenes of Vietnamese civilians hanging on to the \n     last U.S. helicopters, literally by their finger tips, as \n     they took off from the rooftops of U.S. buildings in Saigon. \n     We remember the images of women left behind, holding \n     babies, crying hysterically, their hands reaching into the \n     air as their American protectors abruptly departed. \n     British historian Paul Johnson aptly observed that this \n     moment symbolized ``the most shameful defeat in the whole \n     of American history. . . . But it was the helpless people \n     of the region who had to pay the real price.''\n       In response to that shame, President Ford authorized the \n     admission to the USA of more than 131,000 South Vietnamese \n     refugees. So why not show comparable commitment to Iraqis who \n     have worked closely with our troops and civilian personnel \n     and face dire risks because of their association with the \n     American cause?\n       Even if the Bush administration succeeds in its determined \n     efforts to stabilize the current Iraqi government, an \n     American departure could still put at risk some of the \n     individuals most closely associated with our long-term role \n     in the country. And even if a greatly reduced contingent of \n     U.S. troops remains in Iraq on a semipermanent basis to \n     battle al-Qaeda (as even the anti-war Senate Democratic \n     resolution stipulated), those soldiers will have their hands \n     full with other assignments without diverting attention to \n     the protection of Iraqi families whose pro-American roles \n     placed them at risk. These people deserve our support, \n     regardless of our differing positions on ongoing disputes \n     about the war and its execution.\n\n                           Opening Our Gates\n\n       Last month, a bipartisan group of senators, including \n     Kennedy, who is anti-war, and Lieberman, who supports the \n     war, introduced legislation that would provide special \n     refugee status for Iraqis who are in danger because of their \n     association with the United States or its contractors. This \n     legislation, or something like it, needs strong support from \n     the administration as well as from citizens across \n     ideological and partisan lines. As the experience with the \n     young Iraqi described above proves, days, even hours, could \n     mean the difference between life and death for people who did \n     nothing wrong other than help Americans.\n       No one--not even the most fervent critics of the Iraq war--\n     expects that an end to that struggle will bring an overall \n     conclusion to the larger war with Islamo-Nazi terrorists. In \n     the continued battle against jihadist fanatics, the admission \n     to our country of Iraqi Arabs who courageously proved their \n     support of the American cause can only enrich our resources \n     for challenges to come. The language skills and cultural \n     perspective of moderate Iraqis won't damage our society and \n     could play an important role in helping to defend it.\n       Finally, we must consider our moral obligation here, \n     especially for those who support an immediate or definite \n     timetable for withdrawal of U.S. forces. To deny that \n     obligation, or worse, to ignore it, would tragically stain \n     the legacy of another generation of Americans--whether pro- \n     or anti-war--as did our passivity and indifference to the \n     plight of Vietnamese allies left behind to suffer and die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9771-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9771-S9772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S.

The initiatives are continuing \ndisability reviews and supplemental security income redeterminations, \nInternal Revenue Service tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2008, on June 27, 2007. That bill contains \nprovisions that fulfill the conditions of section 207(c) for \nadjustments related to continuing disability reviews and supplemental \nsecrity income redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, \nand unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.\n  In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported the \nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2008, on \nJuly 13, 2007. That bill contains provisions that fulfill the \nconditions of section 207(c)\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\nfor Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement.\n  As a result, for fiscal year 2008, I am revising both the \ndiscretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for discretionary budget authority and \noutlays. The amount of the adjustment is $1,042 million in budget \nauthority and $699 million in outlays. The revised discretionary limits \nand allocations for discretionary budget authority and outlays are the \nappropriate levels to be used for enforcement during consideration of \nthe fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, every American who has ever visited a \nhospital knows that nurses are on the front lines of our health care \nsystem. Our Nation's nurses treat patients, work with doctors, and \nperform complex duties critical to providing care to all patients. For \nthese reasons, I am joining Senator Kennedy in introducing the Safe \nNursing and Patient Care Act. I have done so for the last three \nsessions of Congress and will continue to do so until this vital \nlegislation is enacted.\n  At the heart of the bill is the belief that nurses should not be \nforced to work beyond their ability to offer exemplary care to \npatients. Mandatory overtime requires nurses, given very short notice \nto work excessive hours in our hospitals and other institutions that \nprovide health care services. Nurses are left with no recourse when \nmandatory overtime is applied. They continue treating patients, despite \nfatigue in many instances, impacting the delivery of care to patients. \nIt is time that we answer the call made by nurses from across the \nNation to immediately address this issue.\n  Individual States have begun to respond to this call. Massachusetts \nis one of several States seeking to tackle adverse nursing conditions \nand curb requirements of mandatory overtime for its nurses. This bill \nwould give nurses the necessary tools to continue putting patient care \nfirst by prohibiting mandatory overtime and providing protections if \nnurses report cases of it happening. Each year, 98,000 deaths are \nattributed to medical errors, and so addressing this issue is critical \nto the safety of our patients and the well-being of our nurses.\n  The Safe Nursing and Patient Act is the first step toward addressing \nimportant issues in our Nation's health care system. Our legislation \noffers support and protections to nurses. It is time that Congress act \nto create a healthy and safe work environment for nurses so that they \ncan continue to create healthy environments for patients.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 21, 2007, in Hoboken, NJ, two men assaulted a gay couple near \na well-known nightclub. They knock the two victims to the ground, beat \nthem, and shouted antigay slurs. After noticing the attack, a bouncer \nat a nearby nightclub chased the two men down the street and held them \nuntil police arrived. The attackers now face charges of assault and \nbias intimidation. Police Captain Anthony Romano confirmed for \nreporters that the attackers hit the two men because they were gay.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9772-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING FREDERICK ``TIM'' McCLINTOCK\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor one of the Senate's \nown, a man who went above and beyond the call of duty to save another's \nlife.\n  Frederick ``Tim'' McClintock has been a fixture in the Senate for \nover 30 years. He is a skilled carpenter and a familiar face in the \nSenate.\n  He has come to my office on numerous occasions to perform various \ntasks. He does his job well and is always ready with a smile and a kind \nword.\n  Yet, on Friday, July 6, 2007, Tim McClintock was confronted with a \nterrible scene, well outside the routine of the Senate.\n  As he headed home at the end of the day, he noticed a man laying face \ndown in the reflecting pool in Lower Senate Park. Without hesitation, \nTim McClintock came to his aid. He turned the man over and performed \nCPR until he was resuscitated. Then with the assistance of a Capitol \nPolice officer, he pulled the man out of the water.\n  That afternoon, Tim McClintock selflessly and courageously saved a \nman from drowning.\n  He would deny that he is a hero.\n  He was quoted in Roll Call newspaper as saying, ``A hero is someone \nwho risks their own well-being or life. The worst that was going to \nhappen to me is that my feet would get wet.''\n  His modesty is astounding.\n  The fact is that acts of compassion and bravery such as these display \nthe true character of a man.\n  On that day, Tim McClintock demonstrated quick thinking, \nresourcefulness, bravery, and, above all, compassion and humanity for a \nstranger. The brave actions that Friday afternoon, as many others \nrushed home eager to start the weekend, were the actions of a true \nhero.\n  So, on behalf of the Senate, I commend the heroism of Frederick \n``Tim'' McClintock, who on July 6, 2007, demonstrated the principles of \nkindness, bravery, and compassion that we value so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/23/senate-section/article/S9772-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9772-S9773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR THOMAS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to address the impact \nof globalization, to reauthorize trade adjustment assistance, to extend \ntrade adjustment assistance to service workers, communities, firms, and \nfarmers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with my good \nfriend and colleague Senator Snowe to introduce the Trade and \nGlobalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2007. This legislation would \ninvest in America's workers and firms, farmer, and communities. It \nwould help them to compete in the global marketplace.\n  The open trade system that has evolved over the past 50 years has \ncreated new markets for American ingenuity. It has delivered more \naffordable goods to American consumers. In Montana alone, trade \nsupports nearly one in five jobs.\n  But for some Americans, trade-related economic change has not always \nbeen smooth. In 2005, the Owens and Hurst sawmill in Eureka, Mt, closed \nits doors. That mill fell victim to an onslaught of unfairly dumped and \nsubsidized Canadian lumber. Jerry Ross, a supervisor at the mill, lost \nthe job that she had held for over a decade.\n  Jerry's prospects for reeployment looked dim. Luckily for Jerry, she \nqualified for Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA. With a diligent, \ncaring job service caseworker by her side, Jerry charted a new course \nin life.\n  Jerry has been training intensively the Building Trades program at \nthe Flathead Valley Community College in Kalispell, Mt. She is also \ntaking accounting coursework. When she finishes her training in \nDecember, she will be qualified as a construction superintendent. She \nhopes to start her own business.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance helps tens of thousands of American \nworkers like Jerry retrain for and fill jobs, right here at home. But \nthe program is set to expire on September 30. It is up to this Congress \nto reauthorize and expand the program.\n  I have consulted closely with workers in Montana. I have sought \nadvice from not just Montana's Department of Labor I have also \nconsulted with officials from Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, and \nPennsylvania. I have sat down with unions, businesses, economists, and \nother experts.\n  Everyone agrees. TAA is a lifeline to American workers reentering an \nincreasingly global labor market.\n  But for all the good that Trade Adjustment Assistance does, the \ncurrent program is a complicated maze of hurdles and exceptions. For \ninstance, workers can qualify for benefits if their jobs move offshore \nto Canada, Mexico, or another free trade agreement partner. But they \nwill not qualify if their jobs move to China or India. Trade-displaced \nmanufacturing workers can qualify for TAA if they lose their jobs. But \naccountants or any other service providers cannot. Workers can qualify \nfor wage insurance, but only if they give up their right to retraining.\n  It does not have to be this way. The Trade and Globalization \nAdjustment Assistance Act authorizes a more fair, flexible, and \nrelevant program.\n  Today's TAA overlooks the 80 percent of America's workforce employed \nin the services sector. Tens of thousands of workers who applied for \nTAA last year were shut out, simply because current law covers workers \nwho produce ``an article.'' This technicality is a holdover from a \ndifferent era. That was an era when only the manufacturing sector \nexperienced strong foreign competition. We must extend the same \nprotections to services sector workers.\n  Equally confounding is why workers whose firms move to Canada deserve \nany less protection than workers whose firms move to India. \nGlobalization does not adhere to any trade agreement. My bill will end \nthis discrimination, by covering any workers whose jobs move offshore, \nregardless of whether our nations have a trade agreement in force.\n  Losing health care coverage can be nearly as devastating as losing a \njob. In 2002, Congress passed legislation to provide TAA-certified \nworkers and certain retirees with an advanceable, refundable healthcare \ntax credit to cover 65 percent of their insurance premiums. But few \nhave used this credit to replace a portion of their former employer's \ncontribution to their health care premiums. Since folks who are out of \nwork cannot afford to pay more for health coverage, that means most are \ngoing without. Our bill would increase the Government share of \nparticipants' premiums to 85 percent. That could give workers a real \nshot at keeping their healthcare coverage. Our bill also would fix the \nglitches that have made it difficult for workers to access this tax \ncredit.\n  Our bill would also ensure that States have enough funds to pay for \nthe 2 years of training to which TAA-certified workers are entitled. \nToday, the law caps the amount of available funds. That leads some \nStates either to run out of or to ration training funds. The Baucus-\nSnowe bill would double the cap on training funds. That would ensure \nthat all workers, including newly eligible ones, get training. Our bill \nalso includes a trigger to automatically raise the cap to respond to \nunanticipated training demands.\n  Our bill also would make important improvements to the pilot wage \ninsurance program that Congress created in 2002. Wage insurance helps \nolder workers supplement lost wages when they get a new job. While \nolder workers suffer worse wage loss, they are certainly not alone. Our \nbill would allow younger workers to participate in the pilot program. \nIt also would eliminate the requirement that workers forfeit training \nif they opt for wage insurance. Instead, our bill would allow workers \nto choose what income assistance is right for them. They could choose \nthis assistance either with training, without training, or after \nsuccessfully completing training. Wage insurance should supplement, not \nsupplant, TAA benefits.\n  Our bill also would make important changes in the Commerce \nDepartment's TAA for firms program. This program helps workers and \nemployers avoid painful layoffs in the first place. TAA for firms gives \nsmall businesses the technical assistance that they need to compete in \nthe global economy. But the program runs a substantial backlog of \napproved but unfunded adjustment projects for participating firms. Our \nbill would extend coverage to services firms and triples funding to $50 \nmillion annually.\n  Likewise, our bill would improve the Department of Agriculture's TAA \nfor Farmers program. It would ease the overly strict eligibility \ncriteria that have kept many farmers and fishermen legitimately \naffected by trade from receiving assistance.\n  But we can do more than that. Many communities in which workers, \nfirms, or farmers have been certified for TAA are struggling to \nredefine their place in\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nthe global market. This bill would create a new TAA for Communities \nprogram to help communities uniquely challenged by trade to plan for \nthe future and to access grant funding to implement that future.\n  Jerry Ross faced long odds when she lost her job. But because of \nTrade Adjustment Assistance, she has a bright career. ahead of her. \nJerry believes in TAA. She traveled all the way to Washington, DC to \nurge its renewal and improvement at a Finance Committee hearing in \nJune. I look forward to working with my Colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee and in this chamber to ensure that this Congress does not \ndisappoint Jerry and the tens of thousands of American workers just \nlike her.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we know, this administration has sought \ncloser trade ties to a growing number of nations throughout the world. \nIt asked the last Congress to consider four free trade agreements, and \nis currently negotiating at least that number of new agreements, in \naddition to the Doha round of the World Trade Organization. Yet, in its \nmarch to lower our tariffs on imported goods, we must be sure we are \nnot selling our domestic businesses and their works short or-worse \nstill--out.\n  Last year saw a record U.S. trade deficit of $764 billion with the \nrest of the world. This includes bilateral imbalances with each of \nChina, the European Union, and Japan. These are the latest figures \ndemonstrating a steady slide of U.S. producers' market share in both \nthe domestic and global markets.\n  One of the most troubling features of the decline of America's trade \nprofile is the dramatic reduction in the number of manufacturing jobs \nin recent years. Since 2000, America has lost approximately 3 million, \nor 17 percent of its manufacturing jobs. Maine has lost over 21,000 \njobs, representing over 26 percent of our manufacturing workforce. \nOther States have also found it difficult to retain these high-wage, \nhigh-benefit jobs as manufacturing operations move overseas and our \ndemand for foreign-made goods surges.\n  Unlike job losses due to technological advances, which are the \ninitiative of private enterprise, trade liberalization that sacrifices \nfoundational domestic industries is the chosen policy of government. We \ntherefore have an obligation to ensure that the costs are not borne by \nthese most vulnerable workers alone.\n  That is why Senator Baucus and I--along with Senators Wyden, Coleman, \nand Stabenow--are today introducing the Trade and Globalization \nAdjustment Assistance Act of 2007, which will reauthorize and expand \nthe TAA program to cover new groups of Americans disfranchised by trade \nliberalization, as I had proposed in previous Congresses.\n  First among these are service workers and firms. While TAA currently \naids U.S. citizens who lost their manufacturing jobs to trade, it fails \nto address the growing problem of those finding themselves unemployed \nas a result of foreign outsourcing, also known as offshoring. It is \nalready bad enough that Americans who had careers in the service \nsector--which proponents of free trade argue should benefit from trade \nliberalization--are finding themselves out of work. But it is simply \nKafkaesque that such service workers, now unemployed due to policies \nthat were supposed to benefit them, would not be eligible for aid under \nTAA. That is why the legislation we are proposing today critically \nextends TAA to cover service workers and firms.\n  It is similarly illogical for workers to be excluded from the TAA \nprogram simply because they lost their job due to multilateral trade \nliberalization carried out under the auspices of the World Trade \nOrganization, as opposed to a bilateral trade agreement, such as a free \ntrade agreement. Yet, thousands of workers remain ineligible for TAA \nbenefits under current law because they happened to lose their job to \ntrade competition from a WTO member such as China or India rather than \nan FTA partner country. Accordingly, our legislation extends TAA to \ncover Americans who have been adversely affected by trade \nliberalization with WTO member, such as China, who are often the worst \noffenders of international trade rules.\n  Of critical importance to Maine and other coastal States is TAA's \nfailure to cover fishermen who have suffered from the adverse effects \nof trade liberalization. U.S. fishermen have seen their livelihoods \ndissolve due to the reduction of duties on foreign fish and seafood \nimports. Yet, TAA benefits remain unavailable to these hard-working \nAmericans under the current program. That is why I am pleased to \ncosponsor this legislation which will make such fisherman eligible for \nTAA.\n  An additional concern with the present TAA program is its failure to \naddress the inability of displaced workers in communities that have few \njobs to offer. In small towns, including many in Maine, where the \nlivelihood of the local economy often depends on one industry, one \nplant, or one company that is suffering under trade liberalization, the \nclosure of that business is sure to cause economic ruin and devastation \nof individual lives.\n  Accordingly, the legislation we are introducing today would create a \nprogram to address economic dislocation in entire communities \nnegatively affected by international trade and provide readjustment \nassistance to such communities. As we approach the expiry of \nauthorization for both the TAA program and trade promotion authority, I \nview inclusion of relief for trade-affected communities as a necessary \ncomponent of any comprehensive trade package.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1852. A bill to designate the Friday after Thanksgiving of each \nyear as ``Native American Heritage Day'' in honor of the achievements \nand contributions of Native Americans to the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould designate the Friday following Thanksgiving of each year as \nNative American Heritage Day.\n  I believe that it is well known to most Members of this body that the \noriginal inhabitants of the lands that now constitute the U.S.--the \naboriginal, indigenous, native people of America--occupied and \nexercised sovereignty over more than 550 million acres of land prior to \nthe first European contact.\n  In the early days of our history, well before our Nation was formed, \nthe native people fought alongside our soldiers in the Revolutionary \nWar. The Indian tribes enabled the survival of General George \nWashington and his troops during the harsh winter at Valley Forge by \nproviding food to the troops.\n  A few years later, as our Founding Fathers were engaged in the \nchallenge of forming a new Nation, they drew upon the democratic model \nof government that they learned from the Six Nations of the Iroquois \nConfederacy. There they found the well-institutionalized practice of \nthe fundamental principles of freedom of speech and a system of \ngovernmental checks and balances provided through the separation of \ngovernmental powers.\n  In our early days as a Nation, we entered into treaties with Native \nAmericans pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution that \nrecognize them as sovereigns. But later, we abandoned the path of an \nhonorable course of dealings, and turned to war. Thousands lost their \nlives through these battles and horrific massacres. The native \npopulation everywhere was decimated.\n  Forced marches to relocate the native people from their traditional \nhomelands to areas west of the Mississippi in the dead of winter cost \nthousands of more lives. Few Americans know that there was not one \nTrail of Tears, but many.\n  The Treaties could have signaled a return to a course of honorable \ndealings with the native people had the U.S. not proceeded to break \nprovisions in every single one of the treaties that were ratified by \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Amazingly, notwithstanding these appalling deeds, the native people \nof the U.S. have always been and continue to be staunchly patriotic and \nloyal to this country. They have volunteered to serve in the defense of \nour nation in every military action and war in which we have been \nengaged, and on a per capita basis, more Native Americans have put \nthemselves in harm's way and given their lives to protect the U.S. than \nany other group of Americans. They have made the greatest sacrifice, \nbut their contributions do not end there.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  We have only to look to the history that is sadly not found in the \npublic school textbooks of America's schools, but has been recorded by \nhistorians and anthropologists and through direct, eye-witness \naccounts, we know that the native people of the U.S. have made \nsignificant contributions to our society in every walk of life, in \nevery profession, in medicine and agriculture and as stewards of the \nlands and resources we all hold dear.\n  There have been great men and women who have led their native nations \nout of war, poverty, and despair. Throughout the generations, they have \nshown us the true meaning of courage in the face of the greatest odds, \nand the quiet strength to persevere.\n  A recent nationwide poll of Americans conducted in March of this year \nreveals that 85 percent of those polled strongly support the setting \naside of a day each year to honor the contributions that native people \nof this land have made to the fabric of American society. Such a day \nwould provide an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about the \nrich cultural legacy that this Nation's native people have given to us.\n  I believe the time has come to honor the first Americans of the \ncountry in this manner, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this \nendeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1853. A bill to promote competition, to preserve the ability of \nlocal governments to provide broadband capability and services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Community \nBroadband Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Smith of Oregon, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator McCain \nof Arizona, Senator McCaskill of Missouri, and Senator Snowe of Maine.\n  Far too many U.S. residents live in areas of the country where there \nis no broadband access. Too many others live in areas where there may \nas well be no access because broadband is so expensive. This \nlegislation will promote economic development, enhance public safety, \nincrease educational opportunities, and improve the lives of the people \nwho live in those areas.\n  In 2004, President Bush called for universal and affordable broadband \nin the U.S. by the year 2007. We are now more than halfway through \n2007, and the U.S. is far from reaching this goal. Not only has the \nU.S. failed to provide universal, affordable broadband, but we are \nlagging far behind other countries. A recent study by the International \nTelecommunication Union shows that the U.S. ranks 15th worldwide in the \npercentage of people with broadband connections. If you take into \naccount the availability of affordable broadband, the U.S. ranks 21st \nin the world. The U.S. should be a leader in providing fast and \naffordable broadband to its citizens.\n  Many of the countries ahead of the U.S. have successfully combined \npublic and private efforts to deploy municipal networks that connect \ntheir residents and businesses with high-speed Internet services. The \nU.S. should be encouraging these innovative networks. We should not be \ncreating obstacles for municipalities that want to provide affordable \nbroadband access. Unfortunately, 14 States have passed legislation to \nprohibit or significantly restrict the ability of local municipalities \nand communities to offer advanced communications services and \ncapabilities to their citizens. More States are considering such \nlegislation. The Community Broadband Act is in response to efforts by \nStates to tell local communities that they cannot establish networks \nfor their residents, even in communities that have no access to \nbroadband, in communities where access is not affordable to all \nresidents, and in communities that want to build high-capacity networks \nthat are comparable to those being built in the leading cities in the \nworld.\n  The Community Broadband Act is a simple bill. It says that no State \ncan prohibit a municipality from offering high-speed Internet to its \nresidents; and when a municipality is a provider, it cannot abuse its \ngovernmental authority as regulator to discriminate against private \ncompetitors. Furthermore, a municipality must comply with Federal \ntelecommunications laws. It also contains provisions to ensure \ntransparency by making sure the public is aware of its town's or city's \neffort and intention to provide broadband either itself or in \npartnership with a private entity, and provides those in the community \nwith an opportunity to be heard on the costs and benefits of the \nproject and potential alternatives.\n  This bill will allow communities to make broadband decisions that \nwould: improve their economy and create jobs by serving as a medium for \ndevelopment, particularly in rural and underserved urban areas; aid \npublic safety and first responders by ensuring access to network \nservices while on the road and in the community; strengthen our \ncountry's international competitiveness by giving businesses the means \nto compete more effectively locally, nationally, and internationally; \nencourage long-distance education through video conferencing and other \nmeans of sharing knowledge and enhancing learning via the Internet; and \ncreate incentives for public-private partnerships.\n  A century ago, there were efforts to prevent local governments from \noffering electricity. Opponents argued that local governments didn't \nhave the expertise to offer something as complex as electricity. They \nalso argued that businesses would suffer if they faced competition from \ncities and towns. But local community leaders recognized that their \neconomic survival depended on electrifying their communities. They knew \nthat it would take both private investment and public investment to \nbring electricity to all Americans.\n  We face a similar situation today. Municipal networks can play an \nessential role in making broadband access universal and affordable. We \nmust not put up barriers to this possibility.\n  Some local governments will decide to do this; others will not. Let \nme be clear, this is not going to be the right decision for every \nmunicipality. But there are plenty of examples of municipalities that \nneed to provide broadband, and those municipalities should have the \npower to do so.\n  A few months ago, the Parish Council of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana \nvoted unanimously to create a wireless network. Jefferson Parish, like \nNew Orleans, was plagued with communications problems following \nHurricane Katrina. New Orleans has already created a wireless network. \nNow, Jefferson Parish plans to establish its own network to make sure \nthat, should another disaster strike, emergency officials and family \nmembers will be able to communicate with one another. During \nnonemergency times, the network will foster communication between \npublic workers and stimulate economic development.\n  These stories come from all across the country, from small towns to \nunderserved urban areas. The small town of Granbury, TX, population \n6,400, initiated a wireless network after waiting years for private \nindustry to take an interest. In Scottsburg, IN, a city and its 6000 \nresidents and businesses north of Louisville, KY, could not get \nbroadband service from their local phone company. When two important \nbusinesses threatened to leave unless they could obtain broadband \nconnectivity, municipal officials stepped forward to provide wireless \nbroadband throughout the town. The town retained the two businesses and \ngained much more. There are many Granburys and Scottsburgs across the \ncountry.\n  There are also underserved urban areas, where private providers may \nexist, but many in the community simply cannot afford the high prices. \nFor example, the City of Philadelphia reports that 90 percent of the \nresidents of its affluent neighborhoods have broadband, whereas only 25 \npercent of residents in its low-income areas have broadband. For that \nreason, Philadelphia is now creating a city-wide wireless network.\n  Community broadband networks have the potential to create jobs, spur \neconomic development, and bring the full benefits of the Information \nAge to everyone. I hope my colleagues will join Senators Smith, Kerry, \nMcCain, McCaskill, Snowe and me in our effort to enact the Community \nBroadband Act of 2007.\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Advanced telecommunications capability.--The term \n     ``advanced telecommunications capability'' has the meaning \n     given that term by section 706(c)(1) of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. 157 note).\n       (2) Public provider.--The term ``public provider'' means a \n     State or political subdivision thereof, any agency, \n     authority, or instrumentality of a State or political \n     subdivision thereof, or an Indian tribe (as defined in \n     section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), or any entity that is \n     owned, controlled, or otherwise affiliated with a State, \n     political subdivision thereof, agency, authority, or \n     instrumentality, or Indian tribe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1854. A bill to amend the Social Security Act and the Public \nHealth Service Act to improve elderly suicide early intervention and \nprevention strategies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stop Senior \nSuicide Act.\n  As many of you know, suicide prevention is an issue close to my heart \nfor personal reasons. In 1972, I lost my own father to suicide. Over \nthe years that followed, my family did not talk about it and instead \ncarried the pain in a very private and lonely way.\n  Sadly, this continued until I was contacted by Jerry and Elsie \nWeyrauch from the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA, a national \nadvocacy organization focused on suicide prevention. Knowing that I had \nlost my dad to suicide, they asked if I would speak at their second \nannual suicide awareness event. I was also asked to sponsor a suicide \nresolution to focus much needed attention on the issue of suicide in \nAmerica. On May 6, 1997, I introduced such a resolution and saw it pass \nthe Senate that same day with unanimous support. I was heartened that \nmy work on suicide prevention had begun on this auspicious note, but it \nwas also clear that much more work remained to be done.\n  Today, 10 years later, I rise to address one of those challenges \nbefore us: the unacceptably high suicide rates among the elderly. While \nthe public is increasingly aware of suicide as a leading cause of death \nin America, what is less well-known is the vulnerability of older \nadults. Suicide is disproportionately a killer of seniors, with the \nrisk climbing steadily with age. In fact, the suicide rate for men 85 \nyears of age and older is the highest of all. Moreover, older adults \nwho attempt suicide are much more likely than younger people to carry \nit out to completion.\n  As shocks to the national conscience, these statistics point us to \nthe despair, hopelessness, and desperation that predispose so many \nseniors to suicide. They also lead to the question: Why are older \nAmericans more vulnerable? Compared to other age groups, they often \nmust deal with social isolation, financial hardship, and debilitating \nillnesses. We also know that far too many have mental health care needs \nthat go unrecognized and unmet. Tragically, one-third of older adults \nwho die from suicide had seen their primary care physician in the week \nbefore their deaths, and 70 percent during the prior month.\n  These findings do not just constitute a serious public health \nproblem. They also conflict with America's belief in living our golden \nyears in dignity. The ``bankruptcy of hope and resources'' affecting \nthose at risk ultimately affect us all as a nation.\n  I am introducing the Stop Senior Suicide Act to take action on this \nissue. As a start, this legislation would create an Interagency \nGeriatric Mental Health Planning Council to improve the geriatric \nmental health and social services delivery system. Composed of \nrepresentatives from the health Federal agencies and the community of \nolder adults, the council will make recommendations and foster the \nintegration of mental health, suicide prevention, health, and aging \nservices. In doing so, the council will ensure that senior suicide and \ngeriatric mental health receive the attention befitting a national \npriority.\n  As another step, my legislation would authorize a grant program for \nsuicide prevention and early intervention programs focused on seniors. \nMany of the risk factors and challenges facing the elderly, after all, \nare unique. Through these grants, public and private nonprofit entities \nwould be able to build innovative approaches and implement them in \nsettings that serve seniors, such as Older Americans Act delivery \nsites. To help grantees achieve their goals, the bill also would \nauthorize additional funding for the Suicide Prevention Technical \nAssistance Center to offer guidance and training.\n\n  Finally, the Stop Senior Suicide Act would eliminate a major barrier \nto receiving and affording mental health care. Clinical depression and \nsuicidal feelings are not a normal part of aging, yet these treatable \nconditions are often misdiagnosed, untreated, or ignored in far too \nmany seniors. Out-of-pocket expenses under Medicare, the health \ninsurance program for 37 million Americans aged 65 years and older, is \na key reason. Medicare currently imposes a 50 percent coinsurance \npayment for outpatient mental health services,\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\neven though it charges just a 20 percent coinsurance for all other \noutpatient care. The resulting coverage inequity discourages \nbeneficiaries, especially low-income and fixed-income retirees, from \nseeking mental health treatment. It keeps some from getting treatment \naltogether. The Stop Senior Suicide Act would thus adjust the 50 \npercent coinsurance to 20 percent.\n  Together, the provisions in the legislation I am introducing today \nare designed to take an important step forward in our efforts to \nprevent senior suicides. That is why the Stop Senior Suicide Act is \nendorsed by the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the \nAmerican Geriatrics Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, Mental Health America, the National \nAlliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of Social Workers, \nthe National Council on Aging, and the Older Women's League. I would \nlike to thank the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA in particular \nfor all its hard work on this issue.\n  Anyone, regardless of age, can be at risk of suicide, but older \nAmericans are especially vulnerable. The resulting call to action will \nonly grow in importance and urgency as more of America's 77 million \nbaby boomers enter their 60s in the coming years. As such, I hope that \nmy Senate colleagues will join me in supporting the Stop Senior Suicide \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Senior Suicide Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The rate of suicide among older adults is higher than \n     that for any other age group, and the suicide rate for \n     individuals 85 years of age and older is the highest of all. \n     In 2004, 6,860 older Americans (age 60 and older) died by \n     suicide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).\n       (2) In 2004, the elderly (age 65 and older) made up only \n     12.4 percent of the population but accounted for 16 percent \n     of all suicides.\n       (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, from 1980 to 1992, the suicide rate rose 9 \n     percent for Americans 65 years of age and above, and rose 35 \n     percent for men and women ages 80 to 84.\n       (4) Older adults have a considerably higher rate of \n     completed suicide than other groups. While for all age groups \n     combined there is one suicide for every 20 attempts, there is \n     one suicide for every 4 attempts among those 65 years of age \n     and older.\n       (5) Of the nearly 35,000,000 Americans age 65 and older, it \n     is estimated that 2,000,000 have a depressive illness and \n     another 5,000,000 suffer from depressive symptoms and \n     syndromes that fall short of meeting full diagnostic criteria \n     for a disorder (Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General, 1999).\n       (6) Seniors covered by Medicare are required to pay a 50 \n     percent co-pay for outpatient mental health services while \n     they are only required to pay a 20 percent co-pay for \n     physical health services.\n       (7) It is estimated that 20 percent of older adults who \n     complete suicide visited a physician within the prior 24 \n     hours, 41 percent within the past week, and 75 percent within \n     the past month (Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent \n     Suicide, 1999).\n       (8) A substantial proportion of older patients receive no \n     treatment or inadequate treatment for their depression in \n     primary care settings (National Institutes of Health \n     Consensus Development Panel on Depression in Late Life, 1992; \n     Lebowitz et al., 1997).\n       (9) Suicide in older adults is most associated with late-\n     onset depression. Among patients 75 years of age and older, \n     60 to 75 percent of suicides have diagnosable depression \n     (Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General, 1999).\n       (10) Research suggests that many seniors receive mental \n     health assistance from their primary care providers or other \n     helping professionals versus specialty mental health \n     professionals (Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General, 1999).\n       (11) Objective 4.6 of the National Strategy for Suicide \n     Prevention calls for increasing the proportion of State Aging \n     Networks that have evidence-based suicide prevention programs \n     designed to identify and refer for treatment of elderly \n     people at risk for suicidal behavior.\n       (12) Objective 1.1 of the President's New Freedom \n     Commission on Mental Health calls for advancing and \n     implementing a national campaign to reduce the stigma of \n     seeking care and a national strategy for suicide prevention. \n     The report addresses targeting to distinct and often hard-to-\n     reach populations, such as ethnic and racial minorities, \n     older men, and adolescents (NFC Report, 2003).\n       (13) One of the top 10 resolutions at the 2005 White House \n     Conference on Aging called for improving the recognition, \n     assessment, and treatment of mental illness and depression \n     among older Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrelief to individuals from the penalty for failure to pay estimated \ntaxes on amounts attributable to the alternative minimum tax in cases \nwhere the taxpayer was not subject to the alternative minimum tax in \nthe preceding year; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, right now millions of Americans don't \nknow whether they should be paying an estimated tax because Congress \nhasn't passed AMT relief. In other words, there are many taxpayers who \nwill be facing a big tax bill if we don't pass AMT relief. By law, many \nof these taxpayers should be paying estimated tax right now based on \nthe fact that as the law is today, they are subject to the AMT. In \norder to these taxpayers, I am introducing the AMT Penalty Protection \nAct of 2007.\n  Under this legislation, in computing tax for purpose of the penalties \nin the\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\ntax code dealing with estimated tax, a taxpayer would be permitted to \ndisregard the alternative minimum tax if the individual was not liable \nfor the alternative minimum tax for the preceding tax year.\n  So if you didn't have to pay AMT last year we aren't going to \npenalize you if you don't file estimated taxes for AMT this year.\n  Just because Congress can't do its job, doesn't mean the taxpayer \nshould be punished.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
