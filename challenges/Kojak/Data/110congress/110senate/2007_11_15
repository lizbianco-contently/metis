Mr. President, if the majority leader is not coming \nout, I will use a little of my leader time.\n  Americans were shocked earlier this year to learn about the \nconditions at Walter Reed Medical Center, and Members of Congress were \nright to seize the moment by pledging to veterans they would do \neverything they could to give them what they need. As Speaker Pelosi \nput it, in the military, we always say: In battle, we will never leave \na soldier in the battlefield; and we say when they come home, we will \nnot abandon them, so we should have the best possible opportunities for \nthem when they do come home.\n  The veterans spending bill gave Speaker Pelosi and the rest of the \nDemocrats in Congress an opportunity to make good on that pledge. So \nfar, that opportunity has been squandered. The veterans bill was ready \nmore than 2 months ago. It had overwhelming bipartisan support in both \nChambers. The House version passed in June by a vote of 409 to 2, the \nSenate version passed in September by a vote of 92 to 1, and the \nPresident has been ready to sign it for weeks. What is the holdup? \nDemocrats must have decided somehow it works to their advantage to hold \nonto this bill for political leverage. We know this because they \nattached it to a bill the President said he would reject, and which he \ndid reject, and now it is back on the shelf and veterans are still \nwaiting. Americans need to know what is going on. The majority is \nholding onto this bill which contains money for critical new programs \nfor veterans returning from battle.\n  There is still time to change course and we must. So I call on the \nmajority to end this game. The fiscal year has come and gone without \nacting on this bill. Veterans Day passed without enacting the bill. Now \nis the time to take it off the shelf, blow the dust off, and get it to \nthe President's desk for his signature before the Thanksgiving recess.\n  The majority's strategy on this bill is meant to put pressure on \nPresident Bush, but all it is doing is putting pressure on our already \nstrained VA and delaying critical help to veterans and their families. \nTroops are finally coming home from Iraq. They deserve better than this \nwhen they get here, remove their uniforms, and return to our \ncommunities.\n  At this moment, two very good and worthy goals stand before us: \nfunding our veterans and getting funding for our troops in harm's way. \nWe promised them we would do this with both the Gregg and Murray \namendments earlier this year. We can achieve it before the recess. \nRepublicans are ready. I would call on the Democrats to join us in \nachieving these good things before the recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14425-7", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14425-S14426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Sergeant Matthew L. Deckard\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today because a son of Kentucky \nhas fallen. I am speaking of SGT Matthew L. Deckard of Elizabethtown, \nKY. He was 29 years old.\n\n[[Page S14426]]\n\n  On September 16, 2005, Sergeant Deckard was driving an M1A1 Abrams \ntank during patrol operations in Baghdad when an improvised explosive \ndevice set by terrorists detonated near another tank in his patrol, \nkilling two soldiers and wounding two others.\n  Sergeant Deckard heroically left the shelter--left the shelter--of \nhis M1A1 Abrams to help tend to his fallen and wounded comrades. \nShortly after returning to his own tank, a second device exploded, this \ntime tragically taking Sergeant Deckard's life.\n  For his courage and bravery as a soldier, Sergeant Deckard received \nnumerous medals and awards, including the Bronze Star Medal and two \nPurple Hearts. His family saw him laid to rest in Harlan, KY, with full \nmilitary honors.\n  Sergeant Deckard--Matt to his family and friends--was in that tank \nbecause he wanted to be there. More specifically, he wanted to follow \nin the footsteps of his stepfather, Glenn Gill, a retired U.S. Army \nstaff sergeant and former tanker himself.\n  Matt was ``learning about the M1 tank before he ever went into the \nArmy,'' Mr. Gill says.\n  When the M1 Abrams tank was still new in the early 1980s, Mr. Gill \nwould receive the tank's training manuals. Young Matt often borrowed \nthem to read. He borrowed them so often that when Mr. Gill couldn't \nfind one of his manuals, he knew right where to look.\n  Matt grew up in Elizabethtown, and he also spent several years of his \nchildhood at Fort Knox, KY, where his stepfather was stationed. A \n``normal country boy,'' as his stepfather describes him, he grew up \nhunting, fishing and learning to work on cars.\n  Matt graduated from Elizabethtown High School in 1994, and in \nDecember of that year married his high school sweetheart, Angela. Then \nin January 1995, Matt fulfilled his lifelong goal and joined the U.S. \nArmy.\n  Matt took his training at Fort Knox, did a tour of duty in South \nKorea, and was assigned to the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA.\n  Matt and Angela were blessed with three children, and Matt's family \nwas the pride of his life. Daughter Makayla was his ``princess,'' elder \nson Matthew Noah his ``little man,'' and younger son Austin the baby of \nthe family. Matt loved to take his kids fishing or to the beach.\n  Family came first whenever Matt had time away from work. ``We had \ndate nights, just me and him,'' says his wife, Angela. ``We had movie \nnights with the kids. When he came home for R, or just any time he \ncame home from work, he would just jump for joy that they were right \nthere with him. It made his night, every night.''\n  Matt was deployed to Iraq twice. The first time, he was originally \nsent to Kuwait in November 2002, later moving into Iraq and staying \nthere until August 2003. He was among the first American troops to \nenter Baghdad in the liberation of that country from dictatorship in \n2003.\n  Matt's second Iraq deployment began in January 2005. An experienced \nsoldier with 10 years of service, he spent his time where he had always \nwanted to--around tanks. He served as a driver, gunner, and loader.\n  ``Matt was in the Army as a career soldier and to make a better life \nfor his family,'' Mr. Gill says. ``Definitely, he loved it. . . . That \nwas his ambition.''\n  The family he left behind is in my thoughts and prayers today as I \nrecount Matt's story. I wish to recognize his wife, Angela, his mother \nand stepfather, Cassie and Glenn Gill, his daughter, Makayla, his sons, \nMatthew Noah and Austin, his brother, Michael Deckard, his sister, \nMichelle Best, and other beloved family members and friends.\n  Today, in the Elizabethtown Memorial Gardens cemetery in \nElizabethtown, KY, there is a monument to Sergeant Deckard. His family \ndesigned it, had it built, and with help from friends, paid for it to \nbe erected in tribute to their lost husband, son, brother, and father.\n  Matt's family held a dedication ceremony for this monument on \nFebruary 3 of this year. A color guard team from Fort Knox raised the \nflags, and the local American Legion post performed the wreath-laying \nceremony.\n  Flying underneath the American flag, Matt's stepfather, Glenn, has \nraised the Armed Forces Memorial Tribute flag, so we will never forget \nthe brave men and women in uniform who have given their lives for this \nNation.\n  On the monument, Matt's face is boldly etched into a slab of black \ngranite. Next to that perches a bronze eagle. Underneath the eagle are \nthe words, ``Freedom is not free.''\n  The loss of Sergeant Deckard proves that true. His family and friends \nall have paid a very heavy price.\n  Nothing we can say here today can ease their terrible loss. But we \ncan remind them that Matt lived to fulfill--in the words of his \nstepfather, whose career path he followed--his life's ambition.\n  And we can reassure them that America will forever honor and remember \nSGT Matthew L. Deckard's sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14426-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when I have \n1 minute left on my time, and I thank the Chair; and I, of course, join \nthe Republican leader in paying tribute to all the members of our Armed \nForces, those who continue to serve, those who have completed their \nservice, and particularly those whom we have lost and their families.\n  But the Senate still needs to address Iraq. The American people voted \na year ago to end the war and we haven't followed through. We need to \naddress this issue and to end this misguided war now, before more \nAmericans are injured and killed.\n  The bridge fund passed yesterday by the House isn't good enough. The \ngoal for redeployment doesn't cut it. We need a binding deadline, which \nmeans we need to pass the Feingold-Reid bill.\n  Despite recent reports of a downturn in violence in Iraq, violence \nremains at unacceptable levels. 2007 has already been declared the \nbloodiest year since the war in Iraq started, and that is with almost 2 \nmonths still to go. Those counts don't bring in the number of Iraqis \nkilled. On a relatively quiet day earlier this week, with no reported \ncoalition tragedies, at least 33 Iraqis were killed and an equal number \nwounded in violence around the country. We can't say violence is down \nwhen violence around the country remains so high, when so many \nAmericans are being killed and when so many Iraqis are afraid to walk \nthe streets.\n  The underlying reality is we are working with both sides of the Iraqi \ncivil war and deepening our dependence on former insurgents and \nmilitia-infiltrated security forces.\n  Meanwhile, the situation in the North and South is precarious at \nbest. Unrest in these areas threatens the security of our supply lines.\n  The most recent National Intelligence Estimate largely attributed the \ndecline in violence--particularly in Baghdad--to population \ndisplacements. Baghdad is now predominantly Shi'ite. While the purpose \nof the surge was to foster reconciliation, the reality is that the \nnumber of Iraqis displaced by the conflict doubled since the start of \nthe surge, adding to millions already pushed out of their homes from \n2003 to 2006.\n  Meanwhile, we have put our troops outside the forward operating bases \nin more dangerous territory for the purpose of policing the Iraqi civil \nwar. When they are out in those joint security stations, they have to \nspend half\n\n[[Page S14427]]\n\ntheir time watching their backs because our ``allies'' are former Sunni \ninsurgents and Iraqi Security Forces, neither of whom can be trusted.\n  We continue to supposedly ``train'' Iraqi Security Forces despite the \nfact that we finished training over 300,000 of them over a year ago. Of \ncourse, we may well be simply contributing to the Iraqi civil war by \n``training'' and arming forces that are infiltrated by militias. We \ncan't even account for the guns we have given them.\n  The ``al Anbar'' strategy--signing cease fires I with insurgents who \nwere attacking our guys not too long ago--does not have the support of \nthe Iraqi government. It is a poor substitute for meaningful \nreconciliation, which supposedly the surge is going to foster. Now the \nadministration is shifting the goal posts and talking about ``bottom-\nup'' reconciliation.\n  We have seen the levels of violence in Iraq shift before--this is \nnothing new. If my colleagues think the surge is working and violence \nis down--let's get out while the getting is good. Without meaningful \nreconciliation, the violence will spike up again, that's for sure. So \nlet's not wait around for that to happen.\n  Many U.S. troops currently in Iraq are now in their second or third \ntours of duty. Approximately 95 percent of the Army National Guard's \ncombat battalions and special operations units have been mobilized \nsince 9/11.\n  Mr. President, 1.4 million Americans have served in Iraq, and over \n400,000 have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nearly \n4,000 have been killed in Iraq and over 27,000 have been wounded.\n  The Army cannot maintain its current pace of operations in Iraq \nwithout seriously damaging the military. Young officers are leaving the \nservice at an alarming rate.\n  Readiness levels for the Army are at lows not seen since Vietnam. \nEvery active Army brigade currently not deployed is unprepared to \nperform its wartime mission.\n  More than two-thirds of active duty Army brigades are unready for \nmissions because of manpower and equipment shortages--most of which can \nbe attributed to Iraq.\n  There are insufficient Reserves to respond to additional conflicts or \ncrises around the world, of which there are, of course, potentially \nmany.\n  This failure to prioritize correctly has left vital missions \nunattended. Natural disaster response, U.S. border security, and \ninternational efforts to combat al Qaida are all suffering due to the \nstrain on military forces caused by poor strategy and failed leadership \nin Iraq.\n  Thousands of our troops have returned home with invisible wounds; \nsuch as PTSD and TBI--traumatic brain injury, which will have a long-\nterm impact on veterans and their families. These invisible wounds are \nnot counted in the casualty numbers, but we will be struggling with \nthem for a generation or more.\n  The cost of the War? America has been in Iraq longer than it was in \nWorld War II.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said the war would cost less than $50 billion. The \nadministration has now requested over $600 billion for the war.\n  If we don't change course in Iraq, the cost of the war is likely to \nballoon to $3.5 trillion.\n  If we keep a ``Korea-like presence'' in Iraq, as Secretary Gates has \npredicted, this means we will have 55,000 troops in Iraq by 2013--a \nlevel that remains constant until 2017. And while this drop would \ncertainly be cheaper, it would still mean an additional $690 billion. \nCBO has estimated that, just paying the interest on the money we have \nborrowed to pay for the war to date, will cost another $415 billion.\n  We are currently spending nearly $9 billion a month in Iraq. In 3 \nmonths in Iraq, we spend nearly the same amount that we spend on \nforeign relations and aid worldwide in 1 year.\n  The fiscal year total spending of the war--$150 billion--is greater \nthan the combination of spending on our national transportation \ninfrastructure, health research, customs and border protection, higher \neducation assistance, environmental protection, Head Start, and the \nCHIP program. Our national programs are being neglected because of this \ndisastrous war and future generations will bear the brunt of our \nmisguided policy.\n  The costs are only rising. We spent twice as much this year in Iraq \nas we did in 2004.\n  The President continues to mislead the country about al-Qaida and \nIraq. Contrary to the President's assertions, Pakistan and Afghanistan, \nnot Iraq, are the key theater in this global conflict. While the \nadministration has focused on Iraq, al-Qaida has reconstituted itself \nalong the Afghanistan- Pakistan border.\n  The President also presents a false choice between fighting al-Qaida \nin Iraq and doing nothing. Every single redeployment proposal includes \nthe option of targeted operations against al-Qaida within Iraq. The \ndifference is that the President seems to think that 160,000 or 180,000 \ntroops, sent to Iraq for an entirely different purpose, need to stay.\n  We cannot ignore the rest of the world to focus solely on Iraq. Al-\nQaida is and will continue to be a global terrorist organization with \ndangerous affiliates around the world. Contrary to what the \nadministration has implied, al-Qaida is not abandoning its efforts to \nfight us globally so that it can fight us in Iraq. That is absurd.\n  We need a robust military presence and effective reconstruction \nprogram in Afghanistan. We need to build strong partnerships where AQ \nand its affiliates are operating--across North Africa, in Southeast \nAsia, and along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And we \nneed to address the root causes of the terrorist threat, not just rely \non military power to get the job done.\n  For example, right now, Iran's strategic position continues to \nimprove and the situation on the Turkish border is explosive. We are \nbogged down in Iraq and exposed to attack from all sides, and our \nability to promote regional stability from a position of strength is \nundermined.\n  Maintaining a huge, open-ended presence is igniting tensions in the \nregion, and playing into the hands of the Iranian regime. Iran is able \nto expand their influence while we take the hits, in terms of \ncasualties and finances. Our open-ended presence in Iraq is a blessing \nfor Iran because it provides them with a buffer and mitigates any \npotential conflict between those two countries. It also removes any \nincentive for Iran to engage in a constructive manner.\n  Maintaining a significant U.S. troop presence in Iraq is undermining \nour ability to deter Iran as it increases its influence in Iraq, \nbecomes bolder in its nuclear aspirations, and continues to support \nHezbollah.\n  The American people want us out of Iraq. The administration's policy \nis clearly untenable. The American people know that, which is why they \nvoted the way they did in November. More than 60 percent of Americans \nare in favor of a phased withdrawal. They do not want to pass this \nproblem off to another President, and another Congress. And they sure \ndon't want another American servicemember to die, or lose a limb, while \nelected representatives put their own political comfort over the wishes \nof their constituents.\n\n  The Feingold-Reid amendment requires the President to safely redeploy \nU.S. troops from Iraq by June 30, 2008. At that point, funding for \nmilitary operations in Iraq is terminated, with narrow exceptions for \ntargeted operations against al-Qaida and its affiliates; providing \nsecurity for U.S. Government personnel and infrastructure; and training \nIraqis.\n  We have narrowed the training exception to prevent training of Iraqi \nSecurity Forces--ISF--who took part in sectarian violence or attacks \nagainst U.S. troops. The exception also prohibits U.S. troops training \nIraqis from being embedded with or taking part in combat operations \nwith the ISF. These changes are intended to address concerns about the \nperformance of the ISF--which has been infiltrated by Shia militias and \naccused of attacks upon U.S. troops--and to make sure that ``training'' \nis not used as a loophole to allow substantial numbers of U.S. troops \nto remain in Iraq for combat purposes.\n  The other two exceptions are appropriately narrow: the \ncounterterrorism exception applies to operations against al-Qaida and \naffiliated international terrorist organizations, while force \nprotection applies to protecting U.S.\n\n[[Page S14428]]\n\nGovernment personnel and infrastructure.\n  The time has come for the Senate to seriously engage on this issue. \nThe costs and the tragedy of this war are plainly unacceptable and \ncontrary to the will of the American people.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 1077\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that S. 1077 be discharged \nfrom the Foreign Relations Committee, be placed on the calendar, and at \na time to be determined by the majority leader following consultation \nwith the Republican leader, the Senate may proceed to consideration of \nS. 1077 and it be considered under the following limitations: that the \nonly amendment in order be a Feingold-Reid amendment which is the text \nof the amendment offered on the DOD authorization measure; that there \nbe a total time limitation of 2 hours of debate on the bill and the \namendment, with the time divided and controlled in the usual form, and \nupon the use of that time the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \namendment; that upon disposition of the amendment, the bill, as \namended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate then proceed \nto vote on passage of the bill, without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am, of course, disappointed Republicans have again \nblocked us from debating and voting on legislation to end the war in \nIraq. S. 1077 is the bill I introduced with the majority leader, Harry \nReid, and eight other Senators earlier this year to safely redeploy \ntroops from Iraq. The substitute amendment is the amendment we offered \nto the Defense authorization bill in September. It is, in effect, just \na tweaked version of S. 1077. The majority leader joins me in these \nefforts.\n  There is simply no good reason to block a vote on this important \nbill. I assure my colleagues I am not going to go away, and this issue \nwill not go away either, much as they might prefer it. Until Congress \nbrings a halt to the President's open-ended, misguided war in Iraq, we \nwill have debates and votes on this issue again and again and again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, here we go again. We have had an effort to \ntake another vote on whether we should pull out of Iraq. Apparently, it \nis based on public opinion polls. Some think it would be popular, and \ncertainly the moveon.org and Code Pink wing of the majority party would \nbe very happy if we could have crammed down a measure to make a \nsubstantial change in our policy without even allowing an amendment. It \nis absolutely unacceptable on its face.\n  I object not only on behalf of myself and many of my colleagues but \nfor the brave men and women from America who volunteered to go into \nharm's way for our security and to promote security in the world. \nRetreat and defeat may be politically popular with some, but this kind \nof poison pill does great injustice to what our American volunteers \nhave done. From the people on the ground, when we first started \nconsidering these retreat-and-defeat measures, I heard a very heartfelt \nplea: We have made too many contributions and made too many sacrifices \nto see it all go for naught because of political maneuvering on Capitol \nHill. That comes from people who have seen their comrades fall in \nbattle.\n  This year alone, the Democrats have attempted at least nine times to \nforce the President to change the military strategy and tactics in \nIraq, on the misbegotten notion that somehow we, in this comfortable \nsetting of Congress, can make better military, tactical, and strategic \ndecisions than our commanders on the ground. I find that deplorable.\n  It used to be the tradition of this body, of America, that we \nsupported our troops when they were going in harm's way. Now some are \ndoing everything possible to undermine their efforts. Nine times they \nhave tried to change the policy. After 77 of us voted to send troops \ninto Iraq because we knew it was a dangerous place, we found out--by \nthe Iraq Survey Group--that it was even more dangerous.\n  Make no mistake, while some in this body may not think Iraq is \nimportant, two people whose activities I try to follow fairly closely \nin intelligence, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, his No. 2 man, \nthink Iraq should be the headquarters of their caliphate, the \nheadquarters of their vicious terrorist empire that wants to subjugate \nthe region and threaten the United States.\n  Now, however, there is a key difference from earlier because we are \nseeing dramatic improvements in the security situation in Iraq, in \nparticular in Al Anbar Province, which a year ago was a deadly place, a \ndeadly place into which American troops could only go under heavy fire.\n  My son and several thousand marines are coming home because they have \nsucceeded. Yes, there is a strategy for drawing down our troops. The \nPresident has announced it. It is called ``return on success.'' We \nbring the troops back when they have succeeded in their mission.\n  In Iraq, in Al Anbar, I have heard from people who are imbedded with \nIraqi security forces that times have changed. There now are Iraqi \ncitizen groups, citizen watch groups, who look for IEDs, who will \nidentify foreign terrorists--al-Qaida types--who come into the area, \nand who will point out factories designed to build explosive vehicles. \nThey turn that over to the Iraqi police in the area, and they clean it \nup. I have heard from a guy on the ground who is responsible for \nmaintaining stability and security from the terrorists that the marines \nwere no longer needed. So they are coming back. This is being \nreplicated in places throughout Iraq.\n  Have we finished? We have not finished the job. There are still other \nareas, but it means we are succeeding. Iraqis are going about their \nnormal business. Unfortunately for our fighting men and women and the \nIraqi people who put their trust in us to see this mission through, too \nrarely are their successes being reported. They are ignored, although \nthe New York Times, on the back page, I think, this past weekend, \npointed out that we had routed al-Qaida in Iraq. Surprise. That wasn't \non the front page, did not make headlines, because it has indicated a \nmajor change. Have you heard much about the success of General Petraeus \nand the counterinsurgency strategy after he testified on Capitol Hill? \nIf you are like most Americans, the answer is you have heard very \nlittle, because it has fundamentally changed. While the media has \nalways been quick to report bombings and failures in Iraq, it is simply \nnot providing all of the good news.\n  They have been remarkably successful in 2007 in reducing violence. \nYes, with the surge, with the new strategy, there was violence. But, \naccording to General Odierno, the operational commander of U.S. forces \nin Iraq, enemy attacks are now at their lowest level since January 2006 \nand continue to drop. There has been a 60-percent decrease in IED \nattacks.\n  The reduction in violence is partly as a result of the presence of \nadditional American forces and their adoption of the sound \ncounterinsurgency strategy--go in and clear an area, work with the \nIraqi security forces, and help them build an economy, a neighborhood, \na safe place. It is also because the leaders on the ground in Iraq, the \nSunni sheiks, have said--they have seen what continued terrorist \nattacks do to their country, to their people. The most frequent victims \nare Iraqis, good Muslim Iraqis who are being killed by the terrorists. \nThey want to cooperate with us, and they are building, from the ground \nup, a stable, reliable, peaceful control over the area with the Iraqi \nsecurity forces. Yes, some of them fought against us in the past, but \nthey are now on our side because we are on their side and we are \nhelping them. And when they take over, we will move back.\n  Now, I am fully aware of and concerned about the lack of political \nreconciliation. But, again, from boots on the ground, I hear: How do \nyou expect them to establish a perfect democracy when this country is \nstill not secure? Our goal in Iraq must be to work with the Iraqis, the \nIraqi security forces, and responsible leaders to establish relative \npeace and security in the area.\n\n[[Page S14429]]\n\n  What would happen if we withdrew precipitously for a political goal? \nWe learned in an open hearing of the Intelligence Committee in January \nthat if we pull out before we have stabilized this area and left in \nplace Iraqi security forces, there would be chaos, and three bad things \nwould happen: No. 1, there would be greatly increased violence among \nSunni and Shia; there would likely be intervention by other states \ncoming into Iraq to protect their coreligionists, potentially a civil \nwar spreading into a region-wide war in a vital security and energy \npart of the world; but most dangerous for United States, and this is \nsomething my colleagues who want to cut and run seem to refuse to \nacknowledge, is that al-Qaida would be able to establish a safe haven. \nYes, they have been driven off to the hills, the mountainous regions \nsomewhere in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but they cannot mobilize and \nexercise their command and control. If they had a place for command and \ncontrol, had access to the oil riches of Iraq to fund their deeds, we \nwould be significantly at greater risk to weapons of mass destruction \nattacks by terrorist groups funded and supported by al-Qaida.\n  We need to be realistic in defining what reconciliation is. It is a \nlong process. To this day, for example, not all outstanding political \ntensions have been reconciled in Northern Ireland, in Bosnia, or \nKosovo. Yet the civil wars and the terrorist campaigns that once \nthreatened to engulf those areas have ended, and competing factions are \npursuing their agendas primarily by peaceful political means.\n\n  Our men and women in uniform are fighting in Iraq to bring violence \nunder control, to destroy al-Qaida, to drive out destabilizing Iranian \nmeddling, and to establish a relatively stable and secure structure in \nIraq, and they are making progress to those goals.\n  Getting a perfect democracy--we thought we had a perfect Jeffersonian \ndemocracy; then we had to have a Lincolnian republic after the Civil \nWar. We are continuing to see the democracy. While it is the best of \nall the other bad situations, it is not perfect and does not work in a \nclear upward path; it takes time. And now we are seeing the questions \nbeing worked out at the local level on revenue sharing, oil revenue \nsharing. But to push a retreat-and-defeat, a delay-and-deny battle for \nthe funds for our troops on the ground is unthinkable. This unanimous \nconsent agreement to which I objected would be the ultimate cut and \nrun: declare defeat, and hope to be rewarded in 2008 at the polls--a \nvery regrettable effort by our colleagues on the other side.\n  The 2008 Defense appropriations bill recently passed by Congress \nincludes no funding for our current operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand the global war on terror. For 3 years prior to this, we included \nemergency funding for the regular Defense appropriations bill to cover \nthe cost of military operations until a full supplemental could be \nadopted. We are now seeing, coming over from the House, a pittance of \nwhat is needed, encapsulated in all kinds of restrictions that tie the \nhands of the troops on the ground and put unreasonable restrictions on \nthem that are likely to cause much greater danger to American \npersonnel, military and civilian, over there. What we need to provide--\nand I hope we will be able to put an alternative emergency funding bill \non the floor--are funds for force protection initiatives, body armor, \nhelmets, ballistic eye protection, even knee and elbow pads, flares, \nand armor. The 2008 Defense spending bill did include funding for \nMRAPs, but why did the Democrats insist on omitting other critical \nitems?\n  Now that DOD will be forced to continue robbing Peter to pay Paul in \norder to fund operations, it has a tremendously negative impact, not \nonly on the way we conduct the war but how the Department of Defense \noperates. Important equipment reset and other procurement programs have \nto be slowed down. It will impact the availability of equipment, \nincluding critical equipment for the National Guard needed to respond \nto domestic emergencies. Without this funding, the Pentagon is forced \nto divert money from their regular accounts to fund overseas \noperations, about $13 billion a month.\n  I have a letter that has just been sent by Gordon England. He has \npointed out what this would mean to the Defense Department. It means, \namong other things, the Deputy Secretary of Defense said, they will \nhave no choice but to deplete appropriations accounts, and it will \nresult in a profoundly negative impact on the defense civilian working \nforce, depot maintenance, base operations, and training activities, and \nwithin a few weeks they will be required by law to issue notices of \ntermination to civilian employees.\n  In addition, a lack of any funding for the Iraqi security forces and \nthe Afghanistan national security forces directly undermines the \nability of the United States to continue training and equipping Iraqi \nand Afghanistan troops who are needed to take over. This makes \nabsolutely no sense in a time of war. We deny the needed funding that \nwill keep our troops--not only keep the troops in the field but support \nthose who are working to assure that we can turn over the \nresponsibility to them.\n  This is absolutely the wrong message to send to our deployed troops. \nWe must provide emergency funding without political timetables to win \nvotes at home but undermine our troops.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nDeputy Secretary of Defense England to House Defense Subcommittee \nchairman John Murtha and an article in today's Washington Times called \n``War Funds Under Attack.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 2007.\n     Hon. John Murtha,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman. I am deeply concerned that the Fiscal \n     Year 2008 Appropriations Conference Report currently under \n     consideration does not provide necessary funding for military \n     operations and will result in having to shut down significant \n     portions of the Defense Department by early next year. Last \n     week, Secretary Gates reiterated the Department's request \n     that Congress pass the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense budget \n     request promptly and in its entirety, including for Global \n     War on Terrorism (GWOT) operations. Lacking complete funding, \n     the Department requested that sufficient funds be provided to \n     continue global operations and to allow equipment reset.\n       Without this critical funding, the Department will have no \n     choice but to deplete key appropriations accounts by early \n     next year. In particular, the Army's Operation and \n     Maintenance account will be completely exhausted in mid-to-\n     late-January, and the limited general transfer authority \n     available can only provide three additional weeks of relief. \n     This situation will result in a profoundly negative impact on \n     the defense civilian workforce, depot maintenance, base \n     operations, and training activities. Specifically, the \n     Department would have to begin notifications as early as next \n     month to properly carry out the resultant closure of military \n     facilities, furloughing of civilian workers and deferral of \n     contract activity.\n       In addition, the lack of any funding for the Iraqi Security \n     Forces and the Afghanistan National Security Forces directly \n     undermines the United States' ability to continue training \n     and equipping Iraqi and Afghani security forces, thereby \n     lengthening the time until they can assume full security \n     responsibilities. Further, the conference report provides \n     only $120 million for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device \n     Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), which is a small fraction of \n     what is required to sustain ongoing efforts to protect our \n     forces against this deadly threat.\n       I urge you to take whatever steps are necessary to promptly \n     pass legislation that properly supports and sustains our \n     troops in the field. The successes they have achieved in \n     recent months will be short lived without appropriate \n     resources to continue their good work. I ask that you provide \n     them complete and unencumbered GWOT funding as soon as \n     possible.\n     Gordon England.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 15, 2007]\n\n                         War Funds Under Attack\n\n                  (By S.A. Miller and Sara A. Carter)\n\n       The Pentagon yesterday warned that money was already \n     running out for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as \n     congressional Democrats dismissed recent security gains and \n     threatened to stall emergency war funds.\n       ``The Army is in a particularly precarious situation,'' \n     Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. ``Absent extraordinary \n     measures, it would run out of money by mid-February--so quick \n     congressional action is needed as quickly as possible.''\n       The Defense Department had to start shuffling funds to \n     cover war costs Tuesday after the president signed the \n     department's $471 billion spending bill that did not include \n     war funds but allowed account transfers, he said.\n       Nevertheless, House Democrats passed a $50 billion war-\n     spending bill last night with a 218-203 vote that President \n     Bush promises to veto because it mandates a U.S. pullout from \n     Iraq start immediately with a goal of a nearly complete \n     withdrawal by December 2008.\n\n[[Page S14430]]\n\n       The bill mimics Democrats' previous challenges to Iraq \n     policy and likely will stall emergency funds, which would pay \n     for about three months of warfare while lawmakers debate the \n     rest of the $196.4 billion war-funds request for 2008.\n       The top Democrats--House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California \n     and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada--say they \n     will withhold troop funds for at least the rest of the year \n     if Mr. Bush does not accept the pullout timetable.\n       ``There is a growing sense within our caucus that it is \n     time to play hardball,'' said Rep. Jim McGovern, \n     Massachusetts Democrat and outspoken war critic. ``This is \n     George Bush's war. He started it. He's got to finish it.''\n       White House press secretary Dana Perino said Democrats used \n     the pullout bill ``for political posturing and to appease \n     radical groups.''\n       ``Once again, the Democratic leadership is starting this \n     debate with a flawed strategy, including a withdrawal date \n     for Iraq despite the gains our military has made over the \n     past year, despite having dozens of similar votes in the past \n     that have failed and despite their pledge to support the \n     troops,'' she said.\n       ``The president put forward this funding request based on \n     the recommendation of our commanders in the field,'' Mrs. \n     Perino said. ``The Democrats believe that these votes will \n     somehow punish the president, but it actually punishes the \n     troops.''\n       House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, \n     said recent progress in Iraq--a sharp decline in U.S. \n     casualties, fewer Iraqi civilian deaths and fewer mortar \n     rocket attacks and ``indirect fire'' attacks--were temporary \n     improvements from the troop surge this summer.\n       ``What has not happened is what the administration \n     predicted would happen, [that] an environment would be \n     created where political reconciliation would occur,'' Mr. \n     Hoyer told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n       ``Violence is down. I am happy that violence is down,'' he \n     said. ``What is not up is, this year, we've lost more people \n     than any other year in this war. This year, more refugees \n     were created than any other year in this war.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few moments this \nmorning talking about the business as usual in Washington.\n  As a nearly 60-year-old male baby boomer, I believe we face some of \nthe most serious challenges we have ever faced as a nation, and \ncertainly in my lifetime. The challenges are going to continue to grow \nunless Congress changes how it works, how it does business, and starts \nsetting priorities. The last election was about change. We heard a lot \nof great promises, and I think they were well-intentioned. But let's \nlook at what has happened.\n  After the last election, we were told we would have an earmark \nmoratorium until we had a real reform process that was in place. We do \nnot have a reform process; we have a faint claim for a reform process. \nInstead, we have seen thousands--the average is 2,000 earmarks per \nbill. The American people were told that the earmark process would be \nmore transparent. Yet we have seen Congress backtrack on that at every \nopportunity.\n  The earmark reform has really been a triumph of ``business as \nusual.'' The original Senate version of S. 1 required Senators to \npublicly disclose the following within 48 hours of the committee \nreceiving the information: the earmark recipient, the earmark's \npurpose, certification that neither they nor their spouse would \ndirectly benefit from the earmark. Now, what is in the real language? \nThe real language was secretly changed. It no longer requires public \ndisclosure of who is going to get the earmark or the earmark's purpose. \nThat is the Senate's rules.\n  You know, there is a foundational principle; that is, you cannot have \naccountability in anything unless you have transparency. What we have \nis obfuscation of transparency.\n  We don't want the American people to see who is going to get an \nearmark or what its purpose is. Thankfully, we passed the transparency \nand accountability act that starts this January so the American people \nare going to see it anyway, except they are going to unfortunately have \nto see it after the fact.\n  Yesterday my office learned of another attack against transparency. \nThe just-released conference report for the Transportation-HUD spending \nbill contains an earmark provision that attempts to prohibit the White \nHouse from releasing publicly its budget justifications. When they send \nup their budget, they send the reasons for why they want that money \nspent in certain ways. I worked last year to make sure that OMB agreed \nthat the American people were entitled to see the justification for why \nthey would want to spend money in certain areas. The appropriations \nprocess doesn't want that to be public. Why should it not be public? \nWhy should we not want to know why the administration wants to spend \ncertain money in certain ways and their reasoning and justification?\n  There is a reason why this was added. This was added so the \nauthorizing committees won't have the same information the \nappropriations committees have. We are not supposed to be appropriating \nanything that isn't authorized, yet we continue to do so. This is a \ncommonsense approach to make transparent to the American public as well \nas the rest of the Members of this body the justification and reasoning \nof the administration.\n  I agree, the broken promises we have seen have contributed to the 11-\npercent favorability rating of Congress. It isn't a Republican or \nDemocratic issue. No Americans want their leaders to say one thing and \nthen do another. The American people are tired of hearing the same \ndefenses of the earmark favor factor. They didn't work when Republicans \nwere in control, and they will not work today.\n  Let's talk about that for a minute. The earmark system exists to \nserve politicians, not local communities. Members earmark funds rather \nthan advocate for grants because they want the political credit for \nspending money. Earmarks oftentimes are worthwhile, but the system \nunder which they are propagated is not. Earmarks are the gateway drug \nto overspending, one of the No. 1 issues for which the American people \nhave a problem with Congress. Our problem is, we refuse to make the \ntough choices families have to make every day, every week within their \nown budgets. Consequently, we now have this last week surpassed $9 \ntrillion on the debt. We have $79 trillion worth of unfunded liability \nwhich is going to cause us to break the chain of heritage of this \ncountry. That heritage is one of sacrifice where one generation works \nhard, makes sacrifices to create at least the same or hopefully better \nopportunities for those generations to come.\n  We have heard complaints that it is illegitimate to single out or \nstrike an earmark with an amendment. It is not our money. It is the \nAmerican people's money. What is scandalous is how few of the special \ninterest projects are ever challenged on the floor. Only one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the more than 60,000 earmarks passed since 1998 have ever \nreceived a vote. Where is the accountability with that? Where is the \ntransparency?\n  Finally, we hear Senators complain that it is partisan to strike \nindividual earmarks. I can't speak for anyone else, but I have been \ngoing after this process for a decade. No one has gone after more \nRepublican earmarks than I. Plus, if you don't like my amendments, I \nask the body to offer some of their own. I would appreciate the help. \nIn spite of a lot of grand talk about earmark reform, we haven't seen \nanyone on the other side of the aisle attempt to strike an individual \nearmark. Does that mean all these projects are worthwhile? Is there not \na single earmark in the 32,000 requests this year that should not be \ndebated on the floor of the Senate?\n  The conference report on the Transportation-HUD bill includes a \nnumber of questionable earmarks, some of which I will try to eliminate \nwhen the bill comes through the Senate.\n  We developed a new rule that one can't earmark in conference. Yet in \nthe new conference report on the Transportation-HUD bill, 18 new \nearmarks were air dropped, new earmarks violating the rules the Senate \njust set up. We can't help ourselves. Such earmarks as an international \nresource center, the Coffeyville Community Enhancement Foundation, \nMinihaha Park development, buses, upgrades to airports, may be good \nthings to do, but are they good things to do when the projected budget \ndeficit is around $300 billion? Are these the priorities we should \nhave?\n  I won't spend a whole lot more time on this issue today, but I can \ntell my colleagues that the American people\n\n[[Page S14431]]\n\nare fed up with this process, not just the process of earmarking but \nthe lack of accountability and the absolute lack of transparency when \nit comes to how we make priorities in spending their money, not ours, \nevery year. I think preserving Social Security, fixing Medicare to \nwhere it is available for those after the baby boom generation, solving \nour budget deficit today might be greater priorities. The real balance \nis between us and our grandchildren, and we lack the courage to make \nthe hard choices now because it impacts our political careers. We have \ntaken our eye off the ball. The ball is what about the future of the \ncountry? What about the opportunity for those who follow us? What about \nthe liberty and freedom they are going to have or not have as a \nconsequence of us ducking the hard choices today?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I will try to be brief and to the \npoint, if I cannot be eloquent. I want to talk about the Iraq \nsituation.\n  A number of Senators have spoken about that this morning. They are \nlooking at the progress that is taking place with the surge. I had \ngreat question about the surge at the outset. I questioned whether this \nwas the right route to go. Yet I have to say my concerns were proven \nwrong.\n  Look at the numbers: U.S. deaths are down more than 50 percent since \nJune. Iraqi deaths are down more than 50 percent since August. \nSectarian violence is down dramatically. Areas of Baghdad are opening. \nOctober saw the fewest roadside bomb instances since September of 2005. \nMortar rocket attacks are at their lowest level since February 2006. \nNobody would say it is over, we have won, but they would say these are \nvery positive events that have taken place.\n  The area we have to emphasize now is the political solution to \ncapture the moment of getting more stability on the ground in Iraq. For \nsome time Senator Biden and I have pushed a federalism approach that \nthis body endorsed by 70 votes. Now is the time for us to push much \nmore aggressively on this political solution. We are seeing this \nalready taking hold in the Kurdish region which has had a head start. \nUnder Saddam Hussein, the Kurds were protected by our air power in the \nnorth. They have stabilized a government and have been operating \nbasically that region. We now have Anbar stabilizing, the Anbar \nawakening. But they are not particularly interested in the federalism \nsolution because they don't have oil. So what we have to have take \nplace at the national level in Iraq is an oil law that distributes oil \non a per capita basis around the country, not in regions, so federalism \nroots can take hold--not one Iraq but several regions and not \nnecessarily on a sectarian basis.\n  Several Iraqis I have met with are saying they believe in federalism. \nThey think it is the route to go. But they say: Don't say we are a \nSunni region here or a Shia region there. These are going to be \nmultisect regions so we can get together on a regional basis and not on \na division basis around the country. This is a very promising route to \ngo, but we need a political surge to take place in Iraq. We need to put \nemphasis on a political surge to capitalize on the stabilizing \nsituation that is taking place on the ground.\n  We need a diplomatic surge. We need to push the Iraqis to get oil \nlaws and debaathification taking place on a national level. We should \nprioritize local and provincial elections and encourage Iraq to devolve \npower from Baghdad. We should provide additional humanitarian \nassistance for those Iraqis who fled sectarian violence and relocated \nto other areas, or they are coming back. Some people are not coming \nback to areas because there is no housing left; it got blown up in all \nthe violence that took place. Instead of pretending that nothing has \nchanged, our debate needs to reflect the reality on the ground, that \nthe security situation is much better, that we have a real moment here. \nThe reality is that security has improved. The reality is that \ncentralizing power in Baghdad is not the route to go. Creating federal \nregions provides a chance for that success to be captured and moved \nforward.\n  I question what came out of the Joint Economic Committee on the \nfunding of the war. I am ranking Republican on that committee. That was \nnot a committee report. I believe there are significant problems with \nhow that funding level was arrived at. I don't think that was accurate. \nI don't think it was a positive way to move forward. Instead, now is \nthe time to say: OK, let's capitalize on the surge. Let's go on a \nbipartisan basis with Senator Biden and myself on federalism. Let's \npush that to capture this, and then we as America can declare victory--\nnot a Republican victory, not a Bush victory, but we as Americans can \nsay it is now stabilized and we can start to pull our troops back. That \nis the talk that is penetrating now, and it is the talk we need to have \na lot more of.\n  Iraqi President Talibani endorses federalism as a political solution. \nThe Kurds have announced they will convene a federalism conference. \nSome Iraqi Shia groups are openly discussing the creation of a region \nthat would be a federalism model. The Sunnis do not particularly want \nto because they do not have oil, so we have to get that oil devolved.\n\n  I think there is a real route forward for us to all be able to say, \nsoon, we are making progress, it is sustainable, and we are handing it \noff to the Iraqis.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand I have time in morning \nbusiness. Let me claim that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14431-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14431-S14432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about several things today. \nI want to start with this question of why, at the end of the \nlegislative session, there is such intractability in trying to get the \nappropriations bills done.\n  It is a paradox to me that President Bush, who has come to this town \nin the last 7 years, and at the start of his Presidency said, ``I want \na fiscal policy that moves in a certain direction.'' He had a \nsufficient number of votes in the Congress to accommodate that so he \nsaid, ``Look, it appears in the next 10 years we are going to have very \nlarge budget surpluses, so I want put in place very large tax cuts, \nmost of which will go to wealthy Americans.'' I did not support that, \nbut a number of people in his party did, so it became enacted. I said \nwe ought to be conservative. We ought to worry things might change. \nMaybe these surpluses won't appear. We do not have them yet. They are \nonly projections.\n  Well, guess what? The President got his fiscal policy, and those \nsurpluses did not, in fact, appear. We faced a recession, 9/11, a war \nin Afghanistan, a war in Iraq, and a continuing war against terrorism--\nall of which has been very costly. We have run up $3 trillion in debt \nwith this President's fiscal policy--$3 trillion. Now, I think it is \nunusual that at this stage of this session of Congress the President \nhas done two things. He has sent to this Congress a request for $196 \nbillion in emergency funding for the war in Afghanistan and Iraq--\nmostly for Iraq.\n\n[[Page S14432]]\n\nHe wants $196 billion in emergency funding--none of it paid for. He \nsays: This is my priority. If you do not support it, you do not support \nthe troops. We do not intend to pay for it. It is called an emergency.\n  At the same time, he has made another request of Congress. He has \nsaid: The budget I sent to you is a budget locked in stone, and if you \ndo not meet those numbers, if you are over those numbers on anything, I \nintend to veto the bills.\n  Eight to ten appropriations bills he has threatened to veto. We are \n$22 billion over the President's numbers in his budget for investment \nhere at home. I am talking about the things that improve roads, do the \nwater projects that are necessary, build infrastructure, invest in \nhealth, and invest in education. We are $22 billion over the \nPresident's budget request.\n  The President says: I will have none of that. The money we are \nspending to invest in things here at home, we will not compromise on \nthat. I will veto all of those bills. So I am going to be a fiscally \nresponsible President on $22 billion with respect to investments in \nthis country, and then I demand $196 billion from you in Congress, on \nan emergency basis. None of it paid for. All of it borrowed in order to \nprosecute the war.\n  By the way, that $196 billion is not all to support the troops. A \nsubstantial part of it is for contractors. I have been on the floor \ntalking about the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of \nthis country with contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have been \nstolen blind by contractors.\n  One short story: This country says that we will commit to building \n144 health clinics in Iraq. So our Government hires a contractor to go \nbuild health clinics in Iraq. The money is all gone. Over $200 million \nof the money is gone, but the health clinics do not exist. Out of over \n200 health clinics, there are only 20 in operation.\n  An Iraqi doctor came to see me and testified at a policy committee \nhearing. He said: I went to the health minister of Iraq to find out \nwhere these health clinics were because I knew the American taxpayer \nspent the money for them. The contractor got the money to build them, \nand I wanted to go see these health clinics and tour them to find out \nwhat has been done. The Iraqi health minister said: You don't \nunderstand. Most of these are imaginary clinics. They have never been \nbuilt.\n  Well, the money is gone. The contractor got the money. The American \ntaxpayer got fleeced. The President wants more money, an additional \n$196 billion. He says: If I don't get it, then you don't support the \ntroops. Then he says: By the way, I don't support the extra $22 billion \nto invest in health care, to invest in energy, to invest in water \nprojects, to invest in roads, or to invest in this country.\n  I say to the President, it is time, long past the time, to start \ntaking care of things in this country. I have a list on my desk of \nwater projects that we are doing in Iraq costing hundreds and hundreds \nof millions of dollars. I have the specific names of the water projects \nwhich we are building in Iraq. The President also says he wants over a \nhalf a billion dollars less in funding than the Congress is \nrecommending for the Corps of Engineers to build water projects in this \ncountry. This is funding to repair dams, to do dredging, and to do the \nthings we need to do to fix water projects in this country.\n  Why such a reluctance to invest here at home? I do not understand it. \nBut why the contradiction? The President wants to spend $196 billion--\nwithout paying for any of it--and then crow to the east that somehow he \nis a fiscal conservative because he is opposed to $22 billion spent \nhere at home.\n  Now in the next several weeks, we are going to have to reconcile \nthis, and I hope, in one way or another, this President will be able to \ntry to find out what his true identity is. It certainly is not a fiscal \nconservative. That is talk. Talk is cheap.\n  Look at what he is asking for: $196 billion to be added to the debt. \nNone of it paid for. All of it borrowed. Then he says that he is \nopposed to $22 billion to invest here at home.\n  That is not fiscal conservatism. That is ignoring needs here in this \ncountry and spending money in a profligate way, especially on \ncontractors which are fleecing the American people in my judgement. I \nhope we can reach an agreement on meeting our appropriations needs. \nThat is what we need to do. This place works and this democracy works \nby agreement and compromise with people of good will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14432-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14432-S14433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXCESSIVE MARKET SPECULATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mention that because I want to talk \nabout two areas of speculation that bother me a lot, both of which \nrelate not to the financial issues of this fiscal policy coming from \nPresident Bush, but it relates to the issue of whether you believe \nGovernment has a role in proper regulation in certain areas.\n  The price of a barrel of oil today is trading at $94 a barrel. It has \nbeen flirting with $100 a barrel. The price of oil has been going up, \nup, up in the last year. Well, it is interesting when you take a look \nat what is happening with oil prices. Take a look at supply and demand \nfactors and ask yourself if the fundamentals with respect to oil supply \nand demand justify $100 a barrel of oil? The answer is no.\n  Let me read to you something from a fellow, Fadel Gheit, who works \nfor Oppenheimer & Sons. Here is what the energy analyst for Oppenheimer \n& Sons said last week. He said:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. . . . I'm \n     absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime \n     above $55 a barrel. . . . Oil speculators include ``the \n     largest financial institutions in the world.'' ``Call it the \n     world's largest gambling hall. . . . It's open 24/7. . . . \n     Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. . . . This is like a \n     highway with no cops and no speed limit, and everybody's \n     going 120 miles per hour.''\n\n  Let me tell you what is happening with the price of oil. This is an \noil analyst from Oppenheimer & Sons saying that there is no \njustification for oil being a dime over $55 a barrel. We have hedge \nfunds in the futures market buying oil. We have investment banks in the \nfutures market. We have investment banks building facilities to store \noil. Now, why are investment banks building facilities to store oil? It \nis because they believe oil will be more valuable in the future. If \nthey buy it and store it, then they will make money in the future.\n  So instead of a futures market that works with respect to the \nfundamentals of the supply and demand of oil, we have a carnival of \ngreed in the futures market, in my judgment. We have investment banks \nhip deep, we have hedge funds hip deep in this, and we have all kinds \nof things that are going on that are driving up the price of oil.\n  Who are the victims? The people filling up at the gas pumps have to \npay this price that, in my judgment, is unsupported by the fundamentals \nof supply and demand.\n  What is the circumstance here? Well, the circumstance, like most \nthings, is we do not have the capability to regulate very effectively.\n  Let me tell you this story, if I might, about a 32-year-old trader at \na giant hedge fund, and I did not mention that hedge funds are in these \nmarkets as well, in a very big way. A 32-year-old trader at a hedge \nfund named Amaranth held sway over the price the country paid for \nnatural gas a year or so ago. Let me tell you what he did. He helped \nlead to the collapse of an $8 billion hedge fund named Amaranth. This \ncomes from the Washington Post:\n\n       His positions were so big that he could cause the price to \n     move in the way he wanted by buying or selling massive \n     amounts of his holdings in the last 30 minutes of trading on \n     NYMEX, a move known as ``smashing the close,'' federal \n     regulators say.\n       At one point, in the summer of 2006, Mr. Hunter, the 32-\n     year-old trader, controlled up to 70 percent of the natural \n     gas commodities on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) \n     that were scheduled to supply companies and homes in November \n     of last year and more than 40 percent of contracts for the \n     entire winter season.\n\n  Now, this relates to the question of a piece of legislation that is \nentitled ``Close the Enron Loophole'' Act that Senator Levin and I have \nintroduced. The fact is, in these energy futures, some of them are on \nregulated exchanges, but many of them are not. The Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission does not have the capability to see exactly what is \nhappening in these futures contracts and in these over-the-counter or \nunrelated areas. We need, in my judgment, to pass legislation to try to \nstop this rampant speculation of unregulated trading.\n\n[[Page S14433]]\n\n  There needs to be a futures market. A futures market is very \nimportant to provide liquidity. But when a futures market becomes a \ngambling hall, and you start with investment banks and hedge funds, and \nall of these activities that have very little to do with the \nfundamentals of supply and demand, then there are very serious problems \nthat must be addressed.\n  Now, it could likely be the case that the price of oil will come down \nin a precipitous way as well. It does not seem that way at the moment. \nBut it could because, clearly, this is a speculative bubble. In my \njudgment, the price is not justified by the fundamentals of supply and \ndemand. Are we going to have a tightening of supplies in the future? \nYes, I understand that. The Chinese want to drive 100 million more cars \non their roads in the next 15 years. They are going to build these \nroads, they are going to drive on them. Is that going to increase \ndemand? Sure it is.\n  Russia wants to capture more oil. I am told they would love to find \nways to impede the opportunity of oil and energy supplies coming from \nthe Caspian Sea to the West. Does that potentially impact the price of \noil? Sure it does.\n  But the fact is this: At least at the moment, with the price of oil \non the futures market, we have a situation in which the trading, in \nmany cases, is completely unregulated and not transparent. We need to \nchange that. There needs to be some regulation. This administration \ndoes not believe that. They have never believed in regulation. We \nunderstand what happened with respect to the crash of Enron and the \nbilking of tens of billions of dollars from consumers on the West \nCoast. Enron, in many ways, was a criminal enterprise, and there are \npeople now in jail as a result of it. The regulators sat on their \nhands, dead from the neck up, believing: No, no, no, no, this is the \nmarket working. It was not the market working. It was criminal \nactivity, and people were hurt, a lot of them.\n  With respect to the oil futures market, there needs to be effective \nregulation. I am not alleging illegal activity here. I am saying, \nhowever, it is not healthy to have an amount of speculation in that \nmarket that is far beyond anything that would be reasonable, given the \nsupply and demand of oil.\n  I have one additional topic I want to cover, but the majority leader \nis on the floor. I would be happy to yield to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14433-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14433-S14434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOME MORTGAGES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue to talk about one other \narea of speculation because speculation with respect to the futures \nmarket in oil is causing significant problems. Speculation with respect \nto mortgage lending in the subprime mortgage scandal has been \nunbelievable as well, and it is causing havoc, as we know. People are \ngetting fired; companies are declaring billions of dollars of losses; \nand the American people are injured as a result of it. The economy will \nnot grow as fast as a result of it. Let me describe to you what I have \nlearned about this issue. It is stunning because I did not know it. You \nget up in the morning, brush your teeth, shave, and watch television \nwhere you see these ads on television. I never thought much about them. \nI always thought they were a little goofy. They say: Do you have bad \ncredit? Have you filed for bankruptcy? You can't pay your bills? You \nhave bad marks on your credit rating? Come see us. We will give you \nsome credit.\n  We have all seen those adds. You think to yourself: Well, how can \nthat work? The fact is, it does not work and cannot work. So what used \nto be a sleepy little industry getting home loans became something like \na Roman candle with powder and a lot of flash. All of a sudden these \ncompanies became very fancy companies. I will mention one, Countrywide, \nthe largest home mortgage lender. Here is what I have discovered as I \nbegan to look at what they did. They said: You know something. We will \ngive you a deal on a home mortgage. You have a broker selling you a \nhome mortgage getting big fees. We will give you a deal on a home \nmortgage, an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). By the way, we have a \nmortgage, an ARM, in which you don't have to pay any principal and \ninterest only, and you can pay the principal later. We have a better \nmortgage than that. We have one in which you don't have to pay any \nprincipal, and you pay the interest later or principal later. You don't \neven have to pay the full interest at this point. We can add the \ninterest you are not paying and the principal later to the loan or \nloans with a 2-percent interest rate.\n\n  So they disclose a monthly payment and people say: Man, that is \nsomething. That is a low house payment. They don't understand, of \ncourse, in two or three years it is going to reset, and it will reset \nat triple or quadruple the rate. In many cases, they didn't even quote \nthe escrow they were going to be required to pay. So all of a sudden in \ntwo or three years the interest rate is going to reset, and they don't \nhave a ghost of a chance of paying the mortgage.\n  This is all about greed, by the way--big brokers, big companies, \nmortgage companies that are fundamentally unsound. It reminds me of the \ndays when they used to put sawdust in sausages, sawdust for fillers. \nPeople found out about it, and they were aghast.\n  Here is what they did with these mortgages. They are out there \nselling bad mortgages, interest only and even less than interest only, \nsubprime, selling mortgages to people who aren't going to have a ghost \nof a chance of making the payments. They are out there selling \nmortgages--not just Countrywide but others as well--which are \nadvertising: Come to us if you have bad credit. We want to help you. We \nwant to give you a loan. They sell these mortgages, and then they \npackage them up, similar to a piece of sausage. They put subprime \nloans, bad loans in with securities. They package them up, and they \nsell them. Pretty soon a hedge fund, an investment bank, or somebody \nelse buys them, and now they have a piece of sausage with sawdust that \nis called a security, which includes bad home mortgages. They don't \neven know it. Then, all of a sudden, it goes belly up because people \ncan't pay their mortgages.\n  Now, I am thinking to myself, where has common sense gone? What has \nhappened to basic common sense? Those brokers are selling the loans and \nmaking big commissions. Those companies were writing the loans making \nbig money and putting in prepayment penalties so they can lock people \ninto bad loans. Those people, the investors who are buying the loans, \nand, yes, in some cases, those who were taking out the loans because \nthey should have known better, where has common sense gone? It is \nrampant speculation.\n  One more point. It relates to what I talked about with respect to oil \nfutures, and it is the total lack of regulatory oversight. Don't look. \nDon't worry. It will all be fine. Well, it is not fine. These kinds of \nactivities have an unbelievably tough effect on this country's economy \nand on people. Millions of people will lose their homes. We have a lot \nof work to do, but I wished to make this point: There is a need to have \neffective regulatory oversight. This administration has never believed \nin it. We saw the consequences of it with the Enron Corporation. We now \nsee the consequences with respect to oil and natural gas futures \ntrading and its impact on the price of oil and natural gas. We see the \nconsequences of it with respect to what has happened with subprime \nlending. If this doesn't convince this administration and future \nadministrations that you have to have effective regulation, then I \ndon't know what does. Companies need someone looking over their \nshoulders to make sure we don't have this carnival of greed take over. \nYou have to have effective regulation. Working in this Congress, many \nof us are trying to put this back together to see if we can't get back \nto some sound common sense, some business sense, in terms of working in \nthese areas.\n  I wanted to at least start today by talking about the contradiction \nof what the President is asking of us and what the President is \ndemanding of the Congress in a way that is completely contradictory to \nsound fiscal policy. I further wanted to talk about a couple of areas \nof speculation that both relate to lack of oversight. We need to fix \nthese. We can do it, but we need to fix it and soon.\n  I appreciate the patience of the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has morning business expired?\n\n[[Page S14434]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from North Dakota leaves \nthe floor, I would like to direct a couple of comments through the \nChair to my friend. First of all, I appreciate the statement made \nrelating to energy. Everything you say has to be overlaid with the fact \nthat we have the most oil friendly administration in the history of our \ncountry. Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney made their \nfortunes in oil.\n  I would direct a question to my friend. It certainly appears our \nadministration has lived up to being the most oil-friendly \nadministration. Would my colleague agree with that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has. There is no question we need oil. \nWe use a lot of oil, but we need to have an energy policy that is a \nbalanced policy, and my colleague, the majority leader, is working with \nall of us on an energy bill that we hope we can get by the end of this \nsession that is balanced. It must include renewable energy. We will \nalso use fossil fuels, as well as need more conservation and \nefficiency. Further, we must make our vehicle fleet much more \nefficient. For the first time in 27 years, I believe, the majority \nsteered through this Senate an energy bill that got 65 votes, including \nfor reformed CAFE standards which will make our vehicle fleet more \nefficient.\n  So we have a lot to do on energy, but we have made some significant \nprogress. I hope we can get that bill by the end of the year.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also say to my friend, I appreciate \nthe statement on where we stand with these subprime loans. The \nfinancial community is crying out for help. Foreclosures help no one. \nThe person who has the home loses. The entity that holds the loan loses \nsignificantly. It is usually about 30 to 35 percent of the value of the \nhome, on average, is gone. The entity where the home is located, a \ncounty or a city, loses money because that home becomes--any \nforeclosure takes time. You usually have to board up the windows. It \nloses value, it loses tax dollars. Something has to be done by the \nFederal Government. What is being done by the Federal Government in its \nlimited fashion is hurting.\n\n  Around this country, one of the things that helps people who are in \nforeclosure is to have a counselor sit down and talk to them about \nalternatives they have. People are so frightened, and we have learned \nthat people who get foreclosure notices don't know what to do with them \nand usually don't even respond to them, either by mail or on the \ntelephone. What this administration has done for these counselors--\nwhich, by the way, are nonprofit entities--they have cut back their \nfunding by three-quarters. At a time when people need help, they cut \nback funding.\n  We know President Bush doesn't like Government. He doesn't like \nGovernment. He has proven that from the time he ran for Congress in the \n1970s and said Social Security should be privatized, and he has lived \nup to that. He doesn't like anything to do with Government. He is a \nperson who is anti-Government.\n  There is a time for Government. Adam Smith, in his great book ``The \nWealth of Nations,'' in 1776, said there is a place for Government. If \nhe were writing that book today, he would talk about the need for \nGovernment throughout America in many different ways. One thing we need \nto do is do something with FHA, with Fannie and Freddie, which are \norganizations we set up in Congress to help people buy homes.\n  I would say to my friend in the form of a question: Does my colleague \nthink the Federal Government should be more active in what is going on \nthan ignoring the problem?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the majority leader is absolutely right. \nWe have a role to play. The first and most important aspect is to help \nthose who have been victimized by this unbelievable speculation and \ngreed, and the second is to make sure it doesn't happen again. That \nrequires effective regulation. So the response to this subprime loan \nissue cannot be no response or just to look the other way. It has to be \nto address those things.\n  One of the points the majority leader has made is the need to rework \nsome of these mortgages. The interesting thing is that, in the old days \nwhen you got a mortgage, you knew where you got it, and you knew who \nhad it. If you had trouble, you went and worked it out with your \nlender. Nowadays, they have already sold that mortgage, so it makes it \nmuch more difficult. They have sold it, wrapped it into a security \nsomeplace, and sold it two or three times. Borrowers go to the place \nwhere they got the mortgage, but the company says we don't have the \nmortgage.\n  So we have a lot to do. I appreciate the words of the majority \nleader. We have to help a lot of people try to get through this. We \nneed to help our country's economy get through this and make sure it \ndoesn't happen again.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one final thing before my friend leaves the \nfloor. There is no one more involved in farm policy any more than the \nSenator from North Dakota. North Dakota is an agricultural State. \nTomorrow morning we are going to have a vote on cloture on the farm \nbill. We are going to have a cloture vote. It is a very important vote. \nThe question is, Are the Republicans going to kill the farm bill?\n  For people who say: Well, gee whiz, we have had no opportunity to \noffer amendments--cloture on the farm bill does not stop amending the \nfarm bill. Relevant amendments can be offered on the farm bill. We have \n30 hours to do that. I, of course, would allow those amendments to go \nforward. There would be no way to say: Well, we are only going to vote \non this one. If there are germane amendments subject to the rule, they \ncan be offered and they can do it postcloture. So I hope all my \nRepublican friends understand this farm bill is important. People at \nhome are going to be watching how we vote on this farm bill because it \nis a very important vote. Are we going to continue working on the farm \nbill or let it go? It appears to me the response from the Republicans \nis let it go. Maybe we will be able to do it some other time.\n  But I ask my friend: It is true, is it not, that this is an important \nvote and there will still be amendments allowed even if cloture is \ninvoked?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the reason a cloture motion was even filed \nis we have been here a week and a half and have not even been able to \nmove to the first amendment because it has been blocked. Yesterday, \nSenator Harkin offered this. He said: Well, how about if we at least \nstart. The way to move on it is to start. He said: How about let's \nstart with a couple of Republican amendments and a couple of Democratic \namendments. In every case, there was an objection by the minority side \nwhich said no, we can't start.\n  So I think the majority leader had no choice but to say let's file a \ncloture motion and try to shut off debate, but that will not shut off \namendments that are germane postcloture. After being very discouraged, \nI really hope those of us who care about a farm program can move \nforward. Having watched this blocking of the farm bill now for a week \nand a half, I hope tomorrow morning, when we have this vote, the \nmessage that American farmers will get is that this Senate cares enough \nto decide that, yes, we will go to work, and we will do the farm bill.\n  I would make one final point to the majority leader. I made the point \nyesterday. Farmers can't do what the minority in the Senate is doing. \nWhen it is time to milk a cow, you have to milk a cow, or the cow gets \nsore. When it is time to plant, you have to plant, or your crop will \nnot grow. When it is time to harvest, you have to harvest, or the crop \nwill spoil. The farmers don't have the luxury the minority has to say: \nWell, let's do nothing.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us tomorrow in voting for cloture. I \nappreciate the filing of the motion by the majority leader because we \ndidn't have any other choice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14434-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14434-S14435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 4156\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are back on the farm bill. To refresh \nmemories, we have now been on the farm bill 10 days. This is our tenth \nday. Not one vote has occurred. We have tried time and again to bring \nup amendments, and they have been objected to. I will attempt to do \nthat again this morning. I will wait until my ranking member is \npresent. I see that Senator Salazar is here to speak on the farm bill.\n  I wish to make it very clear, tomorrow morning we will have a vote on \ncloture on the farm bill. I want there to be no mistake in anyone's \nmind: Tomorrow morning's vote will be a vote on whether we have a farm \nbill this year. If we get cloture on the farm bill tomorrow, we will \nhave a farm bill this year. We will be able to pass a bill in the \nSenate, we will go to conference, and we will send it to the President.\n  If we do not get cloture tomorrow, that is like killing the farm \nbill. A vote against cloture will be a vote to kill the farm bill. We \nwill run out of time. We will be out of here at Thanksgiving for 2 \nweeks. When we come back, we have all the appropriations bills to do, \nwe have the Iraq funding bill to work out, and we will only have about \n3 weeks before Christmas. Therefore, if we do not get cloture, that is \nlike saying we don't want a farm bill. So I hope everyone understands \nwhat the stakes are.\n  I also hope no one has the mistaken impression that because we invoke \ncloture, they cannot offer amendments. I got that question from a press \nperson this morning. I had to inform them that, no, if we get cloture, \nwe have 30 hours of debate and people can offer amendments during that \n30 hours.\n  I just spoke with our leader. It would be the prerogative, if we \nwanted to on the majority side, if we got cloture, to lay down one \namendment and take all 30 hours and debate it and block everybody from \noffering amendments. That has happened around here before, by the way, \nwhere we get cloture and then block it and nobody gets to offer any \namendments until the end. Then we get into this vote-arama where we \nhave votes on amendments but nobody gets to talk about them. We are not \ngoing to do that.\n  If we get cloture, I will try to reach an agreement with my ranking \nmember, Senator Chambliss, so we can have, say, at least a half hour \ndebate on every amendment and vote. That would give us a shot at having \nprobably pretty close to 20 amendments that could be debated and on \nwhich we could vote.\n  At the end of the 30 hours, of course, any amendments still pending \nhave a right to have a vote. There would be a minute on each side to \nexplain those amendments, and we would vote on them.\n  I want to make it clear that voting for cloture does not cut off \namendments. Yes, it may cut off nongermane amendments dealing with \nwhether we are going to go to the Moon or Mars or whether we are going \nto do wacky stuff such as that. Yes, it cuts that stuff out. But any \namendment that is germane to the farm bill can be offered and will be \nvoted on even after cloture. I want to make that very clear.\n  If we do not get cloture, that is it; that is the end of the ball \ngame, and I don't know when we can ever come back to the farm bill \nafter that. Certainly not this year.\n  It is getting late. The crops are in. In most parts of the country, \ncrops are in. And now they are beginning to think about next year. \nBankers want to know, farmers need to know what the program is going to \nbe for next year. Will it be this one or will it be what we have come \nup with in our farm bill and worked out with the House. So it is \ngetting very late, and we need to get this bill done.\n  I encourage all Senators, we are open for business now. We can take \namendments now. We can debate amendments, and we can vote on amendments \nall day today.\n  Shortly, I will be asking consent to bring up amendments. I am going \nto ask consent to bring up Republican amendments that are filed. I have \na Lugar amendment. I have a Roberts amendment, an Alexander amendment, \na Lott amendment, and I am going to be asking consent to bring up those \namendments. If there is no objection, we will bring them up, have a \ndebate, and we can have votes on a lot of amendments this afternoon.\n  I want to make it very clear again: This side is not holding up the \nprocess. We want to vote; we want to debate. Just as yesterday, I \nwanted to bring up five amendments yesterday and have limited time and \nvote on them, but it was objected to. I will try that again today. \nHopefully, maybe we can make some movement and we can have some votes \ntoday on some amendments. I will be doing that shortly.\n  I see the Senator from Colorado is on the Senate floor. He has been a \ngreat member of our Agriculture Committee. No one has worked harder \nthan Senator Salazar in getting us to the point where we have a farm \nbill that came out of our committee without one negative vote.\n  I say to my friend from Colorado, someone this morning on a press \ncall asked me: If you don't get cloture, if you don't get this bill, or \nif the President vetoes it and you have to go back, what are you going \nto do differently?\n  I said: I don't know how much we can do differently to get more of a \npositive vote out of our committee than a unanimous vote. What do you \ndo that is different from that? It is not as if we had a split vote on \nthe committee and we still have to work it out. We didn't have one \ndissenting vote, so I am not certain how we get much better than that.\n  I thank my friend from Colorado for all of his hard work on this \nbill. He was instrumental in a number of issues before the committee, \nespecially on energy, on conservation. The Senator from Colorado was \ninstrumental in working out the agreements and making sure we had a \nbill that got a unanimous vote out of our committee. I thank him for \nthat.\n  He has been a champion of ranchers and farmers, a real champion of \nmoving us ahead in energy, in renewable energy, farm-based energy, bio-\nbased energy, which will get us off the Mideast oil pipeline that we \nhave been on for far too long.\n\n[[Page S14436]]\n\n  Again, I thank my friend from Colorado for all of his hard work. With \nhim, I am hoping we can get cloture on this bill tomorrow and move \nahead and go to conference and get a bill we can send to the President. \nI thank my friend from Colorado for all of his help in getting this \nfarm bill here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come here again, some 10 days after we \nbrought the farm bill here to the floor, and I want to say first of all \nto my good friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, Tom Harkin, that there are few people who really understand \nthe importance of rural America and agriculture in the way Tom Harkin \ndoes. There are very few people on the floor of the Senate today who \ncan claim they still live in the same house in which they were born. \nFew people here can say they know the pain and suffering and the \nchallenges, the hopes, and the optimism of rural America in the way Tom \nHarkin does.\n  The best of what we have here in the Senate today we see in someone \nlike Tom Harkin, who is here for the right reasons--standing up as a \nchampion for agriculture, for rural America, and for America in general \nbecause he understands what is at stake. He understands that the food \nsecurity of the Nation is at stake. Senator Harkin understands what is \ngoing on with respect to the oil addiction of America and foreign oil \nand the importance of American farmers and ranchers helping us to grow \nour way to energy independence. Senator Harkin understands how \nimportant it is to be a champion of the most vulnerable in our society \nby having the kind of nutrition programs that will put fruits and \nvegetables and other kinds of healthy foods in the stomachs of our \nchildren as they are trying to learn. Senator Harkin understands the \nimportance of standing up and fighting for our land and for our water \nand making sure farmers and ranchers across America, who are some of \nthe best stewards of our lands and water, have the right tools so that \nwe have a conservation ethic that is appropriate at the dawn of this \n21st century.\n  So I say this to my friend from Iowa: I applaud his efforts in \nbringing us to this point. This has been an effort which is not one we \ndreamt up overnight to bring to the floor of the Senate just 10 days \nago; it is an effort that has consumed thousands upon thousands of \nhours, with hearings all over the country. And it was not only Senator \nHarkin and his leadership, but it was also Senator Chambliss, working \nas the ranking member alongside Senator Harkin, trying to get us to a \npoint where we had a farm bill we could bring to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  At the end of the day, there are not many votes on major bills that \ncome out of committee on a voice vote. We had Democrats and Republicans \nsaying this is a good farm bill. This is the way for the future. So I \nam very hopeful that tomorrow morning at 9, 9:30, 10 o'clock, when we \ncome to the floor, we take the lead of Senator Harkin and our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, and \nvote yes on the cloture motion before us. It is important that we move \nforward in that direction.\n  I will remind my colleagues--as Senator Harkin already has reminded \nour colleagues--that even though we get to cloture tomorrow morning, we \nwill still have an opportunity to go through a number of amendments. We \nhave another 30 hours of debate and multiple amendments that can be \nconsidered and many votes that can be had as we move forward to try to \nimprove upon the product of the Agriculture Committee. But if we don't \nget cloture tomorrow, we are, in fact, endangering the prospect of even \ngetting to the farm bill.\n  Now, we have some people who may say that what is happening here in \nthe Senate is that there is a stall underway, a stall to keep us from \ngetting to action on a very important piece of legislation for America. \nThat may very well be true. But if those who are trying to stall this \nimportant measure have their way, then those voices that need \nchampions, those voices in rural America, those farmers and ranchers, \nthose who care about food security, they will be the ultimate losers in \nthis debate.\n  I don't think today in my State of Colorado, on the eastern plains or \nthe San Luis Valley or the Western Slope or in Weld County, CO, the \nfarmers and ranchers or those rural communities really understand what \nis going on here, but what they should understand is we will have an \nopportunity in the vote we will have here tomorrow morning to make a \ndetermination as to whether the farm bill moves forward. So for those \nwho vote yes, they are saying they feel we do need a farm bill for \nAmerica. For those who say no, whatever their motivation might be, they \nare saying we should not and that we should allow this very important \nissue to take a secondary seat. So I ask for those voices that care so \nmuch about what we have done in this farm bill to rise and make sure \nMembers of this Chamber know of the importance of getting cloture \ntomorrow morning so that we can move forward on the farm bill.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have spoken often here on the floor \nregarding the farm bill, and I have spoken about the importance of this \nfarm bill with respect to its imperative direction in producing healthy \nand safe foods here in America. It is a vital piece of legislation that \nwill provide us with clean, renewable energy and be a keystone in a \nclean energy economy of the 21st century. It is vital to fighting the \nhunger we see among our school children and hunger that still affects \nmillions of Americans. It is vital to our rural communities, in making \nsure we give them an opportunity to stand on their feet again. It is \nvital to our farmers and to our ranchers and to their very livelihood.\n  This morning I want to speak to a part of the farm bill which is \nimportant, and that is conservation, the part of the farm bill that \ndeals with fighting for and protecting our land and our water. Senator \nHarkin and others have been champions of this aspect of the farm bill, \nand I applaud them for their efforts.\n  The bill we have brought to the floor does more for conservation than \nany farm bill in the entire history of the United States. It does more \nfor conservation than any bill in the entire history of the United \nStates. So for all of those Americans who care about how we take care \nof our land and water, it is important that they have their voices \nheard on getting this farm bill moving forward.\n  The farm bill has an enormous impact on this Nation's land and water. \nNon-Federal agricultural and forest lands occupy 1.4 billion--that is \nbillion, not million, 1.4 billion--acres or nearly 70 percent of the \nlands of the 48 contiguous States. Mr. President, 7 out of 10 acres in \nthe United States of America, in the 48 contiguous States, are affected \nby this farm bill. These lands provide the habitat and corridors of \nsupport for healthy wildlife populations, they filter our groundwater \nsupplies, they regulate surface water flows, sequester carbon, and \nprovide the open space and vistas that make America a place we all \nlove. As I learned from working for a long part of my life on a ranch \nand farm in southern Colorado, farmers and ranchers are some of the \nbest stewards of these resources. Farmers and ranchers want to take \ncare of their land, and they want to do what is right for the \nprotection of our environment.\n\n  The conservation programs that are in this farm bill reauthorize what \nare already some programs that are making a major contribution to the \nland stewardship challenges of the last half century.\n  In 1982, not so long ago, widespread soil erosion was degrading water \nquality in rivers and streams and putting dust in the air at \ndangerously high levels. But since 1982, with the Conservation Reserve \nProgram, the EQIP program, and their predecessor programs, total \nerosion on U.S. cropland has fallen by more than 43 percent. Since \n1992, total erosion on U.S. cropland has fallen by more than 43 \npercent. We are succeeding, and we can make more progress.\n  The investments we make in the Conservation Reserve Program, which \nputs environmentally sensitive croplands into conservation uses, \nresults in the following: First, $266 million annually in environmental \nbenefits from reduced sediment loads in streams and rivers, $51 million \nannually from reduced dust and wind, and $161 million annually from \nincreased soil productivity.\n\n[[Page S14437]]\n\n  Here is a picture that the Natural Resources Conservation Service \nsent to me a few days ago from Colorado. This shows how some of our \nconservation dollars are spent.\n  I wish to thank Allan Green, our State conservationist, and Tim \nCarney, our assistant State conservationist, for helping us with this \neffort on conservation. And I thank all the staff, all the dedicated \nstaff of NRCS, who dedicate their hearts and souls to making sure \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers are doing the best they can on \nconservation.\n  This is a picture of some of my friends and colleagues in the Saint \nVrain and Boulder Creek watersheds. What these farmers and ranchers are \nlearning here behind the tractor, working with NRCS, is how to work on \nwatersheds with some of the new practices that have come into play in \nfarming and ranching over the last several decades which will allow \nthem to reduce their tillage, to reduce their consumption of energy as \nthey are tilling those lands, and at the same time to increase the \nyields in their fields.\n  The field day, which is depicted here in this program, was part of a \n3-year EQIP conservation innovation grant that was done in partnership \nwith the local conservation district, local farmers, seed companies, \nand farm equipment dealers. At the end of the day, these farmers went \nhome with new ways to reduce erosion and to boost their bottom line.\n  The conservation program we are authorizing in the farm bill today \nalso helps us protect the very wetlands of America that are so valuable \nto hunters and to anglers, to wildlife watchers, and to those of us who \ncare so much about the beauty of this place. Indeed, for those of us \nwho come from a natural resources background, we know that more than \nhalf of all of the species of wildlife essentially reside around these \nwetlands and river corridors of our Nation. So what we do with this \nfarm bill in terms of the protection of wetlands and continuing the \nWetlands Reserve Program is very important to all those who care about \nhunting, who are the anglers of our Nation, and who care about making \nsure we are protecting our wildlife.\n  Starting in the mid-1950s, we were losing over half a million acres \nof wetlands every year--half a million acres of wetlands. To put it \ninto perspective so that people will understand, it is like losing the \nsame amount of acreage that makes up all of the District of Columbia \nevery year. Thanks in large part to the Wetlands Reserve Program and \nCRP, we have achieved the goal of having no net loss--no net loss--from \nagriculture. In fact, from 1997 to 2003 in that 6-year period, we had a \nnet gain of 260,000 acres of wetlands here in America.\n  This is a picture of the Wetlands Reserve Program project near \nBerthoud, along the Front Range, north of Denver. WRP funded 70 percent \nof the $12,000--70 percent of the $12,000--it took to restore this \nwetland. You can see what great waterfowl habitat and nesting areas it \ncreated along the shoreline. When you look at this beautiful picture--\nand, yes, I happen to live in the State which is the crown jewel of the \nNation in terms of its beauty--you see the mountains, the snow-capped \nRockies in the background, but you also see part of what makes Colorado \nsuch a wonderful place; that is, the agriculture that feeds into this \nwetland and a wetland that has now been restored to provide the \nvaluable wildlife and water quality values I addressed a few minutes \nago.\n  This farm bill and the Wetlands Reserve Program is part of what is at \nstake on this vote that we take tomorrow morning, on whether we move \nforward with the farm bill.\n  At the end of 2005, nationwide we had 1.8 million acres enrolled in \nthe WRP. We had 2 million acres of wetlands and buffer zones in the \narea that were enrolled in CRP. This is great for the bird watchers, \nfor the anglers, for the hunters. CRP alone yields about $737 million a \nyear in wildlife-related benefits.\n  The conservation program in the farm bill also helps ensure that we \nhave healthy ranges and that animal waste does not harm water quality. \nHere is an example of EQIP, along Pawnee Creek near the Colorado-\nWyoming border. EQIP provided about $3,000--around 50 percent of the \nproject cost--to install this water tank for livestock. This tank is \npart of a grazing system with a stock well, a pipeline system, and \ncross fencing that facilitates rotational grazing.\n  For those of us who come from the West, we understand the importance \nof water. I often say, for us in the West, we all recognize that water \nis the lifeblood of our community. Without the waters of the streams \nand rivers and aquifers in my great State, we would continue still to \nbe the great American desert. It is important we take care of our water \nin the right way. We know that, it is part of our heritage in the State \nof Colorado. EQIP is representing these ranchers, making sure we are \ntaking care of a very precious resource.\n  As this picture shows, a small investment from EQIP results in more \nbalanced grazing, less erosion, improved water quality, and improved \nwildlife habitats.\n  I see my friend from New York is here. I have probably 4 or 5 more \nminutes to go. Through the Chair, I say I will continue to speak but to \nlet him know I have probably another 5 or 10 minutes on the farm bill, \nand I will yield the floor to my friend from New York.\n  This is a picture of an irrigation ditch. Through the improvements \nmade on the irrigation ditch, it will make sure there is less water \nloss along this ditch so water can be more efficiently and more \neffectively applied on the soil that will be irrigated from this ditch.\n  I could speak for a long time about the benefits of the Conservation \nReserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program, \nthe Grassland Reserve Program, and many other programs we are \nreauthorizing in the farm bill. You see the benefits of the farm bill \nand the programs in this legislation throughout my State of Colorado. \nFrom my native San Luis Valley in the south to the Yampa River Valley \nin the north, they have made an immeasurable difference over the last \ntwo decades.\n  I am proud this farm bill reauthorizes these programs and invests \n$4.4 billion in conservation, a record amount in conservation. The \ngrowing pressures on agricultural lands make it all the more important \nthat we pass a farm bill with a strong conservation title. I wish to \nagain applaud Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Chambliss, and Senator \nBaucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, as well as Chairman \nGrassley, for their contribution--the members of both committees who \nhave brought a great farm bill to the floor of the Senate. I hope we \ncan get beyond the roadblocks that some Members have placed before this \nlegislation. We need to pass this bill for the good of America.\n  Finally, again, I think we need more people in the Senate who \nunderstand the importance of this farm bill. We need more people who \nunderstand the food security of our Nation should not be imperiled.\n  That sign on my desk that says ``no farms, no food,'' is something we \nought to be hitting everybody over the head with every day, as we deal \nwith this very important part of our legislative responsibilities, to \nmake sure we have the food security we so need in this country.\n  We also need to make sure, on this floor, there are people who have a \nstrong voice for those farmers and ranchers who work very hard every \nday, in a way that you only know when you have worked on a farm or a \nranch, to make sure we have that food security for America. For most \npeople in America, when you are out there at work and it is 5 or 6 \no'clock, you look at your clock and it is time to go home. If you are a \nfarmer or rancher and you look at your watch and it is 5 or 6 o'clock, \nmore than likely you have another 4 or 5 hours to go.\n  Then, when you get home, you know you have probably 5 or 6 hours' \nsleep before you have to get up and make sure you are milking the cows, \nif you are a dairy farmer, or make sure you are out checking the calves \nthat are being born on the spring days or that the water is being \nchanged at the right time so you are not wasting water, at 2 or 3 or 4 \nin the morning. It is a hard life out there on the farm. It is a hard \nlife out in rural America. It is important this Senate stand up strong \nand say yes to rural America, yes to rural communities that want to \nrebuild themselves, yes to the future of our energy security as we grow \nour way to\n\n[[Page S14438]]\n\nenergy independence, yes to the future of our nutritional programs for \nAmerica, yes to the future of those who want to protect the land and \nwater of America.\n  This is the right bill. It is important for people to come to the \nfloor of this Chamber tomorrow morning and to cast their vote ``yes'' \non the cloture motion before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nColorado for, as always, his excellent remarks. One of the many things \nhe does for our Senate and our Democratic caucus in particular is \nconstantly remind us of the problems in rural America. He has a link, \ncoming from a great family tradition in rural America, a farming \ntradition, a tradition that has gone back centuries. When he speaks on \nthese issues, many of us from more urbanized States listen. I thank him \nfor his courtesy. Not that we don't have great farmers in New York--we \ndo.\n  I am here to talk on a different subject. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        The Prime Lending Crisis\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the subprime \nlending crisis and the plan we are executing to address the foreclosure \nwave that threatens home ownership and our broader economy. Rampant \npredatory lending practices across this Nation have left millions of \nAmerican homeowners stuck with unaffordable and unfair subprime loans. \nAs a result, 2 million families now face the prospect of foreclosure \nand the loss of their homes over the next 2 years unless we take \naction. The number is going to get worse because the loans that were \nmade in 2006 and this year, 2007, usually do not reset until 2008 and \n2009. Because so many people who accepted these loans--took these \nloans--were taken advantage of, the interest rate will skyrocket for \nthem. Many of them will not be able to afford it.\n  Foreclosures entail not only direct costs to the lenders and \nborrowers but also high spillover costs that are felt by neighboring \nhomeowners, communities, and local governments in the form of lower \nhome values, lost property tax revenue, and increased maintenance \ncosts. A recent report by the majority staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee estimated that each foreclosure can cost $227,000 in direct \nand indirect costs. That is astounding. The homes on a street or in a \nneighborhood that has had foreclosures often go down in value. Even if \nyou are perfectly safe, even if you have already paid your mortgage and \nhave no intention of taking out another one, you are at risk because of \nthis foreclosure crisis, in terms of the value of your home.\n  The numbers mean that if the housing market slump continues through \nthe next 2 years, as many economists estimate, approximately $103 \nbillion in housing wealth will be destroyed as these homes are \nforeclosed on; $103 billion in lost wealth at a time when our families \ncan least afford it.\n  In addition, States and local governments will lose nearly $1 billion \nin property tax revenue over the next 2 years as a result of the \ndestruction of housing wealth caused by subprime foreclosures. That is \n$1 billion less funding for public schools and public safety, and that \nis the direct property tax loss. We are not talking about the other \nlosses States and local governments will see as a result of the broader \neconomic impact of the crisis.\n  We are not talking about the financial burden that cities and towns \nall over the Nation will face to maintain vacant properties and to \nprevent crime near abandoned homes. We are also not talking about cost \nto the larger economy. When home values go down because of this crisis, \nconsumers spend less. Consumer spending has been the engine of this \neconomy. It accounts for about 70 percent of our GDP. Statistics show \nwhen home values go down, consumers spend less. So this is ricocheting \nfrom one end of the economy to the other. Again, even if you live in \nyour home and paid off your mortgage, you will be affected by this \nunless we act.\n  The frustrating thing is we know what to do here. We cannot make this \ncrisis go away; there is no magic wand. It took years of neglect, years \nof ideological aversion to even commonsense regulation of the now-\nunregulated mortgage brokers. But the frustrating thing--frustrating \nfor this Member who has been talking about this for a long time--is we \nknow what to do. This administration, when it comes to the subprime \ncrisis, has remained like an ostrich with its head in the sand, not \npaying attention. Why? Why don't they see what everyone else sees?\n  The reason is quite simple. We have ideologues who run this \nadministration. Their view is Government should never be involved. Let \nthe homeowner pay the price. Let the economy pay the price. Because to \nget the Government involved is bad.\n  They can't prove that; that is their ideology. If there were ever a \ntime when we needed some thoughtful, careful, moderate but directed \nGovernment intervention--not to bail out anybody; those people will pay \nthe price, you read it in the financial pages of the newspapers right \nnow--but to help our Nation out of this crisis at a time when other \nthings such as high oil prices are hitting, makes eminent sense. The \ntime to act is now, while we still have a chance to save these homes \nand strengthen our floundering housing market.\n  I am proud to say today that my colleagues, we in the Senate, will \nhave an opportunity to act and take action on two measures that are \ndesigned to use the tools of the Federal Government to assist in \nhelping the 2 million subprime borrowers facing foreclosures with \nalternatives for loan workouts, refinancings, and modifications. I hope \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree with us that \nthese actions are urgently necessary. To wait even 3 or 4 months will \nhave this crisis grow in problems for those homeowners whose mortgages \ngo up, for those financial institutions that have the mortgages but, to \na far greater extent, to our economy--neighbors affected and consumer \nspending.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in \nhelping take the urgent action that is needed now--not next month, not \nin February but now.\n  First, we will take action to pass the FHA modernization bill. This \nlegislation makes several important changes to FHA, including \nadjustments to its downpayment requirements, loan limits, and \nunderwriting standards to give the FHA more flexibility to assist \nsubprime borrowers with safe and sustainable refinancing alternatives \nbefore their loans reset to unaffordable rates. With these changes, FHA \nwill be able to rescue tens of thousands of American families from the \nfinancial ruin of foreclosure.\n  The legislation will also make improvements to FHA's counseling and \nforeclosure prevention programs to ensure that borrowers who have \nalready faced the specter of the loss of their home will not have to go \nthrough the ordeal again. The FHA legislation is modest. It has \nbipartisan support. It has the support of the administration. What are \nwe waiting for?\n  Second, we are pushing the passage of the PROMISE Act, a bill to \ntemporarily increase the portfolio caps on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nby their regulator.\n  This is legislation I have introduced, along with Congressman Frank \nin the House. The bill will alleviate the predicted wave of \nforeclosures by giving Freddie and Fannie 10 percent more balance sheet \ncapacity. But it does not just give them the balance sheet capacity and \nsay: Do what you want with it; we hope some will go to help avoid \nforeclosures through refinancings.\n  We say 85 percent of that increase must be dedicated to assisting \nsubprime borrowers who are stuck in risky adjustable rate mortgages. \nThe legislation is based on the premise that in troubled market times \nlike these, when private firms are unwilling or incapable of providing \nthe financing necessary to help subprime borrowers, it is appropriate \nand necessary for the government-sponsored enterprises to step in and \nprovide liquidity. This is why we have GSEs. They are quasi-private, \nquasi-public. They have a certain and special responsibility when the \nNation's economy is at risk. They are not the same as any private \ncompany whose job is to make money for its owners or its stockholders. \nBut at the same time, they have the expertise of\n\n[[Page S14439]]\n\nthe private sector and the clout of the private sector to get something \ndone in an efficient and directed way.\n  We have all heard that GSEs are the only game in town when it comes \nto secondary market trading, due to profound distrust of credit quality \nand rampant uncertainty about the rating agencies. We have to use the \nliquidity GSEs provide to target those subprime borrowers in need of a \nway to save their homes.\n  What is frustrating is the administration is opposed to this \nlegislation because they do not like Fannie and Freddie. They say: Let \nthe markets take care of this in their own way. That is a lesson that \nwas widely accepted in the 1890s and to some extent in the 1920s, but \nthis is 2007. We know thoughtful, well-thought-out Government \nintervention, in a careful way, works and is needed. We also know if we \ndo not have it, the booms and busts of the economy and to individuals \nwill be far greater, and starting with Woodrow Wilson and then with \nFranklin Roosevelt and with Democratic and Republican Presidents alike \nsince World War II, we have learned that at times Government \nintervention is called for, particularly when the private sector is \nunable to act. In this case, the private sector is clearly unable to \nact.\n  Over the coming weeks, we also plan to pass $200 million in the \nTransportation-HUD appropriations bill for housing counseling \norganizations that specialize in foreclosure prevention. Here is \nanother problem. A homeowner, and many of the homeowners who are in \nforeclosure or about to go in foreclosure, these are homeowners who \ncould qualify for prime loans, but they were taken advantage of by \nrapacious mortgage brokers. And now they are stuck. But they are not \nreally stuck, they have a revenue stream.\n  People I have met, Mr. Ruggiero, the late Mr. Ruggiero, a subway \nmotorman; Ms. Diaz, a clerk at a hospital for 35 years with a pension, \nthey have the income. Mr. Ruggiero of Queens, Ms. Diaz of Staten \nIsland, they have the income to refinance. The trouble is there is no \none there to help them do it. They cannot do it on their own.\n  There are no banks. Banks do not do this stuff in good part anymore. \nThere are nonprofits, able, dedicated, capable, knowledgeable \nnonprofits that could come right in and fill the lurch.\n  Now, you, Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I were able to persuade Senator Murray who, in her \nwisdom and always willingness to help, put first $100 million, then \n$200 million into the appropriations bill for housing counseling \norganizations that can provide this help.\n  At a cost of as little as a few hundred dollars per borrower, housing \ncounselors can prevent foreclosure that results in economic loss of \n$227,000 direct and indirect, on average. This is a highly cost-\neffective investment. We urge the administration not to veto this \nemergency funding when the Senate passes it. If it is vetoed, and this \ncrisis gets worse, a portion of the blame, a good portion, will be at \nthe President's doorstep, plain and simple.\n  I hope the President will not veto it. Most everyone who has looked \nat this legislation says it is needed. If we can do these three \nthings--FHA reform, lifting the portfolio caps for Fannie and Freddie, \nand money for housing counseling--we will not end the subprime crisis, \nit is too deep already. But we can abate it, and we can get our country \nfocused on moving again economically and on to so many other problems \nthat face us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think this would be an opportune time to pass the farm \nbill. Does anybody object?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Look, we obviously are not going to do that, take \nadvantage of this situation. But I must say, I am tempted after days \nand days of not being able to consider amendments on the farm bill that \nis critically important to this Nation's economy.\n  We got the bill through the Agriculture Committee without a single \ndissenting vote. Twenty-one members of the Senate serve on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. That is over one-fifth of the Senate. After \nmonths of difficult negotiations we reached conclusion.\n  Now we are in this circumstance in which people want to offer \namendments on everything from the Exxon Valdez to medical malpractice \nto immigration to labor issues to a whole series of things that have \nnothing to do with the farm bill.\n  Now, we all understand that very often hundreds of amendments are \nfiled on major bills that Senators have no intention of actually \noffering. Certainly, we know there are hundreds of amendments filed on \nthis bill. But I say to my colleagues, this has now gone on for 10 \ndays. We have not considered one amendment. We have not considered a \nsingle amendment.\n  At some point, one would hope there would be an accommodation. \nTypically, in a situation like this, the accommodation is that a \ncertain number of amendments are offered by each side.\n  That list is agreed to, entered into the Record, and votes are held. \nTypically on a farm bill there are about 20 amendments voted on, 20, \n22, 24. We could have been done with this bill by now. We could have \nbeen finished in the Senate. Then we would be in the conference \ncommittee to work out the differences between the House and Senate. But \nwe are where we are.\n  The reasonable way out of this is to proceed as Senator Reid offered \nlast night. I heard him clearly. He said we would take only five \namendments on this side. If they need more amendments on their side, he \nis open to considering their amendments, even some of them nonrelevant. \nHe made very clear he would accept a certain number that are \nnonrelevant. I ask our colleagues on the other side, can't you come up \nwith a list of amendments that you absolutely have to have voted on, \nincluding those nonrelevant amendments that you believe you have to \nhave a vote on? Can't you do that? Couldn't we enter that into the \nRecord and conclude work on this farm bill?\n  Why is it important? Why does this farm bill matter? First, because \nwe have a food policy in this country that is making a difference. How \ndo we know that? Here is the first way we know it. Who pays the least \nfor food in the world? It is our country. The numbers are very clear. \nWe spend 10 percent of our disposable income on food; 5.8 percent is \nspent on food eaten at home; 4.1 percent is spent on food eaten away \nfrom home. So of the 10 percent of our disposable income that goes for \nfood, about 60 percent of that is food eaten at home, so about 6 \npercent.\n  The comparable figure in these other countries is Japan, 14 percent \nof their income goes for food eaten at home; France, 15 percent; China, \n26 percent; Philippines, 38 percent; Indonesia, 55 percent. There is no \ncountry that comes even close to ours in terms of the percentage of \nincome going for food eaten at home. Even when you factor in food eaten \noutside the home, we are far less than any other country in the world.\n  Of course, as the Chair knows well, the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, who is such a valued member of the Agriculture Committee, who \nalso is an important member of the Finance Committee, these are not \nonly agriculture provisions, these are provisions that come from the \nFinance Committee on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, provisions to \nprovide an incentive to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This bill \nis called the Food and Energy Security Act because it looks to both, \nand both are critically important. Agriculture is one place where we \nstill export more than we import, one of the few places in the economy \nwhere that is true. On energy, it is one place where we could actually \nhelp dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It has been \ndone in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I hear the news broadcasts. I see what is written in some of the \npress. It is amazing that they don't have the basic facts of this \nlegislation, and they don't present them to the American people.\n\n[[Page S14440]]\n\n  Let me show this chart. Commodity programs, which are a small \nfraction of this bill, are the support programs for the major \ncommodities in this country. They draw all the criticism, all the heat. \nThe fact is, commodity program costs are going way down. This red line \nshows what the Congressional Budget Office estimated would be the cost \nof commodity programs when the last farm bill was written. This red \nline is what they estimated the farm program would cost, the commodity \nparts of the farm bill. But look at what has actually happened. We are \nwell below their estimates, not only for the current farm bill but look \nat the estimates going forward. The costs of the commodity program are \ndown dramatically from the past farm bill, from the projections that \nwere made at the time the last farm bill was written. As a share of \ntotal Federal spending, it is also down.\n  According to estimates when the last farm bill was written, the total \nfarm bill passed in 2002 would take 2.33 percent of total Federal \nspending and the commodity programs would take .75 of 1 percent. Now as \nwe look to this new farm bill and what the Congressional Budget Office \nis saying--these are not my numbers or Ag Committee numbers--they say \nthe Food and Energy Security Act costs will be down to less than 2 \npercent of total Federal spending. In fact, 1.87 percent of total \nFederal spending. And the commodity programs, the things that draw the \ncontroversy, are down to one-quarter of 1 percent of total Federal \nspending.\n  I have not seen that statistic written in a single Washington Post \ncolumn. I have not seen it on any of the television broadcasts, not \none. They are supposed to be giving the American people the information \nthey need upon which to base a decision, and they are not telling \npeople that the farm program is being reduced as a share of Federal \nspending or the commodity program is one-third of what it was estimated \nto be when the last farm bill was written. I don't see a single column \ntelling the American people that fact. I don't see a single broadcast \nthat allows that fact to be told to the American people. The Food and \nEnergy Security Act as a share of total Federal spending is going down, \nnot up. The commodity programs are going down, not up, as a share of \ntotal Federal spending.\n  The other thing they seem to forget about is where does the money go? \nThis pie chart shows where it is going. Almost two-thirds of the money, \n66 percent, is going for nutrition. That is not just farm States; that \nis in every State. Every State has school lunch. Every State has food \nstamps. Every State has food banks. Every State, every community \nbenefits by the nutrition spending in this bill. It is nearly two-\nthirds of the total. I don't see that reported by a single news source. \nI haven't seen any of them report that basic fact. I haven't seen \nany of them say 9 percent of the money is going for conservation of \nnatural resources. That is money that goes to every State of the \nNation. I don't see any of them reporting that less than 14 percent of \nthe money is going for commodity programs.\n\n  The fact is, this legislation is important to the Nation. It is \nimportant to the agriculture sector, no doubt, but it is also \ncritically important to our energy security to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. It is critically important to our economy. It is \ncritically important to our continuing competitiveness, because the \nEuropeans, our major competitors, are spending more than three times as \nmuch to provide support to their producers as we provide to ours. What \nare we supposed to say to our producers? You go out there and compete \nagainst the French and the German farmer, and while you are at it, go \ncompete against the French Government and the German Government too. \nThat is not a fair fight. Our farmers and ranchers can take on anybody. \nThey are happy to compete against the French and the Germans. But they \ncan't be expected to take on the French Government and the German \nGovernment as well. That is exactly what is happening in world \nagriculture. The Europeans are providing three times as much direct \nsupport to their producers as we provide ours. That is a fact. Those \nare not my numbers. Those are the numbers from the OECD, the \ninternational scorekeeper that keeps track of competitive positions.\n  What happens if we pull the rug out from under our producers when \nthey are faced already with a more than 3-to-1 disadvantage going up \nagainst our biggest competitors? What happens? Two words: Mass \nbankruptcy. That is what would happen. Farm income would plummet in \nthis country. Cash flow would dry up. Farm and ranch families would be \nforced off the land. America would experience in agriculture what we \nhave already experienced in so many other economic sectors. We would \nbecome dependent on the kindness of strangers for our food. We are \nalready dependent on the kindness of strangers for our money because we \nare borrowing so much money, because we are not being fiscally \nresponsible. We already are dependent for 60 percent of our energy on \nforeign countries. Sixty percent of our oil comes from abroad. We are \nheaded for 70 percent on energy if we fail to act.\n  The Food and Energy Security Act is one place we could make a \nmeaningful difference in reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Why? \nBecause it encourages and provides incentives for the development of \nethanol, and ethanol not just from corn but ethanol from cellulose, \nthings such as switchgrass and wood fiber. Because we know we cannot \nattain the goals this Congress and this President have set for the \ncountry in alternative fuels by only relying on corn for ethanol. We \nwill have to have a breakthrough on the use of cellulosity. There are \nother provisions to encourage the use of biodiesel fuel as well as \nethanol.\n  We look around the world. We don't have to look far to see other \ncountries that have made significant progress in reducing their \ndependence on foreign oil by looking at alternative fuels. Look at the \ncase of Brazil. Brazil, a number of years ago, was 80 percent dependent \non foreign energy. Just as we are 60 percent on foreign energy today, \nthey were 80 percent dependent. Today they are on the brink of energy \nindependence. That is startling. They have gone from 80 percent \ndependence on foreign energy to virtual energy independence. They have \ndone it over a 20-year period. They have done it by focusing on ethanol \nand flexible fuel vehicles, and what a difference it is making to their \ncountry. Look at their economy. It is soaring. Think how different our \ncountry would be if instead of spending $270 billion a year importing \nforeign energy we were spending that money here at home, helping to \ngrow our way out of this energy crisis. We could do it. Instead of \nmaintaining this dependence on the Middle East, how about looking to \nthe Midwest? How about having a circumstance in which a President could \nwake up in the morning and know he didn't have to worry or she didn't \nhave to worry about what was going to happen in the Middle East and how \nthat might threaten the energy security of our country, because that \nperson might know we no longer were dependent on Saudi Arabia, on \nKuwait, on Venezuela; that instead we were able to produce the energy \nhere at home.\n  This isn't a fantasy. It is a possibility. But it is only going to \nhappen if we take steps. Some of the steps that are needed to be taken \nare in this legislation, this legislation that is going nowhere over \nsome argument that the other side ought to be able to offer a whole \nbunch of amendments on things that have absolutely nothing to do with \nfood and energy security. Medical malpractice, Exxon Valdez, the \nalternative minimum tax--those have nothing to do with the farm bill. \nBut those are amendments that are pending on the other side.\n  A final point I want to make is from an article in the Wall Street \nJournal from September 28 of this year. The headline of this chart is \n``Farm Productivity Spurs Global Economy.''\n  Somehow, something has happened in this country. We have forgotten \nabout our roots. We have forgotten about where we came from. We have \nforgotten about what has helped America be strong. Right at the core of \nour strength and our success has been an incredibly productive \nagricultural sector--farm and ranch families all across this country \nwho have dramatically increased their productivity through technology \nand through their own good work.\n  But look at what it means not just to us but around the world. This, \nagain, is\n\n[[Page S14441]]\n\nfrom the Wall Street Journal of September:\n\n       The prospect for a long boom is riveting economists because \n     the declining real price of grain has long been one of the \n     unsung forces behind the development of the global economy. \n     Thanks to steadily improving seeds, synthetic fertilizer and \n     more powerful farm equipment, the productivity of farmers in \n     the West and Asia has stayed so far ahead of population \n     growth that prices of corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, \n     had dropped 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively, since \n     1974. Among other things, falling grain prices made food more \n     affordable for the world's poor, helping shrink the \n     percentage of the world's population that is malnourished.\n\n  How did all this happen? If the farm policy of this country, which is \nthe dominant agricultural producer in the world, is so flawed--as is \nrepeated hour after hour by every broadcast station in this country and \nrepeated in newspaper column after newspaper column--how is it we have \nhad this incredible success and it has gone completely or virtually \nunnoticed by the major media? Could it be that maybe they have not done \na very good job of telling the American people the full story? Could it \nbe that they have been so eager to find fault with every corner and \nevery piece of farm legislation because they kind of at heart look down \non people who work the land? I hate to say it, but I think now we are \ngetting at the truth. I think there is a deep arrogance among some \nabout people--farm and ranch families--who are out there, and they want \nto somehow believe they are superior to them. They want to believe they \nare farming the mailbox and that there are all these endless abuses.\n  It is fascinating, if there are all these endless abuses, why do the \nreform proposals that have been presented and have been suggested raise \nso little money? If there is this rampant abuse, as is presented in the \npopular media, why do all the measures to reform the system save so \nlittle money? How could that be? Could it be because the abuses that do \nexist--and there are abuses--could it be that they are the exception \nrather than the rule? Could it be that we actually have an agricultural \npolicy in this country that has worked so remarkably well that the \nprice of grain, corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, has dropped 75 \npercent and 69 percent, respectively, since 1974? Could it be that we \nhave an agricultural policy in this country that has worked beyond \nanyone's fondest dreams? Could it be that those who put this policy in \nplace actually knew what they were doing? Could it be that one of the \nreasons for America's remarkable success and agricultural abundance and \nlow food prices relative to every other country in the world is because \nwe have been doing something right? Could that be?\n  Maybe it is. Maybe that is the real story the popular media has not \nwritten or broadcast. Maybe they have failed to see that part of \nAmerica's success story is America's agricultural policy--a policy that \nnow can extend not only to food security--and, by the way, has anybody \nbeen watching lately what happens when we become dependent on foreign \ncountries for our food supply? Has anybody been watching the questions \nof food safety from not only food but other products coming from \nforeign countries?\n  Is anybody paying attention to the energy opportunity that is in this \nlegislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help further \nstrengthen this incredible country?\n  It is easy to criticize. It is easy to point the finger. It is easy \nto castigate. It is easy to act superior. It is hard to produce \nsomething that builds a better future for our people. That is hard.\n  I will just ask those who have been such constant critics: Can't you \nopen your mind just a little bit and acknowledge what is clearly the \nlarger truth? The larger truth is, we have the cheapest food as a \npercentage of income in the history of the world. The truth is, we have \nthe most abundant and the safest food supplies of any nation in the \nhistory of mankind. The truth is, the cost of this program is going \ndown as a share of the total Federal budget--and in the case of the \ncommodity programs, going down dramatically. The truth is, we have an \nopportunity to improve the energy security for our country. The truth \nis, we have a chance to strengthen the economy and to make this a much \nmore secure country. Right now, that opportunity is being missed.\n  Look at this Chamber. This is the Thursday before we are supposed to \nleave for 2 weeks for Thanksgiving. I hope when people sit around those \nfamily tables across America enjoying the bounty of our country, they \nthink, for just a moment: Where did that bounty come from? It did not \njust come from the grocery store. I am talking about who grew the \ncrops, who raised the livestock, who raised the poultry we are going to \nenjoy around that dining room table. Where did it come from? How much \ndoes it cost in relationship to what others are paying around the \nworld?\n  What is the further opportunity we have to reduce our dependence on \nforeign energy? Isn't part of it--a significant part of it--anchored in \nthe rural communities of America, a place where we could help grow our \nway out of this dependence on foreign energy by producing it right here \nat home?\n  I hope Americans will think about this. I hope even some of our \ncritics in the media will think--gee, maybe shouldn't they report the \nfull story? Maybe should just one article talk about the positive \nthings that have happened? I know the good news is not news according \nto the news media, but I do not know how the American people can be \nexpected to make a fair and objective decision on the merits of this \nlegislation or the food policy of the country if they are not given the \nwhole story--the whole story--not just the things they can make into a \nheadline and castigate people.\n  I hope for just a moment our colleagues will reflect: Does this \nprocess--here we are, it is Thursday at 12:40 p.m. Eastern time, and I \nam the only one here, other than the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nwho is a Member of this body.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And Senator Nelson.\n  Let me say that I hope our colleagues will think very carefully about \nhow we break this gridlock. This does not reflect well on the body. \nThis does not reflect well on the Senate of the United States that we \nare not able to move forward on legislation that came out of the \ncommittee without a single dissenting vote and we have been stuck here \nfor 10 days doing nothing. I hope we are going to prove we are better \nthan this when we return.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota what an absolute delight he is to speak with such \npassion, as he does, about things he knows so much about and how he can \nexplain it in understandable terms.\n  Farm bills are one of the most complicated things in the world \nbecause of the balancing of all the different interests, with these \nelaborate farm support programs, that you have to have a Ph.D. in \nmathematics, sometimes, to understand. Senator Conrad is someone who \nspeaks so eloquently and yet so simply in explaining it. He comes from \nthe land, and he represents a lot of those who earn their living from \nthe land, as does this Senator from Florida.\n  Most people think of Florida as Disney World and high tech and the \nspace center and so forth. People would be amazed that Florida \nagriculture is--next to the service industry, which is tourism--just \nabout equal to any other industry as the second largest economic impact \ninterest on our State. Our beef cattle industry is huge. Our citrus \nindustry is huge. So it is with a great deal of passion, like Senator \nConrad, that I take the floor to try to articulate the importance of a \nfarm bill to the people in our State as well as has been articulated by \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Now, I wish to talk not just about the farm bill. I want to talk \nabout a major amendment that is pending, and that is the Lugar-\nLautenberg amendment in taking a completely fresh look at how we \nprotect the Nation's agriculture. I am very happy to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  No doubt, farmers are facing difficulties. We rely on them for our \nfood. Senator Conrad said it best: In this time of thanksgiving, as we \nsit around a table of bounty, we should be grateful we live in a land \nwhere our basic food and nutrition is met for most Americans. And I say \n``most Americans'' because some do not.\n\n[[Page S14442]]\n\n  Because we have an effective farming industry, it demands we continue \nto be good stewards of the land and the water. We rely on those farmers \nto persevere during times of natural disaster and uncertainty, where \nmajor natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can completely eliminate \nthe citrus crop in Florida, which threatens their very solvency. Then, \nat the same time, we are asking them not to give in to the pressures, \nthe financial pressures to sell their land for development. This is \nparticularly acute in a State such as Florida where the land value has \nrisen so much that it almost does not make economic sense for the \nfarmers to continue to farm their land.\n  These farmers are providing our food to our citizens--and not only to \nAmerica but to the world. We must provide farmers a safety net in the \nmany programs we do here in the farm bill, in other natural disaster \nbills--a safety net for their times of uncertainty. We have a system \nthat works for many, but this system in a State such as Florida doesn't \nwork for all. In fact, a majority of our Florida farmers are not \neligible to participate in a lot of these farm programs that receive \nthe lion's share of the payments in the bill we are going to vote on. \nThis system, as I said, is so complicated it is nuanced. Many of the \nprograms in the farm bill were started as a temporary fix of the \nimmediate problem that the country was facing at the time, but then \nthey get extended time and time again. Then, contrary to their original \nintent, they become permanent, and some of them have become corrupted--\nsome of those programs--by people who exploit them.\n\n  OK. It is time for us to step back and take a fresh look at this and \ndetermine how we can best support our farmers. I believe the Lugar-\nLautenberg approach I have joined is an amendment that does that. The \namendment is going to flow out of the normal farm program and it would \nprovide every farmer in this country who chooses to participate with \nfarm insurance, which would be provided at no cost. Farmers then would \nhave a guarantee that their revenue would reach a certain threshold \nbased on local conditions instead of national standards. This is a \nremarkable shift from the way we do business now. But it means we \neliminate the direct payments to farmers whose land hasn't been farmed \nin years or who are selling their crops at record high prices. Instead, \nunder this amendment, we are going to provide them with a safety net to \nfall back on if their farm revenues suddenly drop or if a bad year \nhits. Guess how much money it is going to save. Upwards of $4 billion. \nEven by giving the farm insurance at no cost to the farmer, it is going \nto save billions of dollars.\n  The Senate bill we now have on the floor has parts of it that are \nvery good. It increases money for nutrition programs which are going to \nmake a tangible difference in the lives of those on food stamps. It has \na tangible increase for the conservation programs which will make \nsignificant strides in protecting our lands and watersheds. But this \namendment I am talking about, the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment, goes even \nfurther. It fully funds the nutrition programs across 10 years--not \njust 5 as in the committee bill--and it expands programs such as the \nsimplified summer food program. It accounts for an additional $150 \nmillion each year to provide for school lunches, and some of those \nschool lunches are going to children--hungry children--in the \ndeveloping world. It increases the conservation spending by $1 billion. \nAt the end of the day, the amendment saves billions of dollars by \ntaking out the antiquated direct payments program.\n  My State of Florida has more acres of orange and grapefruit groves \nthan any other State and it ranks among the top five when it comes to \ngrowing vegetables, not even speaking about what I already told my \ncolleagues; you would be surprised among the beef cattle industry how \nbig we are. Until this year, the needs of specialty crops such as \ncitrus and vegetables were barely mentioned in farm legislation. The \ncommittee bill we are now debating finally addresses this part of \nagriculture that is so near and dear to our hearts, and so much of a \nstaple for us in Florida, by making tremendous advances in research, \npest and disease mitigation, technical assistance, and block grants. I \ngive sincere thanks to Chairman Harkin and his committee for what they \nhave done, but guess what. The Lugar-Lautenberg amendment goes even \nfurther. It provides over $750 million more to specialty crops and \nstill manages to save $20 billion. I said $4 billion earlier. I said \nbillions. That is true. We are talking about $20 billion of savings in \noverall support for agriculture by taking this farmers' insurance \nprogram at no cost to the farmers.\n  Specialty crops certainly aren't just important to Florida. Fruits \nand vegetables are an absolute necessity of healthy eating everywhere, \nand this Lugar-Lautenberg amendment gives an additional $200 million to \nthe Women, Infants and Children Farmers Market Nutrition Program which \nmakes fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables a part of their daily \ndiets--daily diets of women and young children who can't afford them. \nNot only is it going to make our children grow up strong and healthy, \nbut it also supports the local farmers. There is also an extra $250 \nmillion in this amendment for a similar program that serves low-income \nsenior citizens.\n  I have been on this Senate floor time and time again to call \nattention to the plight of one of our great national, international, \nand natural treasures: the Florida Everglades. I am happy to tell my \ncolleagues there is an important step in this Lugar-Lautenberg \namendment in conserving the endangered Everglades, as it includes $35 \nmillion that can be used to complement efforts undertaken by the State \nof Florida to restore the northern part of the Everglades system, which \nis the area that is so located that pollutes so much of the rest of the \nEverglades as the water flows south, because it is the area north of \nLake Okeechobee that is critical to the larger ecosystem further to the \nsouth. While this is a small part of what is needed to preserve the \noverall Everglades and to restore the Everglades, it is another \nopportunity we can do something about, in helping clean up that water \nthat is flowing into Lake Okeechobee that ultimately flows south into \nthe Florida Everglades.\n  This amendment is a fresh, effective way of how we can do business in \nagriculture, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Colorado\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I come back to the floor this afternoon \nat 1:35 p.m. eastern time just to remind my colleagues about the \nimportance of the issue we are working on. This farm bill, which is the \nFarm, Fuel, Security Act, is something that is very important to the \nfuture of America.\n  We are knocking on the door of Thanksgiving for all Americans, where \nwe will all be giving thanks for the bounty we produce in this country \nfor our families and for the lives we live in this wonderful and free \nAmerica. But without the hard work of farmers and ranchers throughout \nthis country, that very food supply which will give us that great joy \nduring this holiday would not be there.\n  This is one time every 5 years--one time every 5 years--where the \nMembers of the Senate get to stand up and take stock of the importance \nof our farmers and ranchers and rural America and the importance of \nnutrition for our young people in our schools and those who are the \nmost vulnerable, those on food stamps, and the importance of dealing \nwith protecting our land and water and dealing with the future energy \nsupply needs of America. So as we approach this Thanksgiving \ncelebration, it is important for all of us to think back, to reflect \nupon what is happening in the Senate today.\n  Some 10 days after we started this farm bill, and after 3 years of \nhard labor with both Democrats and Republicans to get us to this farm \nbill, we are now stuck in this procedural impasse we find ourselves in. \nI think it is a shame that we are where we are. I\n\n[[Page S14443]]\n\nthink it is a shame that we are not able to move forward.\n  Last night I heard the majority leader, Senator Reid, come to the \nfloor and say: This farm bill is important. Senator Reid said: I want \nto get a farm bill. He said: We will offer, on the Democratic side, to \nlimit the number of amendments to five. With some almost 300 amendments \nfiled on this bill, Senator Reid said: We will limit the number of \nDemocratic amendments to five, and we will give you, if you want twice \nas many amendments, we will give you twice as many amendments. Yet no \ndeal.\n  Why no deal? Why no deal? Why can't we even agree on a subset of \namendments we can debate on the floor and then vote on them and move \nforward on this farm bill? Is it that there is a slow walk, a stall \nunderway because some Members in this Chamber don't want a farm bill? \nAre there some Members in this Chamber who do not want a farm bill?\n  There is a reality, and the reality is that it is possible for us to \nstill get a farm bill. It is still possible for us to get a farm bill. \nWe can move together tomorrow and get 60 votes on the cloture vote. We \ncan have Republicans joining Democrats to get those 60 votes, and then \nwe will move forward with a procedure under the postcloture rules of \nthe Senate to address a series of germane amendments that will improve \nthe bill. So we could still get a farm bill.\n  The question is, Do the members of the minority in the Senate today \nwant to get a farm bill or do they not? Are the politics being pushed \ngoing to triumph over public purpose, which we have tried to address in \nthis farm bill? Are they going to allow politics to triumph over that \npublic purpose?\n  I would hope not. And I would hope when we come together in the \nSenate to vote on the cloture motion tomorrow, that there is a \nresounding yes that we are going to move forward and complete this farm \nbill; that we are going to enter into the postcloture period where we \nwill address the germane amendments to this legislation, and at the end \nof the day we will have a farm bill that can be passed and then sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             UNSAFE IMPORTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, as the holiday season approaches and \nparents are buying toys and other consumer products for their children, \nI would like to put that in the context of what has happened with our \neconomy, what has happened with our trade policy, and what has happened \nwith the breakdown of the part of our Government--the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture--that is there for one simple reason; that \nis, to protect our people. The Environmental Protection Agency is there \nto make sure our air and water are clean, the Food and Drug \nAdministration is there to make sure our pharmaceutical supplies and \nfood supplies are safe, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is there to \nmake sure other food coming across our borders and food that is \nproduced in this country is safe, and the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is charged by this Congress, by our Government, to make sure \nour consumer products are safe.\n  Through the last many years--exacerbated, made worse by the policies \nof the incumbent, the present administration--we have established a \nsituation that is almost a perfect storm for bad outcomes.\n  Last year, in 2006, we imported about $288 billion worth of goods \nfrom China. Tens of millions of dollars of those goods were toys, \ntoothpaste, dog food, and other kinds of consumer products. When you \nbuy tens of billions of dollars of consumer products from China, you \nunderstand implicitly that those products are made and manufactured and \nproduced in a country that puts little emphasis on safe drinking water, \nclean air, food safety, purity in pharmaceuticals, and consumer product \nsafety. So when you buy tens of billions of dollars of goods produced \nin China, you can bet there is a good chance much of their food or \ningredients might be contaminated, much of their toys and tires can be \ndefective.\n  Put on top of that the fact that many U.S. companies go to China as \nthey outsource jobs and they close down production facilities in St. \nLouis, in Independence, in Kansas City in the State of the Presiding \nOfficer, or in Cleveland, in Dayton, in Gallipolis and Steubenville and \nLima in my State. They close down production and outsource these jobs \nto China.\n  These American companies then subcontract with Chinese companies to \nmake these products. When they subcontract with these Chinese \ncompanies, knowing that production in China is not as safe, either for \nthe worker or for the safety of the product, knowing that production in \nChina can often mean contaminated food products and vitamins and \ntoothpaste and dog food, and at the same time understand those American \ncompanies that are subcontracting with these Chinese companies, Chinese \nsubcontractors, the American companies are pushing them to cut costs--\nyou have to cut these costs, you have to cut these corners, you have to \nmake these products cheaper--when you do that, it should not come as a \nsurprise to Americans, or to our Government, that you are more likely \nto get tires that are defective, more likely to get contaminated \ntoothpaste or inulin in apple juice, you are more likely to get \nproducts that simply don't work as well, and you are more likely to get \nlead-based paint coating our toys. Why? Lead-based paint is cheaper to \nbuy, less expensive to apply, it is shinier, and it dries faster.\n  When American companies--without mentioning any names of American toy \nmanufacturers--push their Chinese subcontractors to make it cheaper, to \ncut costs, to save money for these companies, it is almost inevitable \nthat these products are going to have lead-based paint, are going to \nhave other kinds of consumer safety problems. You have them made in \nChina with a nonexistent safety regulatory mechanism, made by companies \nsubcontracting with United States companies that are telling them to \ncut costs, and then these products come into the United States.\n  What happens here? President Bush has weakened the whole regulatory \nstructure. What does that mean? What he has done is dismantled a lot of \nthe protections of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. \nEPA, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Again, why are we surprised when Jeffrey Weidenheimer, a professor at \nAshland University in my State, at my request tested 22 toys bought in \nthe local store 10 miles from where I grew up and found 3 of them had \nexcessively, dangerously high lead content? Six hundred parts per \nmillion is what we as a country have established as a safe amount of \nlead--600 parts per million is safe. One of the products he tested, a \nFrankenstein drinking mug for children, had 39,000 parts per million.\n  Why does that happen? Because Nancy Nord and the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission aren't doing their job. They have half the budget \nthey had 20 years ago, and the budget has continued to be cut by \nPresident Bush. They have weaker rules, and they have a Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission chair who simply says: We are doing the best \nwe can with what we have. Chairwoman Nord has come in front of the \nCommerce Committee and said: I do not need a budget increase; things \nare just fine in my agency. She also has lobbied against the \nlegislation from my seatmate, Senator Pryor, who has introduced \nlegislation that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.\n\n  The solution to all this, without great detail, is to begin to change \nour trade policy. So if we are going to buy tens of billions of dollars \nof toothpaste and dog food and apple juice and other food products and \nvitamins and toys and tires from the People's Republic of China, from \nthat Communist regime, that also means they are going to have to begin \nto follow better safety regimens for the products they produce. It\n\n[[Page S14444]]\n\nmeans American companies that import have to be responsible. If you are \nan American company and you go to China, you hire a subcontractor, and \nyou bring those products back into the United States, it is up to you, \nin your corporate and your personal responsibility, to guarantee the \nsafety of those products.\n  It means a better Consumer Product Safety Commission. It means that \nNancy Nord should step aside, the Chairwoman of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. It means the President of the United States, who has \nshown little interest in that agency except to weaken and defund it, \nneeds, actually, to appoint four new Commissioners. There are only two \nthere now; they have five spots. The President, for whatever reason, \nhas not replaced them. He needs to appoint a new chair to this \nCommission. Nancy Nord has shown she is both indifferent to making this \nCommission work and, frankly, has too great a bias to the companies she \nis supposed to police. She has traveled with them. She has traveled \nwith them at their expense and done all kinds of things and clearly has \nnot shown any real interest in making our Consumer Product Safety \nCommission work.\n  It is up to us as Members of the Senate, Members of the House, this \nGovernment--it is up to us. Our first responsibility is to protect our \npeople, and that means in terms of the air we breathe, the water we \ndrink, the food we eat, the consumer products we use, and the toys that \nare in our children's bedrooms and playrooms. The road is clear, the \nroad we should drive down. Nancy Nord should go.\n  Beyond Nancy Nord's resignation, we need the President's \nattentiveness to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Senate \nneeds to pass the legislation from Senator Pryor, and we need to move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Commerce-Justice Appropriations\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I regret to report that the \nconference committee for the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations \nbill has been indefinitely postponed. I wanted to take just a few \nminutes and say from my point of view why it has been postponed and to \nexpress my hope that it can be put back on track soon, in the regular \norder, and that we can move ahead and deal with it.\n  The Commerce-Justice appropriations bill includes funding for the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It includes \nappropriations for NASA, for the National Science Foundation, and the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n  Here is what has happened. It is important for my colleagues to know \nthis. The reason the Appropriations Committee conference has been \npostponed is because the Speaker of the House objects to an amendment \nwhich I offered in the Appropriations Committee, which was adopted by \nthe committee, adopted by the full Senate, and which the House of \nRepresentatives instructed its conferees to approve. I have been told \nthat unless I agree not to bring the amendment up in conference, the \nconference will not meet.\n  Let me describe the amendment. I believe most Americans will be \nsurprised to learn what its subject is. The amendment I offered in the \nSenate Appropriations Committee is an amendment to make clear that it \nis not against the Federal law for an employer to require an employee \nto speak English on the job. Let me say that again. My amendment, which \nwas adopted by this Senate, was to make it clear that it is not against \nthe Federal law for an employer to require an employee to speak English \non the job. That was adopted by the Appropriations Committee. Among \nthose voting for it were the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, and the ranking Republican member, Senator Cochran. When \nit went to the House, there were two votes on it, but the second vote \nhad the House, as a majority, instructing its conferees to agree with \nthe Senate position and make it the Federal law.\n  Why did I offer such an amendment? I offered the amendment because \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Federal agency, has \ndetermined that it is illegal for an employer in this country to \nrequire employees to speak in English while working. As a result, the \nEEOC has sued the Salvation Army, for example, for damages because one \nof the Salvation Army thrift stores in Boston required its employees to \nspeak English on the job. The EEOC says this is a discrimination in \nviolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It says, in effect, that \nunless the Salvation Army can prove this is a business necessity, it \ncan't require its employees to speak English.\n  In plain English, this means that thousands of small businesses \nacross America--the shoe shop, the drugstore, the gas station--any \ncompany would have to be prepared to make their case to the Federal \nagency--and perhaps hire a lawyer--to show there is some special reason \nto justify requiring their employees to speak our country's common \nlanguage on the job. I believe this is a gross distortion of the Civil \nRights Act, and it is a complete misunderstanding of what it means to \nbe an American.\n  I do not say this lightly. Since the 1960s, in Tennessee, at a time \nwhen it was not popular, I have supported, I believe, and voted for, \nwhen I have been in a position to do it, every major piece of civil \nrights legislation that has come down the road from the early days. I \nbelieve in that passionately. I remember the 1964 Civil Rights Act and \nthe Voting Rights Act and all those important pieces of Federal and \nState legislation which have made a difference to equal rights in our \ncountry. But I cannot imagine that the framers of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct intended to say that it is discrimination for a shoe shop owner to \nsay to his or her employee: I want you to be able to speak America's \ncommon language on the job. That is why I put forward an amendment to \nstop the EEOC from filing these lawsuits.\n  That is why the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed on June 28 to \napprove my amendment. That is why the full Senate on October 16 passed \na bill including my amendment. That is why the full House of \nRepresentatives voted to instruct its conferees to agree with the \nSenate on November 8. That is why, I believe, that the Senate-House \nconference on this appropriations bill should include the amendment in \nthe conference report so it can become law.\n  Let me step back for a minute and try to put this small amendment in \na larger perspective. Our country's greatest accomplishment is not our \ndiversity. Our diversity is magnificent. It is a source of great \nstrength. Our country's greatest accomplishment is that we have turned \nall that magnificent diversity into one country. It is no accident that \non the wall above the Presiding Officer are a few words that were our \noriginal national motto: E Pluribus Unum, one from many, not many from \none.\n  Looking around the world, it is worth remembering that it is \nvirtually impossible to become Chinese, or to become Japanese, or to \nbecome German, or to become French. But if you want to be a citizen of \nthe United States of America, you must become an American. Becoming an \nAmerican is not based on race. It cannot be based upon where your \ngrandparents came from. It cannot be based upon your native religion or \nyour native language. Our Constitution makes those things clear. In our \ncountry, becoming an American begins with swearing allegiance to this \ncountry. It is based upon learning American history so one can know the \nprinciples in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\n  The late Albert Shanker, the head of the American Federation of \nTeachers, was once asked what is the rationale for a public school in \nAmerica? He answered: The rationale for public schools is that they \nwere created in the late part of the 19th century to help mostly \nimmigrant children learn the three Rs and what it means to be an\n\n[[Page S14445]]\n\nAmerican, with the hope that they would go home and teach their parents \nthe principles in the Constitution and the Declaration that unite us.\n  Our unity is based upon learning our common language, English, so we \ncan speak to one another, live together more easily, and do business \nwith one another. We have spent the last 40 years in our country \ncelebrating diversity at the expense of unity. It is easy to do that. \nWe need to spend the next several years working hard to build more \nunity from our magnificent diversity. That is much harder to do. One \nway to create that unity is to value, not devalue, our common language, \nEnglish. That is why in this body I have advocated amendments which \nhave been adopted to help new Americans who are legally here have \nscholarships so they can learn our common language.\n  I have worked with other Members of this body on the other side of \nthe aisle to take a look at our adult education programs which are the \nsource of funding for programs to help adults learn English. There are \nlines in Boston and lines in Nashville of people who want to learn \nEnglish. We should be helping them to learn English. We could not spend \ntoo much on such a program.\n  That is why with No Child Left Behind, one of the major revisions we \nneed to do is related to children who need more help learning English, \nbecause that is their chance in their school to learn our common \nlanguage, to learn our country's principles and then to be even more \nsuccessful.\n  Not long ago, before Ken Burns's epic film series on World War II \ncame on television, my wife and I went to the Library of Congress to \nhear him speak and to see a preview of the film. He was talking, of \ncourse, about World War II and that period of time. It was during World \nWar II, he said, that America had more unity than at any other time in \nour history, which caused me to think, as I think it must have caused \nmillions of Americans to think: What have we done with that unity since \nWorld War II? Our pulling together since then, our working as one \ncountry has been the foundation of most of our great accomplishments.\n  That is the reason we have the greatest universities, that is the \nreason we have the strongest economy, that is the reason we still have \nthe country with the greatest opportunity. Quoting the late Arthur \nSchlesinger, in Schlesinger's 1990s book which was called ``The \nDisuniting of America,'' Ken Burns told us that: Perhaps what we need \nin America today is a little less pluribus and a little more unum.\n  I believe Ken Burns's quote of Arthur Schlesinger is right about \nthat. One way to make sure we have a little more unum, a little more of \nthe kind of national unity that is our country's greatest \naccomplishment, is to make certain we value our common language, that \nwe help children learn it, that we help new Americans learn it, that we \nhelp adults who do not know it to learn it, and that we not devalue it \nby allowing a Federal agency to say it is a violation of Federal law \nfor an employer in America to require an employee to speak English on \nthe job.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I understand that the majority may \nmove to proceed to the supplemental bill passed by the House last \nnight. That bill imposes at least two policy restrictions that will \ncompel a veto: directing the readiness standard the Defense Department \nmust follow before a unit may be deployed, and expanding the \ninterrogation procedures established in the Army Field Manual over to \nthe intelligence community.\n  The House bill will also compel the immediate withdrawal of forces, \nregardless of what General Petraeus's orders may be. Petraeus has \nestablished a reasonable timeline for the transition of mission and \ndrawdown, and, frankly, we ought to support him. The Marine \nexpeditionary unit identified by General Petraeus in September for \nwithdrawal has left Iraq, and an Army brigade is headed home over the \nnext month.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 484, S. 2340, the \ntroop funding bill. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 2340, a bill making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2008.\n         Mitch McConnell, Saxby Chambliss, Bob Corker, Wayne \n           Allard, Thad Cochran, John Cornyn, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Lisa Murkowski, Orrin Hatch, Richard Burr, \n           Trent Lott, Mike Crapo, Pat Roberts, Chuck Grassley, \n           Jon Kyl, Norm Coleman, Mel Martinez.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Secretary Gates stated clearly \nyesterday that the Army and Marine Corps will run out of operating \nfunds early next year. This funding shortfall will harm units preparing \nfor deployment and those training for their basic missions. We should \nnot cut off funding for our troops in the field, particularly at a \nmoment when the tactical success of the Petraeus plan is crystal clear. \nAttacks and casualties are down. Political cooperation is occurring at \nthe local level. We should not leave our forces in the field without \nthe funding they need to accomplish the mission for which they have \nbeen deployed.\n  The Pelosi bill, if it was to get to the President's desk, of course, \nwould be vetoed, as was the supplemental bill sent to the President \nearlier this year that contained a withdrawal date. Because we have a \nresponsibility to provide this funding to our men and women in uniform \nas they attempt to protect the American people, we need to get a clean \ntroop funding bill to the President.\n  There is no particular reason to have all the votes that are likely \nto be coming our way tomorrow. I have indicated repeatedly to the \nmajority leader--and we have at the staff level--that we would be more \nthan happy on this side of the aisle to move both the farm bill cloture \nvote and whatever cloture vote or votes we end up having on the troop \nfunding issue up to today. I hope there is still the possibility of \ndoing that. I know Members on both sides of the aisle, in anticipation \nof the 2-week break, have travel plans. I am all for staying here \nlonger if it makes sense, but under this particular set of \ncircumstances, it doesn't make sense.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak about the importance \nof the farm bill. I also wish to express the same deep concern about \nwhat is happening on process in the Senate, as so many of my colleagues \nand the majority leader have. This is the second week we have been \ntrying to pass a food and energy security bill that is important for \nevery community. The process that has gone on, frankly, since the \nbeginning of the year, is one of delay, slow walking, and filibusters \nover and over again.\n  Yesterday, I showed a chart that read ``52 filibusters so far this \nyear.'' Tomorrow we have potentially three more votes to close off \nfilibusters. One relates to funding on the war that is tied to a policy \nchange the majority of Americans want to have happen to move our men \nand women out of the middle of a civil war, to refocus us instead on \nthe critical areas of counterterrorism, training, support for Americans \nwho remain, those things the majority of Americans want to see happen. \nWe have to stop a filibuster on\n\n[[Page S14446]]\n\nthat tomorrow morning. We then have two votes potentially on stopping \nfilibusters on the farm bill. So my ``52'' is, as of tomorrow, \npotentially 55 filibusters this year.\n  We have never seen the level of filibustering that we have had in the \ncurrent session of the Senate with our friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  In spite of the slowdown, in spite of the blocking of efforts to vote \non amendments and to get a farm bill done last week, in spite of \nefforts this week, I am proud to say that yesterday we were able to \nwork together to pass a reauthorization of Head Start. This is \nsomething that was done on a bipartisan basis. It will go to the \nPresident. We expect him to sign it. It will increase standards for \nteachers and extend resources so more children can receive Head Start \nfunding. Head Start is so important to prepare children for school, to \ngive them a head start. It is a wonderful program that involves parents \nbeing a part of the effort of preschool education. Despite what as of \ntomorrow will be 55 filibusters this year, we once again have put \nforward something that is important to the American people--investing \nin our young children, getting them ready to go to school. The Head \nStart bill did pass. I am pleased it did.\n  Concerning the farm bill that is in front of us, we have worked so \nhard together. We have a bill that came out of committee unanimously, a \nstrong bipartisan effort to not only support traditional agricultural \ncommodities but also to move us in new directions for the future. I am \npleased, in addition to traditional farm programs that are supported in \nMichigan, that we were able to add support for the 50 percent of the \ncrops grown that haven't been under the farm bill; specialty crops, \nfruits and vegetables are now a part of this farm bill. That is \nimportant.\n  We have also tied that to a partnership to expand nutrition, a \nsignificant new program expansion--it is beyond a pilot--the chairman \nof the committee has let in on fresh fruits and vegetables as snacks in \nschools, rather than children going to a vending machine and getting \nsoda pop or candy. There are many parts of this farm bill that focus on \nnutrition. In fact, most people will be surprised to know the majority \nof the farm bill, over 60 percent, is in fact focused on nutrition. We \nneed to get this done. We need to get this done both for our growers as \nwell as for children, seniors, food banks that receive help, farmers' \nmarkets, organic farmers. This is very important.\n  We also in this farm bill have done something very significant--I \nnotice our chairman from the Finance Committee on the floor who has led \nus in this, he and our ranking member--and that is creating a permanent \ndisaster relief program as a part of the farm bill. I am very pleased \nthat fruit and vegetable growers will be able to participate. We need \nto be able to respond quickly when there is a disaster--a flood, a \ndrought, other kinds of disasters.\n  We also have moved this farm bill more aggressively in the direction \nof alternative energy, alternative fuels, biofuels. This is important \nin getting us off gasoline, off oil, when we look at prices continuing \nto rise every day. It is also a way to create jobs. In Michigan, we are \ncreating hundreds of jobs now, with thousands to come, from ethanol \nplants and biodiesel plants. As we move to cellulosic ethanol, we will \nbe able to create new opportunities for my sugar beet growers and the \nfolks up north who are involved in timber and wood products, as well as \nswitchgrasses and other areas. This is important. It is time to get \nthis done, alternative energy for the future, addressing our energy \nneeds, supporting our farmers.\n  I am proud also that American car companies within the next 3 years, \nby 2012, half of what they produce, half of what they manufacture will \nbe flex-fuel vehicles, ethanol, other flex fuels. We need to get this \nfarm bill done to be able to support that effort.\n\n  Rural development is a critical part as well. I have small \ncommunities all over Michigan that would not have water and sewer \nprojects if it was not for USDA rural development--another critical \npart of this bill.\n  I would simply say we have seen now, since last week, delay after \ndelay after delay on giving us the opportunity to move forward and get \nthis farm bill done. Now is the time to do that. I hope tomorrow we \nwill vote to stop filibustering, we will vote to proceed to a critical \nbill.\n  Folks think the farm bill is only about rural communities, but all of \nus are impacted by every part of this farm bill. We need to get this \ndone. It is time to get this done. I do not want to keep having to \nchange this chart over and over again, although I fear I will, on how \nmany times there is delay, how many times there is filibustering going \non.\n  We have a farm bill in front of us that needs to get done for all of \nus. It has been done in a truly bipartisan way. It has very broad \nsupport. Now is the time to get this done for our American farmers and \nour families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMontana.\n\n\n                        Drug Safety Intimidation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, is on the floor. We will both speak on the same subject. I \nhave a statement, and then I think he wants to speak next on the same \nsubject.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I are placing in the Congressional Record \na Senate Finance Committee staff report which describes a very \ndisturbing series of events related to the safety of the diabetes drug \nAvandia.\n  I commend Senator Grassley for his efforts on this issue, and I \nrecommend this report to my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       COMMITTEE STAFF REPORT TO THE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER\n\n                          Committee on Finance\n\n                  United States Senate, November 2007\n\n    The Intimidation of Dr. John Buse and the Diabetes Drug Avandia\n\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The United States Senate Committee on Finance (Committee) \n     has jurisdiction over the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \n     Accordingly, it has a responsibility to the more than 80 \n     million Americans who receive health care coverage under \n     those programs to oversee the proper administration of these \n     programs, including the payment for medicines regulated by \n     the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Given the rise in \n     health care costs and the need to maintain public health and \n     safety, Medicare and Medicaid dollars should be spent on \n     drugs and devices that have been deemed safe and effective \n     for use by the FDA, in accordance with all laws and \n     regulations.\n       This report summarizes the Committee Staff's findings to \n     date regarding GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) intimidation of an \n     independent scientist who criticized Avandia, a drug GSK \n     manufactures to control glucose levels in diabetics. This \n     report is based upon an intensive review of documents \n     provided by GSK and others.\n       In a letter dated May 21, 2007, the Committee asked GSK \n     about allegations that its company executives intimidated a \n     research scientist in 1999. At the time of the alleged \n     intimidation, GlaxoSmithKline was called SmithKline Beecham. \n     In 2000, SmithKline Beecham merged with Glaxo Wellcome to \n     create GlaxoSmithKline. Accordingly, throughout this report, \n     the newly formed company will be referred to as \n     GlaxoSmithKline/GSK.\n       In response to the Committee's letter dated May 21, 2007, \n     that first raised these concerns about retaliation, GSK \n     quickly issued a press release to repudiate the allegation. \n     Specifically, the Wall Street Journal wrote, ``[GSK] called \n     the suggestion `absolutely false.' '' However, internal \n     company documents seem to contradict that claim and reveal \n     what appears to be an orchestrated plan to stifle the opinion \n     of Dr. John Buse, a professor of medicine at the University \n     of North Carolina who specializes in diabetes.\n       In particular, GSK's attempt at intimidation appears to \n     have been triggered by speeches that Dr. Buse gave at \n     scientific meetings in 1999. During those meetings, Dr. Buse \n     suggested that, aside from its benefit of controlling glucose \n     levels in diabetics, Avandia may carry cardiovascular risks.\n       The effect of silencing this criticism is, in our opinion, \n     extremely serious. At a July 30, 2007, safety panel on \n     Avandia, FDA scientists presented an analysis estimating that \n     Avandia caused approximately 83,000 excess heart attacks \n     since coming on the market. Had GSK considered Avandia's \n     increased cardiovascular risk more seriously when the issue \n     was first raised in 1999 by Dr. Buse, instead of trying to \n     smother an independent medical opinion, some of these heart \n     attacks may have been avoided.\n       According to documents provided to the Committee by, among \n     others, GSK, and the University of North Carolina, it is \n     apparent that the original allegations, regarding Dr. Buse \n     and GSK's attempts at silencing him\n\n[[Page S14447]]\n\n     are true; according to relevant emails, GSK executives \n     labeled Dr. Buse a ``renegade'' and silenced his concerns \n     about Avandia by complaining to his superiors and threatening \n     a lawsuit.\n       Even more troubling, documents reveal that plans to silence \n     Dr. Buse involved discussions by executives at the highest \n     levels of GSK, including then and current CEO Jean-Pierre \n     Garnier. Also, GSK prepared and required Dr. Buse to sign a \n     letter claiming that he was no longer worried about \n     cardiovascular risks associated with Avandia.\n       After Dr. Buse signed the letter, GSK officials began \n     referring to it as Dr. Buse's ``retraction letter.'' \n     Documents show that GSK intended to use this ``retraction \n     letter'' to gain favor with a financial consulting company \n     that was, among other things, evaluating GSK's products for \n     investors. After cutting short Dr. Buse's criticism, GSK \n     executives then sought to bring Dr. Buse back into GSK's \n     favor.\n       While publicly silent subsequent to signing the \n     ``retraction letter,'' Dr. Buse still remained troubled about \n     Avandia and its possible risks. Years later, he wrote a \n     private email to a colleague detailing the incident with GSK:\n\n       ``[T]he company's leadership contact[ed] my chairman and a \n     short and ugly set of interchanges occurred over a period of \n     about a week ending in my having to sign some legal document \n     in which I agreed not to discuss this issue further in \n     public.''\n\n       Dr. Buse ended the email, ``I was certainly intimidated by \n     them. . . . It makes me embarrassed to have caved in several \n     years ago.''\n       GSK's behavior since the Committee first brought these \n     allegations to light has been less than stellar. Instead of \n     acknowledging the misdeed to investors, apologizing to \n     patients, and pledging to change corporate behavior, GSK \n     launched a public relations campaign of denial. Specifically, \n     GSK sent out a press release titled ``GSK Response to US \n     Senate Committee on Finance'' which stated that the \n     allegations raised by the Committee were ``absolutely \n     false.'' Further, CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier denied having any \n     knowledge of the alleged intimidation of Dr. Buse in an \n     interview that ran in July in The Philadelphia Enquirer.\n\n\n                    B. Detailed Review of Documents\n\n       The Committee initiated an investigation into the risks and \n     benefits associated with the diabetes drug Avandia in the \n     spring of 2007. That investigation was prompted when the New \n     England Journal of Medicine published an article by Dr. \n     Steven Nissen and Ms. Kathy Wolski, noting that Avandia was \n     associated with serious cardiovascular risk, including heart \n     attacks.\n       Dr. John Buse is an expert in diabetes with extensive \n     research experience in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of \n     drugs. This class includes Rezulin (troglitazone), Actos \n     (pioglitazone), and Avandia (rosiglitazone). In 1999, Dr. \n     Buse sent a letter to the FDA stating that Rezulin should not \n     be withdrawn over worries about liver toxicity. He noted that \n     the liver toxicity and other safety issues surrounding the \n     alternatives--rosiglitazone and pioglitazone--were not yet \n     known. He noted that the three compounds ``are dramatically \n     different in their interaction with their proposed \n     receptor.''\n       Dr. Buse added that he was a consultant for Takeda-Lilly, \n     the manufacturer of Actos and had been a consultant for \n     SmithKline Beecham, which manufactured Avandia. Documents \n     from this period show that Dr. Buse was an investigator for a \n     SmithKline Beecham study on rosiglitazone as a treatment for \n     diabetes.\n       Also in early 1999, Dr. Buse gave speeches at meetings of \n     the Endocrine Society and the American Diabetes Association \n     (ADA). At both meetings, he suggested that Avandia may carry \n     increased cardiovascular risks.\n       In June 1999, GSK executives discussed Dr. Buse in a series \n     of emails they titled, ``Avandia Renegade.'' One email reads:\n\n       ``[M]ention was made of John Buse from UNC who apparently \n     has repeatedly and intentionally misrepresented Avandia data \n     from the speaker's dais in various fora, most recent among \n     which was the ADA. The sentiment of the SB group was to write \n     him a firm letter that would warn him about doing this again \n     . . . with the punishment being that we will complain up his \n     academic line and to the CME granting bodies that accredit \n     his activities. . . . The question comes up as to whether you \n     think this is a sensible strategy in the future (we don't \n     really do too much work at UNC to make any threats).\n\n       The email series also includes threats that might be made, \n     including a lawsuit and contacting Dr. Buse's colleagues at \n     UNC. SB in this email refers to SmithKline Beecham which is \n     now GSK.\n       In response to this series of emails, Dr. Tachi Yamada, \n     GSK's head of research at the time, wrote in an email that he \n     had discussed Dr. Buse with GSK's CEO Dr. Jean-Pierre Gamier \n     as well as David Stout, a senior GSK executive. Dr. Gamier \n     and Mr. Stout are copied on the email. Specifically, Dr. \n     Yamada's email reads:\n\n       ``In any case, I plan to speak to Fred Sparling, his former \n     chairman as soon as possible. I think there are two courses \n     of action. One is to sue him for knowingly defaming our \n     product even after we have set him straight as to the facts--\n     the other is to launch a well planned offensive on behalf of \n     Avandia. . . .''\n\n       Indeed, Dr. Yamada called Fred Sparling, Dr. Buse's \n     department chairman. Three days later, Dr. Buse wrote a \n     letter to Dr. Yamada attempting to clarify his position on \n     Avandia. Dr. Buse's letter began, ``I wanted to set the \n     record straight regarding all the phone calls and questions I \n     have received. . . .'' The phone calls that Dr. Buse referred \n     to were made by GSK officials including Dr. Yamada regarding \n     the speeches that Dr. Buse gave at conferences suggesting \n     cardiovascular problems associated with Avandia.\n       Dr. Buse continued, ``I believe as a clinical scientist \n     that the null hypothesis should be that rosiglitazone has the \n     potential to increase cardiovascular events.'' Dr. Buse went \n     on to say that his chairman had informed him that GSK \n     executives perceived him as ``being for sale'' because he \n     received speaking fees from Takeda. Dr. Buse added that he \n     heard ``implied threats of lawsuits from my chairman and \n     James Huang. . . .'' who was then a product manager with GSK.\n       Dr. Buse ended the letter to Dr. Yamada by writing, \n     ``Please call off the dogs. I cannot remain civilized much \n     longer under this kind of heat.''\n       Along with his letter to Dr. Yamada, Dr. Buse enclosed a \n     separate letter. GSK officials later referred to that second \n     letter as the ``Buse retraction letter.'' In the ``retraction \n     letter,'' Dr. Buse attempted to clarify the remarks he made \n     at the medical conferences regarding Avandia.\n       On July 1, 1999, Dr. Yamada wrote to Dr. Buse, thanking him \n     for the detailed explanation. Dr. Yamada's email reads, ``As \n     you may be aware, my phone call to Fred Sparling was aimed at \n     being educated. . . .'' The letter is copied to CEO Jean-\n     Pierre Garnier.\n       That same day, several GSK employees discussed Dr. Buse in \n     an email chain that questioned whether or not Dr. Buse signed \n     the ``retraction letter'' that was prepared by GSK. The email \n     reads:\n\n       ``[H]ave you heard back from Dr. Buse? Did he sign your \n     proposed letter? Assuming he does retract, what are we \n     planning to do to let the world know that Dr. Buse retracted \n     his statements?''\n\n       A second GSK employee responded, ``John Buse kindly signed \n     the clarification letter on his letterhead without any \n     change.''\n       Later that day, the first GSK employee wrote, ``I'm not \n     certain what damage has now been caused by the Yamada phone \n     call to [Buse's] seniors. . . . Maybe we can obtain \n     clarification of how such situations with U.S. opinion \n     leaders in [the] future should be handled. Yeesh!''\n       On July 2, 1999, several GSK officials discussed whether to \n     share with financial analysts, what they term the ``Buse \n     retraction letter.'' These financial analysts were evaluating \n     GSK's products for investors.\n       In an email, a GSK employee wrote discussed talks he had \n     with the financial analysts. Several GSK executives were \n     copied on this email, including CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier, Dr. \n     Tachi Yamada, and Mr. David Stout. The email reads:\n\n       ``I also discussed how Dr. Buse has also confirmed that \n     caution should be used in comparing the efficacy data and \n     [adverse events] data he presented. That these should not be \n     taken out of context and that the study designs, baselines, \n     etc., etc., . . . were different. . . . As a result of our \n     conversation, [FINANCIAL COMPANY NAME REDACTED] will remove \n     the `?' under the cardiovascular events and they are removing \n     the John Buse table on efficacy presented at the ADA \n     meeting.''\n\n       But even after Dr. Buse signed the retraction letter, GSK \n     executives were torn over whether or not they could trust the \n     former ``Avandia Renegade.'' On one hand the documents reveal \n     that some GSK executives were eager to work with Dr. Buse. \n     For instance, in late November 1999, a GSK official sent an \n     email to several executives which read, ``We need to see John \n     Buse ASAP now that we know that he is involved with the NIH \n     [study].''\n       On the other hand, others at GSK never fully believed that \n     Dr. Buse had completely dropped his concerns with regard to \n     Avandia and its possible cardiovascular risks. In fact, even \n     though Dr. Buse remained silent in public, he continued \n     privately to voice his opinions about cardiovascular problems \n     with Avandia. For example, after signing the retraction \n     letter, Dr. Buse wrote to the FDA Commissioner in March 2000 \n     where he noted:\n\n       ``In short, the lipid changes with troglitazone and \n     pioglitazone can only be viewed as positive. They are very \n     similar in nature. . . . As mentioned above, I remain \n     concerned about the lipid changes with rosiglitazone. . . . \n     Rosiglitazone is clearly a very different actor. I do not \n     believe that rosiglitazone will be proven safer than \n     troglitazone in clinical use under current labeling of the \n     two products. In fact, rosiglitazone may be associated with \n     less beneficial cardiac effects or even adverse cardiac \n     outcomes.''\n\n       The following month, GSK officials acquired a copy of Dr. \n     Buse's letter to the FDA. GSK executives faxed Dr. Buse's FDA \n     letter among themselves with a cover note reading, ``We need \n     to address this as a company. . . . Looks like Dr. Buse \n     doesn't buy into our lipid or cardiovascular story.''\n       Following Dr. Buse's FDA letter, GSK drafted another letter \n     to Dr. Buse from one of its executives, Martin Freed. The \n     letter reads, ``I remain concerned about your ongoing \n     aggressive posture towards rosiglitazone and SmithKline \n     Beecham. In my opinion, you have presented to [FDA] several \n     unfair,\n\n[[Page S14448]]\n\n     unbalanced, and unsubstantiated allegations.''\n       Later in 2000, Dr. Buse reached out to GSK officials, \n     asking them to sponsor a continuing medical education (CME) \n     program about TZD use. Dr. Buse wrote in his request:\n\n       ``I spoke to Rich Daly, the head of marketing (and sales?) \n     for Takeda. He was going to run the idea of joint support for \n     the CME program by the Takeda lawyers to make sure there are \n     no FTC issues in what I proposed. I highlighted to him that \n     the benefit to Takeda and [SmithKline Beecham] would be the \n     potential to grow interest in the class as a whole and as a \n     very public display of the end of the ``glitazone wars. ''\n\n       By late 2000, GSK officials appeared to believe that they \n     had the former ``Avandia Renegade'' under control. Emails \n     from this time refer to GSK as ``SB,'' as GSK had not yet \n     been created from the merger. In November, a GSK/SB executive \n     wrote:\n\n       ``Just a quick note about your comment on Buse. . . . I am \n     getting messages that he is really coming around to the SB \n     side of things. He has stopped his out-right bashing and is \n     now more TZD positive with kind comments on Avandia. . . . \n     David Pernock spoke to him and said something to the effect \n     that [Glaxo Wellcome] is his friend now but GSK will be the \n     future and he needs to realize that. . . .\n       ``I spoke to him separately on a couple of occasions . . . \n     and let him know that our relationship got off on the wrong \n     foot but that is in the past and we want to move on from \n     here. . . . FYI and thanks for your help in bringing J. Buse \n     back to the middle and hopefully beyond.''\n\n       However, based upon the documents in the Committee's \n     possession, GSK executives continued to try and shape Dr. \n     Buse's views regarding Avandia. For example, in early 2001, \n     Dr. Buse contacted GSK officials, requesting citations for a \n     textbook he was writing. One official suggested that GSK \n     should both provide and interpret the information for Dr. \n     Buse, stating in an email:\n\n       ``Our chances on having Buse reflect our views and messages \n     will be enhanced greatly if we tell him what they are rather \n     than relying on him to development [sic] on his own accord \n     via examining data. . . . [F]inally our view of the big \n     picture lipid story including LDL characteristics and fat \n     redistribution cannot be easily gleaned from our collection \n     of pieces. There is no evidence that Dr. Buse will come to \n     these views without some guidance and support. Of course care \n     will need to be taken to work any overview pieces in a way \n     that appears academic rather than too commercial to enhance \n     the probability that Dr. Buse will adopt our views as his \n     own.''\n\n       Concern with Dr. Buse reemerged in 2002, as his \n     professional stature grew. That September, GSK officials \n     discussed bringing him further into the fold. A GSK official \n     described him as the ``most powerful Endocrinologist in the \n     Carolinas. . . . [H]e is gaining power nationally and \n     internationally.'' The email continued:\n\n       ``[We feel] as if Dr. Buse [is] primed to move to a more \n     middle-of-the-road stance concerning TZDs. The timing for \n     this `shift' has to be right. In my opinion, that right time \n     will be with the launch of Avandamet. He is very excited \n     about the launch of this new combo product and very critical \n     of [COMPANY NAME REDACTED] for not moving faster on their \n     combo. . . . His experience with and advocacy for Avandamet \n     could prove invaluable for it's [sic] in the Blue Ridge \n     region and beyond.''\n\n       A different GSK official responded, ``As long as we are on \n     the same page, we could consider him. . . .'' The following \n     week, another official wrote, ``It looks like marketing would \n     like us to move forward using Dr. Buse as an investigator in \n     the Avandamet program. Are you OK with this?'' Avandamet \n     refers to a combination drug for glucose control that \n     combines Avandia with metformin.\n       Based on the documents in the Committee's possession, it \n     appears that Dr. Buse remained silent about his concerns \n     regarding Avandia for approximately two years. However, in \n     2005, he once again privately voiced his opinion that Avandia \n     carried cardiovascular risks. In an email he sent to Dr. \n     Steven Nissen, chairman of the Cardiology Department at the \n     Cleveland Clinic, he again revealed his ongoing concerns \n     about Avandia and described his treatment by GSK. \n     Specifically, Dr. Buse wrote:\n\n       ``Steve: Wow! Great job on the muriglitazar article. I did \n     a similar analysis of the data at rosiglitazone's initial FDA \n     approval based on the slides that were presented at the FDA \n     hearings and found a similar association of increased severe \n     CVD events. I presented it at the Endocrine Society and ADA \n     meetings that summer. Immediately the company's leadership \n     contact[ed] my chairman and a short and ugly set of \n     interchanges occurred over a period of about a week ending in \n     my having to sign some legal document in which I agreed not \n     to discuss this issue further in public.''\n\n       Later in the email, Dr. Buse confirmed GSK's treatment of \n     him when he wrote, ``I was certainly intimidated by them but \n     frankly did not have the granularity of data that you had and \n     decided that it was not worth it.''\n       Dr. Buse concluded in his email, ``Again congratulations on \n     that very important piece of work. It makes me embarrassed to \n     have caved in several years ago.''\n\n\n                             C. Conclusions\n\n       The documents in the Committee's possession raise serious \n     concerns about the culture of leadership at GSK. Even more \n     serious perhaps is our fear that the situation with Dr. Buse \n     is part of a more troubling pattern of behavior by \n     pharmaceutical executives.\n       Specifically, in 2004, Dr. Gurkirpal Singh of Stanford \n     University testified at a Committee hearing that an executive \n     at Merck sought to intimidate him by calling his superiors. \n     Merck also warned Dr. Singh that they would make life very \n     difficult for him, if he persisted in his request for data on \n     Merck's drug, Vioxx. It was later discovered that Vioxx \n     increased the risk of heart attacks and it was withdrawn from \n     the market.\n       Merck's intimidation of Dr. Singh as it sought to protect \n     Vioxx bears striking similarities to apparent threats by GSK \n     against Dr. Buse to protect Avandia. The Committee is very \n     concerned that this behavior may be more prevalent in the \n     pharmaceutical industry than is evidenced by these two cases.\n       Corporate intimidation, the silencing of scientific \n     dissent, and the suppression of scientific views threaten \n     both the public well-being and the financial health of the \n     federal government, which pays for health care. The behavior \n     of GSK during the time that Dr. Buse voiced concerns \n     regarding the cardiovascular risks he believed were \n     associated with Avandia was less than stellar. Had Dr. Buse \n     been able to continue voicing his concerns, without being \n     characterized as a ``renegade'' and without the need to sign \n     a ``retraction letter,'' it appears that the public good \n     would have been better served.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The report presents evidence that a pharmaceutical \ncompany allegedly tried to intimidate a doctor who raised concerns \nabout Avandia's link to heart problems.\n  A few years ago, the Senate Finance Committee uncovered a similar \nsituation connected to the drug Vioxx.\n  These actions are unacceptable.\n  It is critical that our prescription drugs be developed based on \nrigorous experimentation, the facts, and the science, not on \nintimidation and threats of lawsuits.\n  We place a great deal of trust in pharmaceutical companies to make \nsafe and effective products. The health of millions of Americans, from \nyoung children to retirees, depends on the careful work of these drug \nmanufacturers.\n  Today, as I said, Senator Grassley and I are placing in the \nCongressional Record a Senate Finance Committee staff report which \ndescribes a very disturbing series of events related to the safety of \nthe diabetes drug, Avandia.\n  The report presents evidence that a pharmaceutical company allegedly \ntried to intimidate a doctor who raised concerns about Avandia's link \nto heart problems. This occurred after the doctor gave speeches at 2 \nscientific meetings where he warned of the cardiovascular risks to \nthose using Avandia, a drug designed to control glucose levels in \ndiabetics.\n  To make matters worse, the company in question denied trying to \nintimidate the doctor in the press. That claim is seriously challenged \nby e-mails presented in the staff report.\n  It appears that the company labeled the doctor as a ``renegade'' and \nall but silenced him by complaining to his department chairman and \nthreatening a lawsuit.\n  In an e-mail contained in the report the doctor in question describes \nsigning a legal document in which he agreed not to discuss the issue in \npublic. He goes on to say that he felt intimidated by the actions of \nthe pharmaceutical company.\n  Is this the tip of the iceberg or just an isolated case? Nobody \nreally knows. But just 3 years ago the Senate Finance Committee \nuncovered a similar situation connected to the drug Vioxx. A clinical \nprofessor at Stanford University said Merck scientists had tried to \nintimidate him after he raised questions in public about the effects of \nVioxx.\n  It was later discovered that Vioxx increased the risk of heart \nattacks and the drug was withdrawn from the market. Just last week \nMerck agreed to pay $4.8 billion to settle Vioxx lawsuits.\n  As in the Vioxx case, the concerns raised by the doctor in the \nAvandia case were followed by complaints by other researchers. And \nyesterday the FDA added an additional ``black box'' warning to the \nAvandia label.\n  With the Finance Committee's continued spotlight on this behavior, I \nhope we can deter similar abuses in the pharmaceutical community.\n  Again, it is critical that our prescription drugs be developed based \non rigorous experimentation, facts and\n\n[[Page S14449]]\n\nscience, not on intimidation and threats of lawsuits.\n  I, again, recommend the report to my Senate colleagues, and I very \nmuch thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his efforts \nhere and, again, for his efforts on the work of this investigation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to follow Senator Baucus on \nexactly the same subject. I thank him for the period of time now, this \nyear, he has been chairman of the committee, succeeding my \nchairmanship, because he has been very cooperative in my efforts to \nfinish investigations that carried over with the change of Congress \nfrom Republican to Democratic, and also for helping us initiate new, \nneeded investigations.\n  But I also wish to take some time to comment exactly on what he had \nmade reference to in the very report he has now submitted for the \nRecord. Since he has submitted a copy, I will not ask permission to do \nthat.\n  It was about 3 years ago--in fact, the exact date was November 18, \n2004--I convened a hearing on the worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx, a \nblockbuster pain medication.\n  That hearing turned a spotlight on systemic problems at the Food and \nDrug Administration. We found that the Food and Drug Administration \nmaintained a very cozy relationship with the drug industry and \nsuppressed scientific dissent regarding agency actions on drug safety.\n  At that Vioxx hearing, we also heard about Merck using its power, its \ninfluence, and access to try and discredit an FDA safety expert, Dr. \nDavid Graham--a person who is still on the staff at the FDA trying to \ndo the job of being a policeman for safety for the consumers of \nAmerican pharmaceutical products.\n  Merck also tried to intimidate a Stanford researcher, Dr. Gurkirpal \nSingh. The company warned him to stop asking for more safety data on \nVioxx, despite the fact he was one of their paid consultants.\n  What is troubling is that 3 years later, I am here with my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, to talk about yet another case where pharmaceutical \nexecutives use power, use their influence, and use access to intimidate \na medical researcher.\n  In essence, another company wanted to put an end to another scientist \nwho was voicing concerns about the cardiovascular risks associated with \na drug.\n  Now, in this case--similar to Vioxx--we are talking about a diabetes \ndrug, Avandia.\n  Today, Senator Baucus and I are releasing a staff report showing how \nexecutives at GlaxoSmithKline intimidated Dr. John Buse, a medical \nresearcher at the University of North Carolina.\n  Together, our respective staffs reviewed documents provided by the \ncompany and by others, and they found bothersome internal e-mails that \nreveal how these pharmaceutical executives think. In these e-mails, \nhigh-level company officials discussed the possibility of threats--I am \ntalking about threats by pharmaceutical executives--against Dr. Buse of \nNorth Carolina University. These threats included the possibility of \nfiling a lawsuit.\n  Company executives called Dr. Buse an ``Avandia Renegade'' and had \nhim sign a retraction letter they wanted to give to financial analysts. \nThese analysts were evaluating the company's products for investors.\n  So what we have are three cases--starting with Dr. Graham, then Dr. \nSingh, and now Dr. Buse--where companies intimidated researchers who \ndared to express concerns about the safety of what they thought were \nrisky drugs. In the case of both Vioxx and Avandia, the drugs actually \nturned out to carry some very serious risks.\n  What I am here to say today is that attacks on medical researchers by \nthe pharmaceutical industry must stop. And it has to stop right this \nminute.\n  Until this practice ends, I wish to let America's scientists know I \nam very interested in their concerns. Scientists should feel free to \ncontact my office if a pharmaceutical company threatens their career or \nattacks their reputation when they raise the alarm about possible \ndangerous drugs.\n  They can also anonymously provide information and documents by mail \nor by fax to the committee. Here is the fax number: 202-228-2131.\n  That is the warning that I put out, and the invitation that I put \nout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, it does not look like anybody else wants to speak, so \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Educational Benefits For Veterans\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, my first day in the Senate I introduced \nlegislation that would provide educational benefits for those who have \nserved in our military since 9/11 that would be the equivalent of the \neducational benefits that those who served in World War II received.\n  We are very fond in this body and elsewhere in the U.S. Government of \ntalking about those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan as being \nthe new ``greatest generation.'' Well, it seems to me very logical that \nif we are going to use that rhetoric, we should be able to provide \nthose who have served in this difficult time with the same educational \nbenefits as those who served during World War II.\n  I was very privileged, for 4 years, to serve as a committee counsel \non the House Veterans' Committee at a different point in my life, and \nwas able to study the benefits that had been provided to our veterans \nfrom the American Revolution forward.\n  I also noticed an interesting phenomenon; and that was, a good part \nof the veterans' benefits package that was provided to those who served \nin World War II was done so because of the wisdom of those who had \nserved in World War I--partially because they did not receive these \nsorts of benefits. The World War I veterans were very adamant that the \nveterans coming back from World War II be treated differently than they \nwere. One of the end results of that was the GI bill.\n  Very recently, former Senator Bob Dole testified in front of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. I asked him about \nhis own experiences, having been wounded in World War II, and how the \nWorld War II GI bill assisted him in his transition to the civilian \nworld. This is what he said in part:\n\n       I think [the World War II GI bill was] the single most \n     important piece of legislation when it comes to education, \n     how it changed America more than anything I can think of. \n     [We] ought to take the same care of the veterans today.\n\n  I could not agree more strongly. The people who served in World War \nII--there were 16 million of them--were offered an entirely different \nconcept in terms of fairness in American society when they returned. \nEight million of them were able to take advantage of a GI bill that \nprovided for their tuition when they went to college, bought their \nbooks, and gave them a monthly stipend.\n  This education benefit has gone up and down since the enactment of \nWorld War II GI bill. When I came back from Vietnam, the benefit was a \nmonthly stipend that was not very helpful to most Vietnam veterans. \nThat has been on my mind for years, as I think about the service of our \nveterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Just as the World War I veterans stepped forward and took care of the \nWorld war II veterans, I believe it is the responsibility--not wholly, \nbut strongly--of those of us who served in Vietnam and who experienced \na lot of the disadvantages of service, once we got out, to make sure we \ntake care of those who are serving now and who have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It is for that reason I introduced this bill.\n\n  To look back on the educational benefits that were derived from this \nexperience, I asked my staff to take a look at those Members of this \nbody--our colleagues--who served in World War II, just to see where \nthey were able to go to school and to see how the World War II GI bill \nbenefitted them, and then to compare that with what they would have \nbeen able to do today if\n\n[[Page S14450]]\n\nthey were the same individual having served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan \nand were coming back with today's Montgomery GI bill, which basically \nis a peacetime GI bill that was put in place well before 9/11 and was \ndesigned more as a little bit of a bump to assist in recruitment than a \ntrue readjustment benefit for people who had been in war.\n  Our chairman, Senator Akaka, was able to go to the University of \nHawaii under that program, the World War II GI bill. Today, if one were \napplying for the Montgomery GI bill, 41.5 percent of his education \nwould have been paid for.\n  Senator Inouye, who is a cosponsor of our bill, was able to attend \nGeorge Washington Law School. Today, that would cost $48,460 a year. \nThe Montgomery GI bill would pay for 12.4 percent of that.\n  Senator Lautenberg, who also is a cosponsor of this bill, was able to \ngo to Columbia on a full boat, graduating in 1949. Today, to go to \nColumbia, it would cost $46,874 a year. The Montgomery GI bill would \npay for 12.8 percent of that.\n  Senator Stevens was able to go to UCLA and Harvard Law School. His \nstaff declined to be specific about how much of that was assisted by \nthe GI bill, but if one were to go to Harvard Law School today, it \nwould cost $54,066, which is about 11 percent of what the Montgomery GI \nbill would take care of.\n  Senator John Warner, my senior Senator from Virginia, my esteemed \ncolleague and friend, has told me many times he would not be in the \nSenate today if it had not been for the educational benefits of the GI \nbill. He was able to go to Washington and Lee for an undergraduate \ndegree. Today that would cost $42,327 for 1 year, of which the \nMontgomery GI bill would pick up 14 percent. He was then able to go to \nUVA Law School, full boat, as a reward for his service. Today that \nwould cost $44,800.\n  Just to be fair, I am standing here today because Uncle Sam made a \nbet on me. I was able to go to the Naval Academy. The taxpayers of \nAmerica paid for that. The taxpayers of America would pay for that \ntoday, the same amount. I was also in a different situation than most \nof my Vietnam war veteran colleagues because after I was wounded and \nhad medical difficulties with a bone infection in my leg, I was \nmedically retired from the Marine Corps and was able to go to law \nschool on a program called Vocational Rehabilitation, which was the \nexact same program as the people who served in World War II received. I \nwas able to go to Georgetown Law School. Today that would cost $51,530 \na year. The Montgomery GI bill would pick up 11.6 percent of it.\n  So on the one hand, we are saying this is the next great generation. \nThis is the next greatest generation. We never cease to talk about how \nmuch we value their service, these people leaving home on extended \ndeployments again and again, giving us everything we ask, and then we \nare giving them a GI bill that was designed for peacetime.\n  It is not because we don't spend money on education. We just passed \nlegislation for Federal education grants. I voted for it. I assume the \nPresiding Officer voted for it. If you add up these grants--and these \nare grants--this is not rewarding someone for affirmative service. If \nyou add up these grants, it is going to cost $18.2 billion this year. \nWe are having a difficult time getting an exact number on what my GI \nbill proposal would add up to, but the best estimates we have had \ninformally are about $2 billion.\n  I would submit that with the cost of this war now heading well north \nof $1 trillion, and with the President coming over and saying he wants \n$200 billion on top of that and on top of an appropriations bill, we \ncould spend this money in a way that will allow the people who have \nserved since 9/11 a first-class future. We are saying they are that \ngood; let's let them be that good.\n  For that reason, I hope all of my colleagues will step forward and \njoin me so we can get this legislation passed this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     FHA Modernization Act of 2007\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, each day that goes by, the depth and \nseverity of our country's subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis emerges. \nIt is very difficult. This week I spoke to former Secretary of the \nTreasury Rubin. I spoke also to the present Secretary of the Treasury, \nMr. Paulson, and they both recognize we have some severe problems with \nour subprime mortgages. This is very deep. It is very hard.\n  Hundreds of thousands of mortgages are now delinquent nationwide--\nhundreds of thousands. That is fully twice as many as last year, and \nlast year was not a good year. The most alarming fact is this could be \njust the beginning. Experts agree as more mortgage rates continue to \nexpire, not thousands, not tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands \nof American families could be at risk.\n  When these introductory ``teaser'' rates expire, these teaser rates \nwhere they tease people into taking these loans, sometimes that they \ncouldn't afford--a lot of times that they couldn't afford--when these \nhigher rates arrive, the mortgages that many families can afford today \nwill become impossible to pay off tomorrow. This will leave many with \njust two options: lose their homes or try to work something out on \nrefinancing.\n  That is what this is all about. Some say if a borrower gets into \nfinancial trouble, it is their obligation and it is their \nresponsibility to find a way out. That is not true. If you have a piece \nof property, and it is a home and it is being foreclosed upon, you as \nthe owner of that property are going to lose money. There is no \nquestion about it. You usually lose about 35 to 40 percent of the value \nof the home. So the borrower gets hurt. Also, the entity where the home \nis, a county or a city, if you have that property under foreclosure, \nthe windows are boarded up, and it just loses value. So the tax base of \nthat community suffers.\n  So we need to do something about that. We are talking about families \nlosing the roof over their heads. Therefore, we need to do something \nabout it.\n  The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, recognized \nthat a sharp increase in foreclosed properties for sale could weaken \nthe already struggling housing market and thus, potentially, the \nbroader economy. He was being very deliberate. The word ``should'' \nshould have been used, not ``could.'' But he was being, as he should be \nas chairman of the Federal Reserve, very cautious.\n  In Nevada, this crisis is hitting very hard. In 2006, in August, the \nnumber of foreclosure filings had gone up by more than 200 percent. We \ncould see another 21,000 foreclosures, we are told, by the beginning of \n2009 in Nevada. That is a lot of foreclosures.\n  One of the things we need to do is have more money for counseling, \nwhich the administration has cut back.\n  There are three items we need to work on in the near term: providing \nfunding for foreclosure prevention counseling, modernizing the FHA \nadministration, and providing temporary but necessary tools to the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, Fanny and Freddie--that is Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac--so they can keep funding available to make or \nrefinance subprime mortgages. So we need to do this.\n  The Senate Banking Committee passed a bipartisan FHA Modernization \nAct of 2007 on September 9, 2007, by a vote of 20 to 1. This has broad \nsupport of consumers and the industry alike.\n  As the name of the bill indicates, this legislation is intended to \nbring needed changes to the Federal Housing Administration that will \nmake the agency more capable of providing the services that homeowners \nneed in today's all-too-perilous environment.\n  The FHA program encourages the private sector to make mortgages by \noffering government-backed insurance for the full balance of the loan.\n  Traditionally, since its inception in 1934, the FHA has played a \nmajor role in providing home purchase financing to minority, first-\ntime, and lower income home buyers.\n  Beginning in the mid-1990s, and until now, however, as more exotic \nloans entered the marketplace, FHA saw its\n\n[[Page S14451]]\n\noverall market share drop dramatically.\n  In some cases borrowers considered the more exotic loans easier to \nget. In many other cases, borrowers were directed into those loans by \nbrokers who often didn't have the borrower's best interests at heart.\n  Unfortunately, these exotic loans often lured borrowers with false or \nmisleading information and contained ``teaser'' interest rates that, \nonce expired, borrowers couldn't afford.\n  These were predatory loans--and the consequences of these shady \npractices are becoming more evident every day.\n  This crucial reform bill modernizes the FHA program by, among other \nthings, lowering mortgage- down-payment requirements and raising the \nloan limits for FHA-backed loans.\n  The result will be a better loan option for families that are having \ntrouble keeping up with their exploding mortgage payments. They will \nhave the option of refinancing to an FHA-backed loan with the peace of \nmind that comes with it.\n  And for future homebuyers, a fully backed FHA loan with honest, up-\nfront terms, will help prevent crises like we now face, and ensure that \nmore American families will experience all the safety, comfort and \nstability that comes with homeownership.\n  Third, the PROMISE Act would temporarily lift the cap on the amount \nof loans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase as investments for a \nperiod of 6 months.\n  The bill could bring as much as $145 billion dollars into the \nsubprime mortgage marketplace and prescribes that the vast majority--at \nleast 85 percent of these resources--be used to refinance subprime \nloans.\n  The past decade has seen remarkable growth in American homeownership. \nWhat's more, these gains have been enjoyed from coast to coast and \namong groups that have traditionally been shut out.\n  We need to ensure that this progress continues.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request here that I have \nbeen told the Republicans will object to. I will make the request and \nthen withdraw it. As I said, I have been told they will object.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2338\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 481, S. 2338, \nthe FHA Modernization Act of 2007; that the Dodd-Shelby amendment at \nthe desk be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table; \nand that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I now will withdraw that request.\n  What a shame that there is an objection to a bill that passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly, came out of committee over here on a vote of 20 \nto 1, and now there is an objection to it. That is really too bad. We \nwill renew this request before we leave here for Thanksgiving. This \nwill be much-needed relief. Even though the President hates the \nGovernment, this Government that was created many years ago has been a \nlifesaver for home building in our country, and we need to modernize \nit; it is long overdue. I hope the Republicans will withdraw their \nobjection to this bipartisan, much-needed legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The unanimous consent request is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I heard the majority leader's speech. I \nwanted to put him on notice that I will object to the bringing forward \nof this bill. It was introduced September 19 and reported out of the \nBanking Committee on November 13, 2 days ago. We received notice, via \nhotline, that they were attempting to clear the bill by unanimous \nconsent yesterday afternoon.\n  This bill addresses a very delicate and complicated area of housing \npolicy on which we cannot afford to make mistakes. I know many \nSenators, including myself, are strong advocates of how we can help \nthose who find themselves in trouble now. I know the authors of the \nbill would like to pass it expeditiously. However, it is a big bill. It \nis an important bill. Under the unanimous consent request, that would \nmean we would not debate it and offer amendments. For those two \nreasons, I object, as a Senator from Oklahoma, and I know several other \nSenators would as well.\n  The problem with hotlining bills is they don't get due deliberation. \nHere is a stack of bills that were offered by unanimous consent in the \nSenate before the August break. Most of the Senators had never read the \nbills, didn't know what was in the bills. Thankfully, many of them were \nobjected to by Members of the Senate. It is not a good way to \nlegislate.\n  This is an important issue. We seem to have a tendency that we are \nafraid to do the real work we need to do because we will be criticized \nas the one stopping the bill. I am not afraid to stop a bill. I believe \nwe need to get things right. It is not about not wanting to help those \nin need today, but there are several significant things in this bill.\n  First of all, the bill changes it so that if you have a $417,000 \nhome, you can get a mortgage; if you are in trouble, we are going to \ntake care of that. That is twice the median price of a home in this \ncountry. It lowers the downpayment to 1.5 percent. It exposes American \ntaxpayers to $1.6 billion over the next 5 years. We can solve this \nproblem. We cannot solve this problem by blowing a bill through here \nwithout good debate, rigorous discussion of the issues, and alternative \noptions, via amendments, which will address, No. 1, how we got where we \nare in terms of the subprime mortgage mess; No. 2, how we restore \nconfidence in that market; No. 3, how do we work to secure better \noversight on the mortgage industry that put people in the position of \nowning property they could not afford; and the predatory lending \npractices Senator Reid talked about. We can address those. Doing it \nunder a hotline, under unanimous consent, where we don't have an option \nto study the bill and think about what other options there can be or \nhow many hearings were held on the bill and what is the response, is \nnot the way to legislate.\n  I believe the President has not said he would not support this bill. \nI may be wrong, but I seem to recall that from the past.\n  I also would like to put in the Record an article from the Roll Call \nof September 17 entitled `` `Hotlined' Bills Spark Concern.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Sept. 17, 2007]\n\n                    ``Hotlined'' Bills Spark Concern\n\n                           (By John Stanton)\n\n       Senate conservatives are upset that the leaders of both \n     parties in the chamber have in recent years increasingly used \n     a practice known as ``hotlining'' bills--previously used to \n     quickly move noncontroversial bills or simple procedural \n     motions--to pass complex and often costly legislation, in \n     some cases with little or no public debate.\n       The increase was particularly noticeable just before the \n     August recess, when leaders hotlined more than 150 bills, \n     totaling millions of dollars in new spending, in a period of \n     less than a week.\n       The practice has led to complaints from Members and \n     watchdog groups alike that lawmakers are essentially signing \n     off on legislation neither they nor their staff have ever \n     read, often resulting in millions of dollars in new spending.\n       In order for a bill to be hotlined, the Senate Majority \n     Leader and Minority Leader must agree to pass it by unanimous \n     consent, without a roll-call vote. The two leaders then \n     inform Members of this agreement using special hotlines \n     installed in each office and give Members a specified amount \n     of time to object--in some cases as little as 15 minutes. If \n     no objection is registered, the bill is passed.\n       According to a review by Roll Call of Senate records, from \n     July 31 to Aug. 3, of the 153 hotlines put out by leadership, \n     75 of those\n\n[[Page S14452]]\n\n     were legislative measures, 61 were nominations, and 17 were \n     post-office-naming bills. While a number of the legislative \n     hotlines were routine procedural motions--such as reporting a \n     House-passed bill to a particular committee for \n     consideration--others were for bills authorizing hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in new spending.\n       According to GOP aides, that run of hotlined bills \n     concerned the chairman of the conservative Republican \n     Steering Committee, Sen. Jim DeMint (S.C.), enough that he \n     made the issue of hotlining the topic of discussion during \n     last week's regular RSC luncheon. Although these aides said \n     DeMint and other conservative lawmakers have yet to broach \n     the topic with their leaders, it likely will become an issue \n     if the trend continues. ``It's inevitable that it will come \n     up,'' one aide said.\n       According to the Library of Congress' legislative database \n     THOMAS, of the 399 bills or resolutions passed by the Senate \n     this year--which range from recess adjournment resolutions to \n     the Iraq War supplemental bill--only 29 have been approved by \n     a roll-call vote. The rest have been moved via unanimous \n     consent agreements, the vast majority of which were brokered \n     using the hotline process.\n       Critics also point out that hotlining is often done during \n     ``wrap-up'' at the end of the day--which can occur well after \n     Members' offices have closed for business--and is \n     particularly popular in the runup to recesses.\n       In a March 2006 floor speech, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \n     harshly criticized the practice. ``The calls are from the \n     Republican and the Democratic leaders to each of their \n     Members, asking consent to pass this or that bill--not \n     consider the bill or have debate on the bill but to pass \n     it,'' Sessions said.\n       ``If the staff do not call back . . . the bill passes. \n     Boom. It can be 500 pages. In many offices, when staffers do \n     not know anything about the bill, they usually ignore the \n     hotline and let the bill pass without even informing their \n     Senators. If the staff miss the hotline, or do not know about \n     it or were not around, the Senator is deemed to have \n     consented to the passage of some bill which might be quite an \n     important piece of information.''\n       During that brief pre-recess period this summer, the \n     chamber passed S. 496, a bill sponsored by Sen. George \n     Voinovich (R-Ohio) making changes to the Appalachian Regional \n     Development Act of 1965. According to the Congressional \n     Budget Office, those changes will cost $294 million over five \n     years.\n       In many cases, bills are placed before the Senate for only \n     a few days or even hours before they are hotlined. For \n     instance, the Senate received H.R. 727--a bill sponsored by \n     Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas) amending the Public Health Services \n     Act--from the House on March 28, according to THOMAS. Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Senate Minority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hotlined the bill the \n     following day. According to CBO, the bill is expected to cost \n     $40 million between 2008 and 2012.\n       Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said hotlining bills is not \n     necessarily a bad thing but that Members have increasingly \n     seen the process as a right. ``People think they can hotline \n     [a bill] and you have to agree,'' Coburn said, adding that \n     ``a lot of Members are offended'' if anyone raises an \n     objection or wants to offer changes to a bill.\n       Coburn also said that because of limited floor time, ``we \n     don't have time to debate everything . . . but if you object, \n     they ought to be willing to negotiate with you. But usually, \n     they put the press after you.\n       ``They accuse you of being against veterans, of being \n     against breast cancer patients . . . I've been accused of so \n     many things,'' Coburn lamented. But he insisted that when \n     sponsors of bills he has objected to take his concerns \n     seriously, they often are able to work out an agreement.\n       For instance, he points out that earlier this year, when \n     Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) brought a small-business bill to \n     leaders to be hotlined, Coburn initially objected because of \n     problems with the bill. He and Kerry entered into \n     negotiations to resolve their differences, and the Senate \n     ultimately passed the package by unanimous consent. ``We gave \n     a couple of things, he gave a couple of things and we passed \n     the bill,'' Coburn explained.\n       Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the government watchdog \n     group Sunlight Foundation, said the process of hotlining has \n     added to the lack of transparency and accountability in \n     Congress. ``Hotlining bills diminishes the accountability of \n     Congress. Senators are forced into an `all-or-nothing' \n     posture--place a secret hold on legislation and negotiate in \n     the back room, or keep their objections to themselves. The \n     Senate is supposed to be a deliberative body, and those \n     deliberations should occur in the light of day and be part of \n     the public record,'' Allison said.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. The increasing practice of this body of passing bills by \nunanimous consent rather than debate and knowledge about what we are \nagreeing to does the Senate a disservice. All you have to do is watch \nC-SPAN and see how much time is spent in quorum calls in this body. I, \nfor one, would never object to unanimous consent for us running several \nbills at the same time so we can continue to discuss them. We should \nnot be passing bills without good thought, good debate, and an \namendment strategy that will improve the bill and protect the future \ntaxpayers of this country. That has to be a requirement as we address \nit.\n  I thank Senator Reid for his attention to what is truly a real \nproblem. But the process is really what matters on this issue. We need \nto get it right. There is too much risk. Therefore, if we decide to \nbring this request back up, I will come back down and object.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bridge \nfund bill that passed the House of Representatives last night. I don't \nknow why it has to be so hard to pass an emergency supplemental to \nassure that our troops in the field get the money they need to support \nthem in the job we are asking them to do.\n  The President has asked for almost $200 billion to get us through \nsome point in January or possibly into the spring. But the bill that \nhas come over is roughly in the $50 billion range and it has all kinds \nof constraints and strings and mandates from the Congress.\n  Our military strategies should not be determined by events 6,000 \nmiles from the theater where our young men and women have boots on the \nground. This bridge fund bill is the latest attempt in a year-long \neffort to constrain the ability of our generals and our brave men and \nwomen in uniform to fight this war effectively.\n  During the past year, the Senate has been forced to vote 40 times on \nbills limiting the generals' war strategy. None of those bills passed \nbut one, and it was vetoed.\n  Since this assembly line of bills started last February, the \nsituation in Iraq has changed so much. General Petraeus has implemented \na strategic readjustment that has produced encouraging progress. Last \nweek, U.S. commanders and the Iraqi Government proclaimed that al-Qaida \nhad been routed in every neighborhood in Baghdad, citing an 80-percent \ndrop in the murder rate since its peak.\n  The British Broadcasting Corporation reports:\n\n       All across Baghdad . . . streets are springing back to \n     life. Shops and restaurants which closed down are back in \n     business. People walk in crowded streets in the evening, \n     where just a few months ago they would have been huddled \n     behind locked doors in their homes.\n\n  This is from the BBC.\n  Some 67,000 Iraqis have joined U.S.-organized citizens watch groups. \nRoadside bomb attacks have receded to a 3-year low, while finds of \nweapons caches have doubled in the last year. The progress has been so \nimpressive that General Petraeus has recommended a drawdown of troops \nbecause conditions on the ground merit such action.\n  In the last 10 months, so much has changed in Iraq, and yet on the \nfloor of the Senate, nothing has changed at all. We are still voting on \nbills for premature withdrawal, not taking into consideration what is \nhappening on the ground, even when victory is in sight.\n  This is a new day in Iraq, and the Senate should recognize that fact \nby providing a vote of confidence in our generals instead of \nthreatening to pull the rug out from under them.\n  If there are Senators who believe the war is lost, they should vote \nto defund the war instead of threatening to tie the hands of our \ncommanders which would needlessly endanger our troops.\n  We know from our troops in the field that we must keep our \ncommitment. This war has been costly for America in lives and dollars. \nThe consequences of failure, after all we have spent in our treasure \nand our young men and women, would be catastrophic. If we abandon Iraq \nprematurely, it will become a sanctuary for terrorists, and they will \nlaunch attacks on the American people.\n\n[[Page S14453]]\n\n  There is also a real danger that Iraq could become a satellite of \nIran. The Iranian Government has a long record of sponsoring terrorism \nand arming the insurgents who are killing our brave soldiers in Iraq.\n  For all these reasons, we cannot abandon Iraq. We can leave when the \ngenerals say it is safe to leave because Iraq will be stable, that it \nwill not be a terrorist training ground, and that is the only way we \ncan leave Iraq, if we are to uphold the integrity of the United States \nof America.\n  We must persevere and succeed in this war, just as generations before \nus have done when we fought and defeated fascism, communism, and \nnazism. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard have \nsacrificed greatly to keep us safe and free, and we must support them \nin this mission. The mission of a stable Iraq rather than a breeding \nground for terrorists must be accomplished.\n  The bill is coming to the Senate from the House which passed it after \na long, arduous debate last night. I urge my colleagues not to do \nsomething that would so damage the integrity of the United States of \nAmerica and hurt our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan by \nputting them in danger by underfunding them, by not giving them the \nvote of confidence they deserve. It would be unthinkable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss one \nof the issues we have been talking about an awful lot recently, and \nthat is the farm bill; more specifically, the unique nature of \nagricultural production in the United States.\n  We are all going to leave next week and go home, hopefully, to \ncelebrate Thanksgiving with our families, to talk about this wonderful \nblessing we have in this great country of ours--the enormous bounty \nthat exists, the blessings of living in a free country, living in a \nplace where we do not have to worry about going to the grocery store \nand finding the shelves empty or we do not have to worry about those \nthings that are produced here not being safe or acceptable. That is \nbecause we have not only very conscientious producers and farmers, but \nwe have a system and respect in our Government that recognizes how \nimportant it is to the American people to maintain that bounty.\n  As we all go home to celebrate Thanksgiving and give thanks for this \nwonderful country in which we live and the bounty that it provides us, \nI think it is so important to talk about the big tent that exists in \nthis country, the big tent that encompasses all of the diversity of \nagricultural production in different regions across our Nation. It is \nan important aspect that we should embrace, and I hope my colleagues \nwill think about that as well.\n  As we discuss the farm bill and agricultural production, my \ncolleague, the Presiding Officer, is representing a wonderful \nagricultural State, beautiful and vast, and it is very different from \nmine in terms of its assets and what it contributes to this great land. \nMy State is different than Colorado. It is vast and different, just \nwithin the boundaries of my State, but certainly in terms of what it \nbrings to the table in our Nation in terms of the bounty that it \nprovides.\n  Perhaps one of the most frequent questions from so many, particularly \nof my urban colleagues--because I do share a seat with so many other \nfarm Senators on the Agriculture Committee, but a lot of times the \nquestion from my urban colleagues is, why are farms in Arkansas \ndifferent from, say, farms in North Dakota or Michigan or Indiana or \nColorado or other regions of our Nation?\n  Although the answer is pretty simple, it does require quite a lot of \ntime to talk about. It looks as if we have a good bit of time today, so \nI thought I would seek this opportunity and, for the benefit of those \ninquisitive Senators who sometimes ask why are things different in \ndifferent parts of our country and in all of our different States, \noffer an explanation that I give, certainly, to my colleagues and to \nothers who are interested and concerned about us as a nation \nmaintaining the safe and abundant and affordable supply of food and \nfiber that exists in this country for which we are all so thankful.\n  First, and this should come as no surprise, each of our States \nproduces the agricultural products for which its climate and its soil \nare best suited. That is one of the things we do in Arkansas. It, \nobviously, has been that way for years. Farms in Arkansas might be \nolder than those in some of the States that exist to our west. As our \ncountry was explored and discovered, many of those lands in the West \nwere discovered, and their climates and their soil types were \ndifferent. As we have grown as a nation, they have adapted themselves \nto the crops for which they are best suited. For the colder climates of \nthe Midwest, it makes sense to produce corn and wheat and sugar beets. \nFor us in the South, with our more humid climates, and given, \ncertainly, our soil types--we have a large clay content and often sandy \nsoil along our river bottom--we are suited for cotton and rice \nproduction. So that is the first explanation I try to give people, to \ntalk about those differences so we better understand what the \ndifferences are.\n  Second, you have to take into consideration what the markets are for \nour commodities. Again, we are a vast country, full of so many \nblessings and diversity. As we have grown, international markets have \ngrown and changed as well.\n  Let's start with corn. By now I think everyone in this body is \nfamiliar with the fact that we mandate a corn ethanol market through \nthe renewable fuels standard. It is important that we move toward a \nrenewable fuel. It has multiple purposes. Renewable fuels will help us \nclean up the environment and will certainly lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil. It also gives secondary markets for our growers. But so \nfar we have only gotten pretty far on corn-based ethanol.\n  We have mandated this market for corn, and it has done quite well. We \nmake sure those corn growers' prices stay up because there is a market. \nThere are tax incentives that are built in to ensure those markets are \ngoing to be there for corn.\n  In addition to the creation of the market, we place a prohibitive \ntariff at the borders of our country to ensure that only American \nfarmers have access to that corn market. That is for good reason. That \nmarketplace has really matured in terms of ethanol production and the \ndirection we are going to the point we are now realizing that renewable \nfuels are going to need to come from other sources as well; that we \ncannot just depend on that corn-based ethanol program but that we have \nto start looking toward cellulosic and biodiesel and biomass and a \nwhole host of other renewable energy sources. But the fact is, we still \nprotect that corn market to a tremendous degree.\n  For sugar, we have a unique program that doesn't make payments to \nfarmers, but, like ethanol, it limits the international competition, \nand it supports the processing of these commodities.\n  Sometimes sugar is supported in the processing facilities, and \ntherefore those protected markets and that payment coming down to those \nfarmers is a little bit trickier to understand than the regular \ncommodity program.\n  Rather than offering a whole lot of detail on a program that does not \ndirectly impact my State, I would rather direct folks to the \nindividuals who represent the States here that are affected by those \ncrops. I think it is most important to let those who understand crops \nin their States give their descriptions because they have a better \nintuitive idea of how those programs work and how their growers benefit \nand how the economy benefits from it and certainly how the American \npeople benefit. There are a lot of Members who can tell you about that.\n  As the President knows, we on the Ag Committee--everyone has their \nspecialty and certainly their best understanding when it comes to corn \nand sugar. I kind of focus on the folks who know those the best to be \nable to provide you the details. But, in short, sugar has an entirely \nseparate program\n\n[[Page S14454]]\n\nsubject to different disciplines but with a market that is very \ndomestic and exclusively limited to American sugar farmers. So you have \ntwo of these products now, or commodities, that have very different \ndisciplines in terms of what protects them or what provides them that \nvery defined as well as insured marketplace through both the \nconstricting of the marketplace without allowing imports to come in and \nalso the incentives they have in the way those safety nets are provided \nto them through their processing.\n  Now, here is a market that I do know about and that I can talk about, \nand that is what comes from my region of the Nation, which is cotton \nand rice.\n  First and most importantly, I need to point out that these two \ncommodities are subject to very intense global competition. Rather than \nsimply state that as a fact, I will offer a couple of explanations.\n  Rice is a stable commodity globally, all over the world. As such, it \nis produced in many regions, including the developing world, those \nnations which are not as developed as we are or as old and efficient as \nwe are. The same is true for cotton.\n  What is also true is that our market is open to direct competition \nfrom international producers while our access into their foreign \nmarketplace is extremely limited. Now, that means our border is open to \ntheir rice and cotton being shipped into our country. So our growers \nnot only have to compete to get into our marketplaces, but they have to \ncompete here with products that are allowed to come in from other \ncountries--the rice and cotton, specifically.\n  I think the best example or one of the best examples is Japan. \nJapan's rice tariff comes in at over 400 percent. That is more than \nenough to keep American rice out of their marketplace, I have to tell \nyou, a 400-percent tariff on rice going into Japan. Yet our markets are \nopen. Our markets are open to commodities coming into this country.\n  Another good example that can be used is the treatment of rice in the \nrecently negotiated Korean Free Trade Agreement. For every product \nproduced in the United States of America, we reduce the Korean tariff, \nlimiting our access into theirs immediately or phased in over 20 years, \nevery one with the exception of one commodity--it is rice, one \ncommodity that is not allowed to be exported into the Korean \nmarketplace.\n  So it just goes to show you the fact that our commodities, although \nthey are different and grown differently and a whole host of different \nthings, also are treated differently in the global community and in the \nglobal economic venue. At this point, you should start to be seeing a \npattern here in terms of the differences not only in how we grow our \ncommodities but also how our commodities are dealt with in the \nmarketplace. Our market is open to competition, while our export \nmarkets remain closed to our growers of our commodities.\n  Now, do not get me wrong, I am not here advocating that we need \nunabashed free trade for agriculture because I know that to expose the \nThird World to our productivity would decimate vulnerable parts of \ntheir economies that support the poorest of the world's poor. So that \nis not what we are talking about. This dynamic is more than a reality \nfor U.S. farmers; it is a part of America's obligation within the World \nTrade Organization.\n  Now, I will summarize that point just briefly. In the WTO, the United \nStates and other developed nations must report their subsidy level, and \nthey must restrict their tariff level. The conversion is true for the \ndeveloping nations that are members of the WTO. They are not subject to \neven reporting their subsidy, and they have little to no obligation \nwith respect to opening their markets.\n  Now, again, I am not saying this is a total and complete outrage; I \nam merely trying to paint a more comprehensive picture of what American \nagriculture is up against in the global economy. Without a doubt, as we \nhave heard in multiple different meetings across the Hill that many of \nus go to, whether it is our lunch groups or our hearings in committee \nand others, we hear all of the talk about global trade and about the \nglobal economy and developing countries and where they are going, \nplacing priorities in education and infrastructure investment and a \nhost of other things, and we see our trade deficit growing. Yet \nagriculture has always been one of those areas where not only we as \nAmericans feel it is important to maintain that domestic production of \na safe and affordable and available food supply, but we also know it is \na big issue to other countries that they can maintain some domestic \nproduction and hopefully as much as they possibly can grab hold of in \nterms of that domestic production.\n  With that said, it simply cannot be ignored that these disparities in \ninternational competition contribute to the world in which the U.S. \ncotton and rice producers must compete and therefore influence how they \nmust structure their operations. So, again, for us, in meeting \ndifferent demands, in looking at the global marketplace and trying to \nfigure out how we structure ourselves as growers, it is not just about \nthe soil type or the weather and the climate; it is also about the \ninternational marketplace, which leads me to the explanation of the \nlast question which is posed to me; that is, Why are Arkansas farms so \nbig?\n  It should not be difficult for Members of this Chamber to understand \nthat when you face intense competition and your foreign markets are \nclosed, you have to create efficiencies. You have to create \nefficiencies elsewhere in your business operation in order to be able \nto compete because you do not set the world market price. You have \nto be able to compete on that international global stage by your own \nefficiencies.\n\n  It is the good fortune of everyone in America that our farmers are \nthe most efficient farmers in the world. Certainly, we are the \nbeneficiary of that in this great country, but people all across the \nglobe understand that, that not only are we the most efficient and can \ndo it the most affordably, but we produce the safest and set a standard \nin many instances across the globe of what is going to be produced in \nfuture generations in terms of sustenance of life. We have improved our \nefficiencies in ways that cannot be described here in a short period of \ntime, but suffice it to say that the American farmer is the most \nefficient on Earth, and are we not all glad? That is something for us \nto be proud of in this body and across this land. If you are not or if \nyou take our bounty for granted in this great Nation, you should be \nashamed of yourself. That is the reason this bill is so important, is \nthat we have been handed this blessing. We have worked hard on this \nEarth in this great land of ours. But we certainly have reason to be \nproud.\n  Despite our efficiency in cotton and rice country, we are still \noperating on very thin margins of profit. In some years, we merely hope \nfor profit that really never comes.\n  What we have done to help level that playing field is to expand our \noperation to further reduce our per-unit cost and, in turn, create a \ncompetitive economy of scale. Now, that means we have to spread our \nrisk out over a greater abundance of production because that is one of \nthe only ways we have to get the efficiency to be able to be \ncompetitive in a very restrictive market, and that is to have a large \neconomy of scale and mitigate our risk over a greater area.\n  Now, unfortunately, many newspapers and some of my colleagues \nattribute USDA statistics for commercial-size operations to many of our \nArkansas and southern farms and assume we are no longer family farms \nsimply because of our size. What a terrible misrepresentation. I think \nit really diminishes what we are about in this body, which is to \nembrace our diversity and embrace the good work all of these hard-\nworking farm families do across this Nation. And without a doubt, it is \nsimply untrue. I do not know of too many nonfamily farms in my State. \nThere are a lot of people who are going to tell you that because they \nbelong to a cooperative or because they maybe farm more acreage, they \nare not a family farm. In fact, I do not even know of one.\n  What I do know a lot about is fathers and sons, wives, daughters, \nbrothers and sisters who work the land with one another. They have to \ncome together. They have to build their operation, come together, and \nstay together if they are going to survive. Even when that generation \nupon generation finds\n\n[[Page S14455]]\n\nthat one of those brothers or sisters happens to move to the city to \nbecome a doctor or maybe an electrician or maybe a fireman or maybe a \nlawyer, they still help share the risk of what that farm has to do, \nwhich is to create that economy of scale in order to be competitive.\n  So hopefully we can still consider those people a family farm, \nbecause, guess what, they are still a family, and they are still \nfarming and they are all carrying the risk of what it takes to be \ncompetitive in that global marketplace. Now, their operations may \nexceed several thousand acres, and they most certainly are still family \nfarms.\n  In fact, I cannot imagine a definition of a family farm that does not \ninclude the overwhelming majority of Arkansas farmers, but apparently \nsuch a definition exists. USDA seems to come up with these definitions, \nand they print them out up here in Washington, inside this bubble, and \nthey fail to realize that there is a lot of diversity in this great \ncountry. There are a lot of family farms that exist. It is not just \nfamily farms in the Midwest, it is not just family farms on the east \ncoast, but it is family farms in other regions of the country too--yes, \nin our region of the country too.\n  Now, I will go ahead and put my colleagues on notice that until those \nmisrepresentations cease--and I have to tell you, they have been long \nand hard for many years in terms of the misrepresentations of what a \nfarm is and who constitutes that farm. You know, I am a daughter of a \nfarmer, but I cannot imagine the way I get labeled as having been this \nhuge farmer when I am not even farming. Yet that misrepresentation \ncontinues to come out there just because it is convenient and it is \nsensational and people can use it.\n  Well, I have to say that it does not matter to me what happens to me, \nbut it does matter what happens to those hard-working farm families who \nare working so hard to make sure we enjoy that safe and abundant and \naffordable food supply regardless of what happens in the international \ncommunity. My colleagues know they are going to hear a lot more from me \non farm policy that supports farmers throughout this great country as \nthe debate goes on.\n  It is my opportunity to describe and talk about the individuality of \neach of these areas. I will hone in on my part of the country because I \nleave how other commodities are farmed up to those who farm them. But I \ncan definitely tell you, having walked rice levees and scouted cotton \nand chopped down coffee bean plants in a soybean field, how our farms \nrun and why they run that way, I understand the markets. I understand \nthe global trade implications that exist. I understand that all of the \nprograms we design oftentimes in the farm bill don't fit us.\n  For example, take disaster assistance. I was glad to work with my \ncolleagues in the Midwest who wanted to see a disaster assistance \nprogram, even though it doesn't benefit my farmers that much. When you \nhave a farm in the South and you are farming rice, you have to control \nyour environment. Have you ever seen a rice field that has no water on \nit? Unless it is being harvested, you haven't. The reason is, you have \nto control that environment. When it comes to disaster assistance, \nthose counties get the same national disaster declaration on a drought. \nBut guess what. They are never going to get that disaster assistance \nbecause they hardly ever hit the 35-percent yield loss that comes with \nanother stipulation in disaster assistance, because they have \ncontrolled their environment.\n  I will tell you what: They have spent twice the effort and resources \nand money in plowing into that crop what they needed to combat that \ndrought and that disaster that was occurring. So they need another \ntool. They need another tool within the confines of our farm \nlegislation that allows them to market their crop, to market their crop \nin this competitive global marketplace so the Government doesn't have \nto do it for them.\n  As I plow through this--and I know I will have many other \nopportunities to do so--I hope I have answered some questions or at \nleast demonstrated some of the differences in our ag land down in the \nsouthern half of the Nation. We are all a little different. I have to \ntell you, for that we should be extremely grateful and proud, and we \nshould embrace that diversity. As a nation, that is what makes us \nstrong, our diversity and our willingness to embrace it and our \nwillingness to respect it. That is what makes us Americans. Despite \nthese differences, it has always been my view that regardless of the \ntype of crop or the region of the country you live, if you contribute \nto the production of safe agricultural commodities, I consider you a \nfarmer. I consider you an American farmer. I don't judge that and I \ndon't judge you as an American farmer based on whether you are in one \nregion or another or how big your family is or how big your farming \noperation is. I judge you by the fact that you are willing to go to \nwork and work hard every day to do the best you can, to be as efficient \nas you possibly can, not only in this country but in the global \nmarketplace, with tremendous respect to the environment, the \nconservation of land, and the ability to produce a safe and productive \nfood supply. That is who farmers are.\n  If we let other people define who a farmer is and a farm family is, \nthen we will be sorely disappointed when we start to outsource our food \nto other countries. I think we have become sorely disappointed to find \nourselves dependent on foreign oil, to have outsourced our need for \nenergy in the oil arena to other parts of the world. We will find \nourselves once again in the next several years with a trade deficit in \nagriculture, outsourcing our food supply. I don't think Americans want \nto go there; I really don't. I think they are willing to listen for the \ndiversity and expertise and the hard work that goes on by America's \nfarmers to continue to produce that safe and abundant, affordable food \nsupply. As a farmer, regardless of the region of the country, we have \nto help our farmers keep meeting that competition.\n  I have the reputation of being that kind of person, of reaching out \nand working with people, understanding differences, accepting \ndifferences and accepting other people's ideas. I hope we all have that \nattitude. But mostly, I try to be respectful of people. Unfortunately, \nmy farmers and I have not been given that same respect by everybody. I \nam going to continue to work hard to prove my point because I am going \nto earn that respect. I am going to earn that respect not only in what \nwe have done in this underlying bill, in creating the greatest, most \nsubstantial reform in decades. We started over here in current law and \nmost of the extremes that people want are way over here. Guess where we \nhave moved. In terms of providing the reforms that the media and others \nall clamor about, we have come from here all the way over here. That \nlast little bit people want to ask of us will outsource the food supply \nthat southern growers have so proudly provided this country for many \nyears.\n  I am proud to be here to defend and support and be proud of Arkansas \nfarm families. They have worked hard. They will continue to work hard. \nI have fought this fight for several years, and I will continue to \ndefend the programs and my farmers who use them within the limits of \nthe law. Creating greater reform is important. Our farmers want to make \nsure they are in compliance with the law and that they are working hard \nwithin the parameters to do their very best. But they also want to be \nable to be competitive, because they want to continue to provide that \nsafe and abundant supply of food and fiber. And they can--most \nefficiently, most effectively, most safely, as well as with the \ngreatest respect to the environment. I hope people will not continue \nthe sensationalized stories and misrepresented facts in order to get \nsomething done that does nothing but move forward in outsourcing our \nfood and fiber supply.\n  I hope I have brought some clarity here today. I will continue to try \nto do that. I look forward to working with my colleagues. We have a \nlong road ahead of us to get something done. But I think everybody will \nagree it is worth it. It is well worth it, as we return home to be with \nour families, to give thanks for this wonderful Nation we live in and \nthe bounty it provides. I hope we will come back and sit down and get \nto work supporting America's farm families and the hard work they do, \nrecognizing all of the tremendous challenges they face, mostly \nchallenges they have no control over. Whether it is the trade \nagreements they operate\n\n[[Page S14456]]\n\nunder, whether it is the environment and the weather they deal with \nthat they have no control over, it is certainly within the confines of \nthe requirements and the regulations we present them to empower them to \ndo a better job or certainly the best possible job in taking good care \nof the land and being good stewards of this great land we have.\n  I thank the Chair. I look forward to working with my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Idaho \nintends to speak. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak \nafter he is concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Before she leaves the floor, I commend my colleague \nSenator Lincoln. I agree with her strong defense and support of \nAmerica's farmers, particularly our family farms and the need for a \nfarm bill. She and I may come from different parties, but we have shown \nthat you can work together. I consider her to be one of my very good \nfriends and allies as we work toward good policy. I appreciate the \nopportunity to sit here and hear her remarks. It is great to see \nsomeone stand up and respond to the attacks we see coming against \nAmerican agriculture. It seems every time we have a farm bill, the \nattacks begin again. Yet it is in America where the American consumers \nspend the lowest percentage of their disposable income on food and \nfiber because we have such strong farm policies.\n  I also agree with her comments about the need for us to remember we \nare in global markets. Those who produce food and fiber in other \nnations have tremendous subsidies from their governments where their \ngovernments enable them to compete unfairly against our producers. In \nfact, not only do their governments provide unfair, extensive subsidies \nto their producers, they also erect significant anticompetitive trade \nbarriers, both tariff and nontariff trade barriers, so that the \nproducts they send to us are subsidized and the products we try to send \nto them are stopped at the border because of these barriers. It is \nbecause of these kinds of international market circumstances and the \nglobal competition we face these days that it is important for us to \nrecognize the role of the farm bill in helping American producers level \nthat playing field.\n  Again, I appreciate so much the opportunities I have had to work with \nSenator Lincoln on this and many other issues. We have worked together \nto strengthen and improve American policy.\n  I came to talk about the farm bill, and I will do that. But before \ndoing so, I want to talk a little bit about the process, because I am \nvery disturbed by the position the Senate is in right now. We could \nhave been debating amendments to the farm bill for a week or two now. \nInstead we have been stalled by a procedure that has filled the \namendment tree, for those who don't follow the rules of the Senate. The \namendment tree has been filled up so no one can file amendments to the \nfarm bill. Yet I understand there are over 260 amendments that have \nbeen prepared and which are out there waiting in the wings from \ndifferent Members of the Senate. We are not going to see all 260 of \nthose amendments debated and voted on. That never happens. But we \nshould see a significant number of them debated and voted on.\n  Those of us who serve on the Agriculture Committee or the Finance \nCommittee have seen both pieces of this farm bill be very vigorously \ndebated at the committee level with all sorts of amendments and work \ndeveloping the right kinds of process. Now it is time for that same \nprocess to occur here on the floor. Yet we have not seen one amendment \nallowed to be brought forward. The farm bill affects so many people's \nlives through providing food and fiber and security and enabling global \ncompetitiveness and ensuring a better environment. I could go on. But \nwe must allow all Senators the opportunity to bring forth amendments \nthey believe need to be debated before we have the final vote on the \nfarm bill.\n  We have all heard by now the debate here in the Chamber and in other \nplaces about numbers, highlighting the multiple rollcall votes we have \nhad on previous farm bill debates. Let me review a few of those. \nAccording to the information I have, during the 2002 farm bill debate, \nwhich is the most recent farm bill we have had, there were 49 amendment \nvotes, including 25 rollcall votes. In 1996, on the farm bill preceding \nthe current one, there were 26 amendment votes, including 11 rollcall \nvotes. And during the farm bill debate previous to that in 1990, there \nwere 113 votes, including 22 rollcalls. In 1985, there were 88 votes, \n33 of which were rollcalls. Yet now during this debate or nondebate, we \nhave had zero votes on any amendments because the amendment tree has \nbeen blocked.\n  I am discouraged by that because we could have made significant \nprogress on this farm bill. Now what we see is a maneuver which is \nproposing that cloture be entered which would cut off debate on the \nfarm bill and push it forward without giving us the opportunity for a \nfull and robust debate on amendments.\n  I encourage our leadership on both sides to get past this impasse. I \nknow there has been a lot of progress made in terms of an effort to \nlimit the number of amendments and try to get a determination of how \nmany amendments will be allocated to each side and allow us to move \nforward. But for whatever reason, we haven't been able to get that \nagreement resolved. The farm bill is too important for these kinds of \npartisan politics and maneuvers. I know there are concerns about \ncertain amendments that may be brought. There are some on either side, \ndepending on the amendment, who would prefer not to see the amendment \nbrought because it could cause an embarrassing vote on behalf of some \nMembers. I will face that same dynamic as amendments are brought \nforward. There will be amendments that will be difficult to face. But \nit is something we must do. It is the tradition of the Senate that we \nfully deliberate on matters such as this and that debate is not closed \ndown.\n  I say again to our majority leader and our minority leader, we need \nto work together, avoid cloture votes, and avoid restrictions that \nprohibit Members from bringing their debate forward in this Chamber and \nallow us to have a full and robust debate so we can move the farm bill \nforward.\n  I remain committed to working together to move this farm bill forward \nin the Senate through a full, fair, and open process, and I hope we can \nget to one soon.\n  Now, let me turn to my comments on the farm bill itself. Many people \nsay we should not call it the farm bill--in fact, I think it actually \ndoes have a different title now--because the farm bill is much more \nthan just a bill that deals with commodities programs.\n  In fact, the farm bill, with the new addition of the Finance \nCommittee title, will have 11 titles in it, only one of which is the \ncommodities title. There are other titles dealing with rural \ndevelopment, with energy policy, and, as most people are not aware, \nwith the food programs of our Nation.\n  In fact, if you look at the allocation of resources in the farm bill, \nonly about 14 percent of the cost of the farm bill is truly allocated \nto the agricultural commodity programs. Over 60 percent--I think around \n66 percent--of the cost of the bill goes to our Nation's food programs, \nsuch as our Food Stamp Program and the other programs that we have in \ninternational aid.\n  Then there are the programs dealing with conservation, which I am \ngoing to talk about in a minute, which is probably the most significant \nconservation effort in which this Congress gets engaged in any kind of \nan ongoing basis. Yet far too few Americans realize the commitment to \nthe preservation and conservation and improvement of our environment \nthat is contained in the farm bill.\n  There are more than 25,000 farms and ranches in Idaho producing more \nthan 140 commodities statewide. Idaho leads or is ranked among the top \nStates in the production of potatoes, peas, lentils, mint, sugar beets, \nonions, hops, dairy products, wheat, wool, cherries, and other \ncommodities. Therefore, the farm bill is of vital importance to a more \nthan $4 billion Idaho agricultural industry, which is an essential part \nof Idaho's economy.\n  In preparation for this farm bill authorization, like Chairman Harkin \nand\n\n[[Page S14457]]\n\nRanking Member Chambliss, the House Agriculture Committee and former \nAgriculture Secretary Johanns, and others, I sought input from \nproducers and those interested in the farm bill throughout the townhall \nmeetings and hearings I had in Idaho, and I listened to many of my \nconstituents voice their criticisms, bring forward their suggestions, \nand bring forward their praise of the last farm bill--the current farm \nbill under which we are operating.\n  What I heard loudly and clearly was that the basic structure of the \n2002 farm bill is solid, and rather than starting from scratch, we \nshould make changes to it and improvements to that basic structure as \nneeded but not lose that structure that has been so helpful to our \nfarmers and to our rural communities in particular throughout America. \nI have been pleased to work with my colleagues on the Senate Ag \nCommittee and in the Congress in general to craft a bill that I believe \nsticks with that principle.\n  The bill before us today does not wipe away existing farm policy but \nbuilds on it for a stronger Federal farm policy. As Senator Lincoln \nindicated, it makes some very significant and needed reforms to move in \nthe direction of addressing the concerns that many have raised about \nsome inequities in the farm bill processes.\n  The legislation includes essential provisions, such as the new \nspecialty crops subtitle that strengthens specialty crop block grants \nand other important programs. I have appreciated working with Senator \nStabenow, Senator Craig, and others on this effort, and I thank \nChairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss and Senator Conrad and \nothers who have worked with us in shaping Federal farm policy that \nbolsters U.S. agriculture through provisions such as these specialty \ncrop programs.\n  Additionally, I thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley on \nthe Finance Committee for the time they spent in crafting a tax title \nfor the farm bill that enables us to make some additions and tweaks \nthat were needed. It has been an honor to be one of the Senators who \nserves on both the Finance and Agriculture Committees, the two \ncommittees with products that will be merged together on the floor of \nthe Senate to make up this year's farm bill.\n  There are a number of highlights in the tax title of the farm bill I \nwant to mention. In the tax title of the farm bill, I worked with \nseveral Senators to include improvements to the Endangered Species Act \nthrough incentives for landowners to assist with species recovery. For \nyears we have struggled with the burden that the Endangered Species Act \nputs on private property owners. Notably, about 80 percent of the \nendangered or threatened species in America are found on private \nproperty. Yet we have put the burden of protecting and preserving and \nrecovering those species unduly on our private property owners.\n  This bill I have introduced and worked on with many others in the \nSenate will provide participants with the option of a tax credit \ninstead of the Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program, \nand Grasslands Reserve Program.\n  This farm bill also provides support for wheat, barley, sugar, wool, \nand pulse crop producers. Pulse crops would become eligible for \nCounter-Cyclical Program assistance.\n\n  The Noninsured Assistance Program would provide coverage for \naquacultural producers who are impacted by drought.\n  There are significant investments in energy programs that would \nassist producers with efforts that support energy independence.\n  Changes to Project SEARCH would allow financially distressed rural \ncommunities in Idaho and nationwide to access increased Federal \nassistance for their water infrastructure needs.\n  The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program would be significantly expanded \nto enable all States to participate. Expanding this program nationwide \nwill further the effort to provide healthy food choices for our \nchildren. This program is a win-win for children, students, and \nproducers.\n  I have visited Idaho schools and have seen firsthand how the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program has been a big support to our students, and \nI look forward to seeing the additional benefits brought through this \nprogram by making it available to more students.\n  There are many other provisions of importance in this extensive \nlegislation that I could bring up and review, but instead I want to \njust focus on one vital area of the bill--the conservation title--\nbefore concluding my remarks.\n  I have appreciated having the opportunity to work with my colleagues \non the conservation title, which provides landowners with both the \nfinancial and technical assistance necessary to achieve real \nenvironmental results.\n  As I said earlier, no Federal policy contributes more to the \nimprovement and protection of our environment than the farm bill, \nthrough the incentive-driven conservation programs. The conservation \ntitle provides $4.4 billion in new spending for conservation programs. \nThe title continues with the current combination of conservation \nprograms with improvements to make them work.\n  For example, the Senate farm bill makes changes to the EQIP, or \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, to ensure that private forest \nland owners receive the help they need to better manage their land.\n  Chairman Harkin made numerous changes to the Conservation Security \nProgram, which has been renamed the Conservation Stewardship Program. \nThe Senate farm bill provides $1.28 billion in new spending for that \nprogram.\n  There are also adjustments made to increase participation of \nspecialty crop producers in the Conservation Stewardship Program, \ndedicated conservation program resources and higher technical \nassistance levels to increase participation of beginning and socially \ndisadvantaged farmers and ranchers. The title also provides added \nemphasis to encourage pollinator habitat improvements on agricultural \nand forest land.\n  Funding is provided for the Wetlands Reserve Program and the \nGrasslands Reserve Program, which did not have baseline funding \nstarting in 2008. The Wetlands Reserve Program would be provided with \nfunds to enroll 250,000 acres per year through 2012. The Grasslands \nReserve Program would be provided with $240 million for fiscal years \n2008 through 2012.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program would be maintained at 39.2 million \nacres. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program would be continued with \n$85 million per year for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The Farmland \nProtection Program would be reauthorized at $97 million per year \nthrough the duration of the farm bill. The conservation title provides \nfor the creation of a framework to facilitate the participation of \nfarmers in greenhouse gas reduction and other environmental services \nmarkets.\n  Now, I understand the challenges faced in writing this farm bill and \nthe significant investment that has been made in conservation programs, \nespecially having to cover baseline shortfalls for the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram and the Grasslands Reserve Program. However, a broader \ninvestment is needed in our conservation programs, such as the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program and the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram, so we can better capitalize on the conservation interest and \nneeds across this Nation.\n  I will continue to work for investments in working lands \nconservation, such as the EQIP program and GRP, or Grasslands Reserve \nProgram.\n  With any legislation that is as comprehensive as this, there are \nalways provisions that each of us would like to see come out \ndifferently. However, on a whole, this bill before us builds upon past \nfarm bills and sets U.S. agriculture on the right course. Throughout \nthe crafting of this bill, it has been refreshing to see that more \npeople are starting to understand each aspect of this important \nlegislation. Truly, there are few pieces of legislation that have the \nability to impact so many lives. This bill affects our Nation's food \nsecurity, our global competitiveness, the condition of our air, water, \nand land, as well as many other aspects of our lives.\n  I look forward to getting past the impasse we face on the Senate \nfloor and moving forward to a timely debate and the enactment of a farm \nbill that enables sound Federal farm policy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to address the issue which has \nbeen noted by the Senator from Idaho,\n\n[[Page S14458]]\n\nwhich is the process under which the farm bill is being considered in \nthe Senate.\n  A number of the Members on the other side of the aisle, primarily the \nleadership, have spoken on this process and have made the \nrepresentation that in some way we, on our side, are slowing down this \nbill. Nothing could be less accurate, in my opinion.\n  I know, although I do not happen to support the farm bill because I \nthink it is bloated in many ways and essentially ignores the concept of \na marketplace, the farm bill is going to pass. It always does pass. It \nalways passes with a very large majority, which is assured by the fact \nthat enough commodities are put into the subsidy system so that you can \nadd up enough people to support it, so it will always pass with a large \nmajority. And there will be 20 or 25 people who will vote against it.\n  So I have never held any belief or even thought for a second this \nfarm bill was not going to pass the Senate. It is going to pass the \nSenate. It has not been my intention to either slow it down or try to \ndefeat it because I know I cannot do either--or I did not think I could \ndo either.\n  My intention was to improve it and to address issues which I think \nare relevant to it or which are appropriate to the issues which the \nSenate should be addressing today generally.\n  But, unfortunately, on the procedure that has been structured by the \nmajority leader, all Members of the Senate, but especially members of \nthe minority--the Republican Members of the Senate--have been shut out \nof the ability to amend this bill.\n  The majority leader has essentially created a system which you could \ncall the ``permission slip'' approach to legislating. If he does not \ngive you a blue permission slip, you cannot bring forward an amendment \non this bill.\n  Obviously, that does not work for those of us who wish to amend the \nbill. But, more importantly, it does not work for the institution. The \nessence of the Senate is the ability to amend legislation when it is on \nthe floor.\n  Washington described the Senate as the place where the hot coffee \nfrom the cup--referring to the House--it is the saucer into which that \nhot coffee is poured, so it can be looked at, thought about, and \nreviewed to make sure there is not hasty action, to make sure there is \nnot precipitous action, to make sure there is not action which will \ncome back to haunt us because we did not try our best to anticipate the \nconsequences.\n  So the Senate was structured to be a deliberative institution. That \nwas its purpose. Our Founding Fathers designed it with that intent in \nmind, as expressed by George Washington. It has always worked that way. \nWe have always, when we have had major pieces of authorizing \nlegislation on the floor, had the opportunity to amend that \nlegislation. Even if they are not major pieces of legislation, in many \ninstances we have had the ability to amend it in just about any way we \nwanted. There was a statement that you have to do relevant amendments. \nWell, under the rules of the Senate, there is no such thing as relevant \namendments. Everything is relevant. Irrelevant amendments are relevant \nbecause that is the way the Senate is structured. That is the way we \nwork. If there is an issue of the time which a Member wants to bring \nforward to discuss and have voted on, the idea is the Senate will do \nthat. Now, there is a procedure to cut off and go to relevant or \ngermane amendments, but that procedure is a very formal procedure known \nas cloture and it takes 60 votes. That should not be done on a bill of \nthis size until there has been adequate debate and a reasonable number \nof amendments considered.\n\n  I noticed that the Senator from Michigan, whom I greatly admire and \nenjoy working with, had a large chart today which talked about the fact \nthat there have been 55 filibusters by the Republican Party since the \nSenate has convened. That is sort of like, as I have said on occasion, \nthe fellow who shoots his parents throwing himself on the mercy of the \ncourt because he is suddenly saying he is an orphan. The simple fact is \nthe only reason there have been 55 cloture motions filed around here is \nbecause the majority party has decided to try to shorten debate and \nshorten the amendment process at a rate that has never occurred before. \nBills are brought to the floor and cloture is filed instantaneously. \nThat never used to happen around here. It is not our party which has \nbeen trying to extend these debates; it is the other party which has \nbeen trying to essentially foreshorten the debates in an extremely \nartificial and premature way and limit the capacity of the minority to \nmake its points and to raise the issues it considers to be important.\n  On almost every one of these bills--the 55 that are noted--agreement \ncould have been reached, timeframes could have been agreed to, an \namendment list could have been set, and we could have proceeded under \nregular order. But regular order was not allowed because the other side \nof the aisle wants to manage the Senate the way the House is managed: \nWhere the majority party essentially does not allow the minority to \noffer amendments to the bills unless the majority party agrees to the \namendments. Well, I can understand that in the House. There are 435 \npeople there and it would be pretty much chaotic. But in the Senate, we \nare not designed that way. The whole purpose of this institution is to \nallow extensive discussion of legislation and amendments on \nlegislation, whether the amendments are relevant or irrelevant.\n  So the process that is being put in place is harmful, in my opinion, \nto the fundamental institution of the Senate, when you have a majority \nleader who comes forward, immediately fills the tree, and then says the \nmajority leader is not going to allow any amendments to the bill unless \nthe amendments are accepted by the majority leader which, of course, on \nits face is a little absurd. Obviously, if we were all going to offer \namendments that agreed with the majority leader, we would all be in the \nmajority leader's party. That is why we have a two-party system. The \nidea is a two-party system. The one party sometimes disagrees with the \nother party and tries to make the points we feel are important to \ngovern us. But the majority leader closes the floor down, says we have \na permission slip process where you have to get his blue slip of \napproval before we can move forward, and then he files cloture on the \nbill after having not allowed any amendments to move forward. I think \nthat does fundamental harm to the institution. It creates a precedent \naround here that may well be a slippery slope for us as an institution. \nI remember a couple of years ago there was a big debate about whether \nwe should do cloture, or needed cloture, on the issue of Supreme Court \njudges. On our side of the aisle, because there was a lot of foot \ndragging about some of the Supreme Court judges who were being \nnominated, there were many who felt we should go forward and have a \nruling of the Chair which says it only takes 51 votes; the Constitution \ndoes not allow filibusters against Supreme Court judges. Well, some on \nour side of the aisle felt that was a slippery slope, that that type of \na procedural heavy-handedness by the majority would harm the \ninstitution and would lead to serious ramifications down the road when \nthe parties changed governance.\n  This institution will not always have a Democratic majority. The \nfacts are pretty obvious. We change around here. The American people \nlike to have Government change. They like change. They get frustrated \nwith the way things are going, so they make a change. There will be a \nRepublican majority; I absolutely guarantee that. But the Democratic \nleadership, the majority leader, is in the process of setting a \nprecedent, if he is successful, which will be extraordinarily harmful \nshould a Republican majority take control and use that same precedent. \nSo I think it is a huge mistake that this process has proceeded in this \nway and it is inconsistent with the facts on the ground.\n  The majority leader has said we can only have relevant amendments--\nrelevant, ironically, as defined by the majority side. Well, history \nhas shown us that is not the case. Even on farm bills--even on farm \nbills--especially on farm bills, amendments are brought forward which \nare irrelevant to the farm bill all the time. In fact, ironically, the \nmajority leader has brought forward a number of those amendments. In \n1996, for example, he offered an amendment to the farm bill regarding \nthe importation of tea and the Board of Tea experts. In 1990, he \noffered an amendment to the bill regarding\n\n[[Page S14459]]\n\ntesting consumer products containing hazardous and toxic substances. In \nthe year 2000, he offered an amendment to the farm bill regarding the \nSocial Security trust fund and tax policy. In the year 2000, the \nmajority leader offered an amendment to the farm bill regarding pest \nmanagement in schools. The manager of the bill, Senator Harkin, in the \nyear 2000, offered an amendment regarding fees on pesticide \nmanufacturing. In the year 1985, he offered an amendment regarding the \ncreation of additional bankruptcy judges in the State of Iowa.\n  I would argue that none of those amendments, under the most liberal \ninterpretation of what is relevant, would be defined as relevant in a \npostcloture exercise and, therefore, by the actions of the majority, \nand specifically the majority leader and the chairman of the committee; \nthey have set a precedent that even if it weren't the right of the \nmembership of the Senate, they have set a precedent that amendments \nwhich are not--which are irrelevant to the underlying bill can be \nbrought forward, and they should be brought forward.\n  For example, today the majority leader came down and made a very \ncompelling statement relative to the dire straits that people are in \nwho are having their mortgages foreclosed on because of this subprime \nmeltdown we are having. It is serious. It is very serious. It is \nserious to those people especially, but it is also serious to the \nNation as a whole because it is affecting the credit markets and it may \nbe contracting the economy. I filed an amendment which would address \nthat issue. Some farmers I suspect are caught up in this subprime \nforeclosure exercise, unfortunately. I bet there are some farm families \nwho have been hit by this. I know there have been. So I think it is \nprobably pretty relevant to these people who are farmers and, \ntherefore, an argument could be made it is relevant to the bill. But I \nam not making that argument. I am saying that issue should be raised \nright now--we shouldn't wait--that the amendment I have offered which \nwould essentially say that if your home is foreclosed on, you don't get \nhit with a tax bill for phantom income, which is what happens today. If \nyou happen to be unfortunate enough to have your home foreclosed on, \nyou get a tax bill from the IRS, even though you lost your home and \neven though you didn't get any income out of the foreclosure sale. That \nputs a little more pressure on the person who has had their home \nforeclosed on. That is a traumatic enough event, but to then have the \nIRS come after you, that is horrible. So this amendment would basically \nstop that practice. It would say to the IRS: No. You can't deem that as \nincome.\n\n  There are going to be some farmers who are going to need that \nprotection, and there are going to be a lot of Americans who are going \nto need that protection, unfortunately. So we should take that \namendment up. I would be happy to offer that amendment right now, but \nif I offered it right now, it would be objected to under the proposal \nbecause the majority leader has deemed it is not relevant to the farm \nbill and, therefore, he is not going to allow it to be debated. I \nhappen to think it is a pretty darned important amendment.\n  There are a couple of other amendments I have suggested. I have \nsuggested 11 amendments to the bill. That is not outrageous. Some of \nthem I think could probably be negotiated. I even suggested I would \ntake 15 minutes of debate on them, 7\\1/2\\ minutes divided equally on \neach one of them. Unfortunately, the other side of the aisle rejected \nthat idea--or they didn't formally object to it, but they told us we \nwould want to talk a little bit more about some of these amendments. \nBut the assistant majority leader on the Democratic side of the aisle \ncame down to the floor and specifically called out a few of my \namendments and said that they were the problem. They were the problem \nbecause they shouldn't be heard on this farm bill. He mentioned the \nmortgage amendment which we discussed.\n  He also mentioned an amendment which I happen to think is pretty darn \nrelevant to this bill, especially to rural America and farm \ncommunities, which is that in most of rural America today, there is a \ncrisis relative to the ability of baby doctors to practice their \nprofession. It is virtually impossible, for example, in northern New \nHampshire to see an OB/GYN unless you drive through the mountains and \ndown to the southern or mid part of the State. That is true across this \ncountry, because OB/GYN doctors--baby doctors--people who deliver \nbabies in rural communities can't generate enough income because the \npopulations aren't large enough to pay the cost of their insurance \nagainst frivolous lawsuits or lawsuits generally. So I have suggested \nthat for those doctors specifically, so we can get more of them into \nthe rural communities delivering babies for all the people who live in \nthe rural communities but obviously for farm families, that we give \nprotection to them--protection which tracks--it is not outrageous \nprotection--the California protection for doctors which occurs \ngenerally under California law so the cost of their premium for \nmalpractice insurance will not drive them out of practicing and \ndelivering babies in rural America and especially to farm families.\n  The Senator from Illinois said that was a frivolous--he didn't use \nthe term ``frivolous''--he implied the amendment wasn't a good \namendment; we shouldn't have to debate that amendment on this bill. Why \nnot? Why not take up that amendment? Fifteen minutes I am willing to \ndebate that amendment, 7\\1/2\\ minutes on both sides, and vote on it.\n  Well, it is not because it is not relevant and it is not because it \nshouldn't be taken up; it is because there are a number of Members on \ntheir side of the aisle who said we don't want to vote that issue. It \nis a hard vote. Why? Because it makes sense. That is why I think it is \na hard vote. But there are other people on the other side of the aisle \nwho simply don't want to have to cast that vote. It is not about the \nrelevance of that amendment; it is about the desire to avoid casting a \ndifficult vote. Well, you were sent here; you should make difficult \nvotes on public policy that is important, and that happens to be a \nfairly significant point of public policy that is important, whether \nwomen in rural America can have adequate and prompt access to an OB/\nGYN. I think that is pretty darn important.\n  Then the assistant leader said an amendment I had on the list, my 11 \namendments--a small number of amendments--was not appropriate because \nit dealt with the Gulf of Mexico. Well, this amendment says, as a \nfollow-on to the Oceans Commission, which did a very large, extensive \nstudy of the status of the ocean and America's involvement and what we \nshould be doing relative to the ocean, which was completed about 2 \nyears ago and which was created, authorized, and funded as a result of \nan initiative by Senator Hollings from South Carolina, with my support \nas a member of the appropriations subcommittee that had jurisdiction \nover NOAA, and the conclusion of this Commission, which was filled with \nthe best and most talented scientists and leaders we have on the issue \nof how the ocean was being impacted, was that the Gulf of Mexico is \nbeing uniquely impacted by fertilizer runoff from the Midwest coming \ndown the Missouri, the Mississippi, and the other tributaries of the \nMississippi and going into the Gulf of Mexico, and we are getting a \ndead zone there, a very significant dead zone because of the phosphates \nand I think the nitrates. The Commission called for action. It said: We \nhave to do something as a country about this.\n  But what does this farm bill do? It expands dramatically the \nincentive to put more acreage into production, and I say: Fine. That is \ngreat. But it doesn't address the runoff issue, which is that \nadditional production is going to occur, or the runoff issue that is \noccurring as a result of already existing production. So all this \namendment does is say let's give NOAA the ability to go out and study \nthis problem and see if they can come up--working with the Department \nof Agriculture--with some ideas on how we might be able to abate the \nharm we are doing as an unintended consequence of expanding our \nagricultural community, the harm we are doing to the Gulf of Mexico. \nBut no, no, we can't take up that amendment. No, no. It doesn't get a \nblue slip, permission slip from the majority leader.\n  Then the fourth amendment which was mentioned or cited by the \nassistant leader as being something that was\n\n[[Page S14460]]\n\nproblematic--and that is sort of a conservative description of the way \nhe addressed the issues--was an amendment I have that says the \nfirefighters should have the ability to pursue collective bargaining.\n  Now, maybe farms don't have fires. Maybe barns don't burn down and \nsilos don't blow up. Maybe there weren't any wildfires in San Diego. \nMaybe I missed all that. But it seems to me that fire protection is a \npretty big part of everybody's lifestyle in this country, and having \nfire departments that know what they are doing and are properly paid, \nhave proper equipment and training is really important whether you \nhappen to be in New York City or on a farm somewhere in the Midwest or \nthe West. So I cannot imagine under what scenario it is deemed that \nthis amendment should not be discussed and voted on.\n  Again, I am willing to do this for a briefer period of time. I am not \ntrying to slow the bill down. I want to get a few issues up that I \nthink are important to the definition of the problem as I see it in the \nfarm region.\n  Then I had a series of amendments--well, I only had 11, but 5 of the \namendments I had dealt with the budget process.\n  This farm bill does fundamental harm to the concept of responsible \nbudgeting. It plays games with our budget process. We hear so much from \nthe other side of the aisle about how they use pay-go to discipline \nspending around here. That is the term, the motherhood term we hear, \n``pay-go.'' It turns out that it is ``Swiss cheese go'' as far as the \nother side of the aisle is concerned regarding spending restraint. On \n15 different occasions, they have gimmicked pay-go, played games with \nit to the point where they have spent almost $143 billion in this \nCongress which should have been subject to pay-go but was not subject \nto a pay-go vote because they managed to gimmick their way around it.\n  This farm bill is a classic example of that procedure occurring \nagain. By changing dates--1 day--so that they shift years and take \nitems out of the pay-go--what is called the pay-go scorecard--they are \nable to avoid pay-go charges in this bill to the tune of $10 billion. \nThat is not small change, by the way. We should have a pay-go vote on \nthat $10 billion if we are going to maintain the integrity of the \nbudget process. That is reasonable. I have asked for that vote.\n  In addition, they have created a new emergency fund--a $5 billion \nemergency fund. The way we have handled emergencies--and there are, I \nadmit, many emergencies in farm country--is that we have always paid \nfor those emergency costs through an emergency supplemental, whether it \nis because of a flood or if there is a drought or if there is a \nhurricane. We fund the costs after they have occurred, and we pay the \ncosts of the emergency. What this would do is set up what amounts to a \nslush fund--what I am afraid will become basically walking-around \nmoney--of $5 billion and a floor so that we are going to be guaranteed \nthat every year for the next 5 years at least a billion dollars will be \nspent on emergencies, whether there is an emergency or not. You know, \nif a large wind blows a mailbox over in North Dakota, it is going to be \ndeclared an emergency because somebody is going to want to get their \nhands on that billion dollars. That makes no sense from a budget \nstandpoint. We know that human nature--especially legislative nature--\nwill spend that money once it is allocated, and we should not do it up \nfront, create a floor; we should do it the traditional way, which is to \npay for emergencies when they occur. Now, some people here obviously \ndisagree with me. I suspect I will not win that vote. But it doesn't \nmean we should not have a vote on that point of budget discipline and \nthe importance of budget discipline.\n  In addition, on the budget issue, there is a $3 billion gimmick in \nhere that is so creative it sets a new standard for creativity. There \nalways has been movement of money from the discretionary side of the \naccount to the mandatory side, and vice versa, to free up more \nspending. That is a game that has been played a long time, where an \nexpenditure that is discretionary will suddenly find out it is being \nput under a mandatory account, so the money being spent in the \ndiscretionary account can be freed up to spend it on something else. If \nyou get it into the mandatory accounts here, you basically put it on \nautopilot and don't have to worry about it ever again.\n  This bill takes this concept to a new dimension. It takes a mandatory \nspending responsibility and moves it over to a tax credit, so that we \nnow have a $3 billion tax credit where we used to have a $3 billion \nmandatory expenditure, and then it takes the $3 billion that was being \nspent on the mandatory side of the account and spends it on a new \nprogram. So, essentially, by using the tax law in a very creative way, \nyou have generated new spending of $3 billion. I think that is terrible \nbudget policy. I think we should address it, debate it, talk about it \non the floor, and definitely vote on it before we allow this bill to go \nto cloture.\n  Obviously, there are a lot of issues raised by this bill; otherwise, \nthere would not be 240 amendments filed. The majority of them have been \nfiled by the other side of the aisle. But the fact that the procedure \nhas been structured in a way that these amendments, which are totally \nreasonable, which are parts of significant issues of public policy, \nsuch as whether women in rural America will be able to see an OB/GYN or \nwhether farmers get the equipment they need or whether a person whose \nhome is foreclosed on will get hit with an IRS tax penalty or whether \nthe Gulf of Mexico should be looked at relative to maintaining its \nvitality as a environmentally sensitive area--we are not going to be \nallowed to look at all of these issues because the majority leader set \nup a blue-slip permission process, which is totally antithetical to the \nsystem the Senate historically works under and undermines the capacity \nof issues to be debated and voted on. I just think, as I said, it is \ndoing fundamental harm to our institution. Even if I didn't want to \nbring these amendments forward, I would not want to have a process that \ndenied the right of other people to bring amendments like them forward.\n  The fact that the leadership on the other side of the aisle wants to \ninsulate its membership from making tough votes on things like baby \ndoctors being available to farmers and farms getting the equipment they \nneed and people whose homes are foreclosed on not being subject to IRS \npenalties--the fact that they want to protect their membership, that is \nunderstandable. That is their leadership. Their leadership is clearly \ntrying to protect them in their jobs. To abuse the process of the \nSenate to accomplish that, to create a procedure where you basically \nforeclose amendments in a manner that actually is even more strict and \nmore contracted than what the House does, does more harm than good to \nthe institution. As I said earlier, it puts us on an unnecessary and \ninappropriate slippery slope, and it is a fundamental change in the way \nthe Senate works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                             Senate Choices\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, on tomorrow, we will be voting on \nseveral items. Two are going to be related to our policy on Iraq. \nTonight, I wish to express my views on the choices that are before the \nSenate and the American people. I know later in the evening a number of \ncolleagues will speak to this issue. I welcome the chance to now \nexpress my view.\n  Madam President, I oppose the minority leader's effort to provide a \n$70 billion blank check to President Bush for his failed Iraq policy. I \nwill support legislation approved yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives requiring the President to begin to bring our combat \ntroops out of Iraq in 1 month and complete the withdrawal by December \nof next year. I hope the Senate will support it, and I hope President \nBush will sign it into law.\n  Earlier this month, we reached another tragic milestone in Iraq. We \nhave lost more Americans in Iraq this year than in any other year. It \nis another painful and somber reminder of the enormous price in \nprecious lives the Iraq war continues to impose. It is long past time \nfor the administration to change course and end the national nightmare \nthe Iraq war has become. Our military has served nobly in Iraq and done \neverything we have asked them to do. But they are caught in a\n\n[[Page S14461]]\n\ncontinuing quagmire. They are policing a civil war and implementing a \npolicy that is not worthy of their enormous sacrifice.\n  The best way to protect our troops and our national security is to \nput the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for \ntheir future so that we can bring our troops back home to America \nsafely. As long as our military presence in Iraq is open-ended, Iraq's \nleaders are unlikely to make the essential compromises for a political \nsolution.\n  The administration's misguided policy has put our troops in an \nuntenable and unwinnable situation. They are being held hostage to \nIraqi politics, in which sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to \nmake the difficult judgments needed to lift Iraq out of its downward \nspiral.\n  BG John F. Campbell, deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry \nDivision in Iraq, spoke with clarity about the shortcomings of Iraq's \npolitical leaders. He said:\n\n       The ministers, they don't get out. . . . They don't know \n     what the hell is going on on the ground.\n\n  Army LTG Mark Fetter said that ``it is painful, very painful'' \ndealing with the obstructionism of Iraqi officials.\n  About conditions on the ground, Army MG Michael Barbero said:\n\n       . . . it's not as good as it's being reported now.\n\n  All of these military deserve credit for their courage in speaking \nthe truth. We should commend them for it. These are courageous, brave \nmilitary speaking the truth.\n  Yet the President continues to promise that success is just around \nthe corner. He continues to hold out hope that Iraq's leaders are \nwilling and capable of making essential political compromises necessary \nfor reconciliation.\n  The American people know we are spending hundreds of billions of \ndollars on a failed policy that is making America more vulnerable and \nputting our troops at greater risk. The toll is devastating. Nearly \n4,000 American troops have died, tens of thousands of Iraqis have been \nkilled or injured, and over 4 million more have been forced to flee \ntheir homes. Nearly a half trillion dollars has been spent fighting \nthis war.\n  It is wrong for Congress to write a blank check to the President for \nthis war. It is obvious that President Bush wants to drag this process \nout month after month so he can hand off his policy to the next \nPresident. It is time to put the brakes on this madness. It is up to us \nto halt the open-ended commitment of our troops that President Bush has \nbeen making year after year. We need to tell the Iraqis now that we \nintend to leave and leave soon. Only by doing so can we create the \nurgency that is so clearly necessary for them to end their differences.\n  We cannot allow the President to drag this process out any longer. \nThis war is his responsibility, and it is his responsibility to do all \nhe can to end it. It is wrong for him to pass the buck to his successor \nwhen he knows thousands more of the courageous members of the Armed \nForces will be wounded or die because of it. Every day this misguided \nwar goes on, our service men and women and their families continue to \nshoulder the burden and pay the price.\n\n  If this issue were only about the tragedies of the war, there would \nbe reason enough to end it. But it has become about so much more. Now \nwe are also starting to see the fallout at home as the President \nrefuses to deliver the relief our families need.\n  Earlier this week, the President signed a Defense appropriations bill \nthat includes a 10-percent increase in funding compared to last year, \nbut he vetoed a bill that includes an increase half that big that would \nfund cancer research, investments in our schools, job training, and \nprotection for our workers. That bill included $4.5 billion more than \nthe President proposed for education. He said that $4.5 billion more \nfor students is too much. Yet he has asked for 35 times that much more \nfor the war in Iraq. He wants us to say yes to $158 billion for Iraq \nwhen he says no to $4.5 billion for American children.\n  In Iraq, anything goes. The sky is the limit. Billions and billions \nof dollars for Iraq. But here in America, right here at home, a modest \ninvestment in our school children gets a veto.\n  The bill included $3 billion to improve the quality of our teachers. \nThose funds would have been used to hire 30,000 more teachers, provide \nhigh-quality induction and mentoring for 100,000 beginning teachers, \nand provide high-quality professional development for an additional \n200,000 teachers. One week of the failed policy in Iraq is the cost. We \ncould do all of this for our teachers for the cost of a single week in \nIraq, but the President says no.\n  The bill that he vetoed included $7 billion to provide high-quality \nearly education through Head Start. Yesterday, the Senate approved a \nHead Start bill to strengthen the program and make Head Start even \nbetter. The bill goes a long way in strengthening the quality of the \npersonnel, tying Head Start to kindergarten and other education \nprograms in the States and consolidating all the various programs in \nthe States that are available to children to make them more effective. \nEach of these improvements make an enormous difference in the lives of \nHead Start children. Funds the President vetoed would be used to build \na basic foundation for learning that will help low-income and minority \nchildren for the rest of their lives. We can improve this foundation \nfor the cost of a little more than 2 weeks in Iraq.\n  But even as we work in Congress to improve this vital program, the \nPresident says no. No, no, no to this program, no to the Head Start \nchildren. We are only reaching half of those who are eligible for the \nprogram at this time. We have over 4 million poor children under the \nage of 5 in the United States of America; we only reach 1 million of \nthem. We all know what a difference early intervention makes for \nchildren in education. It is critically important for us to continue \nstrengthening the academic programs, socio-emotional support, and \nhealth services delivered through Head Start and yet the President \ncontinues to say no.\n  The same misguided rationale applies to other investments in this \nbill. The President's choices cast aside urgently needed research on \nheart disease, diabetes, asthma, infectious disease, and mental health, \nand many other areas that could find cures and bring relief to millions \nof our fellow citizens.\n  This chart shows $4.9 billion in cancer research which would fund \nover 6,800 grants; diabetes research, pandemic flu, with all the \ndangers we are facing with the potential for a pandemic flu--that is \nnecessary--support for the CDC, one of the prime health agencies to \nhelp protect Americans. It does such a good job in terms of \nimmunizations and community health centers, which is a lifeline for 15 \nmillion of our fellow citizens, so many of whom have lost their health \ninsurance. And the answer is no to those individuals.\n  It is true, in terms of American workers, the President rejects \nfunding to enforce the labor laws that keep workers safe and to give \nthem a level playing field. Instead, the President's veto takes bad \nemployers off the hook and puts the safety and lives of American \nworkers at risk. The President's choices are devastating to veterans as \nwell. Listen to this, Mr. President. Each year nearly 320,000 brave \nservicemen return to civilian life, many coming from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Tens of thousands--here is the chart. These are the \nreturning veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. Tens of thousands of \nreservists and National Guard have lost their benefits and even their \njobs because they served their country. That is why the appropriations \nbill provided $228 million to help veterans find jobs, obtain training, \nand protect their right to return to former jobs. They are guaranteed \nnow under existing law, but what is happening is that law is not being \nimplemented. We found that three-quarters of returning veterans do not \neven know about their rights and, in many instances, they are losing \ntheir jobs, they are losing their overtime pay, and they are losing \ntheir pensions. That is why today one out of four homeless people in \nthe United States is a former veteran. The bill we approved would help \naddress this issue, but that was also vetoed.\n  The bill we will have a chance to vote on tomorrow in the Senate, \nwhich was approved by the House of Representatives yesterday, also \ntakes an important step in reining in the Bush administration's use of \ntorture. It is difficult to believe that in this day and age, Congress \nneeds to legislate against the use of torture to prevent the President \nof the United States from abusing prisoners. Torture and cruel, \ninhuman, and\n\n[[Page S14462]]\n\ndegrading treatment are already prohibited by law. Yet, once again, we \nmust legislate, not because the conduct we would prohibit is somehow \nunlawful, but because the Bush administration continues to twist and \ndistort existing law in its misguided, immoral interrogation practices.\n  The Nation was shocked by the horrible images from Abu Ghraib prison, \nand America was shamed in the eyes of the world. The administration \ntried to whitewash the episode by blaming it on low-level soldiers, but \nthe truth about our use of torture couldn't be concealed. Led by \nPresident Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \nand Attorney General Gonzales, the administration had set a course that \nundermined fundamental American values in the craven belief that \ntorture could somehow make us more secure.\n  Our interrogators were authorized to shackle prisoners in stress \npositions, induce hypothermia, and use sleep deprivation, extend \nisolation, bombardment with lights and loud music, and even now the \ninfamous practice of waterboarding. The Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel--listen to this, Mr. President--the Justice Department's \nOffice of Legal Counsel gave its approval to the legality of these \npractices in the morally outrageous Bybee torture memorandum. The Bybee \ntorture memorandum was in place for more than 2\\1/2\\ years until Mr. \nGonzales appeared before the Judiciary Committee when he wanted to be \nthe Attorney General of the United States. He could look over that \ncommittee and tell that if he had to defend that memorandum, he would \nnever make it, and he was right.\n  What happened? The administration repealed the Bybee torture \nmemorandum, and Mr. Gonzales got through the Judiciary Committee, \nalthough there were more than 40 votes in the Senate against his \nconfirmation.\n  Under the Bybee memorandum, if the President approved the use of \ntorture, no one could be prosecuted for breaking our Nation's laws or \ninternational obligations.\n  Do my colleagues understand? Under the Bybee memorandum, if you were \ngoing to prosecute an individual for using torture, you had to \ndemonstrate a specific intent that the purpose of the torture in which \nyou were involved was not to gain information but just to harm the \nindividual. Unless a prosecutor would be able to demonstrate that the \npurpose of torturing an individual was not to gain information, you \nwere effectively let off, free.\n  As the distinguished Dean of Yale Law School, Dr. Koh, said, it was \nthe worst piece of legal reasoning he had seen in the history of \nstudying laws in the United States and legal opinions.\n  The administration withdrew the Bybee memo in embarrassment when it \nbecame public. Indeed, the now-Attorney General Mukasey refused to \ndenounce waterboarding as torture.\n  Only leaders who fail to understand the founding principles of \nAmerica could approve such behavior. Our country needs to stand beyond \nreproach for the sanctity of each individual, for freedom, for justice, \nfor the rule of law. But the administration turned its back on all \nthese traditions and on the ideals of America itself.\n  In 2005, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act to ensure that \nall interrogations conducted by the Department of Defense would comply \nwith the Army Field Manual, a comprehensive and effective approach to \ninterrogation that prohibits the use of torture and cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading techniques in favor of techniques that are most likely to be \neffective in gaining necessary information.\n  LTG John Kimmons said, when releasing the manual:\n\n       No good intelligence is going to come from abusive \n     practices. I think history tells us that. I think the \n     empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tells \n     us that. The Manual itself tells us that the use of torture \n     is not only illegal, but also it is a poor technique that \n     yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection \n     efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks \n     the [interrogator] wants to hear.\n\n  Last May, General Petraeus echoed these statements in a letter to all \nour servicemembers in Iraq saying that ``torture and other expedient \nmethods to obtain information'' are not only illegal and immoral, but \nalso generally ``neither useful nor necessary.''\n  We now know, however, that the 2005 act left open a loophole that \nundermines the basic safeguards against torture and cruel and degrading \ntreatment. We applied the field manual to the Department of Defense, \nbut not to the CIA.\n  Last year in the Military Commissions Act, Congress left it to the \nPresident to define by Executive order the interrogation practices that \nwould bind all Government interrogators, including the CIA. The \nPresident's Executive order drove a Mack truck through this small \nloophole. The vague terms of the order permit many of the most heinous \ninterrogation practices.\n  The provisions of the bill we will have an opportunity of voting on \ntomorrow closed that loophole. They require that all U.S. \ninterrogations, including those conducted by the CIA, conform to the \nArmy Field Manual. This very simple and easily implemented reform means \nno more waterboarding, no more use of dogs or other extreme practices \nprohibited by the Manual. There will still be great flexibility in use \nof interrogation methods and our interrogators will be able to \neffectively get the required information, but torture will be off the \ntable.\n  This bill is an opportunity to restate our commitment to the ideals \nand security of our Nation. It is an opportunity to repair the damage \ndone to our reputation by the scandal of Abu Ghraib and the abuses of \nGuantanamo. It is an opportunity to restore our Nation as the beacon \nfor human rights, fair treatment, and the rule of law. It is an \nopportunity to protect our brave service men and women, both in and out \nof uniform, from similar tactics. It is a simple but vital step in \nreturning our Nation to the rule of law and the ideals on which America \nwas founded, and it deserves to be enacted into law as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Subprime Lending Crisis\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to express my \nstrong support for modernization of the Federal Housing Administration. \nAs you know, there is a serious financial issue affecting a lot of \nAmericans. The subprime lending crisis is driving up foreclosure rates \nin Florida and across the country.\n  The problem is that from 2004 to 2006, financial institutions gave a \nlot of people mortgages they could not afford. These were low-interest, \nnothing-down, sometimes no-document loans that made the initial monthly \npayment very affordable. But because these were adjustable rate \nmortgages, a lot of people soon found themselves in a lot of financial \ntrouble. After 24 months, or whenever the initial low downpayment \nperiod was over, the next market-driven rates set in and monthly \nmortgage payments climbed substantially.\n  Another factor compounding the problem, especially in places such as \nFlorida, is that housing prices are stagnant or declining. So with no \nequity, higher monthly payments, and no chance to sell without taking a \nsubstantial loss, a lot of homeowners who have subprime loans are \nfinding themselves in the perfect storm and, sadly, they are facing \nfinancial foreclosure.\n  Imagine the heartbreak of a family losing a home to foreclosure. \nAbout 2 million families in America are in that predicament today. This \nsummer we saw the first wave of foreclosures, and because of the lag \ntime between interest rate adjustments, we are likely to see another \nwave before too long. But the good news is that there is a strong \npublic-private partnership offering help.\n\n  The Federal Housing Administration is offering certain homeowners an \noption to refinance their existing mortgages so they can make their \npayments and keep their homes. Additionally, FHA is coordinating a wide \nvariety of groups that offer foreclosure counseling. This is to \nidentify homeowners before they face hardships, help them to understand \ntheir financial options, and allow them to find a mortgage product that \nworks for them.\n  I commend President Bush and Housing Secretary Alphonso Jackson for\n\n[[Page S14463]]\n\nstepping in to help with this difficult situation. I also commend the \nprivate institutions that are helping families avoid foreclosure. But \nwhere we need more action right now is right here in the Congress.\n  I am pleased we have put together a bipartisan FHA reform bill that \nwill lower downpayment requirements, allow FHA to insure bigger loans, \nand give FHA more pricing flexibility. These reforms will empower FHA \nto reach more families that need help. It would also help first-time \nhome buyers, minorities, and those with low to moderate incomes.\n  Over the past 72 years, FHA has been a mortgage industry leader, \nhelping more than 34 million Americans become homeowners at no cost to \nthe taxpayer. With this legislation, we build an even better program \nthat complements conventional mortgage products and allows FHA to \ncontinue to serve hard-working and creditworthy Americans.\n  I commend Senators Dodd and Shelby for their leadership on this issue \nin the Banking Committee. The legislation we have before us is the \nresult of a lot of time and dedication from members of that Senate \nBanking Committee. It isn't an easy process to get legislation through \nthis committee, but it is a fair one. With this legislation, we have \nthe opportunity to use the resources of the Federal Government in a \nreasonable and responsible manner in order to mitigate against future \nhome losses.\n  As former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, I know this \nprogram well, and I would ask my colleagues who may have questions or \nconcerns with this legislation to talk to me about it. I would love to \ntell you why this is a good idea for America.\n  I would also add that Senators Dodd and Shelby and I have worked hand \nin hand with the administration throughout this process, and that this \nlegislation that was reported from the Banking Committee--and, as I \nsaid, has bipartisan support--also enjoys the support of the President \nand the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In fact, I have a \nletter from Secretary Jackson to Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member \nShelby dated September 19 expressing enthusiastic support for the bill.\n  This is a bill that will help families. At a time when America seems \nto be looking to Congress for answers on issues from energy to the \ncrisis that is going on with the foreclosure problem, to so many other \nissues, here is a time when we can come together and get something done \nthat is good for the American people.\n  To make the argument this legislation has not been given due \ndeliberation is both unfair and unfounded. FHA reform is an issue that \nhas been debated here in Congress for many years. In fact, I know we \ndebated this issue here when I was Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  The Banking Committee has had hearings and Members have been an \nactive part of the process. At the markup in September, members voted \n21 to 1 in favor of reporting the legislation from committee. I believe \nthe one Senator who did object in committee now supports the \nlegislation.\n  So, again, I ask my colleagues to take a good look at the merits of \nthis legislation and support our efforts to provide hard-working, \ncreditworthy Americans with an avenue to safe, sound, and affordable \nmortgage lending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Senator Byrd\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor the \nPresident pro tempore, our great friend, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia. Senator Byrd will celebrate his 90th birthday next Tuesday. \nIn Alaska, we call this a significant milepost. Milestones in Alaska \nget covered with snow too often.\n  I remember watching from the gallery in 1959 when Senator Byrd took \noffice. I was a member of the Eisenhower administration at the time. He \nhad been here for nearly a decade by the time I came to the Senate in \n1968. Senator Byrd and I have worked together on the Appropriations \nCommittee now for 36 years. We have each chaired that committee and we \nhave each had the honor of becoming the President pro tempore. He has \nbeen President pro tempore twice.\n  Senator Byrd has been called a symbol of our history, and those of us \nwho served with him, and continue to serve with him, rely on his \nknowledge of the Senate and its history and traditions. I wish I had \nthe time to go into some of the times I have listened to Senator Byrd \nrecite poems or history, or tell of his times of researching the \nhistory of the Roman Senate. I served as the whip here for 8 years when \nSenator Byrd was giving his history lessons, and it was my honor to sit \nhere and listen to those history lessons, and I learned a great deal \nfrom him.\n  His devotion to the Senate and to those of us who serve with him are \nreasons for us to call him the patriarch of the Senate family. I know \nof no one who has done so much to keep the spirit of the family alive \nin the Senate. Over the years, Senator Byrd has come to the floor many \ntimes to honor me personally and to honor my family. He comforted me \nhere on the floor when my wife Ann passed away. He comforted me in \ntimes of sorrow; he comforted me in times of joy.\n  He came to me on the day I first became a grandfather. And I will \nnever forget that, because he gave a speech about the meaning of \nbecoming a grandfather, and he told me I had my first taste of \nimmortality because I was a grandfather. Those words have stayed with \nme for a long time. I now have 11 grandchildren, but I will never \nforget that speech about the first one.\n  I also remember the kind remarks he has made to me on many other \noccasions. He came to the floor and offered congratulations of the \nSenate when I remarried, and he came again when Catherine and I had our \nfirst daughter, our only child, Lilly. Earlier this year, he came to \nthe floor to congratulate Lilly on her graduation from law school. And \nwith Lilly, I remember when she was young and a baby, and I was the \nwhip, we had a birthday party for Lilly every year here, and Senator \nByrd never missed one of those. He became Uncle Robert to Lilly. He has \nhad a marvelous relationship with the children of Senators who have \nserved with him.\n  The nurturing and caring quality that Senator Byrd has brought to \nthis Chamber for so many years reminds us we are a family. We had the \nsad occasion to gather with him and support him when he lost his \nbeloved wife. But I have come here today to congratulate the Senator \nfrom West Virginia not only for his service to our Nation and to the \nSenate, but for his longevity. He is the only Senator who is older than \nI am, and I thank him for his friendship and for all he has done for me \nand my family personally.\n  Catherine and I wish him a very happy birthday, and we hope the \nSenate will join in extending to the President pro tempore our sincere \ncongratulations on his birthday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                         National Adoption Day\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be \nrecognized to speak for a moment with my colleague Senator Coleman on \nNational Adoption Day, which is this Saturday.\n  Before I do that, let me thank the Senator from Alaska, the senior \nSenator, for his beautiful remarks relative to our other colleague from \nWest Virginia, a man whom we have all come to know and love and respect \nfor his years and quality of service to this body and to our country. \nMany of us will have other words to say on behalf of Senator Byrd on \nhis birthday, which is coming up very soon.\n  I wanted to come to the floor with my colleague from Minnesota to \nspeak about a very important issue that we try to remember and reflect \non through the whole month of November, but particularly on National \nAdoption Day on November 17. I also wanted to take this opportunity to \nremind ourselves of the importance of family and the laws we try to \npass here in Congress to encourage families to be strengthened and \nexpanded through the miracle of adoption.\n  Many Members of Congress, including myself, are adoptive parents. We \nhave personally experienced the joy of building our families through \nadoption. We are proud promoters of this practice that is not uniquely \nAmerican, but is embraced by Americans in a way\n\n[[Page S14464]]\n\nthat it is not embraced in most countries in the world. And we are \nproud of that. In America, we like to believe it is not the color of \nour skin or even being from the same part of the world that makes a \nfamily. It is a bond, a love that can be shared between people and \nfamilies and children, even if those children are of a different race \nor a different background. It is a very unique aspect of America that \nis quite open and quite extraordinary.\n  In America, we adopt many children, thousands of children. Over the \nlast decade, the numbers have increased every year, in good measure due \nto the work that has been done in the United States, right here in \nCongress.\n  Let me back up a minute to say that, obviously, our ultimate hope and \nwish is that all children could stay with their birth families. In an \nideal world, you would want all children born in every country, every \nday and every year, to be able to be born into families who want them, \ncan care for them, can nurture them, and will stay whole and permanent. \nBut we know in the reality of the world in which we live, that is not \npossible. War, famine, disease, addiction, violence, and gross neglect \nseparate families, separate children from their birth parents every \nday.\n  I think it is one of our primary responsibilities as responsible, \nfunctioning governments, particularly democracies, to do what we can to \nconnect those children who are separated from that special bond with a \nbirth parent to another nurturing, loving adult as quickly as possible. \nIt would seem that the most natural thing in the world is to understand \nthat a child without a parent is very vulnerable. Even children with \nparents who are educated and able to navigate through life still have \ngreat challenges. So, you can imagine the vulnerability of children \nwith no parents to protect them, alone to raise themselves. Children \ndon't do that very well. And governments don't raise children. Human \nbeings--parents--do. So we need to do our best.\n  We are working at it, but we have a long way to go. That is why every \nNovember, our Presidents, President Clinton, and before him President \nBush, take a minute, as our current President will tomorrow at the \nWhite House, to acknowledge that November in America is National \nAdoption Month. We focus the attention of our country on our efforts \nand we congratulate ourselves on our progress, but there is still a \ngap. We have 514,000 children who have been removed from their birth \nfamilies and placed in the care of the community, in foster care. \nToday, over 115,000 of these children are waiting to be adopted, and \nthe majority of their parents already have had their parental rights \nterminated. These children are waiting to be placed in a permanent \nfamily through adoption, whether kinship or regular, or long-term \nguardianship.\n  So I come to the floor today to recognize some of these children who \nare waiting today, and to say that while we are making progress, we \nhave some beautiful children who are still waiting to be adopted. There \nare many misconceptions about some of the children who are in our \npublic child welfare and foster care systems. The survey recently \nconducted by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption indicated that the \nmajority of Americans mistakenly believe that many of the children in \nfoster care are ``juvenile delinquents.'' According to the survey, an \nunbelievable number of Americans, have thought about adopting a child \nfrom foster care, but because of their misperception that there is \nsomething wrong with these children, that they are damaged goods, they \nback up or they back away.\n\n  The facts will show that it is not the children who are in foster \ncare who are delinquent. It was a problem from the parental end; that \nthe parents somehow failed to step up or were unable to step up. These \nchildren are not damaged goods. They are doing beautifully in school. \nMany grow up to be quite successful, but they, like all children, need \nparents and protection.\n  This is a young girl, Natalyia, who is 8 years old. She has been in \nfoster care since 2001 and is one of the children in Louisiana who is \nwaiting to be adopted.\n  This is two siblings. Sometimes a child is an only child and \nsometimes a child has brothers and sisters. I am one of nine children. \nI know, Mr. President, you came from a fairly large family. Sometimes \nthe unfortunate thing is that parents walk away, or disease or violence \nseparates them from groups of children.\n  These are two young boys, Terron and Montrell, who are about 7 and 8 \nyears old. They are in foster care in Louisiana, looking for parents \nhere in the United States.\n  This is two other brothers who have been in foster care for a while. \nTheir names are Ronnie and Kody. They are 11 and 13 years old, also \nlooking for a family here in the United States.\n  We have thousands and thousands of children of all ages in the United \nStates looking for families. We have millions of orphans around the \nworld. As I said, there are tens of thousands of children right here in \nthe United States who are waiting to be adopted. I am proud of the laws \nwe have tried to pass here on the floor of the Senate, giving \nappropriate tax credits and providing other opportunities for children \nto move into loving and permanent families.\n  I think our time is limited. I don't want to take any more time, but \nI ask unanimous consent to allow the Senator from Minnesota to finish \nup our talk here on the Senate floor, to acknowledge National Adoption \nDay and National Adoption Month, and then turn to the leadership, if I \ncould.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if my friend from Minnesota \nwill be kind enough to allow the two leaders to engage in a little work \nhere on the floor? As soon as we finish, he would retain the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I graciously yield the floor to the two \nleaders.\n  Mr. REID. My friend is gracious in everything he does. I appreciate \nthat so much.\n\n\n    Conditional Recess or Adjournment of the Two Houses of Congress\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto H. Con. Res. 259, the adjournment resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nconcurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 259) providing for a \n     conditional adjournment of the House of Representatives and a \n     conditional recess or adjournment of the Senate.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could \nthe majority leader tell me what the schedule is likely to be for \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We will do a unanimous consent request in a minute for \nyour approval or disapproval. What we are going to do is come in in the \nmorning. I want to come in early because of requests from both your \nside and my side that we vote first on an Iraq matter that the minority \nhas brought to the floor; then we would vote on a motion to proceed to \nthe bridge bill that the House voted on last night; and then we would \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the farm bill. At that time, \nhopefully, we would be ready to wind things down until after \nThanksgiving.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the current resolution be agreed to \nand the motion be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 259) was considered and \nagreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution reads as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 259\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That when the House adjourns on the legislative \n     day of Thursday, November 15, 2007, or Friday, November 16, \n     2007, on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent \n     resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee, it stand \n     adjourned until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, December 4, 2007, or until \n     the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this \n     concurrent resolution, whichever occurs first; and that when \n     the Senate recesses or adjourns on any day from Thursday, \n     November 15, 2007, through Thursday, November 29, 2007, on a \n     motion offered pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its \n     Majority Leader or his designee, it stand recessed or \n     adjourned until noon on Monday,\n\n[[Page S14465]]\n\n     December 3, 2007, or such other time on that day as may be \n     specified by its Majority Leader or his designee in the \n     motion to recess or adjourn, or until the time of any \n     reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent \n     resolution, whichever occurs first.\n       Sec. 2.  The Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader \n     of the Senate, or their respective designees, acting jointly \n     after consultation with the Minority Leader of the House and \n     the Minority Leader of the Senate, shall notify the Members \n     of the House and the Senate, respectively, to reassemble at \n     such place and time as they may designate if, in their \n     opinion, the public interest shall warrant it.\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote \nat 9:30 a.m. tomorrow on the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to \nS. 2340, the Senate Iraq Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill; if \ncloture is not invoked, the Senate then vote on cloture on the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment \nAppropriations bill; if that cloture is not invoked, the Senate then \nvote on cloture on the substitute amendment to the farm bill; I further \nask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on H.R. 2419, the \nunderlying bill, be delayed to occur, if needed, upon the adoption of \nthe substitute amendment; I further ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor debate prior to the first vote be equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees; that the last 10 minutes be reserved for \nthe two leaders, with the majority controlling the last 5 minutes; and \nthat there be 2 minutes for debate before the second and third votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is my intention to come in in the \nmorning at 8:30. That would allow any Senators who wish to talk about \nthe farm bill and Iraq to do that tonight and in the morning we have a \nfew speakers and you would have some speakers, and that should conclude \nthe events tomorrow. I think we need to come in early because we have \nhad a number of requests, as you know.\n  I do say this, I appreciate the understanding of my friends on the \nother side. As they know, there is a debate tonight of all Democratic \nPresidential candidates, and they needed to be here in the morning. \nThat is required. They probably needed the time anyway, but I couldn't \npush forward on that tonight, especially with the debate starting in 2 \nhours in Las Vegas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say a couple of things before the \ndistinguished Republican leader leaves. We had a brief conversation \nhere in the well of the Senate a couple of minutes ago. I am \ndisappointed we cannot proceed to the Transportation appropriations \nbill. The President tells us he wants bills. We do everything we can, \nand it is difficult to get them done, but we have now completed an \nextremely difficult conference. It has been open. Republicans have \nparticipated. I am not going to go into the details of the bill, but it \nis a transportation bill. It deals with such important parts of \nAmerica's infrastructure which are so desperately needed.\n  I hope, I say to my friend, that maybe before we leave here tomorrow \nthere will be another thought given to this. It would be nice if we \ncould send this bill to the President and do it before we leave here \nfor recess. Senator Bond and Senator Murray on our side, the managers \nof this bill, have worked very hard trying to get everything done. They \nworked today. We got a hold on it here taken off. Somebody objected \nhere. We took that off. I am so grateful for their hard work, their \nbipartisan work on this legislation.\n  I do say this, Senator Bond, who has been one of the members of the \nAppropriations Committee for some time, has been pretty easy to work \nwith over the years. He has been very reasonable. Senator Murray told \nme he has been extremely reasonable during this most difficult bill. I \nam not going to ask unanimous consent to go forward on it. I have been \ntold by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, there would \nbe an objection. I do feel sorry we have not been able to do that.\n  Finally, I will say a few words on an important issue, breast cancer \nand environmental research. I indicated earlier this year I was going \nto move forward, if necessary, on cloture. There is one Republican \nSenator who has held up this extremely important bill. This legislation \nwould authorize money for 5 years to study the possible links between \nthe development of breast cancer and environment. One key provision in \nthe legislation would create an advisory panel to make recommendations \nabout these grants.\n  Over the past 6 years, this bill has enjoyed very broad, bipartisan \nsupport. During the 109th Congress, this bill was reported out of the \nHELP Committee, but one Senator on the other side, one Republican, \nobjected to our request to pass it.\n  I am bound and determined to pass this legislation. Why I have not \nmoved on it earlier is the following reason: We have gotten great work \non a bipartisan basis out of the HELP Committee. Senators Kennedy and \nEnzi--one would not think they are political soulmates, but they are. \nThey balance each other out. Senator Enzi confided in me--I don't \nnecessarily mean confided in me, but he told me that he was going to \nhave a hearing on this very soon, before the first of the year, to see \nif he could work out the problems the one Senator had. If that in fact \nis the case, this matter could be brought out of the committee to the \nfloor and passed very quickly rather than my taking a week or so on the \nlegislation. So I want all those who are so concerned about this \nlegislation to know I have not forgotten about it, but based on Senator \nEnzi's representations, I am not going to try to invoke cloture on this \nbill at this time. If we do not get something done during the first few \nmonths of the next year, we will do that. Hopefully we can pass it in \nDecember.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, could the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am listening carefully to what you \nsaid. I am here on the floor working very hard trying to get the \nTransportation and Housing bill to the President, as he has asked us to \ndo. We worked together in a strong bipartisan way. All of the \nRepublicans and all the Democrats in both the House and Senate signed \nthe conference committee report. This is critical infrastructure. I \nnote the Senator from Minnesota is on the floor. He had a bridge \ncollapse in his State. We have had a housing crisis we addressed within \nthis bill. We know airport expansion is a critical infrastructure \npiece. I see the Senator from Louisiana is on the floor. There is very \nimportant infrastructure there.\n  If I heard the Senator correctly, we are not going to be able to move \nforward on this critical piece of legislation that only has one hurdle \nleft to get to the White House. If I could, in effect, clarify it, my \nunderstanding is there is an objection and we will not be able to move \nit past the final hurdle?\n  Mr. REID. I answer to my friend who has done such an outstanding job \non this bill, as she does on everything, this bill did have in it $195 \nmillion to replace I-35 West, the bridge in Minneapolis. We all \nwitnessed the tragedy of the collapse of that bridge. A picture is \nworth 1,000 words so I will not give 1,000 words, other than to say I \nask everyone to call up in their mind's eye the devastation that took \nplace when that bridge unexpectedly collapsed. The bill also, I say, \nincludes an additional $1 billion for urgent bridge repairs in all \nStates in the wake of that tragedy. That is only a small part of that \nlegislation and it is unfortunate we couldn't send that to the \nPresident before the recess. We still could, maybe when we get back in \nthe morning, and we could do it before we leave here. That is still \npossible.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I say to the majority leader, I thank him for trying to \nmove forward. I hope our minority leader will work with his caucus to \ntry to help us move this forward. It is critical infrastructure that \nthousands of communities are counting on this week, heading for a \njampacked Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone is going to realize the impact \nof not investing in our infrastructure. I hope we can continue to try \nto work something out.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3996\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Republican leader, may turn to the consideration \nof H.R.\n\n[[Page S14466]]\n\n3996, the Tax Extender/AMT bill, and that it be considered under the \nfollowing limitations: that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided \nbetween Senators Baucus and Grassley or their designees prior to a \ncloture vote on the bill; if cloture is invoked, there be no amendments \nin order to the bill; if cloture is defeated, there then be 1 hour for \ndebate on Senator Lott's amendment No. 3620, providing for AMT repeal \nand 1-year extension of expiring tax provisions; that following that \nvote there be 1 hour for debate on Senator Baucus's amendment providing \nfor a 1-year AMT patch and a 2-year extension of expiring tax \nprovisions with the cost of the expiring tax provisions offset; that \neach amendment vote would require 60 votes in the affirmative; that \nfollowing those votes, if an amendment is agreed to, the bill be read a \nthird time and the Senate vote immediately, without any intervening \naction or debate, on final passage of the bill. If neither amendment \nachieves 60 votes and cloture is not invoked on the bill, then the bill \nbe returned to the calendar; if cloture is invoked on the bill, then \nthe Senate proceed to complete action on the bill under the provisions \nof rule XXII.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know Senators Grassley and Baucus are here to \ndiscuss this issue. I believe the majority leader knows I am going to \nbe offering another alternative consent agreement to his here \nmomentarily. I ask we both be allowed to do our respective consent \nagreements and then let others discuss the AMT.\n  Bearing that in mind, Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senate Republicans have time and time \nagain voted to reform and repeal the alternative minimum tax, a stealth \ntax that was promulgated in 1969 to ensure some 155 wealthy Americans \npaid at least some level of Federal tax but which today threatens to \nentrap more than 20 million American taxpayers this year alone.\n  I know the majority leader shares my desire to fix the alternative \nminimum tax and to extend other expiring tax provisions later this \nyear. In fact, as the IRS has told us, the inexplicable inaction at \nthis point has already the potential to wreak havoc on the tax-filing \nseason. I have been encouraging my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to work with us to do this for quite some time.\n  So both my friend, the majority leader, and I know this is an issue \nthat must be addressed. That is common ground, and that is good. But \nlet's be clear. Republicans want to extend the alternative minimum tax \npatch and expiring tax provisions without increasing taxes on other \nAmericans. Furthermore, we want to protect 90 million American \ntaxpayers, including small business owners, from a massive tax increase \nthat will soon take effect if Congress does not act to extend rate \nreductions contained in the tax relief measures we passed in 2001 and \n2003.\n  I would suggest that there are fundamental differences of opinion \nbetween the two parties on tax policy. This is not a surprise; we all \nknow this. And it is a debate we have been having for years. But on \nthis there is much we can agree on. Let's begin with a base bill that \naccomplishes what is noncontroversial, what we mutually agree upon; \nthat is, extending the AMT patch for 1 year and extending expiring tax \nprovisions for 2 years.\n  In view of the differences between the parties on tax increases, \nlet's allow two amendments per side to be in order, each of our own \nchoosing. I can tell you now that our amendments will be focused on \nensuring tens of millions of Americans do not face tax increases. While \nI would not presume to tell my friend, the majority leader, what \namendments his side should offer, I would suggest it would be an \nexcellent opportunity for him to offer the tax increases that are \nincluded in the Baucus proposal and the Rangel AMT bill as passed by \nthe House as the other. Since we object to the majority's efforts to \nincrease taxes, as they apparently will object to our efforts to extend \ntax relief, let's require that all amendments be subjected to a 60-vote \nhurdle.\n  In summary, I propose we start with common ground and say \ncontroversial pay-fors and add-ons must get 60 votes.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, with the \nconcurrence of the Republican leader, may turn to the consideration of \nH.R. 3996; provided further that there then be a substitute amendment \nin order, the text of which is the 1-year alternative minimum tax fix \nwith a 2-year extenders package without the tax-raising offsets; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that each side be allocated four tax-\nrelated amendments to be offered to the substitute, and that each \namendment under this order and passage of the underlying bill require \n60 votes for adoption or passage as the case may be.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, during the \npast 7 years, we have had an interesting financial program in this \ncountry led by President Bush; that is, spend whatever you want, just \nuse a credit card. That is, he wants new programs. He has had plenty. \nJust write out one of the IOUs that came from the credit card. Or if \nyou want to reduce taxes, do not pay for it, just call for the credit \ncard, which it seems the limit on that never runs out, just more and \nmore.\n  When this man, this man, President Bush, took office, there was a $7 \ntrillion surplus over 10 years. Now there is a deficit of $9 trillion. \nThat is what the Bush fiscal policy has done to this country.\n  We in this Democratic-controlled Congress believe things should be \npaid for. We have done that working with the House on everything. We \nbelieve we are going to do our very best to do it on this legislation.\n  But I would suggest to my friend that one of the requests I had is \nthat we vote on--have every opportunity to vote on--what the House sent \nus.\n  But without belaboring the point, I think we have two different ways \nof how this Government should run. One should be on a pay-go basis. If \nyou want to increase spending, you pay for it. If you want to cut \ntaxes, pay for that. For 7 years the Republicans have not agreed with \nthat. As a result of that, we find ourselves in a difficult situation. \nSo I respectfully object to my friend's request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I regret that the Republican side has \nobjected to the request offered by the majority leader. But I am very \npleased, frankly, with the objection by the majority leader to the \nminority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator from Montana would \nsuspend for just a moment.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota had the floor for a few minutes before the leadership.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleagues to indulge me \na little because this is an important subject on the issue at hand. I \nask their indulgence for 5 minutes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friends. Mr. President, the goal is to try to \nfix the alternative minimum tax and to try to get these tax extenders \npassed. The goal is not to relitigate the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which \nI think would be the subject of the amendments that the minority side \nwould offer if their consent requests were granted. We are not here to \nrelitigate that; we are here to figure out some way to make sure this \nCongress allows the alternative minimum tax patch to pass so Americans \ndo not have to pay an alternative minimum tax for tax year 2007, which \nis the goal.\n  I am very disappointed, frankly, that we are not allowed to get to \nthat point because the other side objected to the request offered by \nthe majority leader to set up a series of votes which would enable us \nto get to that point--namely, where this body could pass the \nlegislation, probably an amendment by Senator Grassley and myself--\nwhich would accomplish most of the objectives by the other side; \nnamely, dealing with the alternative minimum tax, not paid for, but pay \nfor the extenders.\n  That would have been the third vote if we were to get there; that is, \nif the\n\n[[Page S14467]]\n\nminority party allowed us to get there. But, apparently, they do not \ncare about that. Apparently, they do not care about the alternative \nminimum tax. Apparently, they want to relitigate the 2001 tax cuts, the \n2003 tax cuts, to have it extended with mischievous amendments.\n  I remind my colleagues we are here today because back in 1969, \nCongress passed the alternative minimum tax because so many wealthy \ntaxpayers were not paying any taxes. So we passed AMT. But we made a \nmistake, frankly; we did not index it. And lo and behold, after all of \nthese years, now taxpayers between $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 of \nincome, many of them are going to have to pay the alternative minimum \ntax very soon.\n  But, ironically, it is the most wealthy taxpayers in America who are \nnot affected by the alternative minimum tax. It does not hit them. It \ndoes not affect them. It does not affect the most wealthy. It just \naffects those with incomes between, say, $100,000 and $200,000 in \nincome.\n  Why does it not affect the most wealthy? Because on the alternative \nminimum tax, the capital gains rates are not the alternative minimum \ntax rates, rather the capital gains rates under the AMT are the regular \ncapital gains rates, and most wealthy people get most of their income \npaying capital gains taxes because their income is passive rather than \nordinary income.\n  So it is a bad provision, the AMT, and we have to fix it. And mark my \nwords, we are going to try to find a way to fix it because it has to be \nfixed. I am very disappointed, frankly, that the other side would not \nlet us fix it now. It is important we fix it now because the IRS is \ngoing to send out forms. The programmers who do the programming for the \nTax Code, for the tax provisions in the Tax Code, have to get the right \nprograms out to the American people.\n  If we dally, if we wait--it looks as if now we are going to wait \nuntil certainly after Thanksgiving. It looks as if probably we have to \nwait to the end of the year. Who knows when? Maybe the day before \nChristmas. That is not the way to do business. So we will find a time. \nWe can bring up legislation to make sure there is a so-called AMT \npatch, that we do not have AMT affect taxpayers for this year. And we \nalso have to bring up these so-called extender provisions.\n  I think we should pay for those extenders. But we may not be paying \nfor the AMT, and that was going to be the third amendment that was \ngoing to be offered today so we can get moving. But I guess that is \ngoing to come up another day. I am very disappointed we are not there.\n  Mr. President, the journalist Norman Cousins once said: ``Wisdom \nconsists of the anticipation of consequences.''\n  By this or any measure, the alternative minimum tax is the most \nunwise of policy. Congress plainly did not anticipate the AMT's \nconsequences. And the wise course now is plainly to stop it from \nincreasing the taxes of millions of Americans.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1969 created the AMT. Congress saw that under \nthe tax code of that time, 155 high-income households took advantage of \nso many tax benefits that they owed little or no income tax. So \nCongress responded with the AMT.\n  But Congress did not anticipate the consequences. Notably, Congress \nfailed to index the AMT for inflation. And now an increasing number of \nmiddle-income Americans are finding themselves subject to this tax.\n  Now, the AMT punishes people for having children. The AMT punishes \npeople for paying high State taxes. And the AMT punishes people with \ncomplexity.\n  And many taxpayers who owe the AMT do not realize it until they \nprepare their returns. Worse yet, many do not realize it until they get \na letter from the IRS. Many never see it coming.\n  Listen to what the Congressional Budget Office has reported:\n\n       [I]f nothing is changed, one in five taxpayers will have \n     AMT liability and nearly every married taxpayer with income \n     between $100,000 and $500,000 will owe the alternative tax.\n\n  But oddly enough, the AMT would have less effect on households higher \nup the income scale. Surely these are not the consequences that \nCongress intended.\n  Protecting working families from the alternative minimum tax is my \ntop tax priority this year. And it remains my goal to repeal AMT \naltogether.\n  We could do something about it, today. We have a chance to anticipate \nthe consequences, today. We could enact wiser policy, today.\n  Last week, the House passed the bill that was the subject of the \nunanimous consent request that the Leader just made. It would protect \nmore than 23 million families from a tax increase this year under the \nAMT. It would extend a number of important tax cuts for research, \ncollege expenses, and other priorities. And it is paid for. It is \nfiscally responsible.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement just propounded, the Senate \ncould have acted. If we had agreed to this unanimous consent request, \nwe could have prevented the AMT from wielding its unintended \nconsequences 1 more year.\n  I'm disappointed that the Senate did not consent to consider this \nbill today. But I am not sorry for choosing to protect taxpayers from \nthe AMT, even at some cost. Too many folks are at risk of an unfair tax \nincrease, if Congress fails to act on the AMT.\n  Provisions like the college tuition deduction, State and local sales \ntax relief, and the research and development tax credit are also in \nthis bill. Those provisions make a real difference for America's \nfamilies and businesses. I am disappointed that we were not able to \nextend these expiring provisions. People deserve greater certainty \nabout their tax relief.\n  Now I don't support all of the provisions in the House bill. I would \nnot have written it this way. There are certain targeted provisions \nthat are not strictly extenders that I would not have put in the bill. \nThere are some offsets that I would not have used or that I would write \ndifferently.\n  But I do support tax relief. And I support fiscal responsibility. And \nthis was our chance to both ensure tax relief for 23 million Americans \nand also to avoid saddling our children and grandchildren with debt.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues have insisted that we pay for \nextending the Children's Health Insurance Program. Many have insisted \nthat we pay for extending the farm bill. And many have insisted that we \npay for preventing cuts to doctors under Medicare.\n  Well, if paying-as-you-go is good enough for children's health, if it \nis good enough for America's farmers, and if it is good enough for \nMedicare, then it ought to be good enough for tax cuts, too.\n  So I regret that there has been objection to considering the House-\npassed AMT bill. I regret that those who are objecting have prevented \nus from saving 23 million Americans from the unintended consequences of \nthe AMT. And I regret that those who are objecting have prevented us \nfrom moving forward to enact wiser tax policy.\n\n\n                         National Adoption Day\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I take the opportunity to turn this body \nto the attention of a matter that has bipartisan support that will \nbring us together. There are some very contentious and challenging \nissues that we have to deal with, but what I am going to talk about now \nin the moments I have is something that is not a Democratic or \nRepublican issue. It is an issue that concerns all of us.\n  It was the poet Carl Sandburg who said: Each young child is God's \nopinion that the world should go on. In our busyness and preoccupation \nthat we have with the affairs of state, we should remember there is \nprobably nothing more important to the future than making life better \nfor a child, something we all agree with.\n  I am talking on the floor today to share a simple way we can all do \nthat in the Senate and in the country. I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to join my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in \nsupporting a resolution to recognize National Adoption Day, which is \ncoming up this Saturday, November 17.\n  I would say my colleague from Louisiana brings not only the passion \nand the intellect to this issue, but she brings a lot of heart to the \nissue. And I think that is most powerful. I applaud her for her \nleadership. It is a\n\n[[Page S14468]]\n\npleasure to work with her on issues of adoption.\n  National Adoption Day is an annual series of events designed to draw \nattention to this crucially important social service of uniting kids \nwho need loving families and families who need kids to share their \nlove. Adoption is one of the greatest win-wins because it fulfills two \nof the greatest needs of human kind: receiving and giving love. \nAdoption, since it involves the welfare of the vulnerable children, is \na process that must be handled with care. The challenge is not to make \nit so legalistic and bureaucratically demanding that it keeps needy \nkids apart from worthy families.\n  Many legal professionals and nonprofit agencies put in countless \nhours to facilitate adoption. This is a day to thank them for their \nefforts and focus our attention as a society on what we can do to \ncreate greater opportunities for adoption.\n  Last year, for the first time, National Adoption Day was celebrated \nin all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In total, \nmore than 300 events were held throughout the country to finalize the \nadoptions of more than 3,300 children in foster care and to celebrate \nall families that adopt.\n  This year, the partners are anticipating an even greater number of \nfinalized adoptions as a greater number of cities and communities \nparticipate in NAD events.\n  This Saturday, hundreds of volunteer lawyers, foster care \nprofessionals, child advocates, and local judges will come together to \ncelebrate adoptions and to draw much needed attention to the 114,000 \nchildren in foster care still in need of adoptive homes.\n  I am thankful my friend from Louisiana showed us the faces of those \nkids so we understand it is flesh and blood that we are dealing with.\n  I would like to encourage my colleagues in this Chamber to invest \nmore of their time and effort into this special area of constituent \nservice throughout the year. Each December, my staff and I hold a party \nin Minnesota to gather and celebrate all of the families, Minnesota \nfamilies, that we have assisted in adoption. It is the most joyous \nevent that I participate in. The expressions of love and gratitude are \nsimply overwhelming.\n  One by one, as I see the kids and imagine the circumstances they have \ncome out of to the place where they have found a home, it makes all of \nthe frustrating and seemingly futile hours of this job just melt away.\n  I also thank my colleagues for their support earlier this year in a \nprovision that Senator Landrieu and I championed to ensure adopted \nteenagers who seek an education were not forced to choose between a \nloving family and financial aid for college. Previously, youth who \n``aged out'' of the foster care system qualified for virtually all \nloans and grants, while those who were adopted were essentially \npenalized in terms of college financial aid eligibility. Our measure \nsimply amended the definition of ``independent student'' to include \nfoster care youth who were adopted after their 13th birthday. This will \nensure that a student does not see his or her financial aid eligibility \ndecline as a result of being adopted.\n  Since taking office, I have taken great satisfaction in helping \nhundreds of families navigate the international adoption process. Many \nof my colleagues are aware of the potential crisis relating to the \ncompletion of over 3,000 adoptions between the United States and \nGuatemala.\n  Due to the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry \nAdoption, which is an internal agreement intended to safeguard adopted \nchildren from trafficking, significant and necessary changes are taking \nplace in adoption law in the United States and Guatemala.\n  The Government of Guatemala previously announced their nation will \nimplement The Hague Convention standards as of January 1, 2008, and \nwill require all adoption cases to meet those standards. This would \nhave effectively stopped the processing of all adoption cases with non-\nHague countries, including the United States. The United States is \nexpected to complete Hague implementation this spring. However, in the \nmeantime, it is imperative we work to ensure that families currently in \nthe process of adopting have the ability to continue with that \nadoption. To highlight these concerns, 52 of my Senate colleagues \njoined with Senator Landrieu and me in sending a letter to the \nPresident of Guatemala encouraging an interim measure for pending \nadoption applications in Guatemala. This action by the Guatemalan \nGovernment will help ensure that orphaned children do not remain \noutside the care of a loving family for lengthy periods of time.\n  Additionally, I have been in close contact with the Department of \nState, the Guatemalan Government, and anxious Minnesota families as \nthis issued progressed. The Guatemalan Government is currently debating \nprovisions that would allow U.S. adoptions that are in process to \ncontinue, despite the implementation of The Hague Convention in \nGuatemala. I know that matter was being debated. I received a message \nfrom the State Department. Originally, I thought the measure was \npassed, and then I was told they hadn't. The State Department informs \nme there will be no action taken today, as it was not on the agenda, \nbut both versions of the law are under consideration and do contain \ngrandfather clauses that would protect the in-process cases. This bill \napparently will be coming up next week. We have been in touch with the \nconsular general, with the Ambassador. If no bill is passed, The Hague \nConvention will become effective on December 31. But we have assurances \nfrom senior Government officials responsible for implementation that \npipeline cases will continue to be processed under the old system.\n  I will be traveling to Guatemala right after Thanksgiving in order to \ndiscuss these critical issues with key United States and Guatemalan \nofficials. They have a new President-elect who was elected in November, \nPresident Colom. We will continue to work on this. I will not be \ntraveling alone. Traveling with me will be countless stories of \naffectionate Minnesota families who are hoping to complete this process \nso they can receive and give love. I have also had the privilege of \nworking with families on other international adoptions. Many are \nunaware of the devastating human tragedy of decades of unrest and civil \nwar in Liberia. Recently, I had the honor to escort a new young \nMinnesotan, Miss Patience Carlson, adopted by a Chaska, MN, family to \nthe White House to be in the Oval Office and to meet with the \nPresident. The Carlsons had been within days of completing the adoption \nof their soon-to-be daughter Patience--what a perfect name for this \nyoung lady--when violence broke out in Liberia. As rebel forces moved \ninto Monrovia, the orphanage began to run low on supplies and the \nCarlsons became desperate to unite with their new daughter. It was an \nhonor to work on their behalf with the U.S. Embassy in Liberia to help \ncomplete the adoption.\n  I have traded stories with Senator Landrieu about how we have both \nbeen in those situations. We said we are going to get the kids out of \nthe war zones and do what has to be done. That is the passion she \nbrings.\n  The Carlsons got to meet the President of the United States. I have \noften related the story about an event in northern Minnesota called the \nGreat Think-Off. Scholars, religious leaders, and regular people gather \ntogether to debate the great issues of the day and search for a common \nsolution. One year the question was: What is the ultimate meaning of \nlife? After several days of long-winded attempts by great philosophers \nand professors and others, a young girl who had patiently waited her \nturn went up to the microphone and said: The ultimate meaning of life \nis to do permanent good. She sat down and the meeting was adjourned.\n  Adoption is such a permanent good. It changes the lives of kids who \nhave been through more in their short lives than most people could \nhandle in a lifetime. It changes the lives of parents and siblings who \nmake room in their lives for another, through which they learn the more \nyou love, the more love there is to give.\n  I urge my colleagues and those who read this record to find time to \nreflect on the importance of adoption, visit the Web site at \nwww.nationaladoptionday.org, and find a way they can contribute in a \nsmall way to this unique social service that makes such an important \ndifference in the lives of so many people.\n\n[[Page S14469]]\n\n  I am grateful for the work that the partners of National Adoption Day \ndo. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, the Alliance for \nChildren's Rights; Children's Action Network, Casey Family Services, \nDave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and the Freddie Mac Foundation have \nonce again come together to provide resources, guidance and \nencouragement to the cities planning events this November.\n  In the end we all have a responsibility to make sure the world goes \non and we do that every time we give a child access to the love every \nchild needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to conclude our \npresentation with a few wrap-up remarks. Before my colleague leaves the \nfloor, I wish to say that orphans everywhere have found a bold, brave, \nand articulate champion on their behalf. I am so pleased that Senator \nColeman has joined me as a co-chair of the Adoption Caucus to help lead \nthe 213 Members of Congress who have joined our coalition. As the \nSenator pointed out, it seems that around this place adoption is the \nonly issue on which we can all agree and work so well together. I don't \nknow if it is a tribute to us or to the children who bring us together \nin a very special way. I thank him.\n  The States of Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, \nOklahoma, and Wyoming have more than quadrupled the number of public \nagency adoptions in their States. It takes a lot of effort, not only on \nwhat we do in Congress, but for Governors, legislators, caseworkers, \nsocial workers, and judges. I wish to call those States out today to \nthank them for their extraordinary work. All States are making \nprogress, and we are happy with what the statistics will show. But \nthose seven states are making special progress.\n  Secondly, we want to be sensitive in our movement, if you will, to \nthe role of birth parents and to honor the choices that birth parents \nmake to the process of making good decisions and creating good \noutcomes. Sometimes we focus a lot of attention on the adopted child \nand the adoptive family. I am not sure we spend enough time honoring \nthe role of the birth parents who make this very brave and generous \nchoice. I would like our Congress to be sensitive this coming year to \nwhat we can do to honor and highlight birth parents who also are part \nof that great triangle of adoption.\n  Finally, I urge our State Department to support adoption. I know they \nare preoccupied with many important, significant and grave issues, from \ninternational diplomacy to conducting wars, which are very important \nand consequential actions. However, our State Department has taken 7 \nyears to implement the rules and changes required by the Intercountry \nAdoption Act of 2000 that Congress passed. Every day and every week and \nevery month that these rules are delayed, there are literally thousands \nof children who die. Without these rules, we can't keep open the \navenues of international adoption. I will say this to our critics--\nthere aren't many, but there are a few--every time there is a bad story \nabout someone, maybe an agency, maybe a lawyer, maybe a disreputable \nperson--and you know there are many disreputable people in the world, \nunfortunately--who does something wrong, does not fill out a document \ncorrectly or does not go through the proper procedures, and there is a \nbig scandal in international adoption. The whole system is shut down \nunder the guise of trying to get the ethics right.\n  Nobody is more committed to ethics and adoption than the two of us. \nWe work every day to make it transparent, make it relatively easy, \nreduce the challenges associated with it, and have it meet every law \nand cross every T. However, every time a bank is robbed in this \ncountry, we don't shut down the banking system. We go after the bank \nrobber. We find them and put them in jail. The banking system stays \nopen. Every day people cash checks and deposit money and take money out \nand make loans and keep this economy going. Every time we shut down \nadoptions from a country, millions of children die. That is the \nconsequence of our action. We need to focus on the roots of the \nproblem. We need to find solutions that address the problems and their \ncauses, but which also meet the best needs of the children in that \ncountry. I want the State Department--and I hope they are listening--to \nunderstand that those of us in Congress understand about ethics. We \nunderstand about laws. We want things to be as appropriate and as legal \nas possible. When mistakes are made in a country, the answer is not to \nshut down the adoption of children from there. When we do this, we not \nonly break the hearts of thousands of our constituents who are waiting \nto receive these children and believe they are doing God's will by \ntaking in orphans who would die otherwise and have no one to care for \nthem, we also hurt the children who we are trying to protect. Our State \nDepartment very callously brushes that aside. They are going to hear \nfrom us this year. They need to finalize the rules required by the law \nthat we passed long ago. We need to continue our efforts to improve our \nsystem of international adoption. We have to get the State Department's \nattention. I intend to work with my colleagues to do so.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota. He will be traveling to Guatemala \nover the holidays, which is a great testament to his leadership and \ndedication to helping us do the right thing by the children of \nGuatemala. We pledge to this Congress to give the best leadership we \ncan on an issue that we all can come together on. It is quite \nrefreshing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, more than 3,860 men and women of the \nAmerican military have died in the war in Iraq. At last count, 21 were \nkilled in November alone, and we are only halfway through. In the \nSenate, we are worried about getting out of work in time for \nThanksgiving. In Iraq, they are worried about making it to \nThanksgiving. As I speak today, more than 28,450 American soldiers have \ncome home from Iraq with their lives changed forever by wounds, with \nmissing arms and legs, with traumatic brain injuries that will forever \nalter how they cope with everyday life, with more cases of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder than ever seen before, with life-altering \nblindness that cuts light from their lives forever.\n  As I speak, American taxpayers are footing a $455 billion bill for \nthis war, with long-term estimates soaring well beyond $2 trillion. At \nthe same time, children are going without health care. Students are \nbeing denied proper education. Our bridges are going without repair. \nOur borders are going without being completely secured, and we heard \ntoday of a case in which we still can't get our screening down pat to \nsecure the possibility of someone bringing an explosive device into our \nairports. That is the legacy of the war in Iraq.\n  In the context of this set of grim statistics, while watching images \non television of horrific explosions and bloody bodies, Americans were \nasked at the beginning of the year to accept a so-called surge of our \ntroops into that country, an additional force that was supposed to \nprovide the breathing room for the feuding political factions to \nachieve reconciliation. Those factions, of course, are Iraqi factions.\n  The Bush administration knew that peace could not be achieved solely \nmilitarily, that it had to be achieved politically. The administration \nunilaterally decided that more troops, more weapons, more military \nwould make the political reconciliation happen. So we have to ask: What \nhas been the result? Our men and women of the military have carried out \ntheir mission with unparalleled skill and bravery. They have sacrificed \nlife and limb for their country. That is why we must ask these \nquestions. Because they always respond, no questions asked. But it is \nour obligation to ask for them.\n\n  Through their excellent work, they have achieved results. But has it \nbrought Iraq closer to a lasting peace? Has the political \nreconciliation--the very purpose of the additional troops--been \nachieved? Absolutely not. Absolutely not.\n  The front page of today's Washington Post paints a startling picture, \na picture of the hard truth. Our generals--our generals on the ground--\ntell us\n\n[[Page S14470]]\n\nthat a political settlement remains elusive. In fact, their concern \nover this failure is growing. Let me quote from this morning's article \nin the Washington Post:\n\n       Senior military commanders here now portray the \n     intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the \n     key threat--\n\n  ``As the key threat''--\n\n     facing the U.S. effort in Iraq, rather than al-Qaeda \n     terrorists, Sunni insurgents or Iranian-backed militias.\n\n  Let me read that again.\n\n       Senior military commanders here--\n\n  U.S. military commanders--\n\n     now portray the intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated \n     government as the key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq, \n     rather than al-Qaeda terrorists, Sunni insurgents or Iranian-\n     backed militias.\n\n  So here we are, 6 months into the surge, with more troops in Iraq \nright now--175,000--than ever before, and the main purpose of adding \nthese troops remains just an aspiration, well out of our reach.\n  So I ask my colleagues who supported the surge of troops, is this the \nresult you envisioned? A situation in which dozens of Americans are \nstill dying every month despite a reduction in violence? A situation in \nwhich the sons and daughters of America are more than ever acting as \nthe police force--as the police force--in a country that remains \nvolatile and deadly? A situation in which the people we need most to \nachieve stability--the leaders of the various Iraqi political \nfactions--look at a never-ending American military presence in their \ncountry and see little reason to reconcile?\n  Are we going to remain in the middle of an internal struggle for \npower, as General Petraeus reported in September? I was shocked when \nGeneral Petraeus had as part of his testimony that the main conflict in \nIraq was a struggle for power and resources within the different \nfactions of Iraqi society. Are we sending our sons and daughters to \ncreate the space for the Iraqi politicians to fight over power and \nresources? That is what we sent our sons and daughters for? That is why \nwe keep them there? Is that what we bargained for?\n  We cannot accept the status quo in Iraq. When our military commanders \nsay that, in fact, the biggest challenge to us is the intransigence of \nIraqi leaders to come together, more so than al-Qaida, more so than \nSunni insurgents, more so than Iranian influences, that is one \nincredible statement.\n  Things must change, and to change it will take strong action. It \nrequires a choice: Do we stay the course when we know that peace and \npolitical stability cannot be achieved looking down the barrel of a \ngun? Military presence does not achieve political reconciliation. \nRemember, former General Pace of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said once: \nWell, we need the Iraqis to love their children more than they hate \ntheir neighbors. That is a powerful truism, but that does not come at \nthe point of a rifle. That comes about through reconciliation. It comes \nthrough power sharing. It comes through revenue sharing. It comes \nthrough all of those things that, notwithstanding the arguments that we \nare creating the space for the Iraqi leadership to do, the Iraqi \nleadership has failed to do, and there is no movement in sight toward \nthat goal. Or do we choose a course that impresses upon the political \nleaders in Iraq that they must reconcile and bring peace to their \ncountry swiftly?\n  We need to make them understand the true urgency of this task. We \nneed to make them understand America will not always be there to play \npoliceman. Instead of continuing to enable an endless and unchanging \ninvolvement in Iraq, we can set a timetable to begin bringing American \ntroops back home. I believe that only then will we have the Iraqis \nunderstand that we are not there in an endless occupation, that they \nare going to have to make the hard choices for compromise, negotiations \nnecessary to achieve a government of national unity on those issues of \nreconciliation, power sharing, revenue sharing, on the core issues that \npossibly can create the opportunity for a strong federal government in \nIraq to survive. But as long as they believe we will stay there in an \nopen-ended set of circumstances--shedding our blood and spending our \nnational treasure--what is the urgency, the impetus for them to stop \njostling over power, influence, and resources? Not only could we \npreserve the lives of countless American troops, not only could we save \nbillions upon billions of taxpayer dollars, we also could make certain \nthat the Iraqis know they will have to stand up to achieve the peace we \nall seek, the opportunities we would love to see for the Iraqi people, \nbecause until the Iraqi Government and military actually believe we \nwill not be there forever, they will not actually take charge of their \nown country.\n  Transitioning our troops out of Iraq, that is what I choose. It is \nwhat the American people have continuously said they have chosen. It is \nwhat I urge my colleagues to choose. We have that opportunity coming \ntomorrow on the vote on bridge funding. That creates an opportunity to \nbegin such a transition. I hope we will avail ourselves of that \nopportunity because if we have to read more and more of our generals \nsaying that the intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated Government is \nthe key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq rather than al-Qaida \nterrorists, Sunni insurgents, or Iranian-backed militias, we are in \ndeep trouble--we are in deep trouble.\n  We have to have an opportunity to change the course, and pride--\npride--I hope is not the impediment for people recognizing that. We \nhave lost too many lives already. We have spent an enormous amount of \nmoney. It is time for change. It is time for a change in course. It is \ntime to make sure the Iraqis know they have to stand up for their own \nfuture, they have to make the hard decisions possible to have a \ngovernment of national unity. That opportunity comes tomorrow for the \nSenate. I hope we will avail ourselves of it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today we had a very interesting hearing \nwhere we had General Casey and Secretary Geren and others before the \nArmed Services Committee. I want to make sure that before we leave on \nthis recess we have one more chance to talk about the significance of \nthe McConnell-Stevens emergency supplemental appropriations bill. It is \nvital to our troops overseas, and it is important to the future of our \nArmed Forces.\n  As Senator McConnell stated earlier today--and I am quoting now--he \nsaid:\n\n       Because we have a responsibility to provide this funding to \n     our men and women in uniform as they attempt to protect the \n     American people, we need to get a clean troop funding bill to \n     the President.\n\n  I would like to associate myself with these words and these remarks \nand also express my support for the supplemental he has sponsored.\n  The emergency supplemental offered by the Democrats, on the other \nhand, is the epitome of everything that is wrong with the 110th \nCongress. It is a bill we all know does not have the 60 votes needed to \npass. This is not new to this Congress. We have had 61 votes related to \nIraq measures; 29 of those votes were here in the Senate. If those on \nthe other side of the aisle want to continue to play politics, now is \nnot the time to do it.\n  The current war supplemental expires in 2 days--now, the reason I \nknow that is true is that happens to be expiring on my birthday--which \nI hope I don't--and the Department of Defense will be required to start \npulling from their nonwartime budget to pay for ongoing operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues want us out of Iraq \nregardless of what the facts on the ground may be, but not sending a \nclean supplemental bill to the President before we go home for the \nThanksgiving recess is an absolute travesty. Forcing the Department of \nDefense to start reprogramming funds to keep our brave men and women \nfully equipped in Iraq and Afghanistan will jeopardize our efforts to \nmaintain, sustain, and transform our Armed Forces, not to mention \ncreate an accounting nightmare. We went through this once before and we \nsaw the trauma that resulted from it.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, in a November 8 letter, \nstated\n\n[[Page S14471]]\n\nthat a delay in war funding would force us in December to begin \npreparing to close facilities, laying off Department of Defense \ncivilian employees, and delaying contracts. According to England, it \nwould completely drain the Army's operations and maintenance accounts \nby the end of January, and the training of the Iraqi security forces \nwill be delayed without this supplemental.\n  While fighting the war on terror, we cannot forget about our efforts \nto sustain and transform our Armed Forces. Pulling money away from such \nprojects will cost us dividends in the future. We talked about that \nthis morning, that we have a lot of things that are happening for our \nground forces. We have the future combat systems we are involved in \nright now, and we cannot allow FCS to keep sliding as it does.\n  Other countries that are potential adversaries would be in a position \nactually to have better equipment than we do. A good case in point \nwould be our best artillery piece happens to be called a Paladin. It is \nWorld War II technology. It is actually one where, after every round, \nyou have to get out and swab the breech. People do not realize that. \nThere is an assumption out there in America that America has the best \nof everything--the best strike vehicles, the best lift vehicles--and it \nis just not true. We do not. But this is one of the problems we will \nhave if we do not continue to fund these efforts.\n  I have a hard time understanding why now, of all times, we would \nwithhold funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why now, when \nwe are turning the corner in Iraq and our troops are making remarkable \nprogress under the leadership of General Petraeus, would we hand the \nenemy off, tell them to lay low until December of 2008, and you can \nhave the country then?\n\n  This proposed emergency supplemental by the Democrats sends the wrong \nmessage to our troops fighting in Iraq and in Afghanistan. It tells \nthem: We will give you the funding to fight your war, but we don't \nbelieve in what you are doing.\n  I do not presume to speak for every American service man and woman \nfighting overseas, but I have met with a great many of them and have \nspoken with many of the families back home. It is kind of interesting \nthat I have had the opportunity--and I say opportunity in a very \nsincere way--to have visited the area of responsibility of Iraq more \nthan any other Member; actually, some 15 times, and I will be returning \nthere in 2 more weeks. So when I talk about the military, these are the \nones whom I have talked to on the ground. I watched Ramadi change from \nthe al-Qaida declared capital to Iraqi control. That was a year ago \nright now when they declared Ramadi would become the terrorist capital \nof the world. I can remember Fallujah, when we were going from door to \ndoor, our marines, who were doing a great job. It is now completely \nsecure, but not by Americans. It is secure by the Iraqi security \nforces.\n  I visited the Patrol Base Murray south of Baghdad and met with local \nIraqis who came forward and established provisional units of \nneighborhood security volunteers. These individuals heard that the \nAmericans were coming and were waiting to greet them when they arrived.\n  I watched these Neighborhood Watch and Concerned Citizens groups take \nroot in Anbar Province--I think everyone realizes now that Anbar \nProvince is kind of the success story over there--local civilians who \nwere willing to take back their cities and their provinces. These \ncitizens actually go out and paint circles around undetonated IEDs and \nRPGs, and it is something they are doing so we don't have to do it. Now \nin Iraq, in visiting the joint security stations, you see that our \nkids, instead of going back to the green zone in Baghdad, for example, \ngo out and actually live with the Iraqi security forces and develop \nintimate relationships with them. When you see these operations take \nplace, it is very gratifying.\n  We had the report yesterday up in 407 in a security environment about \nthe successes in Iraq, and while that was a classified briefing, the \ninformation they gave is not classified. When you look, you can \ncompare, as shown here--and I wish I had a chart so it could be shown--\nOctober of 2005, the Iraqi security forces had 1 division headquarters, \n4 brigade headquarters, and 23 battalions they were leading in their \nown areas of responsibility. Now, 2 years later, in October of 2007, \nthe Iraqi security forces have 10 division headquarters, 33 brigade \nheadquarters, and 85 battalions. It shows that two-thirds of the entire \narea we have in Baghdad is now under control and under security. More \nthan 67,000 Iraqis are serving as the concerned local citizens \nassisting coalitions and Iraqi security forces to secure their own \nneighborhoods.\n  Locals in Baghdad's east Rashid district are helping secure forces \nand locate IEDs. All of these things are going on right now.\n  I want to wind up. I know the majority leader has time he wants to \nshare with us. But I have to say that Lieutenant General Odierno stated \non November 1:\n\n       Over the past four months, attacks and security incidents \n     have continued to decline. This trend represents the longest \n     continuous decline in attacks on record.\n\n  None of this is to say the war is over. We understand that. But I \nwould have to say this: When I listened to my very good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, talk about the doom and gloom, the \nfacts that he cited just flat aren't true. We are winning. We are \naggressively winning. Good things are happening. I have to say you \ndon't get that from reading reports. You need to go over there and look \nfor yourself.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts and I agree on a lot of things. \nHe has been very active with me on doing something about the western \nSahara problem. He is concerned about what Joseph Coney is doing in \nnorthern Uganda. We are together on a lot of things. But as far as Iraq \nis concerned, he has never made a trip--not one. I have been to A.O.R. \n15 times. You have to go over there. I see it as our responsibility as \nMembers of this Senate body. We are encouraged to go over by the \nmilitary because this encourages our troops who are over there. When \nyou go, they look at you in the eyes and they say: Why is it a lot of \nthe American people don't agree with what we are doing over here? They \nknow there were actually several terrorist training camps in Iraq prior \nto the time we were over there. In one they were teaching people how to \nhijack airplanes. All of those are closed down now. It has been a very \nsignificant thing. Nothing is more important than continuing along the \nlines of victory as we are today and finishing the job we have been \ncarrying on in Iraq.\n  I applaud all of the young people over there. I said today in this \nhearing that I was a product of the draft and I always felt we would \nnever be able to conduct this type of activity unless we had compulsory \nservice. I have always supported compulsory service. But when I go over \nand I see these young volunteers, all of them total volunteers who are \nover there, the dedication they have, the commitment they have, I get \nvery excited and I realize I was wrong. Those guys are doing a great \njob and we don't need to have compulsory service because we have great, \ndedicated Americans who are volunteering on a daily basis. The \nretention rates have never been higher than they are right now. Those \nindividuals who come to the end of their term are reupping in numbers \nand in statistics we have never seen before. So good things are \nhappening. We need to get this supplemental finished so we can have the \ncontinuity of funding over there and not have to rob other areas of our \ndefense system. I am hoping we will be able to do this.\n  I thank you very much for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend from Oklahoma \nyielding the floor. I appreciate it very much. He had the right to the \nfloor and I hope he was able to complete his statement.\n\n\n                              Golden Gavel\n\n  Mr. President, first, I want to recognize the Presiding Officer. One \nof the accolades that we are allowed, and certainly look forward to \ngiving to the Members of the Senate, is for those people who preside \nover the Senate for 100 hours a year. My friend from Colorado has \nreached that pinnacle an hour or so ago. That is a tremendous \naccomplishment, 100 hours presiding over the\n\n[[Page S14472]]\n\nSenate. I congratulate my friend and look forward to the first time we \nget back after Thanksgiving recess on a caucus day where we make the \npresentation of the very fine golden gavel. As I have said before, it \nis a very nice presentation. You will be able, for many years to come, \nto talk to your children and grandchildren about presiding over the \nSenate for 100 hours in 1 year.\n  So thank you very much, I say to my friend from Colorado, who does an \noutstanding job not only presiding but being the Senator he is \nrepresenting the people of Colorado.\n\n\n            Transportation Appropriations Conference Report\n\n  Mr. President, it is interesting; one Republican Senator said, when \nwe were trying to clear something earlier, to one of my Democratic \nfriends, the reason they couldn't clear our appropriations bill, the \nTransportation appropriations bill is that they were told the situation \nwith the Republicans is they don't want us to do anything, so they \nobject to everything they can, and that is pretty obvious. So we were \nprevented from going to the Transportation appropriations bill. It was \nquite unique that in the time we were doing this the Senator from \nMinnesota was on the floor. He, above all others, should be weighing in \nand trying to help us get the Transportation appropriations bill \npassed. There is money in it to rebuild the bridge in Minnesota.\n  But we have something else that is vitally important: terrorism \ninsurance. We are arriving at a point where construction cannot go \nforward. Now construction is already taking place--certainly it can--\nbut construction projects that are on the drawing boards in a month or \nso will not be able to go forward because they can't get terrorism \ninsurance because we have not provided it. We have been ready for some \ntime to do that. There is a bill that has been cleared on our side that \nthe Republicans are holding up--a bill dealing with the very foundation \nof this country--whether the business community in our country is going \nto have the benefit of terrorism insurance. Without that, it is a \ndramatic hit to what we need to do in this country for the business \ncommunity.\n  I think it is unfortunate. We asked our staffs to check with the \nminority and they said no, they couldn't clear it; maybe tomorrow. \nWell, we have a lot of tomorrows around here that seem to never come. \nIt would be a real shame if we could not clear tomorrow the terrorism \ninsurance that is so extremely important to this country.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  It was interesting to hear my friend from Oklahoma speak about the \nwar in Iraq. But I would ask everyone to look at--and I am sure it is \nnot only in this newspaper--a daily newspaper that I had the \nopportunity to read today, the Washington Post, the front page \nheadline:\n\n       Iraqis Wasting An Opportunity. Brigadier General John F. \n     Campbell, deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry \n     Division, complained last week that Iraqi politicians appear \n     out of touch with everyday citizens. ``The ministers, they \n     don't get out. They don't know what the hell is going on on \n     the ground.''\n\n  If you turn over to page 22, which is carrying this forward--and \nthere are also some interesting things said in this article.\n\n       So how to force political change in Iraq without \n     destabilizing the country further? ``I pity the guy who has \n     to reconcile that tension,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Douglas \n     Ollivant, the chief of planning for U.S. military operations \n     in Baghdad whose tour ends next month.\n\n  Mr. President, the situation in Iraq is very desperate. This \nnewspaper article says, among other things:\n\n       The Army officer who requested anonymity said that if the \n     Iraqi government doesn't reach out, then for former Sunni \n     insurgents ``it's game on--they're back to attacking again.''\n\n  We have supported the troops for the entire duration of this war. We \nare the ones who recognized that there wasn't body armor for our \ntroops, that mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and wives \nwere writing personal checks to send armor to the valiant troops in \nIraq. We are the ones who recognized that. We are the ones who did \nsomething about the situation we have at Walter Reed, which was a \nscandal, how our veterans were being taken care of, but the President \nwouldn't sign our bill: $4 billion more for these valiant men and women \nwho are suffering from things that have never been suffered in any war \never before. It is a war that has never been fought before. It is a war \nwhere these men and women are subject to these phantom attacks, and \nwhen they go home after their tour or tours of duty end and they have \nall their limbs and they can see, they are not paralyzed, they haven't \nbeen shot, they still have to get over this post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, because they have seen their friends get killed or blown up \nand injured.\n  I think it is very important to talk about how good our soldiers are, \nand that is what my friend from Oklahoma is doing. We agree. We have to \nunderstand that Iraq is in a state of crisis. You can't have it both \nways. The President said he needed these extra troops to get the \npolitical situation in tow in Iraq. He has gotten the troops and now he \nwants to keep them longer. The troops in Iraq now are--because there \nare some people who are coming home and some who have just gone over \nthere--there are about 180,500 some troops are there now to be exact, \nright now in Iraq. We don't know how many contractors are there, but \nthere are estimates of up to 150,000. How much longer, Mr. President? \nHow much longer do the American taxpayers have to take care of a \ncountry that is the richest or the second richest oil country in the \nwhole world? How much longer?\n  Yesterday we were told that Iraq has a balanced budget. Isn't that \nnice. I am glad they do. Why do we need to keep pouring money into \nthem--$12 billion a month. Infrastructure. We have spent billions and \nbillions of dollars on infrastructure in Iraq. How much are we spending \nhere in America? Our President has to look beyond Iraq and look at \nAmerica.\n  Earlier today my friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold, came and asked unanimous consent that we could move forward \non the Feingold-Reid legislation, which, in effect, says we have to get \nour troops out of Iraq very quickly, except those who are there for \ncounterterrorism, force stabilization, and limited training of Iraqis. \nWe are a coequal branch of government. That is why we believe, Senator \nFeingold and I, that after June 30 of next year, funds would only be \nused for the programs I have mentioned: counterterrorism, protecting \nour assets, and limiting training of Iraqis.\n  But in our legislation it is not a suggestion, not a goal, but \nbinding policy. That legislation recognizes our strong national \ninterest in Iraq and the Middle East, but brings to an end the \nrubberstamp and unwavering loyalty in a never-ending war which is the \nhallmark of the Republican-controlled Congress. That legislation \nfundamentally changes course in Iraq and this almost unimaginably high \nprice that grows every day. And there are 4,000 dead Americans.\n  (Mr. SANDERS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was talking about how unusual this war is. \nTwelve and a half percent of the wounded have eye injuries. I don't \nknow how many we have lost track of because we don't have recent \nreports, but more than 35,000 have been injured, and 12\\1/2\\ percent of \nthem have eye injuries. That is how this war is different than other \nwars in one way.\n  Last week, a young marine came to my office, 21 years old. He entered \nthe Marines when he was 17. He came to my office with his wife and baby \ndaughter. He had been on his second tour in Iraq. His legs were blown \noff. I said, ``What happened?'' He said, ``We went to a house where we \nthought there were some people doing some things that we needed to take \na look at. We walked out and somebody detonated a bomb and blew me \nup.'' He said it had been difficult to adjust. He was holding his baby \nin the wheelchair. His wife was over his shoulder. Senator Durbin was \nwith me when we visited this young man. Senator Durbin told me today in \nthe cloakroom that he has trouble getting this image out of his mind. \nWe all do. A 21-year-old hero, who will live the rest of his life with \nthese debilitating wounds of war.\n  He is not the only one, as we know. As if the toll of lives and limbs \nwere not enough, this war also costs billions from our Treasury. We \nwere told by the Joint Economic Committee earlier this week that the \nwar--with the $200 billion he requested--all borrowed money, with a \ncredit card that has no expiration date and certainly no limit. And\n\n[[Page S14473]]\n\nthat is only the direct costs. We were told by the Joint Economic \nCommittee what the cost of extra borrowed money is doing to our energy \npolicy in this country, and the other things they list is double that.\n  To this point the war has cost America $1.6 trillion. That is a lot \nof money. We are not just spending our money; we are maxing out on our \nchildren and grandchildren's credit cards. But perhaps the most \ndangerous cost of this war will be measured in the damages done to our \nArmed Forces' ability to protect and defend our country. Military \nreadiness is at a 30-year low. Our flexibility to respond to emerging \nthreats beyond the borders of Iraq is greatly hampered. I am not saying \nthis, and the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, is not \nsaying this; this comes from General Casey, the head general of the \nArmy. He said:\n\n       The current demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable \n     supply. We are consumed with meeting the demands of the \n     current fight, and are unable to provide ready forces as \n     rapidly as necessary for other potential contingencies.\n\n  That is the lead general of the Army saying that. What is more, we \nhave heard time and time again during the last few months what is \nhappening with recruitment. I have to tell you, I am offended when I \nhear people from the Pentagon tell us ``we are meeting our recruiting \ngoals.'' You can meet any goal if you keep lowering the standards. You \ndon't need to be a high school graduate anymore. You can have a \ncriminal record. Our military has been hit hard. Not only is \nrecruitment not heading in the direction that I think is appropriate, \nbut what is happening to our officers? These people who go to our \nmilitary academies are the best and the brightest. I have the \nopportunity to select people--and I have for a long time--to go to \nthese academies. The best and the brightest of Nevada go to these \nacademies. They finish their mandatory term, and then they are \nquitting. We are 3,000 captains short right now, and it is going to get \nworse.\n  Mid-level officers are so hard to come by. We are doing everything we \ncan to keep them. Huge amounts of money are being given to these people \nto have them stay in the military.\n  Let's not forget the cost of the war on the men and women in our \nNational Guard and Reserve. These are men and women we need protecting \nus and responding to emergencies here at home. But we know, as was \nexemplified in the storm that hit Kansas, when the Governor said most \nof his National Guard is in Iraq and the equipment they have is \nruined--that is the way it is all over the country. These citizen \nsoldiers have already had 2 to 3 tours of duty of 12 to 18 months each.\n  Our men and women in uniform have performed more than admirably; they \nhave performed heroically. But these troops--now more than 180,000--\nawake each morning on that foreign sand to face another day of risk \nthey cannot predict, and the appreciation they get from the Iraqis is \nthat we do everything we can to protect the Shia, the Sunni, and the \nKurds, and they all try to kill us.\n  It is no wonder GEN Colin Powell said that ``the Army is about \nbroken.'' He was being generous.\n  If Senators cannot find the courage to stand against the President's \nfailed war policy, I fear GEN Colin Powell might be right. The cost of \nthe war extends beyond Iraq. The whole Middle East has been \ndestabilized. There is a civil war going on in Israel with the \nPalestinians. Lebanon--could we call that a civil war? It is not much \nof a stretch. They cannot even hold a Presidential election. Iran is \nbasically thumbing their nose at the world, and we are standing by \nsaber rattling with almost no diplomacy for Iran.\n  What is going on in Iraq? An intractable civil war that has become \neven more pronounced in recent weeks, when the Turks gathered 100,000 \ntroops on the northern border of Iraq. The crisis in Pakistan \nexemplifies what is going on. We not only have trouble in the Middle \nEast, but we have lost our moral standing throughout the world as a \nresult of this. The Bush administration focused on a person and a \ncountry, and now we have the situation we have in Pakistan.\n  The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan has become less stable. \nMusharraf now seems intent on derailing the path toward democracy. \nBillions of dollars of American taxpayer money is not fully audited or \naccounted for. And perhaps as bad as any of this, bin Laden is still \nwandering around and sending, when he feels like it, a tape to us so we \ncan look at that. He continues to make these tapes taunting us, and his \nal-Qaida network, according to the President's own intelligence, is \nregrouping and is stronger than ever.\n\n  Meanwhile, on the other side of the border, conditions in \nAfghanistan--once hailed as a victory--continue to unravel. Ten \nAmerican soldiers were killed this week.\n  Now Afghanistan supplies 93 percent of the world's opium. This year \nis going to be another all-time high production year. The people of \nAfghanistan suffered through the most violent year since the U.S. \nintervention. This year, 2007, is the bloodiest year in the history of \nthe war for American troops in Iraq. In Afghanistan, violent incidents \nare up 30 percent. There is a rapidly rising influx of foreign \nfighters, and there was a report this morning that the Taliban has \nvastly stepped up the number of improvised and suicide attacks.\n  We cannot send more troops there. Listen to what General Casey and \nGeneral Powell said:\n\n       Many costs of the war in Iraq have been quantified: \n     American deaths, Americans wounded, trillions of dollars in \n     taxpayers dollars.\n\n  The other costs are not easy to calculate. How long is it going to \ntake to repair our military? The estimated dollar value is hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. How many additional troops and dollars will it \ntake to win in Afghanistan? How do you calculate that?\n  The risk is that the next national security threat becomes a national \nsecurity disaster because we don't have the troops to take care of it. \nAnd all for a war that our troops are fighting harder to win than the \nIraqi politicians, who, after months and months of our troop \nescalation, have failed to achieve any meaningful political benchmarks.\n  Now the Secretary of State is saying those benchmarks don't mean \nanything anymore. But they did at one time, and they do to the American \npeople--$12 billion a month, and they have a balanced budget? Ours \nisn't balanced. They are doing infrastructure development there. We are \nnot. They are building hospitals over there. We are not. So now in this \nwar--soon to be in the sixth year--our troops are no safer, national \nsecurity is no better protected, Iraq is no closer to reconciliation \nthan in the fifth or the fourth or third years.\n  We must not forget that we sent our troops to Afghanistan following \n9/11 to go after those who attacked us, break up terrorist cells, and \nstop future terror plans from becoming reality. Now, 6 years later, we \nhave moved far away from that critical fight.\n  It is long past time to get our national security strategy back on \ntrack, and the only way to do that is to stand up to our President. It \nis our constitutional duty, and our moral responsibility, to do so.\n  I compliment my friend from Wisconsin for offering his effort today \nto move forward on the Feingold-Reid legislation. That is what we need \nto do--bring our troops home.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be here in the morning and I will talk \nabout the bill we got from the House. I appreciate the work they did. \nIt wasn't easy to get it over here. It is not nearly strong enough for \nme. I am going to support it. Earlier this week, we gave the President \nof the United States $470 billion for the troops. We were all happy to \ndo that. He signed that bill and, on the same day, within minutes, he \nvetoed a bill for the American people--the Labor-HHS, a bill that takes \ncare of some of the education needs of this country, a bill that allows \nmedical research to go forward for dreaded diseases in this country. He \nsaid no. So many things for our communities were in that bill. He said \nno. But to Iraq, he says yes. Don't you think it is appropriate, I say \nto the American people and the Presiding Officer, that to this man, who \nwants an additional $470 billion, we say, OK, but we want some \naccountability?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say this: Tomorrow morning, the third \nvote in order is going to be a vote to invoke cloture on the farm bill. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle, my Republican friends, are \nnear bringing this bill down. That is a shame. All those farm States \nout there--and there are lots of them--and all those farm communities--\nand there are lots of them--need to look to the Republicans for killing \nthe farm bill. If they vote, and they should vote cloture to stop this \nsilliness that has been going on now for 10 days, 11 days, they can \nstill offer amendments. Once cloture is invoked, they have the 30 hours \nto offer amendments. We can enter into an agreement. If they want to \nspend a half hour on each amendment, 15 minutes to a side, whatever \nthey want to do that is reasonable, but they have been unwilling to be \nreasonable. I guess they want, as I indicated earlier, the Democrats \nnot to have an accomplishment. But the fault of the farm bill is at \ntheir feet. You don't have to look further than down at their feet. \nThey are stopping an important piece of legislation, a bipartisan piece \nof legislation, and they are doing it for what I believe are very bad \nmotives.\n  It is a shame. The American farm programs are good programs. This \nbill makes them better. Is this bill perfect? Of course not.\n  I went over the schedule with my staff as to what we can do in \nDecember. We don't have the luxury of spending a long time on this farm \nbill. We could if cloture is invoked. We could come back and finish \nthis bill in a short period of time. If it is not invoked, we are going \nto be hard pressed to get the farm bill completed very soon.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the national debate on \nthe war in Iraq will continue on the floor of the Senate. The debate \nhas now reached the stage where we are talking about funding for the \nwar. This war, in its fifth year, has claimed almost 3,900 of our best \nand bravest soldiers. Some 30,000 have been injured, more than 10,000 \nwith amputations, burns, and traumatic brain injuries, serious injuries \nthat they will struggle with for a long time.\n  Earlier this week, I watched a television documentary. James \nGandolfini, who has been in many movies, television documentaries, and \nshows, interviewed disabled veterans. I believe it was titled ``Alive \nDay Memories.'' It was a story of how each of these disabled vets from \nIraq recalled the day when they believed they had been killed and their \nlives lost but somehow survived miraculously. They are extraordinary \nstories of courage, emotional stories about what they went through, and \nheartbreaking stories about some of the injuries they brought home. \nThey were victims of traumatic brain injury--a young man with a video \nshowing him in his youth with all the strength and vitality one could \nask for, now struggling from a wheelchair to speak and to look forward \nto a life where he can walk and be anywhere near normal; his mother by \nhis side holding his hand to calm him when the emotions overcame him.\n  There were amputees talking about returning home. Many of them \nworried about whether they would be accepted. There were some \nwonderful, heartwarming stories of families who stood by them through \nthis whole struggle and are with them even to this day.\n  There was a beautiful young woman who was a lieutenant in the Army in \nher mid-twenties, red hair, as pretty as can be. A rocket-propelled \ngrenade went off right next to her. It blew off her right arm and right \nshoulder. She showed extraordinary bravery in talking about what she \nhad been through and putting her life together, and then struggled for \nwords when she talked about whether she would ever have a family, \nwhether she would ever have a child who would look at her as a mother.\n\n  I watched that show and thought about my role as a Senator, and I \nthought about this war. I was 1 of 23 who voted against it in the \nSenate. It seems so long ago, 5 years. A vote that was at the time \npolitically hard, but a vote that I never ever questioned or regretted.\n  Now 5 years later, here we are still--still--with these stories, this \nhandful of stories we saw on the documentary just representing a small \npercentage of the heroism and suffering of this war.\n  I have had the opportunity to speak with this President directly \nabout these men and women. I have talked with him about Eric Edmundson \nfrom North Carolina, a young man, a victim of traumatic brain injury \nwho has become close to me through his family and visited with me just \nthis last week in my office in Washington. I have seen his family up \nclose, and I know the extraordinary love they have for their son and \nfather of their granddaughter. The sacrifices they have made for him, \nhis wife and baby daughter, are extraordinary.\n  We have a Capitol guide--I wish I knew his name, and I will make it a \npoint of finding it out--who makes a special effort to offer tours late \nat night for disabled veterans from Walter Reed. I run into him in the \ncorridors after everybody is gone, and it is dark outside. He is giving \nspecial, personalized tours to veterans and their families. He always \nstops and introduces them and asks if we will pose for a picture. Of \ncourse, it is the least we can do, and we agree to do it.\n  He came by last week to Senator Harry Reid's office and brought a \nyoung man from New Jersey. I believe his name was Ray. Ray had his \nyoung wife and beautiful little daughter with him, Kelsey. Kelsey was \nabout 16 months old, 17 months old. She was running everywhere. She was \njust a bundle of energy and happy as could be, as her mother worried \nshe might break something.\n  Ray was in a wheelchair. He had lost both of his legs and lost a few \nfingers on his left hand. He had served in Iraq. He came back and \nconsidered himself lucky. He talked about what he was going to do from \nthis point forward. So many stories of bravery.\n  Tomorrow morning we will have a vote, and it will be our chance to \nspeak as a Senate about this war. Some people will view it as just \nanother routine vote, predictable outcome, and be on with their lives \nand head home for Thanksgiving. But for me, it is a chance, just a \nsmall chance, to return to a debate which I know consumes the hearts \nand minds of so many Americans.\n  I can't tell you how many people I run into, particularly the \nfamilies of these soldiers, who want this war to\n\n[[Page S14475]]\n\nend. I want to, too. And tomorrow we will have a chance to do that.\n  Tomorrow we will have two votes. Senator McConnell is going to try to \nmove a spending bill which will provide $70 billion for this war in \nIraq with no strings attached. He will hand over this money, if he has \nhis way, to President Bush, and we know what the outcome would be. The \nwar would continue unchanged until this President walks out of office \nJanuary 20, 2009. That is unacceptable to me, and I think it is \nunacceptable to many in this Chamber.\n  We have to change this war. We have to start bringing these troops \nhome. We have to tell the Iraqis: We have given you as much time as you \ncould reasonably ask for to build your country and govern your country \nand defend your country.\n  This morning's Washington Post has a front-page headline: ``Iraqis \nWasting An Opportunity, U.S. Officers Say.'' Wasting an opportunity. It \nis an opportunity created by the lives and blood of our soldiers, those \nwho were there dying on the ground to give the Iraqis a chance, and our \nmilitary leaders have said they are wasting an opportunity.\n\n       Brig. Gen. John F. Campbell, deputy commanding general of \n     the 1st Cavalry Division, complained last week that Iraqi \n     politicians appear out of touch with everyday citizens. ``The \n     ministers, they don't get out,'' he said. ``They don't know \n     what the hell is going on on the ground.'' Soldiers standing, \n     fighting, and dying while these political ministers twiddle \n     their thumbs and waste their time--that is unacceptable. I \n     cannot imagine how we can continue to ask our soldiers to \n     walk into that hell hole in Iraq and risk their lives and \n     come home severely injured while these Iraqi politicians \n     cannot do the most basic things to put their country \n     together.\n\n  If Senator McConnell has his way tomorrow, we will hand this \nPresident $70 billion and say: Mr. President, more of the same; just \nkeep it coming. I will not be part of that.\n  There is a second choice. Senator Harry Reid, our Democratic majority \nleader, will offer a chance to provide $50 billion to this President \nwith the understanding that within 30 days, American soldiers start \ncoming home in a meaningful way, with a goal that by the end of next \nyear, all of our combat forces will be out of Iraq. There will be some \nremaining. It would not be a complete cutoff, but they will be there \nfor specific reasons--to fight counterterrorism and to protect \nAmerica's remaining civilian and military personnel, to train the \nIraqis with a limited responsibility because we put so much into this \nso far.\n  I think that is the reasonable way to go. That bill we will vote on \nwill also say that the President cannot send military units overseas \nuntil they are combat ready unless he certifies they are combat ready \nor gives good reason why they do not have to be combat ready.\n  I have been there. I have talked with these soldiers. Fifteen months \nis too long. We had a briefing just the other day from one of the \nleaders in the Marine Corps. He conceded that point. Fifteen-month \ndeployments are too long to maintain the morale, to maintain the \nreadiness, to separate these soldiers from their families for 15 \nmonths. He said something that will stick with me.\n\n  He said: Can you imagine what goes through your mind when you are a \nsoldier on the ground in Iraq at Christmas, realizing you are going to \nbe there for another Christmas? That is what these soldiers are facing. \nThat is what this President has put us into, a situation where we have \npushed our brave men and women to the limit.\n  Oh, support our troops and love our soldiers. Well, I do. I want to \nsupport our troops by bringing them home as soon as possible in an \norderly, responsible way. Not what Senator McConnell wants: to let this \nPresident continue with 187,000 American soldiers currently on the \nground and no end in sight. That is unacceptable.\n  Some will say it is just another vote and nobody will notice. Maybe \nthat is so. But for those of us who believe very strongly this war \nneeds to come to an end, tomorrow morning is an opportunity. I hope the \nAmerican people who can follow this debate through C-SPAN, who can \nfollow our votes by referencing Congress on the Internet, will take a \nlook at that rollcall tomorrow morning and will judge which Senators \nfrom which States want to change this policy in Iraq and see this war \ncome to an end. We will have our chance tomorrow morning. It is a \nchance we should not miss.\n  For all those brave men and women who have served us so well in Iraq \nand those who may be called tomorrow, we owe them a ``yes'' vote on the \nReid cloture motion tomorrow, and I will be voting that way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come here at 7:30 p.m. eastern time one \nmore time to implore my colleagues, when we get to the cloture motion \ntomorrow on the 2007 farm bill, that we vote yes on that cloture \nmotion. I fear if we do not move forward with that cloture motion on \nthe farm bill tomorrow, there is a great possibility that the farm bill \nis, in fact, dead.\n  So many people have worked on this farm bill for such a long time--\nSenator Harkin, who has led the effort as chairman of the committee; \nSenator Chambliss, who has worked on this now for 3 years; Senator \nBaucus, who led the efforts in the Finance Committee with Senator \nGrassley to provide a very robust package that is very important for \nthe future of America. It is important that we move forward and we \nbring this matter to a close. The only way we are going to do that is \nif we get cloture tomorrow where people voted yes.\n  When we do that, what that will then set up is a postcloture \ntimeframe where germane amendments can then be considered to the farm \nbill, and we can move forward through an orderly process to bring the \nfarm bill to a just conclusion.\n  For me, what is at stake, when I think about the farmers and ranchers \nin the San Luis Valley, across the eastern plains of Colorado and Weld \nCounty and Adams County and across the western slope, is the future of \nfamily farmers and family ranchers, many of whom work much harder than \nanybody in Washington, DC, or in America; for those farmers and \nranchers know the day does not end at 5 or 6 o'clock in the \nevening. For most farmers and ranchers, their day ends at 10, 11, 12 \no'clock at night. Their day begins long before people go to work here \nin Washington, DC. Their day begins at 4 and 5 in the morning when they \nget up to tend to the cows or when they get up to make sure they are \nbaling their alfalfa, with dew still on the leaves of their alfalfa so \nthat they have a quality product at the end of the day. Those are the \nmen and women who really are the salt of the earth of America.\n\n  Those are the men and women, when you shake their hands, you know \nthey are the hands of working men and women because you feel the \ncalluses and the cuts. These are the men and women who, after they have \nworked for an entire year, wonder whether they are going to have enough \nmoney to pay off their operating line at the bank. These are the men \nand women who know the weather better than anybody here in Washington, \nDC, will ever know the weather and will be able to understand the \nseasons and the days better than most people who stand here on this \nfloor and debate about the issues of the farm policy because these are \nthe men and women who know, when they see a cloud of a certain color \ncoming in their direction, that there is a hailstorm on the way, and \nthey wonder whether or not that hailstorm is going to hit their field \nor their neighbor's field. They wonder whether they are going to be \nable to have enough at the end of the day to pay their operating \nexpenses or their mortgage at the bank.\n  So it is the farmers and ranchers of rural America in all our States, \nDemocratic States and Republican States--South Dakota, the State of my \ngood friend who served with us on the Agriculture Committee and has \ncontributed mightily to the content of this bill. It is all of those \nmen and women in farm country whom we owe this to, to move forward with \na process that brings about a conclusion to this farm bill, that sets \nan orderly process for us to consider amendments, both Republican and \nDemocratic amendments, so that we can bring this legislation to a \nclose.\n  For me, it is personal because I know many of these people. Many of \nthese people are my family. I spent a lot of my own time as an \nirrigator on a farm, on a Heston windrower, on John Deere tractors and \nJohn Deere balers. I spent\n\n[[Page S14476]]\n\na lot of time on a horse. So I know what the life of a farmer and a \nrancher is all about. But this legislation on the farm bill, Mr. \nPresident, is much more to America than just about these farmers and \nranchers. Yes, it is important to stand up for them and for them to \nhave champions here on the floor of the Senate, both on the Democratic \nside as well as on the Republican side. That is why it should not be \neven close as an issue in terms of us getting to a 60-vote margin \ntomorrow. It ought to be done easily because we ought to be champions \nfor these people.\n  But it is more than about the farmers and ranchers in America. It is \nabout a lot of other things. It is about making sure we embrace the \nclean energy economy of the 21st century. Nowhere in America is there \nmore excitement and enthusiasm than there is in rural America today \nabout how rural America will help us pioneer our way to energy \nindependence the same as with Brazil, a Third World country, through a \n20-year dedication to the cause of energy independence, to become \nenergy independent. There is no reason why we in America cannot do the \nsame thing if we put our minds to it and we have the courage to put the \nright policies in place. And rural America will play a very significant \nrole in creating that energy independence.\n  This legislation we have brought to the floor of the Senate from both \ncommittees, the Finance Committee as well as from the Agriculture \nCommittee, makes a very significant step in the right direction of \ngetting us off the addiction of foreign oil and opening a new \nopportunity for energy security for America. When I look at the issue \nof energy, yes, we will be debating and be having votes on the issue of \nIraq tomorrow, but part of why we are involved in these issues in the \nMiddle East is because of the fact that oil has been a driver in our \nforeign policy. We ought not to let that ever happen again in America. \nWe ought not to let oil be a driver in our foreign policy.\n  So as we embrace this ethic of a clean energy economy for the 21st \ncentury, that is part of what is at the heart of the farm bill in title \nIX. As we look at dealing with the environmental security of our globe, \nof this planet, that also is at the heart of this legislation. When we \nlook at creating a new economic opportunity, a new tomorrow for rural \nAmerica, that is also in this legislation.\n  But it goes beyond energy. It also deals with nutrition. We need to \nkeep reminding the people who are critical of this farm bill that they \nare wrong because they are aiming at the wrong parts. They aim at the \n14 percent of the bill that creates the support, the safety net for \nfarmers and ranchers who are out there in the fields, but we have to \nrecognize that it is almost 67 percent of the money that is set forth \nin this bill that goes into all the nutrition programs. Those nutrition \nprograms help our children make sure they have the food in their \nstomachs to be able to learn while they are in school. Those nutrition \nprograms are the ones that help the most vulnerable here in America.\n  It goes beyond nutrition. It also deals with the issue of \nconservation and how we take care of our land and water. This bill is a \nvery important step and makes a very important statement in making sure \nwe help take care of the crown jewels of America with the best stewards \nof our land and water.\n  So if you are a champion of the farmers and ranchers of this country, \nyou are going to vote yes on cloture on this bill tomorrow. If you are \na champion for the new clean energy economy, you are going to vote yes \non this cloture motion tomorrow. If you are a champion of taking care \nof those who are most in need, the most vulnerable in America in our \nnutrition programs, you are going to vote yes on this cloture motion \ntomorrow. If you are a champion and a fighter in protecting our land \nand water, then you will vote yes on this cloture motion tomorrow. \nBecause it is only by getting to yes on this cloture motion tomorrow, \nwith 60 votes, that we can then create the orderly process that can \nhave us consider amendments that will improve this farm bill and get it \nacross the finish line and then moving forward with the rest of the \nprocess to get it to the President's desk for signature.\n  Mr. President, tonight, I urge my colleagues to think about their \nvote tomorrow, and I ask them to vote yes on this very important motion \nthat will come before us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14476-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today about the \nconference report for the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act \nof 2007.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Chairman Kennedy, as well as Senators \nEnzi, Dodd and Alexander, for working together to lead this effort.\n  This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Head Start program, \nsomething the Congress has not done since 1998.\n  In 1965, President Johnson launched a summer program for low-income \nchildren and their families called Project Head Start.\n  The program's mission was simple: to prepare low-income, preschool-\naged children for success in school.\n  Today, Head Start serves children and their families in urban and \nrural areas across the United States.\n  Since its inception, more than 20 million children and families have \nbenefited from the Head Start program.\n  Nevada's eight centers range from a Head Start and Early Head Start \nCenter in rural Ely, to larger, more urban centers in Reno and Las \nVegas, to a Tribal Head Start center in Gardnerville.\n  Each of these programs is unique, because they focus on the needs of \nchildren and their families in the communities they serve.\n  Today, more than 40 years since its inception, Head Start provides \ncomprehensive early education and health services to almost 1 million \nlow-income preschool children to help them prepare for and succeed in \nschool.\n  Unfortunately, this is only a fraction of the number of children that \ncould benefit from Head Start services.\n  In Nevada alone, nearly 10,000 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible for \nHead Start programs. But, last year, only about one quarter of those \neligible were able to participate.\n  This legislation will expand access and eligibility for low-income \nchildren and families, which will open the doors to Head Start to tens \nof thousands of children in Nevada and across America.\n  The bill also makes a number of other important changes to the Head \nStart program.\n  It gives children the tools they need to start school by aligning \nHead Start standards and services with State and local school standards \nand requiring new research-based standards and assessments.\n  And, to ensure that Head Start programs are serving children as \neffectively as possible, the bill requires greater accountability \nthrough improved governance and recompetition for poor performing Head \nStart centers.\n  Finally, the bill strengthens the Head Start workforce by setting new \neducation and training goals for Head Start teachers and curriculum \nspecialists.\n  With proven and lasting results, Head Start is a wise investment in \nour future.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the passage of \nthe Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act to reauthorize the \nHead Start program yesterday. This legislation is a great \naccomplishment for the Congress and improves opportunities for nearly a \nmillion young children and their families. Head Start represents our \nunderstanding that our children must be a top priority. While as \nchildren represent one quarter of our population, they represent 100 \npercent of our future.\n  I would like to thank Senators Kennedy, Enzi and Alexander for their\n\n[[Page S14477]]\n\nleadership on this bill and their strong bipartisan work to complete \nthis conference report. I also commend Chairman Miller and Ranking \nMember McKeon in the House of Representatives and Congressmen Kildee \nand Castle for their work on this reauthorization. Since 2003, the \nSenate HELP Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee have \nworked to reauthorize this legislation. As a result of more than four \nyears of bipartisan efforts, the conference report we adopted yesterday \nimproves and strengthens the already successful Head Start program. I \nam happy with the unanimous passage of the bill and look forward to its \nenactment into law.\n  Since 1965, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood \ndevelopment services to low-income children. The evidence is clear: \nHead Start works for the more than 900,000 children enrolled in its \ncenters throughout the country.\n  This conference report bolsters the comprehensive nature of Head \nStart that aids in the social, emotional, physical and cognitive \ndevelopment of low-income preschool children. The program is successful \nbecause each center works to address the needs of its local community. \nHead Start is more than just a school readiness program; it addresses \nthe comprehensive needs of children and their families by providing \nhealth and other services to enrolled children.\n  The role of parents as essential partners and decisionmakers in Head \nStart is also strengthened in this legislation. Families play the most \nimportant role in ensuring the success of their children, and our bill \nmaintains an integral role for parents in the decision-making and day-\nto-day operations of the program. Parent involvement is a centerpiece \nof Head Start and I believe this bill strengthens their critical role.\n  Expanded eligibility, improved accountability, strengthened school \nreadiness for children and enhanced teacher quality are some of the \nessential elements of this legislation. In addition, collaboration and \ncoordination with other early childhood development programs and \noutreach to underserved populations is greatly improved. The \nlegislation before us significantly increases resources for Indian Head \nStart and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start. In addition, Early Head \nStart is prioritized, so that thousands of additional infants and \ntoddlers will be served. We know that major brain development occurs in \nthe first 3 years of life and I am thrilled that we are putting \nresearch into practice by expanding Early Head Start.\n  The conference report will enable more low-income children to get a \nhead start by allowing programs to serve families with incomes up to \n130 percent of the poverty level, while ensuring that the most \nvulnerable families below the poverty level are served first. This is \nimportant for Connecticut and other States where the cost of living is \nespecially high and many working poor families aren't able to access \nservices because they earn just above the poverty level.\n  Although we do not go as far as I would personally like to see in \nfunding for Head Start, we do authorize additional resources in this \nbill. Despite the tight budget situation, we authorize an increase of \nsix percent from $6.9 billion to $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2008, to \n$7.65 billion in fiscal year 2009 and to $7.995 billion in fiscal year \n2009. I continue to be gravely concerned about the lack of resources \nfor Head Start--funding levels have been essentially flat since 2002. \nCurrently, only half of eligible children are served in Head Start and \nfewer than 5 percent are served in Early Head Start. The increased \nfunding authorized by this bill will help us to begin to close this \ngap.\n  Across the country, Head Start providers are reporting rising costs \nin transportation health care premiums, facilities maintenance and \ntraining for staff. Rising operating costs are coinciding with \ndecreasing state, local and private contributions to Head Start \nprograms. We address these needs by ensuring that all Head Start \nprograms receive a cost of living increase, tied to inflation, each \nyear that funds are available.\n  Research shows that child outcomes are directly related to the \nquality of the teachers and professionals who work with them on a daily \nbasis. I am pleased that in the bill we establish strong educational \nstandards for Head Start teachers, curriculum specialists and teacher \nassistants. In 6 years, all Head Start teachers will be required to \nhave an associate's degree and 50 percent of teachers will be required \nto have a bachelor's degree. I will continue to work toward increased \nfunding to assist teachers in pursuing additional educational goals.\n  When Head Start began more than 40 years ago, it was the only \npreschool program available for low-income children; now there are many \napproaches. Collaboration and coordination with other early childhood \nprograms is also an essential piece of this Head Start bill, reducing \nduplication and encouraging opportunities for shared information and \nresources.\n  This legislation represents an important step forward and I welcome \nour continued focus on the needs of our Nation's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14477-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14477-S14478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SITING FUTUREGEN IN ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are nearing an important milestone in \nthe development of an ambitious project to develop new, environmentally \nfriendly ways of using coal. FutureGen is a joint venture between the \nDepartment of Energy and an international, non-profit consortium of \ncoal producers and energy generators. The FutureGen project will \nexplore the viability of capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide an \nunwanted by-product of coal use.\n  The plan is to begin facility construction for the project in 2010, \nwith full-scale operation beginning in 2013. The plant will generate \napproximately 275 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to supply \n150,000 homes.\n  The key to the FutureGen project, of course, is siting it at a \nlocation that can best meet the project's goals for carbon capture and \nsequestration. Right now four sites are under consideration, including \nMattoon and Tuscola, IL. Those sites are ideally suited for this \nproject. Illinois is coal country. Our State has 38 billion tons of \nrecoverable bituminous coal reserves, the largest in the Nation. That's \none-eighth of the total U.S. coal reserves, representing more energy \nthan the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined.\n  The Illinois sites have an abundant and reliable supply of water. The \ndeep, thick, undisturbed sandstone reservoirs of southern Illinois are \nwell suited for carbon sequestration. Unlike the other sites being \nconsidered for FutureGen, Illinois shares geological features with \nother states likely to build new coal plants capable of carbon capture \nand sequestration. The experience gained, then, by siting this project \nin Illinois will be key to extending the technology to new coal-fired \nplants built in the U.S.\n  Other States recognize the merits of the Illinois FutureGen \nproposals. Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have each \ndeclared support for the Illinois sites, based on their superior \ngeology and infrastructure compared to competing sites.\n  A decision on where to site the FutureGen project is around the \ncorner, and it can't come too soon. Global warming is already marring \nthe Earth. Global average surface temperatures are rising at an \nalarming rate. Cold days are fewer, and heat waves are more common. \nMountain glaciers and ice caps are melting. The global average sea \nlevel is rising. Coastal regions are threatened. It is no exaggeration \nto say that global climate change is the most threatening environmental \ndisaster we face.\n  Through it all, the world's top scientists have clearly advised that \nmanmade greenhouse gases that trap the Sun's heat are a significant \nfactor in this shift in the global climate. Of those greenhouse gases, \ncarbon dioxide is by far the most important. Because of our reliance on \nfossil fuels for heating, power, and transportation, carbon dioxide \nlevels in the atmosphere today are far greater than any seen in 650,000 \nyears. And those levels are only growing.\n  In fact, the growth rate of carbon dioxide concentrations over the \npast 10 years is greater than at any point since we have been taking \nmeasurements. The problem will only grow worse as China, India, and \nothers work to catch up economically to more developed countries. Much \nof that economic growth will be fueled by coal-fired powerplants.\n\n[[Page S14478]]\n\n  The world is looking to the United States for leadership in finding \nsolutions to carbon dioxide emissions. The U.S. Climate Change Science \nProgram this week reported that the United States was responsible for \n23 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 2003 that is more \nthan 1.5 trillion metric tons.\n  Unless we stand up and face this problem head on, it is unimaginable \nthat developing countries will be serious about curbing their \nemissions. And where does that carbon dioxide come from? Well, almost \n40 percent comes from the combustion of coal for electricity.\n  Coal represents just about half of America's electricity production. \nIt isn't going away anytime soon, especially as energy demands grow in \nthe U.S. and the world. How can we balance these needs, then, for \naffordable, abundant energy supply and stewardship of the earth's \nenvironment? Technology may hold part of the solution. Carbon capture \nand sequestration is one possible option; it is a way to extract carbon \ndioxide from combustion gases and pump it underground for long-term \nstorage to keep it out of the atmosphere. There is great potential for \nsuch technology in the United States, but it has not been demonstrated \nin a full, integrated facility.\n  That's where the FutureGen program comes in. In Illinois, we eagerly \nawait word of the project's location. And we look forward to working \nwith the Department of Energy and the private sector partners to \nexplore the potential of this promising new technology.\n  As the world faces the interconnected prospects of economic expansion \nand devastating environmental catastrophe, we must search for \ntechnological options that will help lead us to a sustainable future. \nOne promising possibility is the use of underground carbon \nsequestration to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere while \nemploying America's most abundant energy source: coal. FutureGen is a \nkey step to testing that technology, and I am proud that Illinois is in \na position to show America's responsible leadership to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14478-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Specialist Adrian Hike\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank all of my \ncolleagues for their support in extending the highly successful breast \ncancer research stamp for 4 additional years.\n  This bill has the strong bipartisan support of Senator Hutchison and \n61 other Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  Without congressional action, this extraordinary stamp is set to \nexpire on December 31 of this year, and it deserves to be extended.\n  This legislation would: Permit the sale of the breast cancer research \nstamp for 4 more years--until December 31, 2011; allow the stamp to \ncontinue to have a surcharge above the value of a first-class stamp \nwith the surplus revenues going to breast cancer research programs at \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and \nnot affect any other semipostal proposals under consideration by the \nU.S. Postal Service.\n  A recent report by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nreleased just last month, confirms that the breast cancer research \nstamp continues to be an effective fundraiser in the effort to increase \nfunds to fight the disease.\n  Since the stamp first went on sale 9 years ago, over 790 million \nbreast cancer research stamps have been sold by the U.S. Postal \nService--raising $57.8 million for breast cancer research.\n  These dollars have led to significant advances in the treatment of \nbreast cancer through research at the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, which receives 70 percent of the stamp's proceeds, and at the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, which receives the remaining 30 percent of \nthe proceeds.\n  For example, the GAO reported that: In 2006, NIH began to use the \nstamp's proceeds for a new program called the Trial Assigning \nIndividualized Options for Treatment to help determine which breast \ncancer patients are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Dr. Susan \nNeuhausen at the University of California used an NIH award that has \nled to many insights into breast cancer risks--using both genetic and \nenvironmental data to further define the breast and ovarian cancer risk \nfor individuals with a specific genetic mutation. Dr. Archbald Perkins \nat Yale University used a Department of Defense award to do research to \nhelp with the prognosis of some breast cancers by using new techniques \nto identify novel genes involved in cancer.\n  In addition to raising much needed funds for breast cancer research, \nthis wonderful stamp has also focused public awareness on this \ndevastating disease, and it is just as necessary today as ever.\n  About 3 million women in the United States are living with breast \ncancer, 1 million of whom have yet to be diagnosed. This year alone, \nabout 178,480 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed among \nAmerican women. And one out of every 8 women nationwide will get breast \ncancer in her lifetime, with the disease claiming another woman's life \nevery 13 minutes.\n  Extending the life of this remarkable stamp is crucial. With the sale \nof the breast cancer research stamp, every dollar we continue to raise \nwill provide hope to breast cancer survivors and will help save lives \nuntil a cure is found.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14478-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14478-S14479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TERRORISM REINSURANCE ACT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to address extension of the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program or TRIA. I am strongly reminded of the \nwords of the great economist Milton Friedman: ``Nothing is so permanent \nas a temporary government program.''\n  I remember quite clearly when the insurance industry requested a \ntemporary Federal backstop after the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001. I cannot stress the word temporary strongly enough in this \ncontext. Industry witnesses testified before the Banking Committee that \nthey only needed a temporary program in order to give the private \nmarkets time to adjust. I was also promised in private meetings that \nthe program would only be temporary. Insurance industry representatives \ntold me repeatedly that they would not come back to seek an extension \nof the program.\n  I was quite clear in expressing my disappointment with them when \nshortly after implementation of the program they began advocating for \nan extension. I very reluctantly supported the last extension because I \nbelieved it made progress in forcing the private sector to step up to \nthe plate. I am here today, though, to say enough. I intend to hold the \ninsurance industry accountable for their pledge of a temporary program \nby opposing the TRIA reauthorization bill.\n  I regret that those who utilize insurance are caught in the middle. \nUnfortunately, there doesn't seem to be another way to spur insurance \nindustry action to address this problem. Unless they are forced to come \nup with solutions, they will simply continue to rely on the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S14479]]\n\n  It is a shame that some consider it ``the best we can do'' to avoid \nmassively expanding a ``temporary'' government program. I believe we \ncan do better; we can hold people to their word and say enough is \nenough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14479-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                LEBANON\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, every so often a defining moment \narrives, capable of dramatically altering the future of a Nation and \nits people. The country of Lebanon, which will hold its Presidential \nelections as soon as November 21, is on the brink of one of these \nmoments.\n  Lebanon is a country whose vision for a socially rich, prosperous, \nand democratic future could serve as a model for what we hope to see in \nthe Middle East region. Yet in spite of the courageous and unwavering \nwill of the Lebanese people, extremist forces led by Syria, Iran, and \nterrorist groups--primarily Hezbollah--conspire to undermine the \ndemocratic majority in Lebanon and remake the country in their own \noppressive image.\n  Ever since Lebanon's Cedar Revolution in 2005, when a third of the \nLebanese people flooded the streets in peaceful protest against Syria's \nforeign domination, Lebanon has struggled to remain on the path to \npeace and democracy.\n  The cultural and media capital of the Arab world, Lebanon is \ncomprised of a uniquely rich social and religious fabric where \nChristians, Sunnis, and Shias live in relative harmony. Polling data \nfrom Lebanon indicates that the majority of the Lebanese people desire \nan independent and stable country, free from Syrian and Iranian \ninfluence. They want the militias, including Hezbollah, disarmed, and \nthey want an international tribunal to investigate the assassinations \nof Rafiq Hariri and other members of their Parliament.\n  On November 21, the Lebanese Parliament is scheduled to meet to elect \nthe country's next President, an event which will serve as a harbinger \nfor the future of independence and democracy in the Middle East. The \nstakes could not be higher--a fact that has not been lost on Syria and \nIran and that certainly must not be lost on us.\n  Desperate to regain its lost foothold in Lebanon, Syria has adopted \nthe macabre strategy of systematically assassinating members of the \nMarch 14th parliamentary majority, the embodiment of the Cedar \nRevolution's ideals. This tactic is designed to ensure the election of \na President sympathetic to Syrian hegemony. As the election date \napproaches, Lebanon's prodemocracy members of Parliament have been \nforced to enter complete seclusion in Beirut's Phoenicia Hotel. They \ncannot go outside, or even look out of windows, for fear of a sniper's \nbullet.\n  If we are committed to ensuring a free and democratic future for the \nMiddle East, safe from terror and extremism, we must not remain silent \nor passive about the need to ensure that the constitutional \nPresidential election process in Lebanon remains untainted by foreign \nmeddling and coercion by terrorist groups like Hezbollah. We must be \nunequivocally clear in our support for our March 14 allies in Lebanon.\n  I commend Secretary of State Rice for her recent statement that ``any \ncandidate for president or any president [of Lebanon] needs to be \ncommitted to Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, needs to be \ncommitted to resolutions that Lebanon has signed on to . . . and needs \nto be committed to carrying on the tribunal.'' I also strongly agree \nwhen she says that ``the March 14 majority should not be put in a \nposition of having to accept either extra-constitutional measures or \nmeasures that would undermine the program that they stand for.''\n\n  In light of the precarious situation in Lebanon, we must ensure that \nthe United States will not support anything less than the untainted \nelection of a constitutionally legitimate President in Lebanon.\n  We must make clear to the regimes in Syria and Iran, in no uncertain \nterms, that the United States will not support a puppet President that \nseeks to thwart the will of the Lebanese people, nor will the United \nStates remain silent in the face of the spread of militant Islamic \nextremism.\n  We must not allow Lebanon to be dragged back into chaos and war. \nLebanon's enemies should understand that we are fully dedicated to \nLebanon's future as a model for independent and sovereign democracy in \nthe Middle East. We cannot abandon the Lebanese people and our shared \nideals at this critical moment. The stakes are simply too high--for \nLebanon, for the Middle East, and for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14479-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TODAY'S ARMS RACE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the danger involved in combating crime in \nour Nation is escalating. Police departments across the country are \nbeing forced into a dangerous arms race with criminals and gangs. \nIncreasingly confronted with assault rifles capable of firing up to 600 \nrounds per minute, law enforcement officers have been forced to carry \nmilitary-style arms in order to counter such criminal firearm \nsupremacy.\n  Recently, tensions have increased throughout south Florida's police \ndepartments after three Miami-Dade police officers were wounded and \nanother killed by a man using an assault weapon. In a recent interview \nwith CNN, Sergeant Laurie Pfeil, who supervises a sheriff's road patrol \nin Palm Beach County, stated that, ``It's not nice we have to arm \nourselves like the soldiers in Iraq. We are like soldiers. It is a \nwar.''\n  Over 60 police officers have been gunned down so far this year in the \nUnited States. According to Robert Tessaro, the associate director for \nlaw enforcement relations for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence, we are currently on pace to set an alltime high. ``We're \nhaving more than one officer shot and killed a week. It's just \noutrageous that officers are being targeted. It's something all \nAmericans should be outraged about.'' Like many others, he lays the \nblame for this increase on the expiration of the assault weapons ban.\n  ``It's different now. It's shootings on a weekly basis. Ten years \nago, that just didn't happen. They don't get out and run from us \nanymore. They stop, and they're shooting at us,'' Sergeant Pfeil went \non to say. ``They don't have .38s anymore. They have AK-47s . . . They \nhave automatic weapons now.''\n  Miami Chief of Police John Timoney said he began noticing a \nsignificant increase in the use of automatic weapons used in crimes \ndating from the time the assault weapons ban was permitted to lapse. \nThis increase includes an 18 percent increase last year and 20 percent \nincrease this year.\n  The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the sale of 19 of the highest \npowered and most lethal firearms produced. Additionally, it prohibited \nthe sale of semiautomatic weapons that incorporated a detachable \nmagazine and two or more specific military features. These features \nincluded folding telescoping stocks, threaded muzzles or flash \nsuppressors, protruding pistol grips, bayonet mounts, barrel shrouds, \nor grenade launchers.\n  I voted to establish the assault weapons ban, and 10 years later I \njoined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend the ban \nfor another 10 years. Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming support \nof the law enforcement community, the ongoing threat of terrorism, and \nbipartisan support in the Senate, neither President Bush nor the \nRepublican congressional leadership acted to protect Americans from \nassault weapons like the one used in the attack on the Miami-Dade \npolice officers. As a result, police officers across the country are \nbeing forced to counter previously banned military-style assault \nweapons.\n  This Congress, as in previous ones, I will once again cosponsor the \nreinstating the assault weapons ban. Congress must take up and pass \nthis piece of sensible gun safety legislation to aid our law \nenforcement agencies and to help prevent such tragedies from occurring \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14479-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14479-S14480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n    17TH ANNUAL COVENANT HOUSE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL FOR HOMELESS YOUTH\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on November 15, 2007, Covenant \nHouse will mark their 17th annual Candlelight Vigil for Homeless Youth. \nThis Vigil will bring together individuals from\n\n[[Page S14480]]\n\nmore than 500 sites throughout North America to keep the light of hope \nburning for homeless youth. Covenant House provides quality, effective \ncare for homeless and runaway youth and we are proud that our State of \nNew York is home to Covenant House's headquarters.\n  Emergency health care, shelter, and treatment of the homeless in New \nYork City cost an average of $40,000 per person each year, placing a \nstaggering and unsustainable social and economic burden on State and \nlocal governments. Covenant House, the Nation's largest privately \nfunded agency for homeless youth and young adults, is helping to \nrelieve some of this burden by providing resident and non-resident \nservices to nearly 66,000 youths in 2006 alone.\n  Covenant House has provided more than 1 million young people with the \nsupport necessary to transition from life on the streets to a life with \na future. Covenant House uses successful programs and services--\nincluding counseling, transitional living programs, educational and \nvocational training, health services, and drug abuse treatment and \nprevention programs--that help transform the lives of these individuals \nat an early stage.\n  Still, more work needs to be done. As we speak, nearly 1.3 million \nchildren and young adults are homeless and living on the streets \nthroughout our Nation, with roughly 5,000 of these youth dying from \nassault, illness, or suicide. The Candlelight Vigil for Homeless Youth \nwill honor the memory of these young people who have died alone and \nanonymously while living on our streets and raise awareness about \ngrowing crisis of youth homelessness. As Sister Tricia, executive \ndirector of Covenant House, has said, ``The Vigil is for every kid who \nruns away, convinced they'll be safer on the street than at home, where \nthey hope to escape abusive or dangerous environments. That's why we \nstand together with candles, to light their way to Covenant House, \nwhere they will be safe, treated with dignity and loved without \ncondition.''\n  Many of the youth living and dying on our Nation's streets are former \nfoster care children who have aged out of the system. Though they are \ntoo old for the foster care system, they are often too young and ill \nprepared for self-sufficient living without the assistance of a family \nor support system. Unemployment and a lack of education among these \nyoung people can lead to a life of poverty, crime, and drug abuse. The \nchallenges facing young men and women today are overwhelming. For youth \nwho are faced with a life on the streets, the need for a guiding light \nis often a matter of life and death.\n  The Covenant House has used successful programs to help transform the \nlives of these individuals at an early stage. Senator Schumer and I are \npleased to stand with Covenant House as together we work to keep the \nlight of hope burning bright for all of our young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14480-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                  VISIT OF THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to extend my welcome to Prime \nMinister Yasuo Fukuda of Japan, who is visiting Washington today.\n  Japan is a critical ally and friend of the United States. I believe \nour alliance is fundamental to a peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific \nregion.\n  The Prime Minister's visit comes at an important time. It is crucial \nthat our two countries maintain the positive momentum in our \nrelationship and work closely together to accomplish shared goals, such \nas denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, stability in South Asia, \nnonproliferation in Iran, and political reform in Burma. As a long-\nstanding ally, we must consult closely and respect Japan's \nperspectives, even as we contemplate next steps in our negotiations \nwith nations like North Korea.\n  Thousands of miles away from the Korean peninsula, we face the \nresurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan and in the border \nregions of Pakistan. We are all too familiar with the reports that \nsuggest the Taliban and al-Qaida are gaining strength. We were reminded \nof this fact in an unsettling report in Tuesday's Washington Post, but \nthe most troubling report of all was last July, when the declassified \nNational Intelligence Estimate warned of a persistent and growing \nthreat from a reconstituted al-Qaida sanctuary in northwest Pakistan.\n  It is therefore critical that the U.S. and its partners in the \ninternational community, including Japan, maintain our focus and \noperations in this region.\n  In particular, I wanted to extend to the Prime Minister my \nappreciation for the support that Japan's Self Defense Forces have \noffered U.S. operations in Afghanistan, and hope Japan's deployment of \nrefueling tankers will quickly be reauthorized and be extended.\n  Our half century alliance with Japan remains vital, based on common \nvalues and shared interests. There is ample room for improved efforts \nto forge an even stronger and enduring global security partnership. I \nhope that Prime Minister Fukuda's visit will continue the progress \ntoward that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14480-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14480-S14481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF PROFESSORS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the accomplishments of Maxine Pierce Frost, a longtime \ncommunity leader in Riverside, CA, and nationally renown leader in \neducation. This month, Maxine Frost will retire from the Riverside \nUnified School District after 40 years of dedicated service.\n  Since 1967, Maxine Frost has provided leadership to her community, \nthe State of California, and our Nation. As a board member of the \nRiverside Unified School District, Frost has seen great change in \neducation policy throughout her tenure. Being a member of the first \nlarge school district in the Nation to voluntarily desegregate, she has \nhelped pave the way for similar changes across America.\n  Throughout periods of intense growth in the State and the region, \nMaxine Frost has worked diligently to ensure that students and \neducators are provided with adequate resources. The Riverside Unified \nSchool District has grown from roughly 23,000 students to 43,000 \nstudents during Frost's tenure. Throughout this period of intense \ngrowth, she has maintained her resolve that every student have the \nresources they need to succeed.\n  Numerous academic committees across the State of California and our \nNation have benefitted from the leadership and experience of Maxine \nFrost. She has held a number of leadership posts: president of the \nPacific Region of National School Boards Association, the California \nSchool Boards Association Legislative Network, the California \nAssociation of Suburban School Districts, the Schools Accrediting \nCommissions, the Council for Basic Education, and the California \nAssociation of Student Council's Board of Directors. In 1981, after \nserving as president of the California School Boards Association, \nCalifornia Governor George Deukmejian appointed her to the Education \nCommission of the States, in which she served alongside future \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton, who chaired the commission at that \ntime.\n  On October 16, 2006, the Riverside Unified School District adopted a \nresolution to designate one of its elementary schools as, Maxine Frost \nElementary School, in honor of her longtime service and dedication to \nthe community.\n  As she retires from four decades of service and dedication to the \nstudents, families, and educators of California and our Nation, I am \npleased to ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her fine \nwork. Her tremendous leadership will be long remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14481-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORIAM: ROBERT GERARD GOULET\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of the late Robert Gerard Goulet, the beloved \nrecording, movie, theater, and television star. Mr. Goulet passed away \non October 30, 2007. He was 73 years old.\n  Robert Gerard Goulet was born on November 26, 1933, in Lawrence, MA, \nto French Canadian parents, Jeanette and Joseph Goulet. Shortly after \nhis father's untimely passing, he and his family moved to Alberta, \nCanada. His abundant talents and charisma were evident at a young age, \nas Mr. Goulet became a popular singer on Canadian television as a \nprecocious teenager.\n  In 1960, Mr. Goulet made his Broadway debut as Sir Lancelot in the \noriginal production of ``Camelot,'' starring opposite Julie Andrews and \nRichard Burton. After hearing Mr. Goulet sing during the first day of \nrehearsals, Mr. Burton compared his rich baritone voice to ``the voice \nof an angel.'' Mr. Goulet's performance won him wide acclaim, including \nthe Theater World Award, and recognition as one of Broadway's most \ncaptivating and talented stars. In 1968, Mr. Goulet won the Tony Award \nfor best actor in a musical for his role as Jacques Bonnard in ``The \nHappy Time.''\n  A consummate entertainer, Mr. Goulet, who won a Grammy Award for Best \nNew Artist in 1962, has recorded over 60 albums. Throughout the 1960s \nand 1970s, he starred in a number of his own television specials and \nwas a popular guest on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' and other variety \nprograms. Mr. Goulet could also boast of an impressive resume on the \nbig screen, as he was featured in several successful movies, including \n``Honeymoon Hotel,'' ``Beetlejuice,'' and ``Toy Story II.'' Over the \ncourse of a career that spanned over half a century, Mr. Goulet's many \naccomplishments and successes cemented his status as one of America's \nmost versatile and beloved entertainers in recent memory.\n  A prostate cancer survivor, Mr. Goulet played an active role in \nhelping to increase the awareness of prostate health. He was a \nspokesman for the American Cancer Society and he regularly visited \ncommunities to educate others on the importance of cancer awareness, \nprevention, and early detection. In 2005, he was awarded the ``Human \nSpirit Award'' by The Wellness Community.\n  Throughout an illustrious career, Robert Gerard Goulet used his \nprestigious talents to bring joy and entertainment to millions of his \nfans and admirers from the world over. Mr. Goulet has left behind a \nlegacy of performing excellence. He will be missed.\n  Mr. Goulet is survived by his wife Vera; two sons, Christopher and \nMichael; daughter Nicolette; three grandchildren, Jordan, Gerard, and \nSolange.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14481-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14481-S14482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING VILLA MADONNA ACADEMY ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today I recognize the career and \nachievements of a great military officer, civilian leader, and friend. \nAfter a long and distinguished career culminating with nearly 44 years \nof service, LTG David Poythress will retire from the United States Air \nNational Guard, with the honor of being the first adjutant general of \nGeorgia to reach the rank of lieutenant general.\n  General Poythress was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1964, a \ntime in our Nation's history when serving in the military brought with \nit not only a requirement to face the enemy abroad but also the \nwillingness to serve despite a divided nation.\n  General Poythress received his law degree from Emory University in \n1967 and was a distinguished graduate of Emory's ROTC program. Shortly \nthereafter, he was called to active duty and served 1 year as chief of \nmilitary justice at DaNang Air Base, Vietnam. He served as a judge \nadvocate general in the Air Force Reserve, rising from the rank of \ncaptain to brigadier general. During this same time period, \ncomplimenting his military career, he served the State of Georgia \nhonorably as the assistant attorney general, the deputy state revenue \ncommissioner, the secretary of State of Georgia, and the State labor \ncommissioner.\n  In 1999, he was appointed as the adjutant general of Georgia, with \nhis tenure encompassing what may be the Georgia National Guard's most \ndynamic and demanding period in its 243-year history. Under General \nPoythress's leadership, the Georgia National Guard deployed nearly \n10,000 soldiers and airmen around the world in support of the global \nwar on terror, and more than 2,200 guardsmen to help Gulf Coast States \nfollowing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The Georgia Guard \ncompleted high profile/high risk security missions following September \n11, 2001, and also conducted dangerous operations on the Mexican \nborder.\n  General Poythress's contributions will be appreciated by generations \nof Georgia guardsmen far in the future. He was successful in achieving \nthe long-standing Georgia goal of legislation and funding for a State \nretirement plan for traditional guardsmen. He led the Georgia National \nGuard in winning the Oglethorpe Award for performance excellence. He \nalso oversaw Robins Air Force Base's 116th Air Control Wing's \ntransition from B-1s to a highly modernized Joint STARS unit.\n  General Poythress's noteworthy service and responsibilities have been \nwidely recognized. His distinguished honors include the Legion of \nMerit, the Meritorious Service Medal with one device, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal with one device, the Vietnam Service Medal with one \ndevice and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n  The Georgia National Guard will miss General Poythress's commitment \nto duty, ceaseless drive for improvement, and unwavering support for \nguardsmen, soldiers, and airmen everywhere. Although I will miss his \nservice in the capacity as adjutant general, I am especially pleased \nthat he will remain in the great State of Georgia and continue to serve \nboth publicly and privately as he has done throughout his life. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in wishing him well in all his future \nendeavors and hope that those who follow in his footsteps will continue \nhis legacy of support to Georgia and our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14482-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DICK SMITH\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, from humble beginnings as a seasonal \nfire fighter in Wyoming in the 1970s, Dick Smith built a fine career \nand developed an outstanding reputation as a Forest Service employee \nover his 35 years at the Agency. He retired from Federal service this \nfall, after achieving the position of Forest Supervisor for the Boise \nNational Forest. Although we are thrilled that he is able to now enjoy \nretirement, his absence will indeed be felt, to the detriment of the \nIdaho foresting community. Before taking a position in the Clearwater \nNational Forest, Dick worked seasonally in Alaska, Minnesota, and \nWyoming. In the 1970s and 1980s, he developed a strong foundation in \nforest management, silviculture, fire and project planning and obtained \na Master of Science in Forest Ecology. He worked for 15 years as a \nForest Silviculturalist. From 1989 to 1999, Dick served as District \nRanger in charge of overall management of the 460,000 acre Plains/\nThompson Falls District of the Lolo NF, in Plains, MT. During his \ntenure at this position, he earned a number of awards including the \nForest Service Director's Excellence Award for ``Positive Action and \nCommunity Leadership'' for the District's mineral management program \nand the Forest Service Northern Regional Forester's Honor Award for \n``Personal and Professional Excellence.'' His District received the \n1995 National Salvage Award for effectively taking advantage of salvage \nopportunities in an environmentally sensitive manner following large \nbark beetle outbreaks and significant wildfire activity on the unit \nunder his direction.\n  It is natural that such an individual would rise to the top in his \nagency, and Dick did exactly that. In 1999, the Forest Service brought \nhim here to Washington to serve on the policy analysis staff, and it \nwas at this time that I, too, was able to benefit from his hard work \nand expertise--directly. When I was first elected to the Senate, Dick \ncame to work for me as a Brookings Institute Fellow for 6 months and I \ngreatly benefited from his expertise and experience.\n  He returned to Idaho and was selected to serve as Supervisor of the \n2.6 million acre Boise National Forest in 2003. This position entails \ncoordinating forest management and supervisory activities with state \nagencies, other Federal agencies and the tribes. Then-Governor Dirk \nKempthorne appointed him to serve on the board of the Idaho Rural \nPartnership and the Citizens Advisory Panel to the Policy Analysis \nGroup for the University of Idaho.\n  While under Dick's leadership, the Boise National Forest was one of \nthe first national forests to complete and implement a fuels management \nproject under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. Dick's diligence and \ncommitment to intentional and effective forest management has placed \nthe Boise National Forest at the forefront of implementing hazardous \nfuels treatment and initiatives that support aquatic restoration, \nnoxious weed mitigation and recreation management. These endeavors are \nall the more challenging considering the growing wildland urban \ninterface that characterizes the Boise National Forest.\n  While excelling at his job, Dick maintained his involvement in \nprofessional and community organizations. In addition to membership in \nthe American Society of Foresters, Dick has been involved in Boy \nScouts, Little League, Jaycees, Lions Club, and various leadership \npositions with the Rotary Club in the communities in which he has lived \nover the years.\n  Dick and his wife, Sandy, plan to stay in the Boise area for \nretirement, enjoying the outdoors hiking, camping, fishing, backpacking \nand skiing--fitting pursuits for a man who has worked so hard to \npreserve and manage Idaho's beautiful natural resources for future \ngenerations. I appreciate Dick's wisdom and insight over the years; I \nhave depended on his analysis and advice on many forest management \nissues, and I wish him and Sandy well in the next chapter of their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14482-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14482-S14483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING DON AMERT\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A resolution adopted by the Interstate Oil and Gas \n     Compact Commission at their annual meeting relative to the \n     opinions of the oil and gas producing states on certain \n     matters; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n       POM-248.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     reauthorize Amtrak funding and support states in their \n     efforts to expand passenger rail service; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 107\n\n       Whereas, passenger rail service has historically focused on \n     long distance routes. States may provide shorter, regional \n     service if the state pays most of the cost. Fourteen states, \n     including Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, provide funding \n     support to Amtrak to support in-state and regional passenger \n     rail systems; and\n       Whereas, ridership on these shorter, regional routes has \n     increased dramatically in the past two years. Ticket sales on \n     Midwest intercity rail lines have reached record numbers. In \n     Michigan, ridership has risen by 31 percent on the Blue Water \n     passenger train and 20 percent on the Wolverine passenger \n     train over the past two years. The state hopes to add \n     passenger rail service between Detroit and Ann Arbor. \n     Expanded passenger rail service is being promoted as a \n     solution to rising oil prices, pollution, and increased \n     highway congestion; and\n       Whereas, states would like federal assistance in funding \n     the shorter passenger rail services. Federal matching dollars \n     are provided for other transportation modes, and states would \n     like to see a similar program for in-state and regional \n     passenger rail projects. Senate Bill 294, currently before \n     the United States Senate, would provide $19.2 billion in \n     reauthorization funds to Amtrak and provide grants to state \n     projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to reauthorize Amtrak funding and \n     support states in their efforts to expand passenger rail \n     service; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-250. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New York urging Congress to eliminate the expiration period \n     of the Federal Do Not Call Registry; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                            Senate No. 3582\n\n       Whereas, the Do Not Call Registry was established in the \n     State of New York in 2000 to protect citizens from unwanted \n     sales calls; it was made more effective in 2003, when it \n     merged with the National Do Not Call Registry; and\n       Whereas, the National Do Not Call Registry provides \n     citizens across the state and country with the privacy they \n     deserve and adequate penalties for businesses which violate \n     that privacy by persisting with unwanted phone calls; and\n       Whereas, the merging of the two Do Not Call Registries has \n     effectively protected New York State residents from \n     bothersome and unwanted phone solicitations for the last five \n     years; and\n       Whereas, due to the five year expiration of the National Do \n     Not Call Registry, many of the first enrollees will soon \n     again be vulnerable to telephone solicitations unless they \n     re-enroll: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That this Legislative Body pause in its \n     deliberations to urge the New York\n\n[[Page S14486]]\n\n     State Congressional Delegation to eliminate the 5-year \n     expiration date and make the National Do Not Call Registry \n     permanent; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution, suitably \n     engrossed, be transmitted to the President of the Senate of \n     the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of the Congress of the \n     United States from the State of New York.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-251. A resolution adopted by the Midwestern Legislative \n     Conference of the Council of State Governments expressing the \n     Council's support for improved vehicle fuel economy; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 sets tough fuel economy standards \n     without off ramps or loopholes, by requiring separate car and \n     truck standards to meet a total fleet fuel economy between 32 \n     and 35 mpg by 2022--an increase of as much as 40 percent over \n     current fuel economy standards--and requires vehicle fuel \n     economy to be increased to the maximum feasible level in the \n     years leading up to 2022; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927, while challenging, will provide \n     automakers more reasonable lead time to implement technology \n     changes in both the near- and long-term. Model year 2008 \n     vehicles are already available today, and product and \n     manufacturing planning is done through Model Year 2012. H.R. \n     2927 recognizes the critical need for engineering lead times \n     necessary for manufacturers to make significant changes to \n     their fleets; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 respects consumer choice by protecting \n     tie important functional differences between passenger cars \n     and light trucks/SUV's. Last year, 2006, was the sixth year \n     in a row that Americans bought more trucks, minivans, and \n     SUVs than passenger cars, because they value attributes such \n     as passenger and cargo load capacity, four-wheel drive, and \n     towing capability hat most cars are not designed to provide; \n     and\n       Whereas, while some would like fuel economy increases to be \n     much more aggressive and be implemented with much less lead \n     time, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards must be \n     set at levels and in time frames that do not impose economic \n     harm on the manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, and others in \n     the auto industry; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unrealistic and unattainable CAFE \n     standards cite Europe's 35 mpg fuel economy, without ever \n     mentioning Europe's $6 per gallon gasoline prices, the high \n     sales of diesel vehicles, the high proportion of Europeans \n     driving manual transmission vehicles (80 percent in Europe \n     vs. 8 percent in the U.S.), the significant differences in \n     the size mix of vehicles, or that trucks and SUVs are \n     virtually nonexistent among European households; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unreasonable CAFE standards claim \n     they will save consumers billions, but they neglect to talk \n     about the upfront costs of such changes to the manufacturers \n     of meeting unduly strict CAFE standards--more than $100 \n     billion, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration--which will lead to vehicle price increases of \n     several thousand dollars; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unrealistic CAFE standards ignore \n     the potential safety impacts of downsized vehicles on \n     America's highways and overlook the historical role and \n     critical importance of manufacturing plants to our national \n     and economic security. They seem unconcerned about threats to \n     the 7.5 million jobs that are directly and indirectly \n     dependent on a vibrant auto industry in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 is a reasonable bill that balances a \n     number of important public policy concerns. The bill \n     represents a tough but fair compromise that deserves serious \n     consideration and support: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, by the Council of State Governments Midwestern \n     Legislative Conference, That we memorialize the United States \n     Congress to enact H.R..1927, which responsibly balances \n     achievable fuel economy increases with important economic and \n     social concerns, including consumer demand; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution be submitted to the \n     President of the U.S. Senate, the Speaker of the U.S. House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the congressional \n     delegations of all Midwestern Legislative Conference states.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-252. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania urging Congress \n     to override the President's veto of the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007; to the \n     Committee of Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 447\n\n       Whereas, the highly successful State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP), created by the Federal Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, has enabled states to provide health care \n     coverage to more than 6 million uninsured low-income children \n     in this country; and\n       Whereas, through the program's enhanced Federal match \n     funding, Pennsylvania is currently helping to provide health \n     care coverage to more than 164,000 low-income children who do \n     not qualify for Medicaid and would otherwise be uninsured; \n     and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania led the nation in launching the first \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1992 and \n     provided the model for Federal support of all states; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Pennsylvania continued its leadership by \n     expanding affordable health care coverage to uninsured \n     children through its Cover All Kids program; and\n       Whereas, the Children's Health Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, H.R. 976, is a bipartisan \n     compromise plan to reauthorize the SCHIP program, which \n     expired on September 30, 2007, and to expand coverage to an \n     additional 3.8 million children; and\n       Whereas, on October 3, 2007, the President of the United \n     States vetoed H.R. 976, citing philosophical differences with \n     regard to the expansion of the program; and\n       Whereas, this veto will severely hamper Pennsylvania's \n     efforts to help more than 133,000 remaining uninsured \n     children obtain access to health care coverage; and\n       Whereas, it is critical that this legislation be enacted to \n     ensure affordable health care coverage for all uninsured \n     children: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania condemn the veto by the \n     President of the United States of the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United \n     States to override the veto; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-253 A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     override the President's veto of the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 201\n\n       Whereas, since 1997, the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCRIP) has provided health insurance for children \n     under age 19 from low income families who are not eligible \n     for Medicaid. The program allocated over $40 billion for \n     SCRIP through 2007 to states that provided matching funds to \n     plan a SCRIP program, to expand their Medicaid program, or to \n     implement a combined program relying on Medicaid and separate \n     private plans; and\n       Whereas, the compromise SCHIP bill passed by Congress was \n     vetoed by President Bush. This bipartisan measure would have \n     reauthorized the program and added $35 billion over the next \n     five years to cover 10 million children, including the 6.6 \n     million currently covered and 4 million additional uninsured \n     children; and\n       Whereas, the number of uninsured children declined by \n     26.6%, resulting in nearly 79,000 more children having health \n     care coverage than ten years ago. MI Child has operated in \n     conjunction with the Medicaid program to provide a much-\n     needed safety net for Michigan's children; and\n       Whereas, an override of this veto is crucial to providing \n     access to health care for millions of children. Expansion of \n     this successful program is long overdue and strongly \n     supported by the American people. Politics and misplaced \n     priorities should not supersede a bipartisan solution to \n     protect the health and lives of our most vulnerable \n     citizens--innocent children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to override the \n     President's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP); and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-254. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania expressing \n     support for ``National Food Safety Education Month''; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 398\n\n       Whereas, in 1994, the National Restaurant Association \n     Educational Foundation's (NRAEF) International Food Safety \n     Council created ``National Food Safety Education Month'' as \n     an annual campaign; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of ``National Food Safety Education \n     Month'' is to strengthen food safety education and training \n     among persons in the restaurant and food service business and \n     to educate the public on the safe handling and preparation of \n     food; and\n       Whereas, there are more than 200 known foodborne diseases \n     caused by viruses, toxins and metals and usually stemming \n     from the improper handling, preparation or storage of food; \n     and\n       Whereas, bacteria are the common cause of the foodborne \n     illness; and\n       Whereas, foodborne illness costs the United States economy \n     billions of dollars each year in lost productivity, \n     hospitalization, long-term disability and even death; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture \n     estimated that in 2000 medical costs and losses in \n     productivity resulting from five bacterial foodborne \n     pathogens was $6.9 billion; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that in 2001 the annual cost of \n     salmonellosis caused by the\n\n[[Page S14487]]\n\n     Salmonella bacteria was $2.14 billion, including medical \n     costs, the cost of time lost from work and the cost or value \n     of premature death; and\n       Whereas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) estimates that in the United States, there are 76 \n     million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths \n     per year due to consumption of food contaminated with \n     pathogenic microorganisms; and\n       Whereas, numerous cases have occurred in the United States \n     and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: 2007--Salmonella from \n     peanut butter in 44 states, 425 cases; 2006--E. coli in eight \n     states from fresh spinach, 205 cases, including 3 deaths; and \n     2003--hepatitis A from Chi-Chi's sourced green onions in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, up to 2,000 cases of salmonellosis occur each year \n     in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, following four simple steps, consumers can keep \n     food safe from bacteria: clean--wash hands and surfaces \n     often; separate--do not cross-contaminate; cook--cook to \n     proper temperature; and chill--refrigerate promptly: \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania express full and enthusiastic \n     support for ``National Food Safety Education Month'' in \n     September 2007; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-255.

The network of national cemeteries under \n     the administration of the United States Department of Veteran \n     Affairs (VA) is a most appropriate expression of the respect \n     a grateful citizenry holds for those who have worn the \n     nation's uniforms and faced grave perils to safeguard our \n     freedoms; and\n       Whereas, ever since President Lincoln signed legislation \n     during the Civil War to create national cemeteries as final \n     resting places ``for soldiers who have died in the service of \n     the country,'' this network of cemeteries has grown. Today, \n     there are 141 national cemeteries, with 125 under the VA \n     National Cemetery Administration. New facilities are \n     regularly developed; and\n       Whereas, despite the growth in the number of national \n     cemeteries, including the addition of the Great Lakes \n     National Cemetery in Holly that opened in 2005, veterans in \n     our Upper Peninsula remain very far from any such facility. \n     In fact, the nearest national cemeteries are hundreds of \n     miles away, near Milwaukee and Minneapolis. This distance \n     presents a significant obstacle for the families of many \n     veterans. We should do all we can to make this measure of \n     honor and respect more readily available to all veterans: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide for the construction and \n     maintenance of a national cemetery in Michigan's Upper \n     Peninsula; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14487-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills were read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 719.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nhuman-animal hybrids; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Human-\nAnimal Hybrid Prohibition Act, joined by Senator Landrieu and 15 other \ncosponsors.\n  A healthy imagination is a good thing in a young child. Children may \ndream of becoming a firefighter or an astronaut. In the case of really \nyoung children--especially when they love animals--they may even \nimagine being a horse or a dog. I don't see any harm in this . . . as \nlong as there is a general attachment to reality as the child matures.\n  However, today, we are starting to see such wildly imaginative dreams \nbeing transformed into reality in a few rogue science labs in this \ncountry and abroad. Efforts are being marshaled to push us in the \ndirection of experiments to create human-animal hybrids. Amazingly, \nhere at the dawn of the 21st century, the Island of Dr. Moreau is \nbecoming more than a fiction.\n  The legislation that we introduce today is very modest in scope. \nThough a few researchers may argue that it goes too far, there are many \nmore who argue that it does not go far enough. I believe that the \nlegislation that we offer today, hits just the right chord to be in \ntune with our society's needs. We do not want to stifle legitimate \nscience. We only want to stop the efforts of mad scientists. In short, \nthis bill only bans the creation of organisms that truly blur the line \nbetween humans and animals.\n  For instance, the legislation is so modest that it does not view all \nhuman-animal mixes as ``hybrids.'' This is because we recognize that \nsome procedures--which currently use such techniques--do not blur the \nline between species. For example, a human with a replacement pig heart \nvalve--such as our former colleague, Senator Jesse Helms is not \nconsidered a hybrid under this bill. Additionally, mixes that do not \nblur the line between human and animal--such as a mouse created with a \nhuman immune system, on which drugs could be tested for AIDS patients \nwould not be banned. Again, this is because there is no blurring of the \nidentity of the creatures involved.\n  What is banned is the creation of hybrid creatures that blur the line \nbetween species. For instance, creating an animal with human \nreproductive organs or a primarily human brain would be prohibited \nbecause such a creature blurs the lines between the species. \nAdditionally banned are the creation of hybrids through experimental \ncloning techniques and/or the fusion of human and animal gametes. With \nthis common sense bipartisan legislation, we are basically going with \nthe most modest of bans in order to ensure that we do not infringe upon \nlegitimate scientific research.\n  This ban would only hinder the efforts of mad scientists and rogue \nresearchers. Legitimate scientists should have nothing to fear from the \nenactment of this legislative proposal.\n  There are many different reasons to support this legislation. This is \nreflected in the diverse groups that support this bill. On the right \nare groups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for \nAmerica; on the left are groups like Friends of the Earth and the \nInternational Center for Technology Assessment. Both sides have \ndifferent but equally valid reasons for supporting the Human-Animal \nHybrid Prohibition Act.\n  For now though, I would like to focus my attention on what I believe \nis the central ethical question: Why should we be opposed to human-\nanimal hybrids?\n  I would submit that it is much more than what some have termed, ``the \nYuck Factor.'' Rather, the reason to oppose human-animal hybrids is \nembedded in our very fabric as human beings. The reason to oppose the \ncreation of human-animal hybrids is that the creation of such entities \nis a grave violation of human dignity and a defilement of the human \nperson.\n  Human beings have a fundamental right to be born fully human. To \ncreate a human-animal hybrid whose identity as a member of the species \nHomo sapiens is in doubt is a violation of that human dignity and a \ngrave injustice.\n  Think about this for a minute. What if--beyond your control--some mad \nscientist were to have created you as only 80-percent or 50-percent \nhuman. That would not be fair to you, but it would be something that \nyou could not change and it would be something that you would have to \nlive with for the whole of your existence on earth.\n  The fundamental issue is the dignity of the human person, but it does \nquickly move into other issues, such as the creation of a sub-human \nservant class, or maybe even a super-human class that comes to dominate \nhumanity.\n  In the year 2000, one of the first attempts at human-animal hybrids \nwas made. It was a vanguard attempt, which was shamed back into the \nsilence of the mad scientist laboratory from which it came; but now as \nsome scientists are trying to bring human-animal hybrids more into the \nmainstream, an essay on the year 2000 attempt is worth considering \nagain. The essay, entitled, ``The Pig-Man Cometh'' appeared in the \nOctober 23, 2000, Weekly Standard, and from this piece I will quote \nextensively. In the piece, J. Bottum wrote:\n\n       On Thursday, October 5, it was revealed that biotechnology \n     researchers had successfully created a hybrid of a human \n     being and a pig. A man-pig. A pig-man. The reality is so \n     unspeakable, the words themselves don't want to go together.\n       Extracting the nuclei of cells from a human fetus and \n     inserting them into a pig's egg cells, scientists from an \n     Australian company called Stem Cell Sciences and an American \n     company called Biotransplant grew two of the pig-men to 32-\n     cell embryos before destroying them. The embryos would have \n     grown further, the scientists admitted, if they had been \n     implanted in the womb of either a sow or a woman. Either a \n     sow or a woman. A woman or a sow.\n       There has been some suggestion from the creators that their \n     purpose in designing this human pig is to build a new race of \n     subhuman creatures for scientific and medical use. . . .\n       But what difference does it make whether the researchers' \n     intention is to create subhumans or superhumans? Either they \n     want to make a race of slaves, or they want to make a race of \n     masters. And either way, it means the end of our humanity.\n       You can't say we weren't warned. This is the island of Dr. \n     Moreau. This is the brave new world. This is Dr. \n     Frankenstein's chamber. This is Dr. Jekyll's room. This is \n     Satan's Pandemonium, the city of self-destruction the rebel \n     angels wrought in their all-consuming pride.\n       But now that it has actually come--manifest, inescapable, \n     real--there don't seem to be words that can describe its \n     horror sufficiently to halt it. May God have mercy on us, for \n     our modern Dr. Moreaus--our proud biotechnicians, our most \n     advanced genetic scientists--have already announced that they \n     will have no mercy.\n       It's true that Stem Cell Sciences and Biotransplant have \n     now, under the weight of adverse publicity, decided to \n     withdraw their European patent application and modify their \n     American application. But they made no promise to stop their \n     investigations into the procedure. We simply have to rely \n     upon their sense of what is, as Mountford put it, ``ethically \n     immoral''--a sense sufficiently attenuated that they could \n     undertake the design of the pig-man in the first place. The \n     elimination of the human race has loomed into clear sight at \n     last.\n\n[[Page S14491]]\n\n       It used to be that even the imagination of this sort of \n     thing existed only to underscore a moral in a story. . . . \n     But we live at a moment in which British newspapers can \n     report on 19 families who have created test-tube babies \n     solely for the purpose of serving as tissue donors for their \n     relatives--some brought to birth, some merely harvested as \n     embryos and fetuses. A moment in which Harper's Bazaar can \n     advise women to keep their faces unwrinkled by having \n     themselves injected with fat culled from human cadavers. A \n     moment in which the Australian philosopher Peter Singer can \n     receive a chair at Princeton University for advocating the \n     destruction of infants after birth if their lives are likely \n     to be a burden. A moment in which the brains of late-term \n     aborted babies can be vacuumed out and gleaned for stem \n     cells.\n       In the midst of all this, the creation of a human-pig \n     arrives like a thing expected. We have reached the logical \n     end, at last. We have become the people that, once upon a \n     time, our ancestors used fairy tales to warn their children \n     against--and we will reap exactly the consequences those \n     tales foretold.\n\n  This was a grim philosophical essay, but the questions that it poses \nare worth reflecting upon--even if those questions make us cringe.\n  Will society exercise some responsibility, or will it be led, \nmindlessly going wherever the mad scientists want to go? Every week, it \nseems that there are new developments. Yesterday, the science journal \nNature published an article on advances in cloning technology using \nmonkeys. This is a slightly different issue than human-animal hybrids, \nbut it further illustrates the rapid changes, developments, and \nsurprises occurring in science. Such developments must be harnessed by \nsociety and directed toward good and ethical ends; and if the \ndevelopments cannot be directed to good ends, then they should be \nabandoned to the scrap heap of morally bankrupt ideas. If we neglect to \ndirect our course, we will be led to the brink of destruction.\n  I am more optimistic than the tone embodied in the Weekly Standard \nessay. I believe in the goodness of the American people and their \nelected representatives. I think that we can rise to the challenge to \nensure that the marvels of science are properly channeled to serve \nhumanity and human dignity.\n  Consideration and passage of the ``Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition \nAct,'' which we introduce today, would be a wonderful step in the right \ndirection.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nSenator Brownback of Kansas as a co-sponsor of S. 2358, the Human-\nAnimal Hybrid Prohibition Act. As stem cell research has progressed in \nrecent years, Federal law has remained troublingly silent over its \nproliferation. This bill would place a ban on the creation, transfer, \nor transportation of a human-animal hybrid. Human-animal hybrids are \ndefined as: a human embryo into which animal cells or genes are \nintroduced, making its humanity uncertain; a hybrid embryo created by \nfertilizing a human egg with non-human sperm; a hybrid embryo created \nby fertilizing a non-human egg with human sperm; a hybrid embryo \ncreated by introducing a non-human nucleus into a human egg; a hybrid \nembryo created by introducing a non-human egg with human sperm; an \nembryo containing mixed sets of chromosomes from both a human and \nanimal; an animal with human reproductive organs; an animal with a \nwhole or predominantly human brain.\n  In August of 2001, President Bush issued an executive order, allowing \nfor Federal funding for stem cell research on the then-existing stem \ncell lines. In November of that same year, he appointed a council to \nmonitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and \nregulations, and to consider all of the medical and ethical \nramifications of biomedical innovation. To date, this council has \nissued numerous reports on the bioethics issues involved in stem cell \nresearch.\n  Meanwhile, the scientific community has moved forward in its \nresearch. Just this morning, researchers from Oregon announced that \nthey successfully used cloning to produce monkey embryos and then \nextract stem cells from the embryos. The National Academies of Science \nreleased guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research in 2005 and \nagain in 2007. Everyday we, as Members of Congress, are faced with a \nfundamental question: How far we should go in the name of science?\n  There is no doubt that embryonic stem cell research holds the promise \nof curing diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and \ncancer. Even President Bush stressed the importance of federally-funded \nresearch in approving the original stem cell lines in 2001--he \nexplicitly stated that Federal dollars help attract the best and \nbrightest scientists and help ensure that new discoveries are widely \nshared at the largest number of research facilities.\n  Federal funding not only allows us to encourage and financially \nsupport this research, it allows us to use the power of the purse to be \nsure it is done in the most safe and ethical way possible. I support \nFederal funding for embryonic stem cell research provided that the \nembryos used in these studies are those that are in excess from the \nfertility process and are knowingly donated for this purpose. I have \nmet with many constituents suffering from life altering and fatal \ndiseases and they have told me the impact that this research may have \non their lives.\n  But what Senator Brownback and I come forward with today is not about \nstem cell research with existing embryos. This is about a practice that \nhas far-reaching ethical implications and brings into question our \nnotion of humanity. Scientists have begun experimenting with injecting \nhuman neural stem cells into the brain of an animal. They are looking \nto insert a human nucleus into the egg of an animal and vice versa. \nThey are looking to fertilize human eggs with non-human sperm and vice \nversa. They are on the verge of creating human-animal hybrids that \ntruly blur the line between species. While the stated purpose may be a \nnoble one--to advance medical research--the outcome is deplorable. At \nwhat point is scientific research going too far?\n  We believe we have reached that point. Creating human-animal hybrids \nopens the door to a host of concerns. It is a violation of basic human \ndignity. It also has the potential to threaten human health by \nintroducing infections from animal populations.\n  The human body is not a product to be mass produced and stripped for \nparts, even in the earliest stages of its development. Assembly lines, \npatents, and warehouses are appropriate terms when talking about cars \nor computers, but not people. If we allow the creation of human-animal \nhybrids for research purposes, the end result will be a system of \n``hatcheries'' where such ambiguous embryos are grown in mass. We hold \na certain value for the uniqueness of humans. To challenge that in the \nname of science will have consequences we cannot begin to predict or \nunderstand.\n  A ban on this procedure helps to redirect science to equally \npromising areas. In addition, such a ban does not ban cloning and \nnuclear transfer techniques for the production of DNA, molecules, cells \nother than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants and animals. The type \nof ban that I support does nothing to restrict the vast majority of \nmedical advancements that have and will continue to pave the way for \npotential cures for diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord \ninjuries, and cancer.\n  But as elected officials, we must take action on matters of such \ngrave importance. Our legislative leadership is badly needed in this \narea. For this reason, I ask for your support for the Human-Animal \nHybrid Prohibition Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Obama, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2369. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide \nthat certain tax planning inventions are not patentable, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my Colleague \nSenator Grassley in introducing legislation to provide that certain tax \nplanning inventions cannot be patented.\n  America's patent system promotes innovation and competitiveness in \nall industries.\n  Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution authorized Congress to \nestablish a patent system. That system is meant to protect inventors \nand promote the progress of science and ``useful arts.'' Today, we \nrefer to this as technological innovation.\n\n[[Page S14492]]\n\n  In the Patent Act of 1793, Congress enacted a broad definition for \ninventions that can be patented. But conditions were included. The \ndefinition for what could be patented in 1793 is remarkably similar to \nthe definition in the United States Code today. And not every process \nor discovery is patentable.\n  In 17th century England, the Crown would grant a monopoly over a \nparticular business line. Peter Meinhardt, in his book, ``Inventions, \nPatents and Monopoly,'' described these ``letters-patent'' that \nprovided exclusive manufacturing rights as enriching ``the grantee at \nthe expense of the community.'' This is what our Founders and Congress \nsought to avoid.\n  Today, a number of attorneys and accountants have begun applying for \nand obtaining tax patents. These involve financial products, banking, \nestate and gift, and tax preparation software.\n  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted at least 60 of these \ntax patents. About 90 applications are pending.\n  I have heard from tax practitioners, including those in Montana, who \nfear that tax patents will impede their ability to provide advice to \ntheir clients. They are concerned that even obvious applications of the \ntax law may become protected by tax patents. They also tell me that \nsome tax strategy patent applications appear to be for tax shelters and \nother tax-motivated transactions.\n  The Treasury is also concerned about patent protection for tax \nplanning methods. In September, Treasury issued proposed regulations \nrequiring the disclosure of transactions that use a patented tax \nstrategy.\n  While this is a step in the right direction, these rules do not go \nfar enough to fix the real problem.\n  A taxpayer shouldn't be in the position of choosing to file a return \nand pay a patent holder a fee for using a tax strategy in the return. \nNo one should have to pay a toll charge to comply with the tax laws.\n  They also should not have to conduct a due diligence check every time \nthat they comply with the tax laws to see if they are infringing a tax \npatent.\n  As I understand it, a taxpayer might use a tax strategy based on \nadvice from a tax practitioner. The practitioner would prepare and file \na tax return using the patented strategy. The tax practitioner's \nadvice, the taxpayer's use of the transaction, and the preparation and \nfiling of the tax return could all be considered patent infringement.\n  These tax patents can also create traps for the unwary. If taxpayers \nused a patented strategy, not knowing that it is not permitted under \nthe Internal Revenue Code, they could be subject to additional taxes, \npenalties and interest.\n  Congress has previously enacted laws to limit what can be patented. \nLimiting patentability for tax patents is another situation where \nCongress must act.\n  I introduce our bill today with Senator Grassley. There are a number \nof cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  It would provide that the Patent Trademark Office could not issue \npatents for tax planning inventions.\n  Tax planning inventions are generally tax plans, strategies, \ntechniques, schemes, processes, or systems that are designed to reduce, \nminimize, avoid, or defer a taxpayer's Federal or State tax liability.\n  There is an important exception. This change would not affect the use \nof tax preparation software to help practitioners and taxpayers prepare \ntax or information returns.\n  Title 26 of the U.S. Code contains the Internal Revenue Code, a \npublic law that is available to everyone. No one should have the \ncapability to monopolize the tax law through the patenting of tax \nstrategies. This is why I believe that these tax planning inventions \nshould not be granted patent protection.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAX PLANNING INVENTIONS NOT PATENTABLE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 101 of title 35, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Whoever'' and inserting ``(a) Patentable \n     Inventions.--Whoever'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Tax Planning Inventions.--\n       ``(1) Unpatentable subject matter.--A patent may not be \n     obtained for a tax planning invention.\n       ``(2) Definitions.--For purposes of paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) the term `tax planning invention' means a plan, \n     strategy, technique, scheme, process, or system that is \n     designed to reduce, minimize, avoid, or defer, or has, when \n     implemented, the effect of reducing, minimizing, avoiding, or \n     deferring, a taxpayer's tax liability or is designed to \n     facilitate compliance with tax laws, but does not include tax \n     preparation software and other tools or systems used solely \n     to prepare tax or information returns,\n       ``(B) the term `taxpayer' means an individual, entity, or \n     other person (as defined in section 7701 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986),\n       ``(C) the terms `tax', `tax laws', `tax liability', and \n     `taxation' refer to any Federal, State, county, city, \n     municipality, foreign, or other governmental levy, \n     assessment, or imposition, whether measured by income, value, \n     or otherwise, and\n       ``(D) the term `State' means each of the several States, \n     the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or \n     possession of the United States.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section--\n       (1) shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act,\n       (2) shall apply to any application for patent or \n     application for a reissue patent that is--\n       (A) filed on or after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, or\n       (B) filed before that date if a patent or reissue patent \n     has not been issued pursuant to the application as of that \n     date, and\n       (3) shall not be construed as validating any patent issued \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for an invention \n     described in section 101(b) of title 35, United States Code, \n     as added by this section.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Tax Patients\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Patents have increasingly been sought and issued for \n     various tax-related inventions, including strategies for \n     reducing a taxpayer's taxes.\n       In a 1998 case, State Street Bank, the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit (''Federal Circuit Court'') \n     held that a method of doing business could be patented. The \n     case involved a data processing system for a partnership \n     structure of mutual funds that had advantageous tax \n     consequences. The case has been considered a key decision \n     allowing the patenting of business methods of all types. \n     Since 1998, numerous tax-related patents have been issued or \n     applied for, in some cases involving tax strategies less \n     related to computer or other mechanical data processing \n     systems. More recently, the Federal Circuit Court has \n     indicated that some business methods are unpatentable.\n       The patents that have been granted or applied for have \n     involved many aspects of the tax law, including financial \n     products, charitable giving, estate planning, and tax \n     deferred exchanges.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Tax-related patents, if valid, remove from the public \n     domain particular ways to satisfy a taxpayer's legal \n     obligations. Tax-related inventions that have been patented \n     cannot be practiced without the permission of the patent \n     holder. Thus, a tax-related patent may have the effect of \n     forcing or encouraging taxpayers to pay more tax than they \n     would otherwise lawfully owe, either because taxpayers are \n     not able to engage in a particular transaction or financial \n     structure without the permission of the patent holder or \n     because, if permission is granted, such permission requires \n     payment of an undesirable charge. Taxpayers might seek other, \n     more questionable alternatives to the patented invention in \n     an attempt to avoid the scope of the patent. Unauthorized use \n     of patented inventions may have adverse consequences for \n     taxpayers or their advisers, who may face patent infringement \n     suits for using, or suggesting use, of patented tax-related \n     inventions. This could undermine uniform application of the \n     tax laws, decrease public confidence in the nation's tax \n     laws, and increase public dissatisfaction with tax laws if \n     compliance must be accompanied by patent searches and \n     licensing.\n       The availability of patent protection also could encourage, \n     in a variety of ways, the\n\n[[Page S14493]]\n\n     further development of aggressive tax shelter transactions or \n     of transactions that do not achieve the expected tax results. \n     For example, tax-related inventions do not necessarily have \n     to deliver their claimed tax benefits to be eligible for a \n     patent; yet strategies or methods that do not achieve the \n     intended tax result might be marketed as ``legitimate'' based \n     on the existence of a patent.\n       Finally, the creativity and ingenuity reflected in many tax \n     planning techniques developed over the years without patent \n     protection suggests that even without such protection there \n     are sufficient incentives for tax planning innovation.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, a patent may not be obtained for a tax \n     planning invention.\n       A tax planning invention means a plan, strategy, technique, \n     scheme, process, or system that is designed to reduce, \n     minimize, avoid, or defer, or has, when implemented, the \n     effect of reducing, minimizing, avoiding, or deferring, a \n     taxpayer's tax liability, or is designed to facilitate \n     compliance with tax laws, but does not include tax \n     preparation software and other tools or systems used solely \n     to prepare tax or information returns.\n       The term ``taxpayer'' is defined as an individual, entity, \n     or other person (as defined in section 7701 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986).\n       The terms ``tax,'' ``tax laws,'' ``tax liability,'' and \n     ``taxation'' refer to any Federal, State, county, city, \n     municipality, foreign, or other governmental levy, \n     assessment, or imposition, whether measured by income, value, \n     or otherwise.\n       The term ``State'' means each of the several States, the \n     District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or \n     possession of the United States.\n       No inference is intended as to whether any business method, \n     including any tax-related invention, is otherwise patentable \n     under present law, or as to whether any software is entitled \n     under present law to patent protection as distinct from \n     copyright protection.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision takes effect on the date of enactment.\n       The provision shall apply to any application for a patent \n     or application for a reissue patent that is (a) filed on or \n     after such date of enactment; or (b) filed before such date \n     if a patent or reissue patent has not been issued pursuant to \n     the application as of that date.\n       The provision shall not be construed as validating any \n     patent issued before the date of enactment for an invention \n     described in section 101(b) of title 35, United States Code, \n     as amended by this section.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this legislation that Senator Baucus and \nI are introducing changes the current rules governing tax patents. \nRecently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, has allowed the \npatenting of tax strategies. Because of the serious policy concerns \nabout this practice, our legislation would make tax strategies an \nunpatentable subject matter.\n  Tax patents are a relatively recent phenomenon. The rise of these \npatents can be traced back to the 1998 opinion of the Federal Circuit \nin State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group that rejected a per \nse rule that business methods could not be patented.\n  As of September 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had \nidentified 60 issued tax related patents, with another 99 published tax \npatent applications pending. The recent growth of these patents, \ncoupled with their deleterious effect on the tax system, necessitates \nlegislative action in this area.\n  Tax patents undermine the integrity and fairness of the Federal tax \nsystem. They place taxpayers in the undesirable position of having to \nchoose between paying more than legally required in taxes or paying a \nroyalty to a third party for use of a tax planning invention that \nreduces those taxes.\n  A patent holder can preclude others from using their tax strategy. \nThis may result in taxpayers paying more in taxes than is otherwise \nlegally required. An exclusive proprietary right should not be granted \nfor methods of compliance with the tax law, which is obligatory for \nall.\n  The patentability of tax strategies also adds another layer of \ncomplexity to the tax laws by requiring patent searches and potential \nexposure to patent infringement suits.\n  This legislation contains a general prohibition on ``tax planning \ninventions,'' with an exception for tax preparation software and other \ntools or systems used solely to prepare tax or information returns.\n  I hope that we can move this legislation quickly. The House has \nalready included a version of prohibiting tax strategy patents in their \ncomprehensive patent reform bill. The Senate should act as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2370. A bill to clear title to certain real property in New Mexico \nassociated with the Middle Rio Grande Project, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Biological Park Title Clarification Act with my colleague \nSenator Domenici. A slightly different version of this bill passed the \nSenate during the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congress. We are introducing \nthis legislation again in hopes of assisting the City of Albuquerque, \nNew Mexico clear title to several parcels of land located along the Rio \nGrande. If title is cleared, the city will be free to proceed with \nplans to improve the properties as part of a biological park project, a \ncity funded initiative to create a premier environmental educational \ncenter for its citizens and the entire State of New Mexico.\n  The biological park project has been in the works since 1987 when the \ncity began to develop an aquarium and botanic garden along the banks of \nthe Rio Grande. Those facilities constitute just a portion of the \noverall project. As part of this effort, in 1997, the city purchased \ntwo properties from the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, MRGCD, \nfor $3,875,000. The first property, Tingley Beach, had been leased by \nthe city from MRGCD since 1931 and used for public park purposes. The \nsecond property, San Gabriel Park, had been leased by the city since \n1963, and also used for public park purposes.\n  In the year 2000, the city's plans were interrupted when the U.S. \nBureau of Reclamation asserted that in 1953, it had acquired ownership \nof all of MRGCD's property associated with the Middle Rio Grande \nProject. The United States assertion called into question the validity \nof the 1997 transaction between the city and MRGCD. Both MRGCD and the \ncity dispute the United States' claim of ownership.\n  This dispute is unnecessarily complicating the city's progress in \ndeveloping the biological park project. If the matter is left to \nlitigation, the delay will be indefinite. Reclamation has already \ndetermined that the two properties are surplus to the needs of the \nMiddle Rio Grande Project. In fact, the record indicates that \nReclamation once considered releasing its interest in the properties \nfor $1.00 each. Obviously, the Federal interest in these properties is \nlow while the local interest is high. This bill is tailored to address \nthis local interest by disclaiming any Federal interest in the two \nproperties at issue. To avoid future complications, the bill also \ndisclaims any Federal interest in several other parcels associated with \nthe BioPark. The general dispute concerning title to Middle Rio Grande \nProject works is left for the courts to decide.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me to resolve this issue. This \nbill represents a simple solution to a local problem caused by Federal \naction. I urge my colleagues to once again support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \ntechnical corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today we are pleased to introduce the Tax \nTechnical Corrections Act of 2007. Technical corrections measures are \nroutine for major tax acts, and are necessary to ensure that the \nprovisions of the acts are working consistently with congressional \nintent, or to provide clerical corrections. Because these measures \ncarry out congressional intent, no revenue gain or loss is scored from \nthem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Technical corrections are derived from a deliberative \nand consultative process among the Congressional and Administration tax \nstaffs. That means the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House \nWays and Means and Senate Finance Committees are involved, as is the \nstaff of the Treasury Department. All of this work is performed with \nthe participation and guidance of the nonpartisan staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. A technical enters the list only if all staffs \nagree it is appropriate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. By filing this bill, we hope interested parties and \npractitioners will comment and provide direction on further edits, \nadditions, or deletions. These comments should be submitted in a timely \nmanner. It is our hope that we can move this package of technicals in \nDecember if possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 383\n\n       Whereas Carl Stokes was a pioneer in cultivating a positive \n     climate for African-Americans to seek election to public \n     office and made great strides toward improving race relations \n     in a tumultuous period of United States history;\n       Whereas Carl Stokes was born on June 27, 1927, in \n     Cleveland, Ohio to Charles and Louise Stokes;\n       Whereas Carl Stokes rose from poverty in Outhwaite Homes, \n     Cleveland's first federally funded housing project for the \n     poor, to be elected to the highest political office in \n     Cleveland;\n       Whereas Carl Stokes earned his bachelor's degree from the \n     University of Minnesota in 1954 and graduated from the \n     Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in 1956, and was admitted \n     to the Ohio State Bar in 1957;\n       Whereas, in 1962, Carl Stokes was elected to the Ohio \n     General Assembly and served 3 terms as the first African-\n     American Democrat to serve from Cuyahoga County;\n       Whereas, in 1967, relying on his ability to mobilize \n     support that transcended racial divides, Carl Stokes was \n     elected Mayor of Cleveland and became the first African-\n     American mayor of a major American city;\n       Whereas, after declining to run for a 3rd term as Mayor of \n     Cleveland, Carl Stokes became the first African-American to \n     appear\n\n[[Page S14500]]\n\n     daily as an anchorman on a New York City television outlet, \n     WNBC-TV;\n       Whereas Carl Stokes served as a municipal judge in \n     Cleveland from 1983 to 1994, completing a political career \n     encompassing each branch of government; and\n       Whereas Carl Stokes maintained his dedication to public \n     service throughout his life, serving as Ambassador to the \n     Seychelles and representing the White House on numerous \n     goodwill trips abroad until his death in 1996: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the pioneering career of Carl Stokes, who \n     helped expand political opportunity for minorities by \n     becoming the first African-American mayor of a major American \n     city; and\n       (2) commemorates the 40th anniversary of the election of \n     Carl Stokes as the Mayor of Cleveland and the first African-\n     American mayor of a major American city, one of the most \n     significant events in the American Civil Rights movement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14500-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 384--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF NATIONAL \n    ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH BY PROMOTING NATIONAL \n AWARENESS OF ADOPTION AND THE CHILDREN AWAITING FAMILIES, CELEBRATING \n CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN ADOPTION, AND ENCOURAGING AMERICANS \n     TO SECURE SAFETY, PERMANENCY, AND WELL-BEING FOR ALL CHILDREN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Thune, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 384\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 514,000 children in the \n     foster care system in the United States, approximately \n     115,000 of whom are waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 52 percent of the children in foster care are age \n     10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is over 2 years;\n       Whereas, for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas the number of youth who ``age out'' of foster care \n     by reaching adulthood without being placed in a permanent \n     home has increased by 41 percent since 1998, and nearly \n     25,000 foster youth age out every year;\n       Whereas every day loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a recent survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that though ``Americans \n     overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in \n     particular foster care adoption . . . foster care adoptions \n     have not increased significantly over the past five years'';\n       Whereas, while 3 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, \n     a majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of adopting children from foster care and the children who \n     are eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 71 percent of those who have considered adoption \n     consider adopting children from foster care above other forms \n     of adoption;\n       Whereas 45 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 46 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas, since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, \n     nearly 17,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas, in 2006, adoptions were finalized for over 3,300 \n     children through more than 250 National Adoption Day events \n     in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; \n     and\n       Whereas, on October 31, 2007, the President proclaimed \n     November 2007 as National Adoption Month, and National \n     Adoption Day is on November 17, 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the citizens of the United States to \n     consider adoption during the month of November and all \n     throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14500-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14500-S14502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3679.

A \n     substantial part of this increase in market concentration is \n     the direct result of mergers and acquisitions that the \n     antitrust enforcement agencies did not challenge, in part \n     because of the lack of guidelines focused on identifying \n     particular structural characteristics in the agricultural \n     industry and the adverse competitive effects that such \n     acquisitions and mergers would create.\n       (iii) The cost of transportation, impact on quality, and \n     delay in sales of agricultural commodities if they are to be \n     transported to more distant buyers may result in narrow \n     geographic markets with respect to buyer power.\n       (iv) Buyers have no economic incentive to bid up the price \n     of agricultural commodities in the absence of effective \n     competition. Further, the nature of buying may make it \n     feasible for larger numbers of buyers to engage in tacit or \n     overt collusion to restrain price competition.\n       (v) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have \n     incentives to engage in unfair, discriminatory, and \n     exclusionary acts that cause producers of agricultural \n     commodities to receive less than a competitive price for \n     their goods, transfer economic risks to sellers without \n     reasonable compensation, and exclude sellers from access to \n     the market.\n       (vi) Markets for agricultural commodities often involve \n     contexts in which many producers have relatively limited \n     information and bargaining power with respect to the sale of \n     their commodities. These conditions invite buyers with \n     significant oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power to exercise \n     that power in ways that involve discrimination and undue \n     differentiation among sellers.\n       (B) Issuance of guidelines.--After consideration of the \n     findings under subparagraph (A), the Assistant Attorney \n     General and the Chairman, in consultation with the Special \n     Counsel, shall issue agricultural guidelines that--\n       (i) facilitate a fair, open, accessible, transparent, and \n     efficient market system for agricultural products;\n       (ii) recognize that not decreasing competition in the \n     purchase of agricultural products by highly concentrated \n     firms from a sector in perfect competition is entirely \n     consistent with the objective of the antitrust laws to \n     protect consumers and enhance consumer benefits from \n     competition; and\n       (iii) require the Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Chairman, as the case may be, to challenge any merger or \n     acquisition in the agricultural industry, if the effect of \n     that merger or acquisition may be to substantially lessen \n     competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n       (C) Contents.--The agricultural guidelines issued under \n     subparagraph (B) shall consist of merger guidelines relating \n     to existing and potential competition and vertical \n     integration that--\n       (i) establish appropriate methodologies for determining the \n     geographic and product markets for mergers affecting \n     agricultural commodity markets;\n       (ii) establish thresholds of increased concentration that \n     raise a concern that the merger will have an adverse effect \n     on competition in the affected agricultural commodities \n     markets;\n       (iii) identify potential adverse competitive effects of \n     mergers in agricultural commodities markets in a nonexclusive \n     manner; and\n       (iv) identify the factors that would permit an enforcement \n     agency to determine when a merger in the agricultural \n     commodities market might avoid liability because it is not \n     likely to have an adverse effect on competition.\n       (2) Agriculture competition task force working group on \n     buying power.--In issuing agricultural guidelines under this \n     subsection, the Chairman and the Assistant Attorney General \n     shall consult with the working group on buyer power of the \n     Task Force established under subsection (b)(4).\n       (3) Completion.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) issue agricultural guidelines under this subsection;\n       (B) submit to Congress the agricultural guidelines issued \n     under this subsection; and\n       (C) submit to Congress a report explaining the basis for \n     the guidelines, including why it incorporated or did not \n     incorporate each recommendation of the working group on buyer \n     power of the Task Force established under subsection (b)(4).\n       (4) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall jointly submit a report to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the\n\n[[Page S14531]]\n\n     House of Representatives regarding the issuing of \n     agricultural guidelines under this subsection.\n       (e) Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition.--\n       (1) In general.--The Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 \n     U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is amended--\n       (A) by striking the title I heading and all that follows \n     through ``This Act'' and inserting the following:\n\n                     ``TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                       ``Subtitle A--Definitions\n\n     ``SEC. 1.

REPORT RELATING TO THE ENDING OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER \n                   IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the highest rate of childhood \n     poverty in the industrialized world, with over \\1/5\\ of all \n     children of the United States living in poverty, and almost \n     half of those children living in extreme poverty;\n       (2) childhood poverty in the United States is growing \n     rather than diminishing;\n       (3) households with children experience hunger at more than \n     double the rate as compared to households without children;\n       (4) hunger is a major problem in the United States, with \n     the Department of Agriculture reporting that 12 percent of \n     the citizens of the United States (approximately 35,000,000 \n     citizens) could not put food on the table of those citizens \n     at some point during 2006;\n       (5) of the 35,000,000 citizens of the United States that \n     have very low food security--\n       (A) 98 percent of those citizens worried that money would \n     run out before those citizens acquired more money to buy more \n     food;\n       (B) 96 percent of those citizens had to cut the size of the \n     meals of those citizens or even go without meals because \n     those citizens did not have enough money to purchase \n     appropriate quantities of food; and\n       (C) 94 percent of those citizens could not afford to eat \n     balanced meals;\n       (6) the phrase ``people with very low food security'', a \n     new phrase in our national lexicon, in simple terms means \n     ``people who are hungry'';\n       (7) 30 percent of black and Hispanic children, and 40 \n     percent of low income children, live in households that do \n     not have access to nutritionally adequate diets that are \n     necessary for an active and healthy life;\n       (8) the increasing lack of access of the citizens of the \n     United States to nutritionally adequate diets is a \n     significant factor from which the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention concluded that ``during the \n     past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity \n     in the United States'';\n       (9) during the last 3 decades, childhood obesity has--\n       (A) more than doubled for preschool children and \n     adolescents; and\n       (B) more than tripled for children between the ages of 6 \n     and 11 years;\n       (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, approximately \n     9,000,000 children who are 6 years old or older are \n     considered obese;\n       (11) scientists have demonstrated that there is an inverse \n     relation between obesity and doing well in school; and\n       (12) a study published in Pediatrics found that ``6- to 11-\n     year-old food-insufficient children had significantly lower \n     arithmetic scores and were more likely to have repeated a \n     grade, have seen a psychologist, and have had difficulty \n     getting along with other children''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national disgrace that many millions of \n     citizens of the United States, a disproportionate number of \n     whom are children, are going hungry in this great nation, \n     which is the wealthiest country in the history of the world;\n       (2) because the strong commitment of the United States to \n     family values is deeply undermined when families and children \n     go hungry, the United States has a moral obligation to \n     abolish hunger; and\n       (3) through a variety of initiatives (including large \n     funding increases in nutrition programs of the Federal \n     Government), the United States should abolish child hunger \n     and food insufficiency in the United States by the 2013.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     relevant committees of Congress a report that describes the \n     best and most cost-effected manner by which the Federal \n     Government could allocate an increased amount of funds to new \n     programs and programs in existence as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act to achieve the goal of abolishing child \n     hunger and food insufficiency in the United States by 2013.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3747.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle \n     Equality Act''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can eradicate salmonella from turtles \n     up until the point of sale, and individuals are more aware of \n     the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, \n     and the seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regimen that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of \n     Agriculture should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 \n     centimeters in diameter as pets as long as the sellers are \n     required to use proven methods to treat these turtles for \n     salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. REVIEW, REPORT, AND ACTION ON THE SALE OF BABY \n                   TURTLES.\n\n       (a) Pet Turtle.--In this section, the term ``pet turtle'' \n     means a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in \n     diameter.\n       (b) Prevalence of Salmonella.--Not later than 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this title, the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food \n     and Drugs, shall determine the prevalence of salmonella in \n     each species of reptile and amphibian sold legally as a pet \n     in the United States in order to determine whether the \n     prevalence of salmonella in reptiles and amphibians sold \n     legally as pets in the United States on average is not more \n     than 10 percent less than the percentage of salmonella in pet \n     turtles.\n       (c) Action if Prevalence Is Similar.--If the prevalence of \n     salmonella in reptiles and amphibians sold legally as pets in \n     the United States on average is more than 10 percent less \n     than the percentage of salmonella in pet turtles--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture shall--\n       (A) conduct a study to determine how pet turtles can be \n     sold safely as pets in the United States and provide \n     recommendations to Congress not later than 150 days after the \n     date of such determination;\n       (B) in conducting such study, consult with all relevant \n     stakeholders, such as the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the turtle farming industry, academia, and the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics; and\n       (C) examine the safety measures taken to protect \n     individuals from salmonella-related\n\n[[Page S14557]]\n\n     dangers involved with reptiles and amphibians sold legally in \n     the United States that contain a similar or greater presence \n     of salmonella than that of pet turtles; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Agriculture--\n       (A) may not prohibit the sale of pet turtles in the United \n     States; or\n       (B) shall prohibit the sale in the United States of any \n     reptile or amphibian that contains a similar or greater \n     prevalence of salmonella than that of pet turtles.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3764.

A \n     substantial part of this increase in market concentration is \n     the direct result of mergers and acquisitions that the \n     antitrust enforcement agencies did not challenge, in part \n     because of the lack of guidelines focused on identifying \n     particular structural characteristics in the agricultural \n     industry and the adverse competitive effects that such \n     acquisitions and mergers would create.\n       (iii) The cost of transportation, impact on quality, and \n     delay in sales of agricultural commodities if they are to be \n     transported to more distant buyers may result in narrow \n     geographic markets with respect to buyer power.\n       (iv) Buyers have no economic incentive to bid up the price \n     of agricultural commodities in the absence of effective \n     competition. Further, the nature of buying may make it \n     feasible for larger numbers of buyers to engage in tacit or \n     overt collusion to restrain price competition.\n       (v) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have \n     incentives to engage in unfair, discriminatory, and \n     exclusionary acts that cause producers of agricultural \n     commodities to receive less than a competitive price for \n     their goods, transfer economic risks to sellers without \n     reasonable compensation, and exclude sellers from access to \n     the market.\n       (vi) Markets for agricultural commodities often involve \n     contexts in which many producers have relatively limited \n     information and bargaining power with respect to the sale of \n     their commodities. These conditions invite buyers with \n     significant oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power to exercise \n     that power in ways that involve discrimination and undue \n     differentiation among sellers.\n       (B) Issuance of guidelines.--After consideration of the \n     findings under subparagraph (A), the Assistant Attorney \n     General and the Chairman, in consultation with the Special \n     Counsel, shall issue agricultural guidelines that--\n       (i) facilitate a fair, open, accessible, transparent, and \n     efficient market system for agricultural products;\n       (ii) recognize that not decreasing competition in the \n     purchase of agricultural products by highly concentrated \n     firms from a sector in perfect competition is entirely \n     consistent with the objective of the antitrust laws to \n     protect consumers and enhance consumer benefits from \n     competition; and\n       (iii) require the Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Chairman, as the case may be, to challenge any merger or \n     acquisition in the agricultural industry, if the effect of \n     that merger or acquisition may be to substantially lessen \n     competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n       (C) Contents.--The agricultural guidelines issued under \n     subparagraph (B) shall consist of merger guidelines relating \n     to existing and potential competition and vertical \n     integration that--\n       (i) establish appropriate methodologies for determining the \n     geographic and product markets for mergers affecting \n     agricultural commodity markets;\n       (ii) establish thresholds of increased concentration that \n     raise a concern that the merger will have an adverse effect \n     on competition in the affected agricultural commodities \n     markets;\n       (iii) identify potential adverse competitive effects of \n     mergers in agricultural commodities markets in a nonexclusive \n     manner; and\n       (iv) identify the factors that would permit an enforcement \n     agency to determine when a merger in the agricultural \n     commodities market might avoid liability because it is not \n     likely to have an adverse effect on competition.\n       (2) Agriculture competition task force working group on \n     buying power.--In issuing agricultural guidelines under this \n     subsection, the Chairman and the Assistant Attorney General \n     shall consult with the working group on buyer power of the \n     Task Force established under subsection (b)(4).\n       (3) Completion.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) issue agricultural guidelines under this subsection;\n       (B) submit to Congress the agricultural guidelines issued \n     under this subsection; and\n       (C) submit to Congress a report explaining the basis for \n     the guidelines, including why it incorporated or did not \n     incorporate each recommendation of the working group on buyer \n     power of the Task Force established under subsection (b)(4).\n       (4) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall jointly submit a report to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the\n\n[[Page S14531]]\n\n     House of Representatives regarding the issuing of \n     agricultural guidelines under this subsection.\n       (e) Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition.--\n       (1) In general.--The Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 \n     U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is amended--\n       (A) by striking the title I heading and all that follows \n     through ``This Act'' and inserting the following:\n\n                     ``TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                       ``Subtitle A--Definitions\n\n     ``SEC. 1.

REPORT RELATING TO THE ENDING OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER \n                   IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the highest rate of childhood \n     poverty in the industrialized world, with over \\1/5\\ of all \n     children of the United States living in poverty, and almost \n     half of those children living in extreme poverty;\n       (2) childhood poverty in the United States is growing \n     rather than diminishing;\n       (3) households with children experience hunger at more than \n     double the rate as compared to households without children;\n       (4) hunger is a major problem in the United States, with \n     the Department of Agriculture reporting that 12 percent of \n     the citizens of the United States (approximately 35,000,000 \n     citizens) could not put food on the table of those citizens \n     at some point during 2006;\n       (5) of the 35,000,000 citizens of the United States that \n     have very low food security--\n       (A) 98 percent of those citizens worried that money would \n     run out before those citizens acquired more money to buy more \n     food;\n       (B) 96 percent of those citizens had to cut the size of the \n     meals of those citizens or even go without meals because \n     those citizens did not have enough money to purchase \n     appropriate quantities of food; and\n       (C) 94 percent of those citizens could not afford to eat \n     balanced meals;\n       (6) the phrase ``people with very low food security'', a \n     new phrase in our national lexicon, in simple terms means \n     ``people who are hungry'';\n       (7) 30 percent of black and Hispanic children, and 40 \n     percent of low income children, live in households that do \n     not have access to nutritionally adequate diets that are \n     necessary for an active and healthy life;\n       (8) the increasing lack of access of the citizens of the \n     United States to nutritionally adequate diets is a \n     significant factor from which the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention concluded that ``during the \n     past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity \n     in the United States'';\n       (9) during the last 3 decades, childhood obesity has--\n       (A) more than doubled for preschool children and \n     adolescents; and\n       (B) more than tripled for children between the ages of 6 \n     and 11 years;\n       (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, approximately \n     9,000,000 children who are 6 years old or older are \n     considered obese;\n       (11) scientists have demonstrated that there is an inverse \n     relation between obesity and doing well in school; and\n       (12) a study published in Pediatrics found that ``6- to 11-\n     year-old food-insufficient children had significantly lower \n     arithmetic scores and were more likely to have repeated a \n     grade, have seen a psychologist, and have had difficulty \n     getting along with other children''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national disgrace that many millions of \n     citizens of the United States, a disproportionate number of \n     whom are children, are going hungry in this great nation, \n     which is the wealthiest country in the history of the world;\n       (2) because the strong commitment of the United States to \n     family values is deeply undermined when families and children \n     go hungry, the United States has a moral obligation to \n     abolish hunger; and\n       (3) through a variety of initiatives (including large \n     funding increases in nutrition programs of the Federal \n     Government), the United States should abolish child hunger \n     and food insufficiency in the United States by the 2013.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     relevant committees of Congress a report that describes the \n     best and most cost-effected manner by which the Federal \n     Government could allocate an increased amount of funds to new \n     programs and programs in existence as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act to achieve the goal of abolishing child \n     hunger and food insufficiency in the United States by 2013.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3747.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle \n     Equality Act''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can eradicate salmonella from turtles \n     up until the point of sale, and individuals are more aware of \n     the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, \n     and the seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regimen that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of \n     Agriculture should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 \n     centimeters in diameter as pets as long as the sellers are \n     required to use proven methods to treat these turtles for \n     salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. REVIEW, REPORT, AND ACTION ON THE SALE OF BABY \n                   TURTLES.\n\n       (a) Pet Turtle.--In this section, the term ``pet turtle'' \n     means a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in \n     diameter.\n       (b) Prevalence of Salmonella.--Not later than 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this title, the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food \n     and Drugs, shall determine the prevalence of salmonella in \n     each species of reptile and amphibian sold legally as a pet \n     in the United States in order to determine whether the \n     prevalence of salmonella in reptiles and amphibians sold \n     legally as pets in the United States on average is not more \n     than 10 percent less than the percentage of salmonella in pet \n     turtles.\n       (c) Action if Prevalence Is Similar.--If the prevalence of \n     salmonella in reptiles and amphibians sold legally as pets in \n     the United States on average is more than 10 percent less \n     than the percentage of salmonella in pet turtles--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture shall--\n       (A) conduct a study to determine how pet turtles can be \n     sold safely as pets in the United States and provide \n     recommendations to Congress not later than 150 days after the \n     date of such determination;\n       (B) in conducting such study, consult with all relevant \n     stakeholders, such as the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the turtle farming industry, academia, and the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics; and\n       (C) examine the safety measures taken to protect \n     individuals from salmonella-related\n\n[[Page S14557]]\n\n     dangers involved with reptiles and amphibians sold legally in \n     the United States that contain a similar or greater presence \n     of salmonella than that of pet turtles; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Agriculture--\n       (A) may not prohibit the sale of pet turtles in the United \n     States; or\n       (B) shall prohibit the sale in the United States of any \n     reptile or amphibian that contains a similar or greater \n     prevalence of salmonella than that of pet turtles.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3764.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken an\n\n[[Page S14570]]\n\nimportant step to combat identity theft and to protect the privacy \nrights of all Americans by passing the Leahy-Specter Identity Theft \nEnforcement and Restitution Act of 2007. This bipartisan cyber crime \nbill will provide new tools to Federal prosecutors to combat identity \ntheft and other computer crimes. Today's prompt action by the Senate \nbrings us one step closer to providing these much-needed tools to \nFederal prosecutors and investigators who are on the front lines of the \nbattle against identity theft and other cyber crimes.\n  I thank Senator Specter, who has been a valuable partner in combating \nthe growing problem of identity theft for many years, for joining with \nme to introduce this important privacy bill. I also thank Senators \nDurbin, Grassley, Schumer, Bill Nelson, Inouye, Stevens and Feinstein \nfor joining with us as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  I commend Senators Biden and Hatch for their important work in this \narea. I am pleased that several provisions that they have drafted to \nfurther strengthen this cyber crime legislation will be included in \nthis bill, and that with those additions, they have also cosponsored \nit.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice in crafting this bill and the Leahy-Specter Identity Theft \nEnforcement and Restitution Act has the strong support of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Secret Service. This bill is also \nsupported by a broad coalition of business, high tech and consumer \ngroups, including Microsoft, Consumers Union, the Cyber Security \nIndustry Alliance, the Business Software Alliance, AARP and the Chamber \nof Commerce.\n  The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act takes several \nimportant and long overdue steps to protect Americans from the growing \nand evolving threat of identity theft and other cyber crimes. First, to \nbetter protect American consumers, our bill provides the victims of \nidentity theft with the ability to seek restitution in Federal court \nfor the loss of time and money spent restoring their credit and \nremedying the harms of identity theft, so that identity theft victims \ncan be made whole.\n  Second, because identity theft schemes are much more sophisticated \nand cunning in today's digital era, our bill also expands the scope of \nthe Federal identity theft statutes so that the law keeps up with the \ningenuity of today's identity thieves. Our bill adds three new crimes--\npassing counterfeit securities, mail theft, and tax fraud--to the list \nof predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft. And, in order to \nbetter deter this kind of criminal activity, our bill also \nsignificantly increases the criminal penalties for these crimes. To \naddress the increasing number of computer hacking crimes that involve \ncomputers located within the same State, our bill also eliminates the \njurisdictional requirement that a computer's information must be stolen \nthrough an interstate or foreign communication in order to federally \nprosecute this crime.\n  Our bill also addresses the growing problem of the malicious use of \nspyware to steal sensitive personal information, by eliminating the \nrequirement that the loss resulting from the damage to a victim's \ncomputer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute this \noffense. The bill also carefully balances this necessary change with \nthe legitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous \nprosecutions, and clarifies that the elimination of the $5,000 \nthreshold applies only to criminal cases. In addition, our bill \naddresses the increasing number of cyber attacks on multiple computers, \nby making it a felony to employ spyware or keyloggers to damage 10 or \nmore computers, regardless of the aggregate amount of damage caused. By \nmaking this crime a felony, the bill ensures that the most egregious \nidentity thieves will not escape with minimal punishment under Federal \ncyber crime laws.\n  Lastly, our bill strengthens the protections for American businesses, \nwhich are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves, by \nadding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute--\nthreatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer \nand demanding money in relation to a protected computer--so that this \nbad conduct can be federally prosecuted. In addition, because a \nbusiness as well as an individual can be a prime target for identity \ntheft, our bill closes several gaps in the federal identity theft and \nthe aggravated identity theft statutes to ensure that identity thieves \nwho target a small business or a corporation can be prosecuted under \nthese laws. The bill also adds the remedy of civil and criminal \nforfeiture to the arsenal of tools to combat cyber crime and our bill \ndirects the United States Sentencing Commission to review its \nguidelines for identity theft and cyber crime offenses.\n  The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act is a good, \nbipartisan measure to help combat the growing threat of identity theft \nand other cyber crimes to all Americans. Just this week, FBI Director \nRobert Mueller reminded all Americans that cyber threats will continue \nto grow as our Nation becomes more dependent upon high technology. This \ncarefully balanced bill protects the privacy rights of American \nconsumers, the interests of business and the legitimate needs of law \nenforcement. This privacy bill also builds upon our prior efforts to \nenact comprehensive data privacy legislation. The Leahy-Specter \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act, S. 495, which Senator Specter \nand I reintroduced earlier this year, would address the growing dangers \nof identity theft at its source--lax data security and inadequate \nbreach notification. Protecting the privacy and security of American \nconsumers should be one of the Senate's top legislative priorities and \nI urge the majority leader to take up that measure at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  Again, I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have joined \nSenator Specter and me in supporting this important privacy \nlegislation, as well as the many consumer and business groups that \nsupport this bill. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support \nletter that I have received from the Chamber of Commerce regarding this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2007.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, thank you \n     for your leadership on issues related to identity theft and \n     other types of cyber crime. The Chamber strongly supports S. \n     2168, the ``Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of \n     2007,'' and congratulates the Committee on the Judiciary for \n     reporting favorably this important legislation.\n       The Internet today is a major engine of economic growth for \n     the United States. Unfortunately, accompanying this amazing \n     growth has been the continued rise of malicious cyber \n     activity by very coordinated and clever criminal networks. S. \n     2168 will go a long way to address this very serious issue by \n     giving law enforcement officials much needed tools and \n     resources to combat these criminals.\n       Once again, the Chamber appreciates your leadership on \n     these issues, and looks forward to working with the Committee \n     to assure passage of S. 2168 by the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third \ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 384, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 384) expressing support for the goals \n     of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by \n     promoting national awareness of adoption and the children \n     awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved \n     in adoption, and encouraging Americans to secure safety, \n     permanency, and well-being for all children.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nAdoption Day and National Adoption Month. Senator Coleman and I \nunderstand that later today the Senate will consider our resolution \nrecognizing National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month.\n  Every child should have a loving and permanent family. The Hague \nConvention recognizes ``that the child, for the full and harmonious \ndevelopment of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \nenvironment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.'' \nUnfortunately, not all children have a family of their own. However, \nthrough adoption a child can have a ``forever family.''\n  President Bush has recognized the importance of adoption to children \nand our Nation. Thus, he has declared November to be National Adoption \nMonth. Nearly half of all Americans have been touched by adoption.\n  In 2002, 151,332 children found ``forever families,'' a significant \nincrease from 119,766 in 1996. 21,063 of these children were born in \nanother country and adopted by American families. Public agency \nadoptions have more than doubled since 1995. The National Council for \nAdoption attributes the increase ``in part to the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997's Adoption Incentive Program, which awards \nfinancial incentives to States for placing foster children into \nadoptive homes.'' Seven States: Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, quadrupled the annual number of public \nagency adoptions from 1995 to 2005. Over 7,000 children who are part of \nthe public child welfare system are adopted every year in California, \nwhich is the highest number of all 50 States. However, only 10 percent \nof the 513,000 children in foster care will ever be adopted.\n  National Adoption Day occurs on November 17 as a part of National \nAdoption Month. National Adoption Day is an event to raise awareness of \nthe 114,000 children in foster care who are waiting for permanent \nfamilies. Since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, nearly 17,000 \nchildren have joined ``forever families'' on this special day. This \nyear we hope to have events in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, \nand Puerto Rico. Over l90 events in 48 States, the District of \nColumbia, and Puerto Rico are planned for this Saturday to finalize the \nadoption of over 3,000 foster children and youth.\n  I want you to picture what happens on this fall day, children \nrunning, laughing, and playing with their new parent. Think about a \ngirl or boy planning their special outfit and joyously awaiting the \nfamily celebration. Imagine the excitement welling up inside of a child \nas she looks into her new parent's eyes and knows she is finally part \nof a family. She will never dread the sound of a car coming to take her \naway again or wonder where she will lay her head or which school she \nwill be moved to.\n  Now picture the other dramatically different reality. In 2005, there \nwere 514,000 children in foster care and 115,000 of them were waiting \nto be adopted. The following States have the largest number of children \nin their foster care system: California, Florida, Michigan, New York, \nPennsylvania, and Texas. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, States \nmade progress in reducing the number of children in their foster care \nsystems, such as Illinois, 34 percent reduction, and New York, 35 \npercent reduction. These children have not had the luxury of their own \nroom, a stable school environment, or a constant adult in their lives. \nThough the average percentage of children in foster care who are \nwaiting to be adopted is 24 percent, some States have percentages as \nlow as 5 percent,--California--and as high as 38 percent--New Jersey \nand South Carolina.\n\n  Of the 52,000 foster children who were adopted, 60 percent of them \nwere adopted by their foster parents. According to a recent survey by \nthe Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, many potential adoptive \nparents have considered foster care adoption, but ``a majority of \nAmericans hold misperceptions about the foster care adoption process \nand the children who are eligible for adoption. For example, ``two-\nthirds of those considering foster care adoption are unnecessarily \nconcerned that biological parents can return to claim their children \nand nearly half of all Americans mistakenly believe that foster care \nadoption is expensive, when in reality adopting from foster care is \nwithout substantial cost.''\n  In Louisiana there are 4,541 children in foster care and 1,162 of \nthem are waiting to be adopted. I would like to tell you about some of \nthe foster children in Louisiana who are looking for their ``forever \nfamilies.''\n  Natalyia is a cute, outgoing and loveable 8-year-old who is bright \nand energetic. She is in the second grade and she is an above average \nstudent. She loves to read books, ride her bike, complete crossword \npuzzles, and play\n\n[[Page S14573]]\n\nwith her dolls. Natalyia has been in foster care since November 2001. \nThe average length of time a child spends in foster care is over 2 \nyears.\n  Most foster children entered into State custody because their parents \nwere either unable or unwilling to care for them. Not only are children \nseparated from parents, but in many cases, siblings are separated when \nthey are placed in foster care. Terron and Montrell are two brothers in \nthe Louisiana foster care system who would like to be adopted together.\n  Terron is a handsome, happy 8-year-old in the third grade who is \nplaced in the same foster home with his younger brother, Montrell. Both \nboys would like to be adopted together, because they share a close \nbond. Terron responds positively to structure, love, and consistency. \nHe is a caring child who has enjoyed living in a two-parent family. He \nenjoys soccer, baseball, fishing and any outdoor activity. He wants his \nnew family to know that he likes to eat spaghetti, macaroni, and rice-\na-roni. Terron would benefit from a two-parent family that can provide \nstructure as well as stimulation.\n  Montrell is Terron's brother. He is a very sweet, friendly, and open \nyoung boy who responds well to structure and consistency. He is very \nbonded to his older brother and with time and nurturance can adjust to \na new environment. Montrell is a first grader. School is a challenge \nfor him but with patience and redirection, he responds well. Montrell's \noverall health is good and he is basically a happy little boy. He \nenjoys riding his bicycle and playing outside. Montrell and Terron \nwould benefit from a 2-parent family that can provide structure as well \nas stimulation.\n\n  Over half the children in foster care are 10 years of age or older \nand have more difficulty being adopted. These children are just waiting \nto flourish with the right parent's guidance. Kody and Ronnie are two \nbrothers who are above the age of 10 years old and are waiting in the \nLouisiana foster care system for a ``forever family.''\n  Kody is a cute, very active and outgoing, blonde haired, hazel eyed, \n13-year-old boy. He enjoys football, skateboarding, fourwheeling, and \nplaying video games. He also loves horses. He is a sixth grader who \nenjoys science and reading. Kody would like to be an entertainer when \nhe grows up, such as an actor, a comedian, or a rapper. He would like \nto be in the same home as his brother, Ronnie.\n  Ronnie is Kody's brother. He is an 11-year-old boy who resembles his \nbrother. Ronnie loves both playing and watching football. He likes to \nplay video games and board games, horses, and going fishing. He is a \nfourth grader who likes math and science. He would like to be a \npoliceman when he grows up, so that he could rescue people. He would \nalso like to own a toy company, so that he could invent new video \ngames. He wants a family who would care about him. He is very close to \nhis brother Kody and wishes to remain in contact with him.\n  I could stand here every day for the next month and talk about each \nchild who needs to be adopted out of foster care. The bottom line is \nthat each of these children, from one day old to 22 years old, needs \npermanency. They all need a loving, nurturing family that will help \nthem to grow, bring out their unique personalities, and transform them \ninto confident and happy adults.\n  On National Adoption Day, I have faith that this can be done and we \nmust continue to be the catalyst. The miracle of adoption cannot be \nexplained, but the loving parents that are holding their children for \nthe first time today are living examples of how dreams can be realized. \nAs an adoptive mother myself, I find that words cannot adequately \nexplain the miracle of adoption. I can only take a moment to offer my \nmost humble thanks, gratitude, and appreciation to all those across the \nNation who have given their Saturday to help find waiting children safe \nand loving homes.\n  Let us continue to remember that when National Adoption Month and Day \nend there are still thousands of children like Natalyia, Montrell, \nTerron, Kody, and Ronnie who need that sense of permanency. I challenge \nCongress to make these children their first priority and to help them \nto finally realize that dream. Please support our resolution.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 384) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 384\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 514,000 children in the \n     foster care system in the United States, approximately \n     115,000 of whom are waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 52 percent of the children in foster care are age \n     10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is over 2 years;\n       Whereas, for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas the number of youth who ``age out'' of foster care \n     by reaching adulthood without being placed in a permanent \n     home has increased by 41 percent since 1998, and nearly \n     25,000 foster youth age out every year;\n       Whereas every day loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a recent survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that though ``Americans \n     overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in \n     particular foster care adoption . . . foster care adoptions \n     have not increased significantly over the past five years'';\n       Whereas, while 3 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, \n     a majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of adopting children from foster care and the children who \n     are eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 71 percent of those who have considered adoption \n     consider adopting children from foster care above other forms \n     of adoption;\n       Whereas 45 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 46 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas, since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, \n     nearly 17,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas, in 2006, adoptions were finalized for over 3,300 \n     children through more than 250 National Adoption Day events \n     in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; \n     and\n       Whereas, on October 31, 2007, the President proclaimed \n     November 2007 as National Adoption Month, and National \n     Adoption Day is on November 17, 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the citizens of the United States to \n     consider adoption during the month of November and all \n     throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14573-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14573-S14574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2363\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity to kind of \nmake a little assessment of where we are with regard to the farm bill. \nI have listened throughout the course of the day as Members have come \nover and accusations have flown back and forth about why we are not \nmaking any progress on the farm bill.\n  Frankly, it is unfortunate because we have a lot of farmers, the \npeople who are actually out there working the land, raising the food \nthat feeds our country and a good part of the world, who are depending \nupon the Senate to act.\n  We have heard from farm organizations, as I am sure most Senators \nhave, about the importance of getting this farm bill passed so they \nknow what the policies are going to be, what the rules are going to be, \nwhat the programs are going to be as they begin to make decisions about \nthe 2008 planting season.\n  As I have listened to all the debate as it has gone back and forth, I \nhave heard a lot of my colleagues, and my colleague from Colorado who \nis a valued member of the Ag Committee--we worked closely on the \nrenewable energy provisions in the bill, and I think we produced a very \ngood bill out of the Ag Committee.\n  But there are 21 of us, 21 Senators on the Ag Committee, 21 members \nout of 100 Senators who serve on the Senate Ag Committee. We came out \nwith a bill that we think makes a lot of sense. It was a balanced bill. \nIt addressed the important issue of providing support for production \nagriculture for our farmers. It had a good strong conservation title \nthat extends and expands in some ways the Conservation Reserve Program, \nthe Wetlands Reserve Program, the Grassland Reserve Program, a number \nof conservation programs that are important to the way we manage our \nlands in this country and provide good environmental stewardship.\n  It had, of course, a good strong energy title which I worked on a \nlot, along with a number of my colleagues on the committee, including \nthe Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  We put together what I think is a good, strong energy title that \nprovides incentives for cellulosic ethanol production. It also had a \ndisaster title, something that we have not had for some time in the \nfarm bill, that provides a backstop against those years when you have \nweather-related disasters and we have had to come to the Congress and \ntry to get political support for disaster relief.\n  Oftentimes it has been problematic there. This puts in place a \ncontingency fund, an emergency fund, for those years in which our \nproducers are not able to raise a crop for some reason, in most cases \nbecause of the weather.\n  It has, of course, as my colleague from Colorado mentioned, about 67 \npercent of the money in the bill going into the nutrition title, which \nfunds many of the programs that help people across the country, whether \nthat is the Food Stamp Program, a WIC program, all of those programs \nthat provide support and food for people who need it.\n  So it is, as we would say, a balanced bill, a bill that was debated \nback and forth. There were a lot of amendments offered. We spent a day \nand a half in the markup. But as I said, what is important to note \nabout that is there are only 21 Members of the Senate on the Senate Ag \nCommittee. That means there are 79 Members of this body who have not \nhad any input in this process up to this point.\n  Well, when the bill was brought to the floor last week on Monday, \nwhich is now 9, going on 10 days ago, the assumption was at that point \nthose Members of the Senate who have not served as members of the Ag \nCommittee may have a chance to get their priorities addressed in this \nfarm bill, to offer amendments they think can improve it.\n  In many cases a farm bill reflects regional priorities. Different \npeople around the country look at these issues very differently. It \nobviously has a national priority as well. But I think it is fair to \nsay that a lot of Members of the Senate would want to come down here \nand offer amendments.\n  In fact, a number of amendments were filed, some 200-plus, almost 300 \namendments. Now I, for one, would like to see an agreement reached \nbetween our leaders that would end this bickering and this standoff and \nget us to where we can process some of these amendments and get them \nvoted on so that we can move toward final consideration of this bill, \nwhich I noted earlier is so important to farmers across this country.\n  But what happened very early on in that process was the leader, the \nmajority leader, did what they in Washington in the Senate called \n``filling the tree.'' By that, for those who are not familiar with \nWashington speak, it essentially means it prevents others from offering \namendments. All of the amendments that can be offered have been \noffered. The leader filled the tree and for the past 9 days now has \nprecluded the opportunity for other Members of the Senate, those other \n79 Members of the Senate who do not serve on the Ag Committee, to be \nable to come down and offer amendments they think would ultimately \nimprove the bill.\n  What is significant about that is it is not unprecedented. It has \nbeen done. They said it was done when the Republicans controlled the \nSenate. I am sure it was--I do not believe very successfully because I \ndo not think it is a tactic or a procedure that lends itself to the \nnature of this institution or how it works. The Senate is unique in all \nthe world. It is the world's greatest deliberative body. We really \nvalue the opportunity to come and amend the bill that is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, which is generally open to amendment.\n  So when the tree gets filled and amendments are blocked from \nconsideration, it essentially shuts down the process that the Senate \nnormally uses to consider and amend bills and ultimately vote on bills.\n  So where are we today? We are almost 2 weeks into this now, and we \nhave yet to vote on a single amendment. We have not had one vote on an \namendment to the farm bill after now having it on the floor for almost \n2 weeks.\n  I have to say, for those who would like to offer amendments and have \nthose amendments voted on, it has been very frustrating. My own view is \nthat we are not going to be able to debate 200 or 300 amendments, but \nwe ought to be able to narrow that down, and our leaders could go about \nthat process. But you cannot even do that when the tree is filled. You \ncannot even consider and vote on any amendments.\n  So here we are. A farm bill is something that we do every 5 or 6 \nyears in the Congress. I was associated with the last one in 2002 as a \nMember of the House of Representatives, a member of the Ag Committee. \nIn that particular bill, which was 5 years ago, we set policies that \ncarried us to the end of the fiscal year 2007, which ended on September \n30 of this year. And we now\n\n[[Page S14575]]\n\nneed a new policy to carry us forward to the year 2012.\n  So the point is, this is something we do every 5 years. This is a \nsignificant and consequential event when it comes to the Congress and \nthe policies that it puts in place with regard to agriculture in this \ncountry that our farmers use as the framework or the guideline to make \ntheir decisions.\n  So when you do something every 5 or 6 years, the assumption normally \nis that you are going to want to do it right. I think we did do it \nright. I think we produced a bill out of the Ag Committee that, as I \nsaid, is very solid, very balanced. But I have a lot of colleagues who \nwould like to have their voices heard in this process, offer amendments \nthat they think would improve the bill.\n  So where are we today after 2 weeks, after having debated this bill \non the Senate floor, or at least talked about it? We have not taken any \naction. I think it is a real disservice to the farmers of this country \nand to our rural economy, those rural communities that depend upon \nagriculture for their livelihood, that we have failed to act because \nthe leadership, the Democratic leader, decided when he called up the \nbill to fill the amendment tree so that amendments could not be \nconsidered.\n  Two weeks on the bill, we have yet to vote on a single amendment on a \npiece of legislation that is 1,600 pages long and spends 280 billion \ntax dollars over the course of the next 5 years. Not one amendment has \nbeen voted on.\n  Now, just to put it in perspective and provide a little bit of a \nframework for previous farm bills, as I said, I was associated with the \nfarm bill in 2002 as a Member of the House of Representatives. During \ndebate of the 2002 farm bill, there were 246 amendments that were \nfiled. Democrats and Republicans came together and voted on 49 of those \namendments, including 25 rollcall votes in the Senate.\n  Before that, if you go back to the 1996 farm bill, there were 339 \namendments offered to that farm bill. In 1996, the Republican \nleadership--at that time it was under the control of the Republicans--\nallowed 26 amendment votes, including 11 of those being rollcall votes.\n  During consideration of the 1990 farm bill, there were 113 votes, \nincluding 22 rollcall votes. And, finally, if you go all the way back \nto 1985--I was actually a staffer here at that time--there were 88 \nvotes, 33 of which were rollcall votes. So 33 rollcall votes in 1985, \n22 rollcall votes in 1990, out of a total of 130 votes taken.\n  As I said, in 1996 there were 26 amendment votes, including 11 \nrollcalls. And in the 2002 farm bill, there were 49 amendments offered \nand voted on, I should say, including 25 of those being decided by a \nrollcall vote.\n  My point, very simply, is, it is unprecedented what is happening with \nregard to the farm legislation, to a farm bill that has these kind of \nconsequences, this kind of cost, and this importance to the Nation's \nfarm economy. I would hope that as this moves forward, and when the \nSenate--I use that term loosely because it is not moving forward; we \nare not getting anything done. It is a great frustration to many of us \nwho worked hard to produce a bill, to get it to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  But I do not think you can take a piece of legislation of this \nconsequence and try and ram it through without even allowing a vote on \na single amendment. We have been here for 2 weeks. We have not voted on \none single amendment.\n  I understand that the majority leader wants to limit the number of \namendments. That is why he filled the tree. He essentially wants to \ndecide which amendments are germane and which amendments are relevant. \nNormally, that is a decision that is made by the Parliamentarian. But \nwhat he has said is: I want to choose for my side, for the Democratic \nside, as well as for the Republican side, which amendments we consider, \nif any, and essentially approve those, which completely undermines, as \nI said, the basic premise of the Senate, which is when a bill is \nbrought to the floor, those bills are open to amendment.\n  That has been the practice here for a good long time. It certainly \nhas been the case on previous farm bills going back, as the numbers I \njust reported say, going back to 1985.\n  I say all of that to, as I said, take a little assessment, back off a \nlittle bit from all the rhetoric that we heard on the floor today. I \nwould like to see us be able to work on it in a bipartisan way because, \ntraditionally, historically, agriculture in the Senate and in the \nCongress generally has not been a partisan issue.\n  There are divisions that occur in agriculture but generally along \nregional lines. Those of us who represent the upper Midwest have \nslightly different priorities when it comes to a farm bill than those \nwho represent the South or the West. You have special crop groups. You \nhave your sort of base commodities--your corn, your wheat, soybeans, \nlivestock, the things that we raise and grow in the upper Midwest. You \nhave dairy and sugar.\n  We have dairy, sugar, lots of competing interests, all which play out \nin a debate over a farm bill. But what is regrettable about that in \nthis particular case is that we are seeing what appears to be for the \nfirst time partisan gridlock over whether Members of the Senate, the 79 \nMembers who are not members of the Ag Committee, will have an \nopportunity, as they traditionally do, to come forward to offer \namendments they think will improve the bill. I express my frustration \nand the frustration of those farmers I represent. The organizations \nthat have been in contact with my office are urging us to get on with \nthis. I would love to be able to do that.\n  I have an amendment that has been filed that is very important to the \nbill. It improves the energy title of the bill. We came out with a bill \nthat was a good product. I was pleased and happy with what we produced \nfrom the committee. But when it came to the floor, it became clear to \nme we could improve upon that by adding an amendment, a renewable fuels \nstandard that would further strengthen the energy title of the bill. It \nbecame even more important when we started to look at what is going to \nhappen next year in 2008, if we don't increase the cap on the renewable \nfuels standard, the 7.5 billion gallon cap in the renewable fuels \nstandard today. We will reach that by the end of this year. So we have \n2008, where we will be past the 7.5 billion gallons, and at that point \nthere is very little incentive for oil companies to continue to blend \nethanol. We need to get the statutory cap raised so we are at 8.5 \nbillion gallons next year, and those who want to make investments in \nthis industry will feel confident that there is going to be a new \nrenewable fuels standard that increases the level of renewable fuels, \nsomething which I believe every Member of this body supports.\n  I believe when you are looking at $100 oil and looking at our \ndependence upon foreign countries for energy supply, it makes enormous \nsense to do everything we can to come up with homegrown, domestic \nsources of energy and supplies. I would hope that amendment will be \nable to be voted on at some point. But at this point we are shut down. \nWe are locked down. That is unfortunate. My hope would be we can move \nvery quickly in the days we have ahead of us this year--I hope by \ntomorrow--to achieve some understanding or agreement about how we will \nproceed to come to a final vote. I hope the majority leader will decide \nin the end to move away from the practice he has adopted on this bill \nof filling the tree and preventing amendments from being offered so we \ncan get to what the Senate does, and that is consider, deliberate, vote \non amendments, take a piece of legislation, allow those 79 Members of \nthe Senate who are not members of the Senate Ag Committee to be heard \nin the process and to have their opportunities to improve the bill to \ntheir liking and according to the priorities their constituents want to \nsee addressed.\n  I hope as we come back tomorrow we will be able to make more headway \non this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/15/senate-section/article/S14575-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14575-S14576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
