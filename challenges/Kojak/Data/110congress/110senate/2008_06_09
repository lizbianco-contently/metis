Mr. President, last Friday, five startling things \nhappened to our economy.\n  The futures price for a barrel of crude oil rose above $139, an \nalltime record. It increased over $10 in 1 day, and the increase in \nprice on Thursday and Friday was the largest 2-day increase in the 130-\nyear history of the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n  That morning, a Morgan Stanley analyst had released a report \npredicting that the price of a barrel of oil could reach $150 by the \nFourth of July.\n  Also that morning, the worst job report and worst unemployment report \nin 12 years was released. The national unemployment rate has now \nreached 5.5 percent.\n  By the end of the day, in reaction to this news, the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average was down 394 points.\n  The average price for a gallon of gasoline at the pump on Friday, \nnationally, hovered around the alltime record of $3.99 a gallon.\n  Are these five events related? Of course they are. There are many \nother economic events that took place last week that were also very \nimportant and related.\n  Here is the more difficult question: Did any of these events cause \nothers to occur?\n  Most importantly, what led to that record increase in the price of \noil, which will no doubt lead to crushing increases in the price of \ngasoline in the days to come?\n  The honest truth is nobody knows. Not the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, the regulator that is supposed to be monitoring the futures \nmarket. The CFTC Commissioners recently argued before the \nAppropriations Subcommittee that I chair that\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nall the increase in the price of oil can be explained solely by the \nfundamentals of supply and demand.\n\n  Was there an explosion on Friday in an oilfield that disrupted a huge \nportion of the world's oil supply that we all missed? No. I don't see \nhow a $10 increase in 1 day can be explained solely by increases in \ndemand relative to supply.\n  Not the Energy Information Administration, the official U.S. \nGovernment source for energy statistics. The EIA doesn't receive \ndetailed information on who's trading what and why.\n  Was there a massive runup in gas on Friday by nervous motorists all \nacross America? Since the EIA doesn't collect demand information from \nthe gas pumps, I don't see how they could judge whether supply and \ndemand explains the current futures prices.\n  Not the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the regulator \nresponsible for the transmission of energy between States. FERC focuses \nmostly on the physical delivery side of the energy markets and doesn't \nanalyze the futures markets.\n  Not the Federal Trade Commission, the regulator responsible for \nlooking out for the interests of consumers and assaulting monopolies. \nThe FTC can investigate the effects of consolidation in the oil \nindustry and can help prevent price gouging at the pump, but they don't \nlook at the nuances of futures market trading.\n  And I admit not this Senator either. I don't pretend to have all the \nanswers as to why gas prices keep rising, but I certainly see a problem \nthat needs to be addressed; it is a problem I see in Illinois and all \nacross this country.\n  This issue is much too important to the American people to allow this \nto continue. Enough is enough. It is time for Washington and leaders \nacross America to respond. We need to get to the bottom of this. There \nare far too many questions to which no one seems to have definitive \nanswers--questions such as:\n  Are speculators driving up the price of oil far beyond what can be \njustified by supply and demand?\n  Are investors simply fleeing the stock markets because of the slowing \neconomy and flooding the futures market with excess cash?\n  Are new investment vehicles, such as commodity index funds, driving \nup futures prices?\n  Are investment bank analysts issuing reports predicting huge \nincreases in oil prices, in part, because those same banks will profit \nfrom that event?\n  Are large institutional investors taking huge positions in over-the-\ncounter trades that are pushing market prices higher?\n  Are regulatory differences between the CFTC, which oversees American \ntrading, and the Financial Services Authority, which oversees British \ntrading, allowing traders to hide manipulative crude oil positions from \nthe CFTC?\n  Are the big integrated oil companies using the rising price of oil \nfutures to justify even larger increases in the price of gas at the \npump?\n  If we had the answers to these and many other questions, we would \nhave a better understanding of what is happening. We would better \nunderstand the policy steps to take next, and we would understand how \nto ensure that a crisis such as this doesn't continue or occur in the \nfuture.\n  It is time to give the CFTC the resources it needs to collect and \nanalyze all the relevant data, so it can understand what is causing \nthese huge price spikes.\n  It is time to give the CFTC--the regulatory agency involved--more \nworkers, analysts, more cops on the beat to investigate every last \ndetail of what is happening.\n  Look at this chart. By 2009, the CFTC will be asked to oversee around \n980 million futures transactions of ever-increasing complexity. From \nthe year 2000, where there were 145 million of these transactions, we \nnow project that by the end of next year, that number will be 980. That \nis about six to seven times the number of transactions that occurred \njust a few years ago.\n  So at this Commission that regulates that industry and makes sure \npeople aren't misusing it, how many cops on the beat have we had? In \n2000, we had 546. Today, under the President's budget, it is 475. The \nnumber of transactions this agency is following to make sure they are \nnot deceiving the public and that there is pure transparency increased \nby sevenfold, and the number of inspectors has gone down in that same \nperiod of time.\n  In Friday's Washington Post, the Chairman of CFTC, Walter Lukken, \nsaid:\n\n       We can hire an extra 100 people and put them to work \n     tomorrow given the inflow of trading volume. We are doing the \n     best we can in difficult circumstances. . . . This is \n     something that we are obviously concerned with--the potential \n     for manipulation.\n\n  It is time to pay attention to Chairman Lukken's comments. More \nimportant, it is time to ensure that extra resources are applied.\n  It is time to require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nreceive data on all trades of all sizes by all participants in the oil \nfutures market that impact deliveries in the United States.\n  The CFTC then should be required to analyze that entire bed of data \nand report to Congress on the fundamental reasons behind the oil-price \nspike.\n  The American economy is clearly struggling. The cost of a tank of \ngasoline is an onerous burden to families, businesses, truckers, and \nfarmers. Yet that price continues to rise. Enough is enough. It is time \nfor us to give the resources to this agency so they will have the cops \non the beat to make sure they are honest, open transactions, which we \ncan monitor to make certain wild speculation doesn't drive our economy \ndown even further. We have the power within Congress to do it. If the \nPresident will not take the leadership on this issue, leadership must \nbegin right here on the floor of the Senate.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee for the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommissions appropriation, I can assure you the resources that are \nneeded for this agency will be the highest priority as we determine the \nappropriations bill that will be debated in the weeks to come.\n  It is time to figure out what is driving oil prices through the roof \nand bring them under control so our economy can continue to grow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5378-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3044, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3044, to provide energy price \n     relief and hold oil companies and other entities accountable \n     for their actions with regard to high energy prices, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Filling the Tree\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout a practice that is being employed on a widespread basis, which I \nbelieve undercuts the fundamental institutional integrity of the \nSenate. I am referring now to a procedure known as filling the tree. \nThat is an expression used inside the beltway--inside the Senate \nChamber--for action taken by the majority leader to establish a \nprocedural situation where no Senator can offer any other amendment.\n  The long tradition of the Senate has been it is an institution that \nencourages, harbors, fosters open debate, the presentation of issues, \nthe discussion of matters, to bring not only in this limited Chamber, \nor beyond on C-SPAN2, if anybody is watching, but to the entire \ncountry.\n  That is what distinguished the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives, for example. In the House, they have what is called a \nrule, and Members may offer amendments only in a very limited, \ncircumscribed way and then in a limited period of time. But under \nSenate rules, any Senator may offer virtually any amendment virtually \nat almost any time on any subject and speak in an unlimited way, as \nlong as he retains the floor.\n\n  Last week, the Senate took up legislation of great importance on \nglobal\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\nwarming. There are many complex issues involved in that subject. We \nstarted off with legislation which had been offered by Senator \nLieberman and Senator Warner that had been modified by Senator Boxer, \nthe chairperson of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nthere were many other proposals in the wings waiting to be considered. \nOne of those proposals was legislation prepared by Senator Bingaman and \nmyself, the Bingaman-Specter bill.\n  In the consideration of global warming, there were many complex \nmatters. I don't intend to go through all of them now, but illustrative \nof that is the issue of technology. Is the technology adequate to \naccommodate the goals and standards of Lieberman-Warner? What would be \nthe economic impact on the provisions of global warming in terms of \nencouraging foreign countries to ship to the United States on \nexclusions where they might not have the same limitations?\n  For example, in the steel industry. On that particular subject, I \ntestified before the Finance Committee last February 14 about the need \nfor the United States to be a leader on global warming, but at the same \ntime not to sacrifice our industry to foreign goods, and noted that the \nChinese wanted a 30-year exemption. If they had gotten that, there \nwould not be any steel industry. But there were many issues.\n  I came to the Senate floor a week ago today to speak on the subject \non June 2. And then I returned to speak again on June 3. Then, by \nWednesday, June 4, I found out that we were on our way to having the \ntree filled. Actually, I spoke on June 2, 3, and June 5 and found when \nthere was no opportunity to offer amendments, I filed four amendments.\n  I bring up that matter because then there was a cloture motion on \nFriday. A cloture motion requires 60 votes. If we are going to do it on \na Friday, it is extremely difficult to find enough Senators to have an \nadequate showing as to what it means.\n  In any event, the cloture motion vote was held, and the cloture \nmotion fell far short. The majority leader took the bill down, and now \nwe are no longer considering the question of global warming. That is a \nmatter which, in my judgment, warrants very considerable time by the \nSenate. I don't know whether it is 2 weeks or 3 weeks or how many weeks \nit is, but I know it is a lot more than 4 days. And now it is gone.\n  Regrettably, it is not just global warming which is involved. Not \nlong ago, we have had the issue of the so-called Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, S. 1843, legislation which would change the statute of limitations \non enforcing employment rights for equal pay. This bill was introduced \nbecause the Supreme Court of the United States, in a 5-to-4 decision, \nenforced a 6-month statute of limitations on a woman who wanted to \nclaim her Federal rights to equal pay.\n  It seemed to me the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates was wrong. The plaintiff was being foreclosed an opportunity to \ngo to court to get equal pay when she didn't even know she had the \ncause of action or the right to do that.\n  This issue then was the subject of a cloture motion. The motion to \nproceed failed on cloture 56 to 42. The bill was given no process. \nThere was no committee referral, no debate, no opportunity for \namendments, just talking points for Democrats, an illustration where \ncloture was filed.\n  The tradition of the Senate has always been to have legislation \noffered, to have it debated. If there is objection, people oppose it. \nIf people are very determined not to allow it to come to a vote without \na supermajority--that is, getting 60 votes for cloture--then they \nfilibuster. But in the course of that process, there is an awakening of \nthe American people about what is going on.\n  A good illustration would be the historic civil rights debates which \nwent on in this Chamber for very protracted periods of time. But the \nAmerican people hardly have any idea about what is involved in equal \npay for women when the matter is called to the Senate floor and in a \nvirtual nanosecond is dispensed with.\n  Had the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act received extensive debate, had there \nbeen opposition, had there been discussion, had there been some idea by \nthe American people about what was going on, there could have been some \npublic opinion registered on that as a very important matter.\n  The great difficulty is this is not a machination of the current \nmajority leader. This is a practice which has been building up for a \nconsiderable period of time and, as with the case of so many matters, \nit is a matter of equal blame on both sides of the aisle, both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  In a survey by CRS, going back to 1985, it was used infrequently. \nSenator Dole used it five times in 1985 and 1986; Senator Byrd, three \ntimes in 1987 and 1988. Senator Mitchell did not use it at all in 1989 \nand 1990. Then in 1991 and 1992, Senator Mitchell used it one time. \nThen in 1993 and 1994, Senator Mitchell used it nine times. In 1995 and \n1996, Senator Dole and Senator Lott used it five times. In 1997 and \n1998, Senator Lott used it three times. In 1999 and 2000, Senator Lott \nused it nine times. Senator Daschle then used it once in the next 2 \nyears. The following 2 years, 2003 and 2004, Senator Frist used it \nthree times. Then in 2005 and 2006, Senator Frist used it nine times. \nAnd in the 110th Congress, so far, Senator Reid has used it 12 times. \nEvery time that it is used, it totally undercuts the ability of the \nSenate to function in its traditional way.\n  Senator Reid had this to say about this practice when he was not the \nmajority leader but when he was the leader of the minority, the leader \nof the Democrats back on February 28, 2006. He was speaking in defense \nof a fellow Democrat's ability to offer amendments to the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization. Senator Reid of Nevada said this:\n\n       Of course, even a good bill can be improved. That is why we \n     have an amendment process in the Senate. I am disappointed \n     that he has been denied that opportunity by a procedural \n     maneuver known as ``filling the amendment tree.''\n\n  Senator Reid goes on:\n\n       This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic \n     nature of the Senate. The hallmark of the Senate is free \n     speech and open debate. Rule XXII establishes a process for \n     cutting off debate and amendments, but rule XXII should \n     rarely be invoked before any amendments have been offered . . \n     . I will vote against cloture to register my objection to \n     this flawed process.\n\n  Senator Reid made similar comments a short time later on March 2, \n2006, saying:\n\n       Don't fill the tree . . . That is a bad way, in my opinion, \n     to run this Senate.\n\n  Senator Durbin, speaking on May 11, 2006, on the 2005 tax \nreconciliation conference report said:\n\n       The Republican majority brings a bill to the Senate, fills \n     the tree so no amendments can be offered, and then files \n     cloture which stops debate. So we cannot have this \n     conversation. We cannot offer other amendments.\n\n  I cite Senator Reid and Senator Durbin with particularity because \nthey are the two leaders of the Democrats at the present time.\n  An eloquent statement on this subject was made by Senator Dodd on May \n11, 2006. Senator Dodd had this to say when he was speaking about \nhealth care legislation:\n\n       I want to point out to our colleagues why I am terribly \n     disappointed with the procedures we have been confronted with \n     this evening dealing with this legislation . . . This is the \n     Senate. This Chamber historically is the place where debate \n     occurs. To have a process here this evening . . . to \n     basically lock out any amendments that might be offered to \n     this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of this body \n     . . . if you believe the Senate ought to be heard on a \n     variety of issues relating to the subject matter--when the \n     amendment tree has been entirely filled, then obviously we \n     are dealing with a process that ought not to be . . . the \n     Senate ought to be a place where we can offer amendments, \n     have healthy debate over a reasonable time, and then come to \n     closure on the subject matter.\n\n  I could go on at considerable length with other Senators making the \nsame point. But here we have issues of gigantic importance which are \nnot being considered. They are not being debated. They are not being \nexplained. They are not being subject to questioning on the Senate \nfloor, one Senator on another.\n  The educational process of telling America what the alternatives and \nprospects are for legislative change is not being explored. Not \nsurprisingly, it is bipartisan. About the only thing that is bipartisan \naround this place is various mechanisms to gain political advantage.\n  We have had furious debates over the issue of confirmation of judges, \na subject on which I have spoken repeatedly\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\nand have noted that in the past 20 years, every time the Senate is \ncontrolled by a party opposite the President, there is a slowdown of \nthe confirmation process. It happened during the last 2 years of \nPresident Reagan's administration in 1987 and 1988 when Democrats won \ncontrol of the Senate in the 1986 election. It happened in the last 2 \nyears of the administration of President George H.W. Bush, and during \nthe administration of President Clinton where we Republicans controlled \nthe Senate for the last 6 years, it was exacerbated. It was even worse \nin blocking President Clinton's nominations.\n  As I have said on this floor on occasion, I voted with the Democrats. \nI thought the Republican caucus was wrong and said so. But each time it \nhas been exacerbated and become more intense.\n  Then this body saw a very sharp debate in 2005 where there was the \nconsideration of the so-called nuclear or constitutional option, which \nwould have changed the filibuster rule from 60 to 51. Now we are, \nagain, in a period of gridlock. There is no doubt that the very low \npublic opinion ratings of us are due to the public realization, the \npublic disgust about all the bickering that goes on here. The public \nsees it on many items, the partisanship and the effort at a partisan \nadvantage. But I do believe the public does not have an understanding \nof these arcane rules, like filling the tree. They can hardly have an \nunderstanding since most Members of this body don't understand exactly \nhow it works.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a matter that comes to me this afternoon \nor yesterday or the day before. I have been watching it for a \nconsiderable period of time, and 18 months ago, on February 15, 2007, I \nintroduced S. Res. 83, a resolution to amend the Standing Rules of the \nSenate to prohibit filling the amendment tree. So far there has not \nbeen a hearing and not been any action on that, but I intend to press \nthis issue. I intend to try to bring some understanding to the American \npeople beyond the confines of this Chamber.\n  I don't think I am going to have a whole lot of effect on my \ncolleagues this afternoon because there are none of my colleagues here \nthis afternoon, except for the--no, no, I know the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland is here--except for the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. And I compliment my colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, on his fast \nstart in the Senate. Of course, he had a lot of advanced training \nhaving come from the House of Representatives and been a leader in the \nMaryland Legislature. I work with him on the Judiciary Committee, and \nhe is a first-class Senator. That extract can be used--let's see, you \nran in 2006--you can use it in 2012, 2018, 2024, and 2030, Senator \nCardin, but beyond 2030, I am reserving my judgment.\n  But Senators are busy, and I am not in any way critical of Senators \nnot being here, but I intend to speak on the subject repetitively. I \ndon't know that will do any good, but I intend to do that.\n  For years, Senator Proxmire used to stand at his seat on the aisle \nspeaking about genocide. Every day he came to the Senate floor, and he \nwas motivated because there was no television at the time he was \nspeaking about genocide. I think television came while he was still \nspeaking on the subject. Senator Proxmire was a remarkable Senator in \nmany ways. My recollection is that he had 17,000 votes, which he didn't \nmiss. I am not sure about the exact statistic, but I am sure he spoke \nextensively on genocide, and he had an impact. And now we know that \ngenocide has been picked up as a crime against humanity and has been \nthe subject of prosecutions under the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  So I intend to speak about this subject with some frequency, and I \nintend to press for a hearing on my resolution. I intend to press to \nsee if we can get some action because if the American people knew what \nwas going on, the American people would not like it. The American \npeople live under the illusion that we have a United States Senate. The \nfacts show that the Senate is realistically dysfunctional. It is on \nlife support, perhaps even moribund. The only facet of Senate \nbipartisanship is the conspiracy of successive Republican and \nDemocratic leaders to employ this procedural device known as filling \nthe tree. It is known that way to insiders, and it is incomprehensible \nto outsiders.\n  Once known as a unique legislative institution, the Senate was \nreferred to as the world's greatest deliberative body because any \nSenator could introduce almost any amendment on virtually any subject \nand get a vote on it. That was, as noted, the distinguishing feature \nfrom the House of Representatives, which is tightly controlled by the \nRules Committee to restrict the parameters on what amendments are in \norder.\n  A principal reason, perhaps the main reason for the use of the \nprocedural device of filling the tree, was to save the majority from \ntaking tough votes. That backfired on Republicans in the last Congress, \nwhere the filling the tree rule was used in order to avoid bad votes. \nAnd, of course, we know the procedure backfired pretty hard for \nRepublicans to lose control of the Senate. In the 2006 election we had \nto lose seven seats, a virtual impossibility, but we managed to do it.\n  But more important than the partisanship, more important than the \nincreased use by both Democratic and Republican majority leaders is the \nimpact it has on this institution. And more important than that is the \nimpact it has on the legislative process and the working through \nlegislation, which ought to be considered and, where warranted, enacted \nfor the benefit of the American people.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5380-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5380-S5387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMERICAN ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the American people are very frustrated \nwith the failure of Congress to act on the great problems facing our \ncountry, a lot of problems, but I believe they are especially concerned \nabout surging gasoline and energy prices. They are angry. They do not \nbelieve we have done enough in this Congress, and I think when they \nfind out the leadership of this Congress, the Democratic leadership, is \nproposing legislation that will raise, not lower gas prices, they will \nnot be happy.\n  Indeed, I received a note today from my staff that an experienced \nreporter at the Birmingham News, Mr. Tom Gordon, today wrote that my \nhome county in Alabama, Wilcox County, again leads the Nation in the \npercentage of income that its citizens spend monthly on motor fuel, 16 \npercent, because the county has low incomes and people drive long \ndistances to work.\n  It is a big deal. It is absolutely a real matter of importance. I \nthink we need to do something about it. They want us to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, to produce more clean American energy, to \nshow we are taking steps to contain and I think maybe even hopefully \nreduce the surging prices.\n  These prices are threatening the family budget. They are threatening \nAmerican jobs and the American economy. Turn on any news program and \nread any news magazine. We are on track to spend $500 billion abroad \nthis year to purchase 60 percent of the oil we consume; 60 percent-plus \nis being imported. This balance-of-trade deficit weakens our dollar, \nrequiring even more dollars to purchase the same amount of oil. With \nthe dollar getting weaker, you need more dollars to buy the same amount \nof oil. We are creating jobs and wealth in nations around the world \nwith our money when this missing wealth in our country that we send \nabroad reduces our own jobs.\n  Families are routinely paying $50, $75, $100 more a month for the \nsame or even less gasoline than they were a few years ago. When this \nadded expense reduces the ability of hard-working middle-class \nAmericans to purchase what they need to get by on, or to take care of \ntheir families, and when this reduction in spending on oil reduces \nspending on things other than oil that the American people need, is it \nany wonder the economy is struggling, I ask? Is it\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\nany wonder millions of American are struggling to get by? Is it any \nwonder Americans from the suites in New York to the rural roads of \nAlabama are worried?\n  What is it our constituents are asking us to do? I think they want us \nto get busy doing what we know works. What works does not mean this \n$6.7 trillion cap-and-trade plan that has been introduced here that \nwill burden the American economy by driving up the cost of gasoline by \nanother 50 cents in the next number of years, 20 years; driving up the \ncost of electricity by 44 percent; driving up the price of gasoline \nthree times that 50 cents in the years to come in the distant future; \nand drive business away from America.\n  It will make our manufacturing industry less competitive than the \nglobal marketplace at a time when we are already struggling to compete \nand stay up. As I have noted, it will drive up unemployment, and we \nunfortunately saw a very large surge in unemployment last week, to 5.5 \npercent.\n  First, it is not a horrible rate of unemployment, but a horrible \nincrease in unemployment of five-tenths of 1 percent. As one economist \nsaid, I would not have been surprised to see 6 percent unemployment \nover the next 12 months. I did not expect to see half of that occur in \n1 month.\n  People know we have a problem and they understand it. I guess the \nquestion is, is there anything we can do about it or are we hopeless? \nIs there something we can do to bring down the price of oil and make \nmore sense in our economy to confront the danger that high energy \nprices, gasoline prices pose to America's well being?\n  Yes, there is. There is. Fundamentally we need to do what works, and \nwe know a lot of things work. It is past time to get started in taking \nthe long road back to a sound energy policy that can and will bring \ndown or at least contain the price of crude oil and gasoline.\n  I propose that we work together on common ground, liberals, \nconservatives, Republicans, and Democrats. It is within our grasp and \nthe people are ready for our leadership. We have an opportunity to \naddress our Nation's crisis. The challenge is truly bipartisan in every \nway. After all, high energy prices affect Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents all in the same way. While conservation and increasing the \nproduction of American oil and gas in an environmentally sound way can \nhelp contain the surge in prices, we need to do that. We must seek \ncommon ground further to develop and deploy technological breakthroughs \nnecessary to solve our Nation's energy crisis.\n  We must commit ourselves as a nation to the production of clean and \naffordable energy sources. We must commit to policies that will move us \nbeyond oil in a financially and prudent way. Only by championing \nnational interests over any special interests will we be able to secure \nthe common interests and lower energy prices and have a cleaner \nenvironment, both of which I believe are possible.\n  But we are far behind. Business-as-usual policies crafted to benefit \nfavored constituents are no way to develop sound energy solutions to \nour Nation's needs. That is why I am proposing legislation to direct \nthe Department of Energy, which I think can do more and should do more, \nto evaluate the host of national incentives we have now on the books to \ncreate alternative sources of energy, some of which have worked well, \nand to recommend changes based on what is in the national interest.\n  The national interest is to utilize those incentives to the maximum \namount possible to create the most amount of clean American energy. \nFrankly, there is too much in some areas and not enough in other areas. \nWe need to utilize incentives to jump-start industries that can help \nbuild a source of clean American energy. For example, we did succeed in \ncreating an ethanol industry through a very sizable incentive. That has \nworked. We have drawn it down some now. The Agriculture bill that \npassed the Senate reduced some of those incentives. Perhaps they should \nhave been reduced more since it has been such a healthy enterprise. \nThat money could have been applied to other areas and other aspects of \nalternative energy that could jump-start those sources.\n  Congress also suffers too often from a short-term focus on the \npressing issues of the day. Too often, we fail to adequately plan for \nthe future needs of the country. That is why I propose that the \nDepartment of Energy develop a comprehensive, long-term energy strategy \nto anticipate unforeseen needs and to promote continued development of \ninnovative energy sources. In order to achieve these goals, the \nDepartment would have to report its recommendations to Congress \nfrequently.\n  I am not ashamed to say that I have a lot of issues on my plate. I am \non the Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the \nEnergy Committee. The Department of Energy has a huge staff, a large \nnumber of personnel. They spend all their time every day working on \nenergy issues. We should have leadership from them. They should tell us \nwhat is working and what is not. They should help Congress set good \npolicy. They could do more in that regard. They should not be timid \nabout it. They should help us, step forward, make some proposals, and \nbe more aggressive.\n  There are many things we can do now to lower the price of gasoline \nand promote clean American energy. Indeed, progress will be made by a \nthousand steps, large and small, but they must be smart steps. They \ndon't need to be steps that cost far more than they will ever return in \nterms of energy per cost. They don't need to be political pork.\n  In 2005, Congress directed the Department of Interior to study the \noil reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf. That is the deep waters \noff our coast, not right on the beaches. The study found that 8.5 \nbillion barrels of oil are currently known to exist off our Nation's \nshores. In addition, the study estimated that approximately 86 billion \nbarrels of oil exist in these waters. We spend maybe $5 billion a year \non oil. That includes the 60 percent we import. The U.S. Geological \nSurvey and private industry also estimate that approximately 25 billion \nbarrels of oil exist on shore in the lower 48 States and Alaska. This \ntotals approximately 119 billion barrels of oil alone and would be \nenough to power millions of automobiles for a century--not every \nautomobile in the country for a century, but it would carry us a long \nway until we continue to work hard to have those breakthroughs that get \nus off oil maybe completely. The sooner the better for me.\n  These are not the only reserves known to exist from studies. These \nare reserves estimated from studies made 30 years ago. Further \nexploration and modern seismographic work will certainly locate far \nmore reserves.\n  The question fundamentally is, to the American people and my \ncolleagues, do we import more and more of our oil and gas from places \nthat produce it in the North Sea and the Persian Gulf and the Caspian \nSea off the coast of Africa and South America or do we produce it \nsafely off our own shores, where the money stays at home, where we are \nnot sending $500 billion of American citizens' money to people who \nbuild palaces in the desert with nothing more than basically money they \nhave taxed us with? The price of oil today is set in large part because \nOPEC has reduced production, creating a shortage in the whole world. \nThat is the fundamental problem. There are a lot of others, but that is \nthe fundamental problem. We need to fight back. The way we fight back \nis to keep more of our money at home and send it less to these \ncountries. How simple is that? But the policies we are having here go \nthe opposite direction. They are not allowing us to produce more oil \nand gas in America, safely and cleanly.\n  We have and can move forward a lot of other sources of oil. One could \nbe oil from oil shale. Some estimate those reserves to be approximately \n1.8 trillion barrels of oil--a lifetime of oil in oil shale. There are \na lot of things that have to happen to make that be produced. We have \nto be sure it is done in an environmental way. But we have major \ncorporations that are willing to spend billions of dollars to see if \nthey can produce it in that fashion. We blocked them from doing that \nlast year. When I say ``we,'' I didn't agree to it, but the Congress \nslipped that in in conference committee and basically blocked that in \nthe dead of night without any hearings to discuss the merits.\n  For example, Saudi Arabia, which has the largest amount of oil known \nin\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\nthe world, has only approximately 267 billion barrels of oil, whereas \nwe have 1,800 billion barrels of oil in oil shale. It is primarily \nlocated in the West in governmental lands.\n  What about coal? We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have 25 percent \nof the world's coal reserves, which is enough to last approximately 250 \nyears at the current rate. Surely long before then, we will have \ndeveloped alternatives to carbon fuels. Converting this tremendous \nresource into liquid transportation fuel using proven technology can \nbring down the price of gasoline. It really can.\n  At this very moment, private companies are prepared to convert coal \nto liquid fuel and sell it to the Air Force for aircraft, sequestering \nthe carbon so it is not emitted into the atmosphere, at approximately \n$85 a barrel. That is $40 less than the world market price of oil \ntoday, which is over $130 a barrel. They are prepared to do that. \nSomebody slipped in language to block that from occurring, so the Air \nForce now is in limbo as to whether they can enter into a long-term \ncontract necessary to guarantee domestic sources of clean fuel made \nfrom American coal, all the money staying in the United States, helping \nenhance our national security. We need to repeal that provision. We \nneed to let the Air Force go ahead with this. It would mean tremendous \nopportunity to affirm the Air Force's initiative and to verify as a \npractical matter whether this large amount of fuel can be converted \nfrom coal. The way they do it, they heat the coal, and off comes the \ngas, and then you can reconvert that back to a liquid. It comes out \ncleaner, just spotless clean. It cleans the engine instead of making it \ndirty. It is a fabulous fuel.\n\n  Diesel fuel--let me share this with you. These are some things we can \ndo and get busy now, that we should already have done. Diesel fuel is \nmore efficient than other fuels. According to Popular Mechanics \nmagazine--recently they did a comparison; I can't guarantee everything \nthey said because the numbers are pretty astounding, but in a sense it \nis good news--the next generation already in existence of clean diesel \nengines runs approximately 38 percent further on a gallon of fuel than \na similar size automobile that is a hybrid automobile. The magazine \nfound that a 2007 Volkswagen Polo Bluemotion diesel automobile travels \n38 percent farther on a gallon of fuel than a 2007 Toyota Prius hybrid.\n  We know for a fact that diesel gets 30, 35, 40 percent better mileage \nthan a gasoline engine. In fact, Europe has 50 percent of its \nautomobiles diesel. Why? Because it gets better gas mileage. We have \ngone the exact opposite direction. We only have 3 percent of our fleet \ndiesel. Why are we not creating policies that will help Americans move \nto more fuel-efficient diesel engines and do something about this odd \ncircumstance when diesel fuel is now considerably more expensive? It is \nabout 15 percent more expensive, but it gets at least 30 percent better \nmileage. It is still a buy, even at the prices at the pump today for \ndiesel. In addition to being fuel efficient, diesel-powered vehicles \nrelease fewer CO2 emissions than similar hybrids or gasoline \nengines; CO2, the global warming gas, less of that from a \ndiesel engine. It is so much cleaner today than people's memory of \nsmoky diesels in the past. It is an entirely new engine, an entirely \nnew procedure.\n  According to the Popular Mechanics field test, the Volkswagen model \ntested by the magazine emitted 5 percent fewer greenhouse gases per \nmile than a Toyota Prius. I was able to drive a Prius the week before \nlast around Alabama. It was very impressive. Why are we not thinking \nabout diesel as we seek to clean up our air and reduce our importing of \nforeign oil? Diesel engines today run on ultra-low sulfur diesel that \nis 97 percent cleaner than older diesel fuel. It is the cleanest fuel \nin the world. It is cleaner than the European fuel--the Europeans are \nenvironmentally conscious--and our own regulations require that.\n  New diesel technology, the Mercedes BlueTec engine--I visited their \nAlabama facility last week--reduces carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, \nand particulates.\n  According to the EPA, if 33 percent of American drivers switched to \ndiesel vehicles, oil consumption would be reduced by approximately 1.5 \nmillion barrels of oil a day, which would cut our imports 10 percent. \nThey say if you drill in ANWR in Alaska, an area the size of the State \nof South Carolina--and they would like to explore for oil and gas in an \narea the size of Dulles Airport--if it comes in and it is only a little \nover a million barrels a day, that is about 10 percent of our import \namount. So if we had more diesel and production in Alaska, that would \nreduce our imports 20 percent.\n  Already Americans are conserving more. They have reduced consumption \nat least 5 percent this year. So now we are down 25 percent. That is \nthe kind of thing we can do that will make a difference in the price of \noil and help make this a stronger country.\n  Now, ethanol represents a viable alternative energy source, I am \nconvinced. According to the Congressional Research Service, 6.5 billion \ngallons of ethanol were produced in the United States last year. This \namounts to approximately $19.5 billion--let me be sure I get this \ncorrect because my mind is probably like some of my colleagues. That is \n6.5 billion gallons as opposed to barrels I was talking about earlier. \nMr. President, 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in the \nUnited States last year. It amounts to approximately $19.5 billion that \nstayed in our country to create American jobs and pay good wages here. \nIt did not go to buy oil from some foreign country so that the wealth \ngoes there.\n  It is estimated that we are on track to produce 9 billion gallons of \nethanol this year. So we go from 6.5 billion to 9 billion gallons this \nyear. We are soon reaching the maximum production, I think, for most \nethanol that comes from corn, which most of this does. But that has \nbeen helpful to us, I submit to you. So this would result in \napproximately $36 billion that will be invested in America, paying \nwages to American citizens, who pay taxes to our cities and counties, \nfor schools, and to the Federal Government. We want them to have good \njobs with good wages.\n  According to Renewable Fuels Association, the price of gasoline would \nrise approximately 31 percent if ethanol was eliminated. Is that right? \nThat is an advocacy group for renewable fuels, but this week Barron's \nMagazine had an analysis and quoted figures similar to that and noted \nthat consumers were saving several hundred dollars a year as a result \nof ethanol. Whether it is a great benefit to us in net reduction of \nCO2, we do not know. Originally, the environmentalists \ncertainly believed so and advocated it. Some now question that. \nRegardless, as an economic matter and as a matter of national security, \nit has reduced our dependence on foreign oil, kept wealth at home, and \nhelped protect our national security and create jobs.\n  But there are limits on ethanol, so that is why we need to seek \ntechnological breakthroughs that will allow us to produce cellulosic \nethanol on a commercial scale. Cellulosic fuel can be produced from \nsources that do not place strains on other end users.\n  There is tremendous potential in our country to utilize waste wood \nfrom sawmills, paper companies, waste wood that is left in the forest \nfrom when the timber is cut and hurricane recovery. I talked to a FEMA \nhurricane emergency response official today about the potential of \nutilizing cellulose that is downed and thrown away in landfills after a \nhurricane, where thousands and millions of trees are blown down, to \ncreate energy. I think it is a realistic possibility. Every city and \ncounty in the country is constantly hauling out large amounts of wood \nand trees from their city. It cannot be utilized effectively for lumber \nor other uses. Instead of going to landfills, this could create energy. \nI think there is a great potential here.\n  Auburn University has spent a lot of time on switchgrass, another \ncellulosic form. They will be bringing up, June 19, to Washington their \ngasification unit that is portable. It is the size of a tractor-trailer \nrig. You put wood chips in one end, the wood is heated, a gas comes \noff, and that gas is converted to a liquid fuel. It is proven it can be \ndone. This is not impossible. What we need to do is accelerate the \nscience to prove whether it can be commercially feasible. I think it \ncan be. I am proud of Auburn. They have won a national award for that. \nThey are No. 1 in the country in that area of research, according to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\n  The next is the plug-in hybrid technology, which holds exceedingly \ngreat potential. By utilizing and improving current battery technology, \nplug-in hybrids will be able to travel father using less gasoline--\nperhaps dramatically less gasoline--than conventional hybrids or any \nother kind of automobile. In addition to greatly displacing imported \noil, plug-in hybrids can reduce the amount of pollutants and greenhouse \ngases in the air by relying on clean nuclear energy to recharge their \nbatteries.\n  Let's just talk about this briefly. We will talk a little more about \nnuclear energy. But if you have a commute each day of 10 or 15 miles \nand you can create a battery that will run 30 miles without any hybrid \nengine having to be turned on to charge and recharge the battery, a \nperson could commute back and forth to work every day if that car would \nonly run 30 miles. When they come home at night, they can plug it in \nand recharge the battery from the power socket. And particularly \ncharging it from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., it will use base load power, often \nnot even being fully utilized. If the power source is nuclear power, it \nemits no pollutants into the atmosphere whatsoever, and that will \ncompletely eliminate the need to utilize any oil or gasoline in the \ncar. Now, that is close to being reality.\n  Certainly, we will produce more wind and solar power. We support \nthose energy sources. The Congress has provided incentives for that. \nFew would dispute that large increases in clean American base load \nelectricity in large amounts is essential, and we cannot get there by \nconservation only because a number of things happen. No. 1 is that our \npopulation is going up. By 2050, we will have a substantial increase in \nthe American population. So even if every American used less, the \nNation is projected, by every expert I am aware of, to utilize more \nenergy. Another thing that happens: You may well develop new \nlightbulbs, which I hope every American will utilize and turn off \nlightbulbs when they are not using them, but we have other things that \ncome up. For example, how many of our people want to give up plasma \nTVs? They use a lot more electricity than the old kind. And computers. \nWhen we projected the increase in the cost of the utilization of \nelectricity in the 1970s and early 1980s, we did not expect the size of \nthe computer revolution and the amount of energy that would add. So \nthere is always something out there. That is all I am suggesting. It is \njust not smart for us to project in a way that is contrary to the \nexperts that we are going to utilize less electricity.\n\n  So after much study--and I have spent a good bit of study on this--it \nis clear to me that nuclear-generated electricity is the serious \nsolution for a clean energy future and an alternative to a future \nfilled with ever-increasing regulations and more regulators and more \nlobbyists and more political fights such as this cap-and-trade bill--\nall of which produce no energy but drain our American economy. Nuclear \npower is American based. It is a proven technology. It helps enhance \nour national security. It is competitive cost-wise. It is not \noutrageously expensive like some of the ideas that are being floated. \nIt emits no pollutants into the air, neither NOX nor SOx nor \nmercury nor particulates. And it 100 percent meets our global warming \ngoals, which is to reduce CO2, carbon dioxide--zero, zilch.\n  Twenty percent of our electricity today is nuclear, and we have not \nbuilt a plant in 30 years. France produces 80 percent of its power from \nnuclear power, and Japan is over 50 percent. They are heavily committed \nto nuclear power, and it is paying off for them. Britain just announced \nfive new nuclear plants. So we are running behind.\n  But the good news is that after the Energy bill Senator Domenici \nworked so hard on and the legislation he offered, 30 new applications \nfor nuclear powerplants have been submitted. That is 30--up from zero \njust a couple years ago. But we must strive to ensure this nuclear \nrenaissance continues and completes.\n  There is this tremendous possibility that base load nuclear power, \nparticularly in the night, offpeak time, could be utilized to charge \nautomobile batteries so we could run our automobiles without any fossil \nfuel being burned. Nuclear power is the one energy source that could \ncreate large amounts of hydrogen, the hydrogen necessary if we are to \ndevelop effectively fuel cell hydrogen automobiles that also favor a \nclean concept. Both of these are postoil, postcarbon energy sources \nthat can power our automobiles, which is where our crisis is today.\n  Renewable energy sources also have an important role to play. \nAccording to the Department of Energy, renewable energy provided \napproximately 9 percent of the total U.S. electricity generation in \n2005. While this is not large, there is significant room for growth. \nWind energy has led this growth, increasing from approximately 3,500 \nmegawatts in 2001 to almost 17,000 megawatts today. Solar power has \nalso increased, although cost and storage remain serious issues. \nGeothermal energy has not expanded as rapidly as wind has, but it has \npotential. According to MIT, the United States has approximately \n100,000 megawatts of enhanced geothermal capacity which can be \ndeveloped by 2050.\n  A few weeks ago, this Senate voted on a plan that would have taken \nthe first steps to produce many of these untapped energy resources by \nallowing more energy exploration off our coasts and in Alaska. But we \ndo need to move beyond petroleum-based transportation fuels. We need to \ndo some other steps, such as enhancing the batteries for electric cars, \nas this bill would have done, which could have allowed us to move to \nplug-in hybrids. I think that is within our grasp right now, and it \nwould help clean up our environment.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader on the floor. I will just \nconclude by noting that with prices at record highs, I think the \nAmerican people can be excused for wondering what their Congress is \ndoing. They expect us to get busy--to get busy now--to produce more \nclean American energy. That will be the only thing that is going to \nhelp reduce our dependence on foreign oil and our ability to be \nhijacked by prices driven up by OPEC nations that are restricting \nsupply.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to take a few minutes \nto share with our colleagues the current condition of the housing \nsituation and the steps being taken by the Senate Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee--the steps we have taken in recent days and \nwhat I hope we can continue to do in the coming days over the next week \nor so, depending upon the agenda the leadership will set for us: our \nhope is to bring forth one more proposal that will complete the circle \nof the steps we can take as public policy setters in the area of \ndealing with the heart of the economic crisis, which is the housing \ncrisis. The heart of the housing crisis is, of course, the foreclosure \ncrisis. So this report I share with my colleagues is both a positive \none--which includes the steps we are taking together to address the \nproblem--as well as, unfortunately, a rather negative one in terms of \nthe actual statistics and numbers that people are living with every \nday.\n\n  When we talk about these numbers and statistics, they actually \nreflect what is going on in the lives of very real people in our \ncountry who are struggling economically to make ends meet. Home \nownership and the value of homes is at the heart of not only the \nAmerican family dream but also at the heart of their economic success \nin many ways. So as I have done regularly over the past several months, \nI wish to share with my colleagues some of the problems we are facing \nin our economy and some of the steps we are taking to address them.\n  Three weeks ago, with overwhelming bipartisan support, we were able \nto pass out of the Banking Committee the Hope for Homeowners Act and \nlegislation to reform the Government-sponsored enterprises--the so-\ncalled GSEs. These measures will help reduce foreclosures, \nstrengthening the housing market and ultimately helping to restore our \neconomy to healthy growth. We also added as part of that legislation an \naffordable housing program which will exist in perpetuity; not a short-\nterm, 4- or 5-year program but one that will be around for years to \ncome to assist those who are in desperate need of adequate and decent \nshelter, including rental housing.\n  The committee work in these major areas follows the work that the \nSenate accomplished earlier this spring when we passed the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act. That legislation contains several very important \nprovisions to help homeowners, neighborhoods, and communities \nthroughout our Nation. The legislation included $4 billion for \ncommunities to use through the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram to purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties in their \ncommunities. The act also included $150 million in additional \nforeclosure prevention counseling, on top of the dollars we had already \nappropriated earlier, to assist in that area. Counseling, I would add, \nis a proven and very effective program that has helped struggling \nhomeowners avoid the devastating effects of losing their homes. \nFinally, the act includes legislation that would modernize the Federal \nHousing Administration so the FHA can play an enhanced role in allowing \nhard-working American families to pursue and achieve the dream of home \nownership through a suitable and sustainable mortgage.\n  I am continuing to work with our colleagues and the ranking member, \nSenator Shelby of Alabama, along with other members of the committee--\nboth Democrats and Republicans--and the Senate to enact comprehensive \nlegislation that includes these and other provisions. These Members \ninclude Senators Baucus and Grassley, the chairman and ranking member \nrespectively of the Senate Finance Committee, who have contributed very \nimportant tax provisions to the Foreclosure Prevention Act.\n  There is no question in my mind that the almost daily information we \nare receiving on the performance of our economy should continue to spur \naction on the part of this Congress. Our economy has been limping along \nfor the last 6 months, with growth well under 1 percent. If you take \naway the growth in Government and the buildup of inventories that \noccurs when the economy enters a recession, our economy grew by three-\ntenths of 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. In other words, \nour economy is at best stagnant, and in the view of many economists and \nothers, we are actually in a recession.\n  Last week we learned that the unemployment rate in April rose by one-\nhalf of a percentage point in 1 month. That is the largest monthly \nincrease at that rate in 22 years. We have lost thousands of jobs each \nand every month this year so far, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. This year, our economy has lost just under 400,000 private \nsector jobs, and most economists expect they will continue to lose jobs \nas the economy struggles. That is why I think it is critically \nimportant that we ought to provide for extended unemployment insurance \nbenefits for those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown as part of our response to the economic challenges we are facing. \nCertainly if we weren't able to do this, it would be the first time in \nmy experience in this body for a quarter of a century that we didn't \nextend unemployment insurance benefits to people who have lost their \njobs during periods of economic hardship. That has never happened \nbefore in my tenure here, and it is my serious hope that we will \nprovide those extended benefits to those who deserve them.\n  The data we are looking at, as sad as it is, also confirms that the \nhousing market continues to be mired in a deep recession as well. \nResidential construction fell by over 30 percent in the first quarter \nof this year. Sales of existing homes fell by 13 percent over last \nyear. Now, let me quickly add some new data today for April that \nindicates sales may have finally picked up slightly, and we welcome \nthat news. Most analysts, however, believe this uptick, if you will, in \nhomes sales occurred only because home prices have continued to fall \nover the last several months. Regardless of that uptick, the number of \nnew homes that remains unsold continues to rise, reaching the highest \nnumber in over a quarter of a century. Joining this growing number of \nnew homes sitting vacant on the market unsold are homes where the \nprevious owner has been foreclosed.\n  Foreclosures have hit a new all-time record. According to the \nMortgage Bankers Association--the MBA--this data shows that almost 1 in \nevery 11 homes with a mortgage in our country is in default or in \nforeclosure as of March of this year. That is the highest level since \nthe MBA began tracking foreclosures in 1979. Foreclosure rates have \nbeen growing at record levels for some time, and last year alone 1.5 \nmillion of our fellow families in this country had their homes enter \ninto a foreclosure.\n\n  Each and every day, over more than 8,100 families enter foreclosure. \nEvery single day, 8,100 families on average enter foreclosure. The \nprojections are that foreclosure rates will remain at historic highs \nfor the foreseeable future. The investment bank Credit Suisse just \nreleased a report in which they predict that 6.5 million homes will \nfall into foreclosure over the next 5 years. They state:\n\n       The coming flood of new foreclosures could put 8.4 percent \n     of total homeowners, or 12.7 percent of homeowners with \n     mortgages, out of their homes.\n\n  The scenario they are describing is one in which one out of eight \nAmerican families with a mortgage could lose their homes. That is a \nchilling prediction.\n  Robert Schiller, the widely respected economist from Yale University \nwho helped invent the so-called Case-Schiller Index that is used \nthroughout the country and the markets to measure the change in home \nvalues, gave a speech recently in New Haven, CT where he said there is \na good chance that housing prices will fall further, perhaps by as much \nas 30 percent since their peak in the late part of 2006. If that were \nto happen, it would mean the decline in home prices would be greater \nnow than it was during the Great Depression back in the 1920s and 1930s \nof the previous century.\n  These are indeed historic times with historic challenges. Already we \nhave seen home prices decline nationally for the first time since the \nGreat Depression. For the first time since the Federal Reserve began \nkeeping track of home equity in the 1940s, Americans today own less \nthan half the value in their homes.\n  The effect this is having on our economy cannot be overstated. Martin \nFeldstein, who served as President\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nReagan's chief economist, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The 10 percent decline in home prices has cut household \n     wealth by more than $2 trillion, reducing consumer spending \n     and increasing the risk of a deep recession.\n\n  That means American families have lost more than $2 trillion of \nwealth. Losses of that magnitude are staggering. That is almost 20 \npercent of our Nation's GDP. Put another way, a national loss of wealth \nof $2 trillion means a typical family of four would have lost over \n$25,000 of wealth due to the current housing market crisis. This sharp \nloss in wealth for the average American homeowner comes at a time when \nthey face record high prices for essentials of American life: Food, \ngasoline prices--as we have heard about today the cost of gas has been \nincreasing every day--health care, and the cost of higher education. So \nthe so-called foreclosure crisis is affecting far more than only those \nfacing foreclosure. It is affecting nearly all of us in every \nimaginable way. As one home falls into foreclosure, the value of \ncountless other homes in those neighborhoods is falling as well. If Dr. \nSchiller's predictions come to bear and home prices fall by 30 percent \nnationally, then the loss to American families will exceed $6 trillion. \nThat is more than half of our Nation's annual GDP. It would mean the \ntypical family of four would have lost approximately $80,000 of wealth. \nThat is more than most American families earn in an entire year.\n  The nationwide implications of this crisis help explain why consumer \nsentiment is at historic lows. Americans' expectations for future \neconomic growth are at the lowest level in 35 years since the deep \nrecession of the early 1970s.\n  These negative views about our economic prospects are based on the \nreal experiences of most Americans. The Pew Center conducted a recent \nsurvey of Americans' views not only on the economy as a whole but on \ntheir personal well-being. The Washington Post characterized the Pew \nCenter's finding as:\n\n       Offering the gloomiest assessment of economic well-being in \n     close to half a century, a new survey has found that most \n     Americans say they have not made progress over the past 5 \n     years as their incomes have stagnated and they have \n     increasingly borrowed money to finance their lifestyles.\n\n  By almost any measure, Americans are struggling more and more than \nthey have at any time in recent memory. Real median family income has \nfallen this decade as the cost of gasoline, health care, and college \ntuition, have risen at levels far outstripping any increases in \npaychecks. To keep pace with these rising costs, Americans have turned \nto borrowing from credit cards and their homes. But now, as the crisis \nin our capital markets begins to threaten sources of liquidity for \npeople, such as mortgages, student loans, and other types of lending, \nthe American economy is in a precarious place, to put it mildly. That \nis why we need new policies and new action to prevent this recession \nfrom becoming more severe, and to lay the foundation for our recovery.\n  The Federal Reserve is engaged in a series of interest rate cuts as \nthey continue to aggressively use monetary policy to try and deal with \nthe recession we are facing. But the Fed is running out of pages in its \nplaybook to address the growing crisis of credit and confidence that \nhas taken hold of our financial markets and threatens to undermine our \nNation's economy. Until we more thoroughly address the core issue \nbehind this recession--namely, the problems in the housing market and \nthe foreclosure crisis--we are unlikely, in my opinion, to put our \neconomy back on the right track. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke understands \nthe seriousness of this problem. In a recent speech on the subject of \nforeclosures, he said:\n\n       High rates of delinquency in foreclosure can have \n     substantial spillover effects on the housing market, the \n     financial markets and the broader economy. Therefore, doing \n     what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in \n     the interest of lenders and borrowers. It's in everybody's \n     interest.\n\n  I pledge to continue to work every day--as I know my colleagues on \nthe Senate Banking Committee will, as well as those in the House \nFinancial Services Committee under the leadership of Congressman Barney \nFrank and as I am confident all of us in this Chamber will--to do \neverything we can to address these issues from the perspective of what \nwe can do as part of the national legislature. That is why I am pleased \nto say that through these efforts, what we have brought to the floor of \nthe Senate over the last several weeks has enjoyed broad-based \nbipartisan support. We will now be coming back again in the coming \ndays. The leader of our Chamber, Senator Reid, has committed that we \nwill get to this as soon as we possibly can, given the crowded agenda \nhe has to deal with. But we cannot, in my view, allow this Congress to \ncontinue to move forward in the coming days without addressing the \nremainder of these issues.\n  I cannot promise absolutely that everything we have offered is going \nto change the world dramatically. But there is one thing I hope it does \ndo and that is restore confidence in the American families, whom the \nMembers of this Congress serve, both Democrats and Republicans, are \ndoing everything in their power to try and prevent foreclosures, \nrestore confidence in the marketplace, and make it possible for the \nAmerican dream of home ownership not to become the nightmare it has for \nfar too many fellow citizens. It is at the core of everything else we \nare grappling with. We have seen the problem spill over into credit \ncards, financial services, commercial lending, student loans, and at \nthe heart of all of this is the foreclosure problem.\n  That is what every single responsible economist, regardless of \npolitical ideology, has concluded. They have said there are steps we \ncan take to make a difference--those steps we have created in a \nlegislative manner to bring to this body. Our hope is we will enjoy the \nkind of broad-based support we have had in our committee. Anybody who \nhas watched this body knows that when you get a 19-to-2 vote in \ncommittee on a matter such of this, you get some indication of the \nwillingness of members to work together to make a difference. Senator \nShelby and I and the other members of the committee will continue to do \nthat. We hope to put on the President's desk by July 4 this \ncomprehensive financial services Banking Committee proposal, dealing \nwith FHA, dealing with the government-sponsored enterprises, dealing \nwith affordable housing, dealing with counseling, dealing with the \ncommunity development block grant program, as well as tax ideas that we \nthink could help, and the Hope for Homeowners Act, which is critical to \ntry to put the brakes on this foreclosure problem.\n  I wished to take some time this afternoon to share with my colleagues \nthat this problem grows more serious. It is growing more troublesome, \nspreading beyond our national borders, in terms of what the subprime \nmarket and the purchase of those mortgage-backed securities has done to \nthe markets, not only in this country, but abroad as well.\n  This is our major responsibility, in my view and I think we have a \ncommitment to address it. Senator Shelby and I have worked very well \ntogether over the past number of weeks to try to fashion this \nlegislative proposal.\n  I commend Barney Frank, my friend from Massachusetts, who is chairman \nof the Financial Services Committee in the other body, and other \nMembers for the job they are doing together as well. I hope that in the \nremaining days, before the July break--hopefully sooner than that--we \nwill be able to present to our colleagues a final proposal bringing \ntogether these ideas for their consideration and support as we do our \npart to try to make a difference in getting this economy and the \nconfidence of the American people back on track.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this evening amid new and very \npressing concerns about the future of our economy. Today, millions of \nAmericans are struggling to keep their homes. The price of just about \neverything, from gas, college, health care,\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\nyou name it, is on the rise, and families from coast to coast are \nwondering how they are going to make ends meet.\n  Just last week, we saw new and shocking statistics illustrating this \ncrisis. With the price of the American Dream going up, working families \nseem to be facing new challenges every day. Last week, it was a new \nreport from the Department of Labor. They told us the overall \nunemployment rate rose from 5 percent to 5.5 percent in May, up from \n4.5 percent just 1 year ago. That is 861,000 new unemployed people in 1 \nmonth, bringing the total to 8\\1/2\\ million people unemployed in \nAmerica today in May. Today, there is even more bad news. Gas has, for \nthe first time, hit an average of $4 a gallon.\n  Madam President, the American people are hurting. While job creation \nand wage levels are dropping, prices are going up. Everything costs \nmore, but families don't have enough money to spend. The bottom line is \nthe American Dream is slipping through the fingers of too many \nAmericans, and we have to do something about it.\n  Now, this evening I want to talk specifically about oil and gas \nprices because this week the Senate is going to have an opportunity to \ntake a step in the right direction and put consumers first. Tomorrow \nmorning, we are going to vote on a Democratic bill that seeks to \naddress the root causes of these high gas prices because we are \ncommitted to putting consumers first and to fixing the root causes of \nhigh gas prices so these solutions have a real lasting effect.\n  We want to force big oil to pay its fair share and invest in clean \nand affordable alternative energy sources. We want to protect consumers \nfrom price gougers who rip off Americans and greedy oil traders who \nmanipulate this market. We want to stand up to OPEC and countries \ncolluding to set high oil prices. These basic, commonsense steps will \nattack the root causes of high gas prices, but they are only the \nbeginning.\n  Step 2 has to include a long-term strategy to decrease our dependence \non oil and promote clean renewable energy. That is why later this week \nwe are going to propose billions of dollars in tax breaks to promote \nthose new energy sources. Our plan seeks to address the high price of \ngas at the pump now, but it will also help to ensure that energy is \naffordable for years to come.\n  With gas prices on the rise, there has been a lot of finger-pointing \nin recent weeks, but you don't have to look very hard to see who is to \nblame and who is benefiting from these skyrocketing prices. While our \nworking families have been scrimping, the economic downturn hasn't even \nregistered for big oil. The major oil companies reported record \nincreases in profits last quarter. ConocoPhillips recorded first \nquarter profits of $4.1 billion, beating their previous record by $600 \nmillion, with Shell and BP also reporting huge gains.\n  The reason is that over the last 7\\1/2\\ years, Republicans have \nbacked an energy policy that does little but give oil companies tax \nbreaks and special favors while our middle-class families pay the \nprice. In the first month of the Bush administration, oil prices \naveraged $29.50 a barrel. Now, almost 8 years later, the price has more \nthan quadrupled. It is over $130 a barrel this week and pushing toward \n$140 a barrel. When President Bush first took office, Americans were \npaying $1.46 a gallon to fill their tanks, and this week gas prices are \naveraging a whopping $4 a gallon. We have gone from $1.46 to over $4 a \ngallon in this Bush administration.\n  What is most disturbing to me and to American families all across the \ncountry is how fast these gas prices are rising. Six weeks ago, I came \non the floor of the Senate and spoke on the same subject, saying a lot \nof the same things, and at the same time I was saying how shocking it \nwas to see the national average at $3.60 a gallon. But in just a few \nweeks prices have gone up another 40 cents a gallon. I am a little \nscared to do the math and see what increase that is going to translate \ninto by the Fourth of July, just a few weeks away or, even worse, Labor \nDay. Instead, I think it is time we come together for action in the \nSenate.\n  I mentioned the national averages already, but in my home State of \nWashington and the home State of the Presiding Officer, drivers are \npaying even more. The average cost of a gallon of gas in Washington \nState is now $4.22. Yesterday, in my State, I paid $4.29 a gallon. \nRight now, AAA is saying that gas costs $4.22 in my State. That is the \naverage. That is 44 cents higher than just a month ago, 95 cents higher \nthan a year ago, and 20 cents higher than the national average. And our \ntruckers are being hit really hard. AAA found the average price of a \ngallon of diesel is $4.89 a gallon in my home State. That is 40 cents \nhigher than a month ago and $1.84 higher than just a year ago.\n  When I travel around Washington State, gas prices are the first thing \npeople talk to me about, and they have written me countless letters \nasking for help. Everyone asks what we are going to do about this \nmatter. While they are cutting back their budgets in my home State, \nthey do not see any action in Washington, DC. And I have told them time \nand again that Democrats want to act, but we need help to do that from \nour Republican colleagues. They will have a chance to help us do that \ntomorrow.\n  But I am concerned that Republicans are more interested, from what I \nam hearing, in just blocking our progress and whatever we want to do \nhere than actually taking any meaningful action for the people who are \nhurting so badly at home today. In fact, for the past several days, we \nhave already seen, from what I have heard, a parade of Republican \nSenators out on the floor complaining about high gas prices, and in \nmany cases blaming Democrats for failing to address this crisis over \nthe past 16 months. They are bringing out their charts and showing the \nprice of gas when Democrats took over Congress and what the price is \nnow, and they ask us all to simply forget the real reason for this \ncrisis--the misguided energy policy that this administration has \npursued for years.\n  But I don't think the American people are going to forget that. They \nare not going to forget it was this administration that asked oil and \ngas companies to write their energy plan. The American people aren't \ngoing to forget the only real idea coming from the other side is to \ndrill our way out of the problem. And they are not going to forget that \nthis is an administration closer to the oil and gas industry than any \nin our history. We are not going to forget either, and that is why we \nare fighting for change. We have already won higher fuel economy \nstandards and new investments in renewable energy sources, but we know \nwe need to do more because Americans know that we cannot rely--we \ncannot rely--on big oil to solve our energy problems.\n  Madam President, the energy policy isn't the only area where \nRepublicans have put special interests ahead of our American families. \nFor 7\\1/2\\ years, President Bush and the Republicans in Congress have \nchosen to stand by while our highways are crumbling, hundreds of \nthousands of our veterans go homeless every night, and millions of our \nfamilies struggle to keep a roof over their heads. In the last year, \nour new Democratic majority has had to fight Republicans and the \nadministration for resources to address everything from veterans health \ncare to the foreclosure crisis our families are facing. I think the \nlegacy of this administration is going to be nothing but red ink and \nbroken promises.\n  People in my home State of Washington are very worried about the \nfuture. They want to be sure their children will have economic \nsecurity. They want a solution to our energy problems that are going to \nkeep us safe and protect our environment for the long run. And the same \nis true, I know, across the country. Americans are hurting because of \nthese high gas prices. It doesn't matter whether they are Republican or \nDemocrat, they want help.\n\n  I know Republicans and oil companies are not going to give up on the \nstatus quo easily here. But Democrats on our side have been fighting \nfor policies that will help us cut those prices, create jobs, and keep \nour air and water clean and, most importantly, our Nation secure.\n  We are committed to taking strong action that will stop rewarding \nthese oil companies and start looking out for our American families. We \nare going to keep up that fight. If my Republican colleagues want their \nconstituents to have help, if they want to take action that will stop \nthis pain at the pump, the solution is very simple: Vote yes with us \ntomorrow morning so we can move to a bill that will begin to solve this \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\n  (Mr. SANDERS assumes the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5387-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RUNNING IT OUT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a unique event occurred in a Philadelphia \nPhillies baseball game last week. The Philadelphia Phillies' shortstop, \nnamed Jimmy Rollins, who was the most valuable player in the league \nlast year, hit a looping ball into left field--which was an easy ball \nto catch--and instead of running it out, he ran at a very leisurely \npace down the first baseline. The left fielder on the defensive team \nmoved in and, in a very unusual play, dropped the ball. Instead of \nRollins getting to second base, he was left at first base.\n  The Phillies' manager, Charles Manuel, then immediately benched Jimmy \nRollins, the most valuable player in the league. He put him right on \nthe bench because he did not run it out. That took a lot of guts, and \nmanager Charles Manuel has been complimented on that, and I renew the \ncompliment here today. But it is a great lesson, in my opinion, about \nthe way baseball players ought to act and Senators ought to act and \neverybody ought to act. We all ought to so-called run it out, with that \nkind of intensity.\n  I am an avid squash player, and one of the maxims I have developed \nover the years is that I am never too far ahead to lose and never too \nfar behind to win. The game is always in play, if you run it out. I \nthink it has some applicability to all facets of life in things that \nall people do, in terms of the intensity of their activity. And I think \nwe need a lot more of that attitude in the Senate and a sense of \nurgency to deal with the people's business.\n  This relates directly to the presentation I made a few moments ago on \ngoing back to the rules of the Senate on open debate, open amendment \noffering, and not filling the tree. But it is a great lesson to have \nthat rule stamped indelibly of ``running it out.'' So I congratulate \nCharlie Manuel.

Mr. President, I have had the privilege of calling \nMr. John ``Harp'' Cote of Butte, MT, my friend for nearly 40 years.\n  In 1973 when I was running for my first congressional seat, not a \nwhole lot of folks knew me from Adam and the only people I was sure \nwould vote for me were my parents. But everywhere I went I heard the \nsame thing: ``Go see Harp.'' So I went.\n  Harp took his time sizing me up during that first meeting, and I \nremember vividly the moment when he said those magic words, ``I'm with \nyou.'' I know his support made all the difference. I owe my first \npolitical break to Harp Cote, and I don't know if anything I've \naccomplished since then would have happened if he hadn't been in my \ncorner from the start.\n  Harp is a pillar in Montana politics and a great American. He's a \nmodel citizen and a model father and grandfather. He and his wife, \nEsther raised 8 children and have 14 grandchildren. From his many \nsuccessful business ventures to his leadership roles in just about \nevery charitable organization in town--Butte, and indeed Montana, is a \nbetter place because of Harp Cote.\n  Mark Twain once said ``I have found out that there ain't no surer way \nto find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with \nthem.'' Well, a couple of years ago, I lead a delegation of Montanans, \nincluding Harp, to China and India to see what we could do to create \nmore good-paying jobs and open doors for Montana businesses. After 10 \ndays I can tell you, there is no one I like more than Harp. His \nfamiliar smile and easy personality made the trip a great success. And \nI'm proud of the doors we opened while we were there.\n  In April, I asked Harp to join me in Washington, DC, to hear Irish \nPrime Minister Bertie Ahern address a Joint Meeting of Congress. Each \nMember of Congress was allowed to bring one guest, and I invited Harp \nbecause of his unwavering dedication to Montana.\n  As a Butte native and proud Irish American, Harp's attendance has \nallowed him to further the Mining city's deep seeded Irish connections \nand heritage.\n  Like most folks in Butte, Harp has Irish blood in his veins, but he \nis a Montanan through and through. He is dedicated, hard working and \none heck of a sportsman. His optimism, resilience and pure grit define \nMontanans and embody the western spirit.\n  I am lucky to have him by my side as we work to do what is right for \nMontana, making sure Big Sky country remains the Last Best Place to \nlive, work and raise a family.\n  In 2006, Harp was on hand to welcome Irish President Mary McAleese to \nButte. McAleese was the first Irish leader to visit the Mining city \nsince 1919. During the visit, McAleese told a crowd: ``You can be \nassured that Butte matters to us as much as Ireland matters to Butte.''\n  I would like to echo President McAleese's sentiment.\n  Harp Cote can be assured that he means as much to Butte, and to \nMontana, as Montana and Butte mean to him.\n  As for myself, I know when it's all said and done and I look back on \nmy career and my friends, one thing will be certain--one of the \ngreatest honors of my life is the privilege of calling Harp Cote my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5387-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5387-S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR J. SCHUT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \nservice that Arthur (Art) J. Schut has provided to so many in my home \nState of Iowa. Art is an Iowan that has dedicated over 30 years of \nhimself to the disenfranchised of our communities. He has worked \ntirelessly on a local, State, and national level to provide care, \ncounseling, and education for families, the public, and lawmakers to \nminimize the negative stigma and to secure funding and resources for \nthose with addiction and mental health issues.\n  Art began his distinguished career nearly 40 years ago as a program \ndirector for the Des Moines Metropolitan YMCA working with youth gangs. \nSince that time, Art has served in a variety of roles working on behalf \nof those who suffer from the scourge of addiction and other mental \nillness. Art has served as a member of the University of Iowa faculty \nand as a clinical and treatment director. During this period in Art's \nlife, he supervised several drug treatment and education programs \nthroughout southeast Iowa, and he provided vital education for future \nsubstance abuse professionals through his position with the University \nof Iowa.\n  Art will soon be leaving the position that he has dutifully served in \nfor 25 years as President and CEO of the Mid-Eastern Council on \nChemical Abuse, MECCA. Throughout his service as the President of \nMECCA, Art has overseen the administration of operations and programs \nin three regions throughout\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nIowa. These operations include outpatient offices in 16 counties, a \nprevention unit, employee assistance program for regional businesses \nand industries, a residential treatment program, and a detoxification \nunit.\n  Sadly, Art will soon be leaving the great State of Iowa, but he will \nbe continuing the good fight against addiction and abuse. Barbara and I \nwant to extend our gratitude for all the years of service and for the \npositive impact on all the lives Art has had throughout his remarkable \ncareer. We wish Art all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5388-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF TULARE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the community of Tulare, SD. After 125 \nyears, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on its \npast and future, and I congratulate the people of Tulare for all they \nhave accomplished.\n  Tulare is located in northeast South Dakota, within Spink County on \nHighway 281. Originally plotted by Charles Prior in 1883, the town \nquickly grew as an important railroad supply station. There is some \ndisagreement about the naming of Tulare, which tends to follow three \ndifferent stories. The first story tells that when riding the train to \nTulare, Mr. Prior encountered two men entertaining the passengers with \ntall tales. He was so amused by the time he reached his destination, he \ndecided to call the town site ``Tulare'' after the ``two liars.'' The \nsecond story claims the town was named after the ``Tulle'' weed that \ngrows in the swamps, and the third story names the city after a Native \nAmerica chief.\n  Today, Tulare has come a long way from its days as a railroad supply \ncenter. The town now boasts a variety of businesses, including those in \nboth the service and manufacturing sectors. Coupling with those parts \nof the economy are the rich natural resources including the plentiful \npheasant population which further aids in the prosperity of this \ncommunity. The town also continues their long tradition of high \nstandards in education that began here with the first 4-year high \nschool and continues to thrive as the Hitchcock-Tulare School District.\n  Tulare has become a credit to Spink County and the State of South \nDakota. The people of Tulare will celebrate their achievements June 20-\n22, 2008, with a basketball tournament, parade, car and quilt show, and \nstreet dance. I am proud to join with the community members of Tulare \nin celebrating the last 125 years and look forward to a promising \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5388-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CANOVA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I recognize the community of \nCanova, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Canova \nis a rural community located in Miner County, and will be celebrating \nits quasquicentennial the weekend of July 4-6.\n  The combination of the Homestead Act of 1862, the opening of \nGovernment lands, and the influx of railroads through the State all \nadded greatly to the development of Canova in the 19th century. L.W. \nAldrich and H.W. Eddy, both from Watertown, NY, bought the land around \nCanova, while F.D. Woodbury registered Canova as a town in 1883.\n  The town of Canova was built on the pillars of farming, faith, and \nbaseball, boasting 8 State titles and 11 runner-up finishes. These \nactivities serve to bring this close-knit community even closer \ntogether. While the school has since closed, it did bring about the \nbirth of the Canova Alumni and the promotion of community health with \nthe CARE Center.\n  Most South Dakotans call small towns like Canova home. South Dakota's \nsmall communities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the \nfuture of our State. It is especially because of our small communities, \nand the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I \nam proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like Canova and its citizens \nare no different and truly know what it means to be South Dakotan. Even \n125 years after its founding, Canova continues to be a vibrant addition \nto our wonderful State, and I once again congratulate them on this \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5388-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF WILLOW LAKE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

After \n125 years, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on \nits past and future, and I congratulate the people of Willow Lake for \nall they have accomplished.\n  Willow Lake, located in Clark County, was originally plotted on the \nnortheast corner of the lake in 1883. When the Manitoba Railroad was \nsurveyed to come about 2 miles south of the city, the decision was made \nto move the town to its present location. Willow Lake grew with the \nevolution of the Manitoba Railroad to the Great Northern in 1890. A \ntornado and several fires swept through the town during the turn of the \n20th century, destroying most of the primarily wooden structures. \nShortly thereafter, the town fathers mandated that all Main Street \nbuildings were to be made of brick to withstand the elements of eastern \nSouth Dakota.\n  Today, Willow Lake has come a long way from the days of railroad \ncommerce. The town now boasts a variety of businesses in both the \nservice and manufacturing sectors, including a grain elevator, multiple \nconstruction companies, and a K-12 public school. The people of Willow \nLake will celebrate their achievements July 4-6, 2008, with a rodeo, \ncar show, fireworks display, and parade as well as an all school \nreunion which, as reported by Paul Harvey, is held each and every year.\n  Willow Lake is a credit to Clark County and to the State of South \nDakota. I am proud to join with the community members of Willow Lake in \ncelebrating the last 125 years, and looking forward to a promising \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5388-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5388-S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING THE SNACKS 4 EDUCATION TEAM\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the friends and \nfamilies of four remarkable young Hoosiers in congratulating their \nteam's success in the eCybermission science, math, and technology \ncompetition for sixth through ninth graders sponsored by the U.S. Army.\n  Having won the ninth grade Northwest Regional Competition, the Fort \nWayne-based ``Snacks 4 Education'' team of Allie Dembar, Andrew \nReichle, Amelia Roebuck, and Darcy Whitney will now face three other \nteams in the National Competition to be held in Washington, DC, on June \n24. These four students have shown considerable insight and leadership \nin the execution of their project promoting proper school-time \nnutrition. The team is led by adviser, Larry Lesh.\n  Each member should be proud of their accomplishments. I am especially \ngrateful for their advocacy and the effort these young leaders have put \nforth to demonstrate the benefits of proper nutrition and healthy \nsnacks on classroom education.\n  I hope you will join me in offering congratulations to all the \nparticipants in this year's eCybermission competition and best wishes \nto the many finalists.\n  I ask to have the following statement further detailing the ``Snacks \n4 Education'' project printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                 (By the members of Snacks 4 Education)\n\n       In American schools today, many students arrive ill-\n     prepared to learn at their full potential. There are a \n     multitude of reasons for this, including not getting enough \n     rest, not eating a nourishing breakfast, and not coming from \n     a home that values education. As a result, these students in \n     particular, and probably all students, have a time during the \n     school day when they experience a low energy point. Our team \n     of four students, after noticing the same problem in our own \n     schools, hypothesized that having a healthy snack at or near \n     this low energy time would help students to be more alert, \n     more energetic, and better able to concentrate.\n       For our project, the team experimented in eleven classrooms \n     in four schools, covering each grade from one through six. \n     The experiments were run during three separate time periods. \n     The team first had to determine the low energy time of the \n     class. This was accomplished by asking the students through a \n     questionnaire, or by allowing the teacher to make the \n     decision, or by a combination of these two methods. In two of \n     the experiments, snacks approved by the Fort Wayne\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\n     Community Schools' Nutrition Services were given each day at \n     the low energy time. Then for two weeks, snacks were not \n     given. In one case, the experiment ran for eight weeks, \n     having two weeks with snacks, then two weeks without, then \n     two with, and finishing with two weeks without.\n       In each experimental snack week, dry snacks were given on \n     Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Fruit snacks were given on \n     Tuesday and Thursday. The dry snacks were packages of teddy \n     grahams, pretzels, and animal crackers. Fruit snacks varied \n     and included small packages of sliced apples, grapes, or \n     oranges. The dry snack servings all contained around 125 \n     calories and were determined to be of healthy content by a \n     registered dietitian.\n       Questionnaires were given to the students on each Friday of \n     the experimental weeks. On the final week evaluation, two \n     extra questions were asked. The first question asked whether \n     the students did better in their schoolwork during the weeks \n     they had a snack each day. The second question asked how they \n     felt after having a daily snack. In grade 1, 84 percent \n     thought they did better on their schoolwork, and 70 percent \n     said they felt better after having a snack. In grade 2, the \n     results were 60 percent and 70 percent. In grade 3, 84 \n     percent and 70 percent. In grade 4, 88 percent and 78 \n     percent. In grade 5, 84 percent and 86 percent. In grade 6, \n     86 percent and 91 percent.\n       For overall results from all eleven classrooms in all six \n     grades, the actual number of answers were used instead of \n     averaging percents, as not the same number of students \n     participated in each grade. Overall, 81 percent of the \n     students said that while they were having snacks they thought \n     they did better on their schoolwork and 82% said they felt \n     better after having a snack.\n       Following our research, we were involved in discussions \n     with the Indiana Parent Teacher Association, which passed a \n     resolution urging its members to support the concept of \n     healthy snacks in schools. That resolution will be considered \n     at the national PTA convention next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5389-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRYAN JOHNSTON\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, former Oregon Governor Tom McCall \nonce said, ``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. \nThey are individuals who say, `This is my community, and it is my \nresponsibility to make it better.'''\n  Today I pay tribute to Bryan Johnston, a true Oregon hero, who \ndevoted much of his life and career to making Oregon and our State \ncapital city of Salem a better place in which to live, work, and raise \na family.\n  Like countless others in Oregon, I was shocked and saddened to learn \nthat Bryan passed away last week at the far too early age of 59 years. \nBryan's passing deprives my State of one of her most respected, admired \nand effective public servants; it deprives St. Martin's University in \nLacey, WA, of a gifted leader, as Bryan was scheduled to begin his \nservice of president of that university on July 1; it deprives many in \nOregon, including myself, of a trusted friend and advisor; and it \ndeprives his wife Anne and their four children of a loving and \ndedicated husband and father.\n  During his years in Salem, Bryan served in a remarkable number of \nroles, including: lawyer; professional mediator; Law professor; \ndirector of the Center for Dispute Resolution at Willamette University \nCollege of Law; dean of the Willamette University Atkinson Graduate \nSchool of Management; interim president of Willamette University; \nOregon State Representative; and interim director of the Oregon \nDepartment of Human Services Children, Adults and Families Division. As \nthe Salem Statesman-Journal so aptly put it, ``Bryan Johnston was Mr. \nFix--it for colleges, for state government, and for the Salem-area \ncommunity.''\n  The tributes that have been pouring in since Bryan's passing speak \nvolumes of the impact this gentle and gifted visionary made in so many \nways.\n  Salem business and community leader Dick Withnell said: ``He was so \nwise. He could grasp a tough situation and see what should be done and \nthen be collaborative with people to accomplish it. That's a real \ngift.''\n  State Senate President Peter Courtney said: ``Bryan was a great \nmediator and facilitator. He was a very, very versatile individual in \nthe area of education and public service. Those are maybe two of the \nhighest callings you can aspire to, if you're chosen; and he was chosen \ntime and again.''\n  Department of Human Services Director Bruce Goldberg stated: ``Bryan \nwas a trusted advisor and friend, who brought wisdom, humor, and \nkindness into all of our lives.''\n  Perhaps the best tribute to Bryan was paid by my friend John Watt, \nwho served with Bryan in the Oregon State House of Representatives. \nSaid John: ``One of the things that has always stuck with me about \nBryan is that he truly was doing the work for Oregon. I mean, he wasn't \nsomebody who was after kudos for himself. He didn't necessarily walk \nlockstep with his caucus. He was always willing to talk and work with \npeople.''\n  Bryan Johnston talked and worked with people, and because of that, he \nleaves behind a remarkable legacy of accomplishment and service. \nIndeed, I am reminded of the words of Mother Teresa, who said: ``God \ndoes not call us to be successful. God calls us to be faithful.''\n  By any account, Bryan Johnston led a successful life. But I know that \nmore important to him was the fact that he led a faithful life. He was \na faithful educator, legislator and public official. He was a faithful \nhusband, and friend. He was a faithful servant of God. May God bless \nBryan Johnston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5389-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13405 OF JUNE 16, 2006, WITH \n  RESPECT TO BELARUS, AS RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON \n                          JUNE 6, 2008--PM 51\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to establish the Small Business Information Security \nTask Force, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator John Kerry, to \nintroduce the Small Business Information Security Act of 2008. Not only \nis this a bipartisan bill in the United States Senate, but it is also a \nbicameral bill. Congressmen Manzullo and Michaud are also introducing \ncompanion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill \nwould establish within the Small Business Administration, SBA, a Small \nBusiness Information Security Task Force to advise the SBA and help \nsmall businesses both understand the unique information security \nchallenges they face, and identify resources to help meet those \nchallenges.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, one of my goals is to ensure small businesses are \nprotected from the mounting information security threats they face \nevery day. This legislation will create a clearinghouse of information, \nresources, and tools--compiled by a task force consisting of public and \nprivate sector experts in the field--that will ease the complexity, \nconfusion, and cost often associated with enhancing information \nsecurity measures within a small business. The task force will \ncontinually update information and resources as new technologies and \nthreats arise.\n  Currently, small business owners turn to the SBA for resources \nregarding a number of aspects, but information security resources \nremain largely unavailable within the agency. This legislation will \npresent an opportunity for the SBA to develop and create a repository \nof data to help small business owners meet their information security \nneeds. This legislation will enable industry experts to come together \nand immediately provide meaningful strategies to enable small \nbusinesses to safeguard their customer's personal information.\n  Computer networks are increasingly susceptible to hackers, intruders, \nand other cyber criminals. In fact, in my home state of Maine, the \nretail supermarket chain, Hannaford Bros., was recently affected by an \nintrusion into their computer system which led to the exposure of 4.2 \nmillion credit and debit card numbers. What many people do not realize \nis that a breach like Hannaford's impacts not only the millions of \ncustomers whose personal data was compromised, but it also has serious \ndownstream impact on our Nation's small businesses. For example, \nthroughout Maine there are many small banks; these banks are \nresponsible for protecting and alerting their depositors upon \nfraudulent activity. Following the Hannaford breach, many small banks \nhad to replace their customers' credit and debit cards, clearly a \ncostly enterprise that diverts resources from more productive \nactivities, such as small business lending. The bill we are introducing \ntoday will help ameliorate this problem.\n  Unfortunately, these attacks are becoming more frequent and more \nsevere, and the perpetrators are becoming harder to identify and bring \nto justice. According to a survey by the Small Business Technology \nInstitute, more than half of all small businesses in the U.S. \nexperienced a security breach in the last year. Furthermore, the study \nconcludes that nearly one-fifth of small businesses do not use virus-\nscanning for e-mail, over 60 percent do not protect their wireless \nnetworks with encryption, and two-thirds of small businesses do not \nhave an information security plan.\n  As these statistics illustrate, small businesses are increasingly at \nrisk of data breaches and other forms of malicious attacks on their \ninformation technology infrastructure. Cyber attacks launched by a \nsmall group of people can devastate America financially, it is \nconceivable that a few individuals working together could disable \nmillions of computers at a cost of hundreds of millions to the U.S. \neconomy. Cyber-criminals can hold hostage not just a few individuals, \nbut millions of small businesses. This legislation provides best \npractices to help small business owners decrease the risk cyber attacks \npose to their customers.\n  The information security threat posed to our Nation's small \nbusinesses is serious, and our efforts to prevent and reduce this risk \ncarry a tremendous sense of urgency. We must continue to focus on ways \nwe can protect small businesses, and their customers, from the serious \nconsequences of cyber crimes. In order to take an important first step, \nI encourage all of my colleagues to support this critical legislation, \nand I hope we can see this commonsense legislation enacted into law as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Iran, North Korea, and Syria \nnonproliferation Act to allow certain extraordinary payments in \nconnection with the International Space Station; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Today Senator Lugar and I introduce, by request, the \nInternational Space Station Payments Act of 2008. This measure would \nenable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to continue \npayments to Russia related to the International Space Station after \n2011.\n  As with any legislation proposed by request, we introduce this bill \nfor the purpose of placing the Executive branch's proposals before \nCongress and the public without expressing our own views on the \nsubstance of the proposals. As chairman and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, we intend to give the administration's \nrequested legislation careful review and consideration.\n  The Administrator of NASA, Michael Griffin, has submitted this \nlegislation to the committee, along with a section-by-section analysis \nthat helps to explain why NASA wants this legislation and what they \nbelieve it will achieve. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\n\n                                         National Aeronautics and \n\n\n                                         Space Administration,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration (NASA) proposes the enclosed amendment to the \n     Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (50 USC \n     1701 note). The purpose of the amendment is to permit NASA to \n     continue to procure Russian support for the International \n     Space Station (ISS) until suitable U.S. capabilities are in \n     place. We urge enactment of this important amendment.\n       The amendment provides a balanced approach, maintaining \n     both U.S. nonproliferation principles and objectives as well \n     as a U.S. presence on ISS. The justification and purpose for \n     this proposed amendment are stated more fully in the enclosed \n     sectional analysis. As an overview, NASA has procured Soyuz \n     services through the fall of 2011, consistent with existing \n     authority under the Act. However, U.S. obligations to provide \n     crew transportation and emergency services to the ISS \n     continue beyond 2011, and Soyuz will be the only viable \n     option for the United States to meet these obligations until \n     the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle or U.S. commercial \n     providers can provide such transportation and rescue \n     services. Fabrication of Soyuz vehicles must begin \n     approximately 36 months prior to launch, according to the \n     responsible Russian entities. Thus, unless contractual \n     arrangements for the provision of crew rescue and rotation \n     services beyond 2011 are concluded in 2008, the production of \n     Soyuz vehicles for U.S. crew transportation requirements will \n     be at risk. This, in turn, means that prompt legislative \n     action is needed to provide further relief beyond 2011 and \n     allow for the negotiation of these arrangements.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this legislation from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael D. Griffin,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act\n\n\n                           Sectional Analysis\n\n       The Administration remains committed to the important \n     objective of persuading the Russian Government and Russian \n     entities to improve their nonproliferation efforts regarding \n     Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Accordingly, the proposed \n     amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria \n     Nonproliferation Act (the Act) would maintain key existing \n     U.S. nonproliferation tools while allowing payments to \n     Russian entities that support U.S. obligations to the \n     International Space Station (ISS) beyond December 31, 2011.\n       The provision would extend the Act's exception to the \n     prohibition on ``extraordinary payments'' to the Russian \n     government and Russian entities for goods or services \n     relating to the ISS from January 1, 2012 to the end of the \n     life of the ISS. It would exclude from the exception any \n     payments after December 31, 2011 for cargo services provided \n     by a Progress vehicle. The new provision would also exclude \n     from the exception payments for crew transportation or rescue \n     services provided by a Soyuz vehicle once (1) the U.S. Orion \n     Crew Exploration Vehicle reaches Full Operational Capability \n     or (2) a U.S. commercial provider of crew transportation and \n     rescue services demonstrates the capability to meet ISS \n     mission requirements.\n       An international partnership governed by an \n     Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) among the United States, \n     Canada, multiple European States, Japan and Russia \n     established the ISS. This partnership is a long-standing and \n     interdependent one, with roles and responsibilities outlined \n     in the IGA and subordinate agreements for design, development \n     and operations of the program. Pursuant to the IGA and \n     subordinate agreements, NASA has an obligation to its non-\n     Russian ISS Partners to provide crew rotation and rescue \n     services during the life of the ISS. Currently, the Russian \n     vehicle Soyuz is the sole provider of rescue services, with \n     the Space Shuttle providing crew transportation. After \n     Shuttle retirement, the partnership will be dependent on \n     Russia to provide both crew transportation and rescue \n     services with Soyuz until the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration \n     Vehicle (CEV) achieves Full Operational Capability (currently \n     projected for 2016) and can provide crew transportation and \n     rescue services, or a U.S. commercial provider can \n     demonstrate the capability to provide crew transportation and \n     rescue services to meet ISS mission needs.\n       NASA has procured Soyuz services through the fall of 2011, \n     consistent with existing authority under the Act. Fabrication \n     of Soyuz vehicles must begin approximately 36 months prior to \n     launch based upon information provided by the Russian \n     entities responsible for manufacturing these vehicles. Thus, \n     unless contractual arrangements for rescue and crew rotation \n     services after 2011 are concluded in 2008, the production of \n     Soyuz vehicles for U.S. crew transfer and rescue will be at \n     risk. This in turn means that prompt legislative action is \n     needed to provide further relief beyond 2011 and allow for \n     the negotiation of these arrangements.\n       Absent the proposed relief, the United States will be \n     unable to meet one of its most critical partner obligations: \n     providing crew transportation and rescue services to \n     European, Japanese and Canadian crews. The United States \n     would not have an American ``presence'' aboard the ISS, \n     either in terms of astronauts or access to research \n     facilities for the U.S. scientific community, if we could not \n     purchase crew transportation and rescue services from Russia, \n     as no non-Russian crew transfer vehicles will be available \n     until the CEV reaches full operational capability or a U.S. \n     commercial provider demonstrates the capability to meet ISS \n     crew transportation and rescue needs. Given NASA's \n     operational, engineering, safety and other responsibilities \n     for the ISS, NASA is concerned whether the ISS could remain \n     fully operational for any significant time period absent an \n     American presence.\n       Moreover, the authority under the present exception to the \n     Act has been used to obtain ancillary goods and services from \n     Russia in addition to crew transport and rescue. For example, \n     although purchased from Russia, the Zarya module is legally a \n     U.S. element under the Space Station agreements and NASA must \n     purchase unique tools and engineering support, such as \n     sustaining software, from Russia for the continued operation \n     of the module. NASA will have a continuing requirement to \n     procure certain goods and services where Russia offers unique \n     capabilities, such as those related to Russian space suits, \n     software and hardware engineering support, and Extravehicular \n     Activity tools and training, which are required for effective \n     operations onboard the ISS. This amendment will allow NASA to \n     continue to purchase such goods and services that are \n     necessary to meet U.S. responsibilities under the Space \n     Station Agreements.\n       In addition, this limited relief being requested (i.e., \n     through the life of the ISS) may be necessary even after a \n     U.S. commercial capability is available, because some \n     potential U.S. commercial providers of cargo services and of \n     crew transportation and rescue services have Russian \n     contractors or other relationships with Russian entities \n     that, without this amendment, could trigger the Act's \n     ``extraordinary payment'' prohibition.\n       With respect to furthering the United States' \n     nonproliferation objectives and tools, in addition to the \n     positive incentive provided by prudent, closely monitored \n     space cooperation in areas of great benefit to the United \n     States, the proposed amendment would not affect the current \n     nonproliferation framework. The first five sections of the \n     Act establish a requirement to report to Congress on every \n     foreign person that transfers controlled items to, or \n     acquires controlled items from, Iran, Syria or North Korea \n     and authorizes sanctions against such foreign persons. These \n     key reporting and sanctions provisions would not be affected \n     by the proposed amendment. In addition, the amendment leaves \n     in place the ban on any United States government agency \n     making extraordinary payments in connection with the ISS or \n     other human space flight to any persons (including entities) \n     subject to sanctions under the Act or the Proliferation of \n     Weapons of Mass Destruction Executive Order (E.O. 12938, as \n     amended by E.O. 13094) or if the U.S. government agency (in \n     consultation with other interested U.S. government agencies) \n     anticipates that such payments will be passed on to such \n     persons. Finally, specific proposals for cooperation with \n     Russia would continue to be subject to review under relevant \n     mechanisms such as the State Department's Circular 175 \n     process for interagency review of international agreements. \n     Likewise, export and import licensing regulations would \n     ensure that U.S. nonproliferation objectives are maintained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5393-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5393-S5394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 87--CONGRATULATING THE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA \n       ON THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 87\n\n       Whereas, on November 18, 1918, in the City of Riga, the \n     members of the People's Council proclaimed Latvia a free, \n     democratic, and sovereign nation;\n       Whereas, on July 24, 1922, the United States formally \n     recognized Latvia as an independent and sovereign nation;\n       Whereas Latvia existed for 21 years as an independent and \n     sovereign nation and a fully recognized member of the League \n     of Nations;\n       Whereas Latvia maintained friendly and stable relations \n     with its neighbors, including the Soviet Union, during its \n     independence, without any border disputes;\n       Whereas Latvia concluded several peace treaties and \n     protocols with the Soviet Union, including a peace treaty \n     signed on August 11, 1920, under which the Soviet Union \n     ``unreservedly recognize[d] the independence and sovereignty \n     of the Latvian State and forever renounce[d] all sovereign \n     rights . . . over the Latvian people and territory'';\n       Whereas, despite friendly and mutually productive relations \n     between Latvia and the Soviet Union, on August 23, 1939, Nazi \n     Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop \n     Pact, which contained a secret protocol assigning Latvia, \n     Estonia, and Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence;\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\n       Whereas, under the cover of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, on \n     June 17, 1940, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were forcibly \n     incorporated into the Soviet Union in violation of pre-\n     existing peace treaties;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union imposed upon the people of \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania a communist political system \n     that stifled civil dissent, free political expression, and \n     basic human rights;\n       Whereas the United States never recognized this illegal and \n     forcible occupation, and successive United States presidents \n     maintained continuous diplomatic relations with these \n     countries throughout the Soviet occupation, never accepting \n     them to be ``Soviet Republics'';\n       Whereas, during the 50 years of Soviet occupation of the \n     Baltic states, Congress strongly, consistently, and on a \n     bipartisan basis supported a United States policy of legal \n     non-recognition;\n       Whereas, in 1953, the congressionally-established Kersten \n     Commission investigated the incorporation of Latvia, Estonia, \n     and Lithuania into the Soviet Union and determined that the \n     Soviet Union had illegally and forcibly occupied and annexed \n     the Baltic countries;\n       Whereas, in 1982, and for the next nine years until the \n     Baltic countries regained their independence, Congress \n     annually adopted a Baltic Freedom Day resolution denouncing \n     the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and appealing for the freedom of \n     the Baltic countries;\n       Whereas, in 1991, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania regained \n     their de facto independence and were quickly recognized by \n     the United States and by almost every other country in the \n     world, including the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1998, the United States and the three Baltic \n     nations signed the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership, an \n     expression of the importance of the Baltic Sea region to \n     United States interests;\n       Whereas the 109th Congress resolved (S. Con.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, \ncommemorating the 90th anniversary of Latvia's independence.\n  This past century saw more than its share of tragedy, as the twin \nevils of fascism and communism seeded mankind with misery unknown to \nearlier generations. Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism did their best to \nstamp out the individualistic spirit among their adherents, and forge \nthem instead into a single mailed fist suited only for war, plunder, \nand oppression. Though the struggle against both was long and often \ndark, rays of light continually pierced the clouds. One such ray was \nthe establishment of Israel, whose 60th anniversary we are \ncommemorating this year. Another was the independence, sporadic though \nit began, of independent Baltic republics like Latvia. The modern state \nof Latvia was born in days of hope after the calamity of the Great War, \ndays when so many of the subjugated peoples of Europe achieved \nindependence. On November 18, 1918, Latvia became free. The U.S. \nrecognized Latvia less than 4 years later.\n  It is both Latvia's blessing and its curse to sit on a historical \ncrossroads. The Baltic region has been an important trading hub for \nhundreds of years, stretching back to the days of Vikings and \nByzantium. Latvians, surrounded by powerful neighbors and wealthy \ntrading states, have thus led a perilous existence. Tragically, but not \nfatally, Latvia's post-1918 existence was to be similarly perilous. \nThrough a secret protocol with the Nazis, the U.S.S.R. occupied Latvia \nin the beginning of World War II, and retained control until the final \ncollapse of the Soviet state in 1991. At that moment, ravished by \ncommunism and beset by historical injustice, Latvians made a bold \nchoice to build a free, democratic, and prosperous Western-oriented \nsociety. They have since succeeded brilliantly, achieving high levels \nof economic and political freedom, and enjoying one of the highest \nliving standards among ex-communist countries. Latvia today stands as a \nmodel of Western, free-market democracy, and America stands with it.\n  I am very proud that Latvia is no longer in peril.

Mr. President, last Friday a cloture motion was filed on \nH.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy Job Creation Act of 2008. This bill \ncontains a robust energy package, with about $17 billion in incentives \nfor alternative energy, for efficiency, and for clean coal. This \npackage is important for our environment, for energy security, and to \nfacilitate the transition to a carbon-controlled economy.\n  It extends expiring individual provisions. These include the teacher \nexpense deduction and the qualified tuition deduction. The bill also \nextends expiring business provisions. These include the research and \ndevelopment tax credit and the active finance expensing provision. \nThese business provisions help keep America competitive in the global \neconomy. These business provisions help maintain and create jobs. If \nthese individual and business provisions are not extended, millions of \nfamilies and businesses would have a huge tax increase. This is all \npaid for with two revenue raisers that no one has a problem with, \nrevenue raisers that are sound tax policy.\n  Some might argue we should not increase taxes to pay for tax cuts, \nbut these revenue raisers are not tax increases. The first provision is \nan extension of the effective date of the worldwide allocation of \ninterest, delaying application of that provision. This section of the \ncode is scheduled to take effect for tax years beginning after December \n31, 2008. Many of the companies that will benefit from this provision \nhave told me they would rather have business extenders, including R, \nactive financing, and CFC look through, in exchange for a delayed \napplication of the worldwide allocation of interest. These companies \nrealize that in order to get extenders done now, they, along with the \nCongress, must pay for these provisions. These companies have made a \nchoice. I believe it is a sound choice.\n  The second provision is offshore deferred compensation. This \nprovision prevents hedge fund managers from deferring income. This is \nnot an increase in tax on hedge fund managers; rather, it is a change \nin the timing of when income tax will be applied. This is a timing \nissue, not a tax increase, and the proposal is sound tax policy. Some \nargue we should not pay to extend current tax benefits. This is a new \none. When the other side was in the majority, several bills passed \nextending provisions, and they were paid for.\n  So this week the Senate is faced with a choice, a choice that, in my \nopinion, is relatively easy. We need to decide whether we will develop \nnew jobs and new medications or we can continue to allow hedge fund \nmanagers to defer without limitation their compensation for investing \nother people's money. I believe the choice is easy. We must pass this \npackage of expiring provisions.\n  I also believe the substitute I will offer will include fixing the \nAMT, taxes American taxpayers would otherwise have to pay--a so-called \nAMT patch. That prevents Americans from having to increase their tax \nliability in a way which I think would not be fair. As I said earlier, \nthe extenders package will be paid for. The AMT patch will not be paid \nfor. Why, some might ask. That is basically because I think it is \nimportant to recognize the reality that at the end of day, it will not \nbe paid for, so I, therefore, believe it is important to include the \nAMT patch in something that is going to be fixed. It is not going to be \npaid for at the end; whereas, other provisions will be. That is the \nreason for including both in this bill. The extenders paid for, the AMT \npatch not paid for.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/09/senate-section/article/S5395-5", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
