The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                               Oversight\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am here today to discuss a very serious matter that \ngoes right to the heart of one of Congress's most important \nresponsibilities, the responsibility of constitutional oversight to see \nthat the laws are faithfully executed by the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n  American taxpayers expect Congress to exercise oversight in order to \nensure that their hard-earned dollars are not wasted. To conduct more \neffective oversight, Congress adopted the Inspector General Act in \n1978, creating a system of inspectors general. I will probably refer to \nthem as everyone else does, as IGs.\n  We did this throughout many departments of Government. The IGs are \nsupposed to be watchdogs or, as I like to say, a junkyard dog. They are \nour first line of defense against fraud, waste, and abuse. When it \nhappens, the IGs are supposed to report it to the agency head and to \nCongress and to recommend appropriate corrective action.\n  IGs are the top cops inside of each agency in the executive branch of \nGovernment. They police the Federal workforce. If rules are broken, \nthen they have to investigate allegations of misconduct and refer their \nfindings to proper authorities.\n  To be credible, IGs must be beyond reproach. Above all, they must \nlive by the rules they themselves enforce. They must set an example of \nexcellence in their personal conduct and they must always do so; \notherwise, they lack credibility. So I tend to, as a Member of the \nSenate, watch the watchdogs. Over the years in doing oversight work, I \nhave found inspectors general who do not seem to meet these standards. \nI am disappointed to have to report to the Senate today about a new IG \ntrouble spot.\n  There are allegations of misconduct in the upper echelons of the \nTreasury's IG office. A tip from a whistleblower earlier this year \nfirst alerted me to this problem. On February 12, 2008, I wrote a \nletter to Acting Treasury IG Schindel asking for a copy of the \ninvestigative report and all pertinent material bearing on the matter \nthat was reported to me.\n  I also asked Mr. Schindel to tell me how and when he intended to \naddress and resolve the issues raised in that report. Mr. Schindel \nresponded promptly, providing a redacted copy of the report on February \n15. On February 29, he assured me that senior level officials involved \nhad been placed on paid administrative leave. They would remain on that \nstatus, he told me, ``until all investigative matters have been \nadjudicated,'' and ``one of them'' was reassigned to what appeared to \nbe a questionable post.\n  The report of investigation on this matter was prepared by the \nDepartment of Labor IG. It is dated January 14, 2008. Since the \nTreasury IG lacks an internal affairs unit, IG Schindel referred the \ncase to the Department of Labor IG for investigation. This was to \nensure maximum independence.\n  Acting IG Schindel made the referral on June 18, 2007. He was briefed \non the findings in the final report on September 26 of last year. The \nDepartment of Labor report of investigations substantiated wrongdoing \non the part of senior Treasury IG officials. The allegations are very \nserious. My staff has carefully reviewed all of the materials provided \nby IG Schindel and interviewed a number of witnesses with knowledge on \nthe issue.\n  Based on the oversight investigation conducted by my staff, I wrote \nto Treasury Secretary Paulson on February 28 this year. In that letter, \nI expressed grave concern to Secretary Paulson about the way the Acting \nIG Schindel appeared to be responding to the allegations that were \nsubstantiated by the more independent review by the Labor Department \nIG, as was reported in his writings.\n  This is what I said to my friend, Secretary Paulson:\n  Mr. Schindel stated that the report showed no corruption, criminal \nactivity, or serious wrongdoing on the part of the senior officials. I \nam stunned that anyone with management responsibilities could make this \nstatement after reading the Labor IG report.\n  The Labor IG presented a compelling case of high-level IG misconduct \nbacked up with rock solid evidence. Mr. Schindel seemed unable to see \nwhat the Labor inspector general sees. Is he turning a blind eye to an \nobvious problem?\n  Secretary Paulson responded to my letter on March 10. He informed me \nthat he has been briefed on the Labor IG's report and ``communicated to \nActing IG Schindel'' his ``views'' on the matter.\n  The Labor IG report seems to leave little or no wiggle room. Based on \na continuous stream of information being provided to my staff, there is \ngrowing concern about Acting IG Schindel's commitment to solving these \nproblems. I think of these as obvious problems.\n  Acting IG Schindel has known about the findings in this report for 9 \nmonths until now. To bring the issue into sharper focus, take a moment \nto review the Labor IG's findings. This is what the Labor IG report \nfound:\n\n       Our investigation corroborated the allegation that senior \n     IG officials violated the Public Transit Subsidy program.\n\n  This program provides money in the form of fare cards to Government \nemployees to help cover the high cost of using public transportation to \nget to work.\n  There is an added benefit to the public transit subsidy program. The \nvalue of fare cards received in this program is not taxable. Subjects \nof the Labor IG investigation signed applications to participate in the \npublic transit subsidy. In signing that document, they certified that \nthey would abide by the terms of the program. The public transit \nsubsidy program application forms, which these individuals sign, state:\n\n       Making a false, fictitious or fraudulent certification may \n     render the maker subject to criminal investigation under \n     title 18, United States Code, section 1001.\n\n  They allegedly took transit subsidies while accepting free rides to \nwork from fellow agents, sometimes in Government vehicles.\n  The findings of the Labor IG's report are of particular concern to me \nfor another reason, and this seems to be the most troubling part for \nme. The senior Treasury IG officials involved in fare card abuse were \nresponsible for investigating and referring for criminal prosecution a \nnumber of other Treasury Department employees who had allegedly \nviolated this same program called the Transit Subsidy Program.\n  As I said up front, the IGs must live by the rules they are sworn to \nenforce. When they do not, then inspectors general lose credibility. \nThe Labor report also finds that the officials involved \n``inappropriately intervened in closing [another] investigation'' of \nalleged PTSP abuse. This one concerned an employee at another agency \nwho also allegedly violated the transit subsidy program. According to \nthe Labor IG's report, the senior Treasury IG officials ``escorted'' \nthe agent in charge of this investigation to their office ``where they \ndiscussed closing the case.'' They apparently ``instructed him to \ncancel'' a key interview and ``told him the case would be closed.''\n  Since the investigation was essentially complete and there was \ncredible evidence to support the allegations, this meeting gave the \nappearance of impropriety. The Labor IG's investigators interviewed the \nTreasury IG officials about this meeting. The Treasury IG officials \nreportedly cited high agent caseloads as an excuse for their attempt to \nclose it down. They also claimed the police at that agency ``were \ncapable of working the investigation'' and that ``there was no fraud or \nloss.''\n  The Labor investigators make one point crystal clear: The claims put \nforward by Treasury IG officials did not stand up to scrutiny. The \nLabor IG's investigators determined that the Treasury IG's office had \nworked similar cases involving this agency's employees in the past. \nThey found that special agents in the Treasury IG's office had a \ntypical caseload of 15 to 16 cases and not the usual 30 caseload \nclaimed by one of the subjects of this investigation.\n  I understand the employee involved in these allegations of public \ntransit subsidy program violations was given a\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nproposed notice of removal on June 18, 2008. This agency is trying hard \nto crack down on such violations. This should be a wake-up call for Mr. \nSchindel. The abuse of the public transit subsidy program alleged in \nthe Labor IG's report constitutes, at best, misuse or abuse of public \nmoneys and, at worst, outright theft.\n  There is one more very disturbing finding in the Labor IG's report I \nshould highlight. The Labor report ``questions the judgment'' of the \nsenior Treasury IG officials for their alleged involvement in the \nreinvestigation of another employee misconduct case. This particular \ninvestigation was originally conducted by the Treasury IG for Tax \nAdministration or TIGTA. Once again, this investigation was referred to \nan outside agency to ensure greater independence.\n  According to the Labor report, the TIGTA investigation determined \nthat the Treasury IG agent ``misused his position, his issued vehicle, \nand made false and misleading statements'' during the course of the \ninvestigation. For a Federal law enforcement officer, making false \nstatements during an investigation, as alleged, could be a career-\nending mistake. As chronicled in the Labor IG's report, the senior \nTreasury IG didn't like the TIGTA's findings and wanted them changed. \nThe Labor IG's report is very clear in stating that the only reason for \nthe reinvestigation was to change the findings of the original Treasury \nIG for Tax Administration investigation. The Labor IG report concluded:\n\n       The appearance is that the sole purpose of intervening in \n     the aftermath of [the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration's] investigation was to mitigate [the] \n     findings, particularly by undermining [the inspector \n     general's] apparently well supported finding that . . . [the \n     agent involved] . . . had made false statements.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       The evidence suggests that TIGTA's findings were correct. \n     It is clear that the only purpose of the reinvestigation . . \n     . was to change the findings of the investigation so [the \n     agent involved] would not have a Giglio issue.\n\n  The person involved in this case was suspended for 10 days 2 years \nago. The Labor IG also questioned the leniency of the agent's \npunishment, noting that misuse of a Government vehicle alone normally \ncarries a 30-day suspension. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration also alleges that the legal counsel to the Treasury IG \nmay have been involved in an attempt to quash or alter TIGTA's final \nreport of investigation. TIGTA provided a document which indicates that \nthe Treasury IG's legal counsel ``disagreed with the results of the \ninvestigation.'' He ``expected a draft ROI'' and ``asked if the Final \nReport of Investigation could be changed.''\n  Fiddling with these kinds of reports ought to raise a lot of \nquestions among people in authority about whether things are being done \nright.\n  He was informed by the agent in charge that TIGTA ``did not submit \ndraft ROIs and would not make any changes to the final ROI.'' The legal \ncounsel denies these allegations.\n  The Labor IG also found the legal counsel's ``advice to the DOT-OIG \nquestionable regarding the investigation.'' The Labor IG reached this \nconclusion because the legal counsel had listened to the tape-recorded \ninterview, during which the subject allegedly ``made a false statement \nunder oath to the TIGTA agent.''\n  The three substantiated allegations I have laid out, which are \npresented clearly in the Labor IG's report, are each disturbing in \ntheir own right. But if you take them all together, they paint a truly \nawful picture of what is going on in that office. This report is the \nresult of an independent investigation conducted by professional law \nenforcement officers. The results of this investigation demand serious, \nthorough, fair, and prompt action. I met with Acting Treasury IG \nSchindel on March 13 to review this matter. He assured me he would take \ndecisive action to clean up this mess. More recently, I was told the \nActing Treasury IG is wrestling with new allegations. Addressing the \nDepartment of Labor IG report must be a first priority to show us in \nCongress that he is carrying out his responsibilities. He needs to sink \nhis teeth into that material and close it out once and for all. In a \nletter on May 30, I asked the acting inspector general again to proceed \nwith his review of this matter ``as quickly as possible.'' I also \ninsisted it be done by the book, ``consistent with all applicable rules \nand regulations.''\n  I call on Acting Treasury Inspector General Schindel to keep his \nword. That is all I ask, just keep his word, do what he told me he was \ngoing to do. I want him to stick to his repeated assurances--in his \nletters of February 15 and February 29, at our March 13 meeting, and \nagain in a letter of June 2. I expect no more and no less.\n  Indecision is costing the taxpayers money. To date, these officials \nhave collected 3 months' worth of paid administrative leave. They are \nsenior executives earning top dollar. Their administrative leave has \nalready cost the taxpayers about $90,000, and the number is climbing. \nContinuing mismanagement and indecision in the Treasury IG's office is \nwasting precious taxpayer dollars. Acting IG Schindel has a \nresponsibility to show he runs a first-class inspector general's \noffice, one that is beyond reproach. He cannot operate effectively as \nan IG until he gets his own house in order. His job is to deter, to \ndetect, and report waste but not to do it himself.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Supply and Demand\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have received 600 e-mails and letters \nfrom Tennesseans in response to a request I put out asking them to \nshare their personal stories about high gas prices. It has been my \npractice each week to put a few of those into the Congressional Record \nto remind my colleagues and to remind our country that we understand \nthat people are hurting. Tennesseans are hurting in their jobs, in \ntheir families, and in their homes. Mr. President, $4-plus gasoline is \na big problem for Tennesseans.\n  Today, I wish to submit for the Congressional Record five more \nletters from among the nearly 600 that I have received, and I ask \nunanimous consent that following my remarks these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The first comes from Christy Long in Maynardville, TN. \nShe works at the East Tennessee Children's Hospital in Knoxville, but \nshe is worried about the cost of her commute. She is a diabetic. She is \nhaving trouble paying for her insulin shots due to the rising gas \nprices. She says:\n\n       Gas for work or insulin to live. That is the decision I \n     have had to make several times daily.\n\n  James Edwards from Charlotte, TN: James drives a rural route for the \nPostal Service, and he uses his own car, but the $26-a-day allowance \ndoesn't cover the gas he uses anymore. He says that since the 10-\npercent ethanol mandate, he gets less mileage and has to use more gas. \nHis wife's 40-mile commute to and from work every day is also cutting \ninto their budget.\n  Kaye Nolen in Dyer, TN: Kay used to drive across the country once a \nyear to see her family in Illinois, Utah, and New Mexico, but can't \nafford to do that this year. She says she is afraid that she will not \nbe able to spend Thanksgiving with her family this year and that she \nwill not be able to afford gas to make it to work if the prices keep \ngoing up.\n  Ruthann Booher of Crossville, TN: Ruthann and her husband have had to \nmake significant cuts in their driving and grocery buying because of \nescalating costs. Her husband, who is 62, is now considering quitting \nhis job at Wal-Mart and drawing Social Security since driving to work \nis so expensive. They can't afford the payment on a new car with better \nmileage.\n  Brenda Northern in Walland, TN, which is in the same county in which \nI live: Brenda is 60. She can barely afford to drive to visit her \nmother, who is 79 now, and it is getting harder and harder to make all \nof her payments. Her\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\nhusband has to use diesel for his truck because he moves mobile homes \nfor a living and diesel prices keep going up too.\n  She says: I just do not know how we are going to make it.\n  I want Christy and James and Kaye and Ruthann and Brenda to know that \nI believe Senators on both sides of the aisle care about this matter, \nunderstand what is happening, and are ready to deal with it. I know on \nthe Republican side, here is what we believe: We believe the answer to \n$4 gas prices is to find more and use less; that is, find more oil and \nuse less oil.\n  Economics 101 taught us the law of supply and demand. The problem \ntoday fundamentally--and most Americans understand this; Americans know \nthis--our problem is our supplies worldwide are not growing as fast as \nour demand worldwide for oil, and so the price of gasoline is going up. \nSo if we had more supplies, and if we used less oil, the price of \ngasoline would go down. So we say on the Republican side: Find more, \nuse less.\n  There seems to be a lot of agreement on both sides of the aisle about \nthe using less part. For example, last year, the Senate did the most \nimportant thing it could do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by \npassing higher fuel efficiency standards that said that cars and trucks \nhad to be up to 35 miles a gallon by 2020. We did that together, \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  We on the Republican side are ready to try to make plug-in electric \ncars commonplace. I had a TVA Congressional Caucus hearing on that the \nother day in Nashville. Major car companies such as General Motors, \nToyota, Nissan, and Ford are making plug-ins that are going to be \navailable next year. TVA and other utilities have plenty of extra \nelectricity at night to plug in, so literally you can plug your car in \nat night for 60 cents and fill it up with fuel instead of $70 worth of \ngasoline. I believe tens of thousands of Tennesseans and millions of \nAmericans are going to be doing that.\n  If we set as our goal and take all the steps we need to take in the \nSenate to make plug-in electric cars and trucks commonplace, we could \nuse less. Many estimates from General Motors and others is that just \nthe plug-in electric vehicles would cut our imported oil by one-third, \nwhich is now about 12 million barrels a day. That is a significant \nreduction.\n  We can use less oil if we have a crash program in advanced biofuels. \nThere is a lot of concern about ethanol and its effect on food prices. \nWell, we can grow a lot of crops that we don't eat such as switchgrass, \nfor example, and with more research on cellulosic ethanol we can use \nless oil.\n  The other half our strategy to lower gas prices is finding more. That \nis where we have a difference of opinion. It seems that the other side \nof the aisle wants to repeal half the law of supply and demand. It is a \nnew form of economics. Maybe we could call it ``Obama-nomics'' or some \nother name. But we say: All right, we agree on using less; now let's \ntalk about finding more. What about, for example, allowing other \nStates, such as Virginia, whose legislature says it wants to, to do \nwhat Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama do, which is to explore \nfor oil offshore. We have a lot of it. We permitted an enlargement of \nthat in the Gulf of Mexico a couple of years ago. Already the money is \nbeginning to come in from the bids, and 37\\1/2\\ percent of the money \ngoes to the States for their use for education or to nourish their \nbeaches or whatever, and one-eighth goes to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both were Governors of our States. \nNeither one of us was fortunate enough to have an ocean on our State, \nso we don't have any potential for offshore drilling. I can't speak for \nthe former Governor of Nebraska, but I can for Tennessee. If we had the \nopportunity in Tennessee to put oil and gas rigs 50 miles offshore \nwhere we couldn't see them and explore for oil and gas, and keep 37\\1/\n2\\ percent of the revenue and put it in a fund for our universities to \nmake them among the best in the world, and to keep taxes low, and to \nuse the money for greenways or to nourish the beaches or for other \npurposes, we would do it in a minute. I would think sooner or later \nVirginia will say they would like to do that. Maybe North Carolina \nwill. Maybe Florida will.\n  Our proposal is simply, if the State wants to do it, the State can do \nit. No one is saying Virginia must do it or North Carolina must do it. \nIt simply gives them the option, and it gives us more American oil and \nmore supply to help stabilize and bring down the price of $4 gasoline.\n  But Senator Obama and most of the Democrats on the other side of the \naisle say: No, we can't. No, we can't to offshore drilling. No, we \ncan't to oil shale, which is in four Western States. There is, \nconservatively speaking, according to the Department of the Interior, 1 \nmillion barrels a day that we could get from offshore exploration and 2 \nmillion barrels a day that we could get from oil shale. If we added 3 \nmillion barrels a day to our production in the United States, we would \nincrease by one-third the production that we have in the United States. \nWe would be making more of our contribution to the world supply of oil.\n  We are the third largest producer of oil in the world. Why should we \ngo begging the Saudis to drill more when we can produce more ourselves. \nThat is part of it: Find more, use less.\n  So we need to come to some conclusion. We want a bipartisan result. \nWe know in the Senate we have to get 60 votes to make anything happen. \nBut I would be hopeful that the Democratic leadership, which is in \ncharge of the agenda, would allow us in July to bring up these matters \nand act like a Senate. Let's vote. Let's debate. Let's talk about ways \nto use less. We could find substantial agreement, whether it is on \nplug-in vehicles, research for advanced biofuels, or conservation.\n  Senator Warner has suggested that the Federal Government ought to use \nless as a good example for the rest of the country. That is a good \nidea. Senator McCain and others have lots of good ideas as well.\n  Let's talk about finding more, too, for gasoline in terms of offshore \ndrilling or in terms of oil shale. We can leave drilling in Alaska out \nof the discussion if that keeps us from having a bipartisan agreement, \nalthough it is the fastest way to get 1 million new barrels of oil a \nday. Let's put it aside for just a moment and say we want to work \nacross the aisle to get a bipartisan agreement. We know we can't reach \nthat agreement with ANWR included, so we will put that aside for the \nmoment. But can we not as a Senate, in a bipartisan way, agree that we \nshould be finding more and using less and not be saying when it comes \nto offshore exploration, no, we can't, and not be saying when it comes \nto oil shale: No, we can't. When Senator McCain says we need to double \nour number of nuclear plants, we can't say that we have enough clean, \ncarbon-free electricity to deal with clean air, global warming, and \nplug-in cars, but from the other side comes: No, we can't. We cannot \nsay ``no, we can't'' to finding more if we want to bring down $4 \ngasoline prices.\n\n  So I say to Christy, James, Kaye, Ruthann, Brenda, and the 600 \nTennesseans who have written me about $4 gasoline, over this Fourth of \nJuly recess, a good thing to say to your Members of the Senate and \nMembers of Congress is: Find more and use less. Yes, we can find more. \nYes, we can use less. Yes, we can bring down the $4 price of gasoline.\n  Some have said it will take 10 years. Well, President Kennedy didn't \nshy away from asking us to take 10 years to go to the Moon. President \nRoosevelt didn't shy away from putting in the Manhattan Project to \nsplit the atom and build a bomb to win the war even though he knew it \nwould take several years. What is wrong with it taking several years? \nAre we supposed to sit here and let our 2-year-old grandchildren have \nthe same energy crisis to deal with 10 years from now that we have \ntoday? Leadership is about looking ahead. It might take 1, 2, 5, or 10 \nyears, but the time to start is today. The way to do it is working \nacross the aisle. The formula for it is economics 101: More supply, \nless demand, find more, use less. Today, the Republicans are ready to \ndo that. We are ready to do both, find more and use less. But the \nDemocrats are not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       1. Christy Long, Maynardville, TN--Christy works at the \n     East TN Children's Hospital in Knoxville but is worried about \n     the\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\n     cost of the commute. She is a diabetic and is having trouble \n     paying for her insulin shots due to the rising gas prices: \n     ``Gas for work or insulin to live . . . that is the decision \n     that I have had to make several times daily.''\n       2. James Edwards, Charlotte, TN--James drives a rural route \n     for the Postal Service and uses his own car, but the $26-a-\n     day allowance doesn't cover the gas he uses anymore. He says \n     that since the 10% ethanol mandate, he gets less mileage and \n     has to use more gas. His wife's 40-mile commute to and from \n     work everyday is also cutting into their budget.\n       3. Kaye Nolen, Dyer, TN--Kaye used to drive across country \n     once a year to see her family in Illinois, Utah and New \n     Mexico, but can't afford to do that this year. She says she \n     is afraid that she won't get to spend Thanksgiving with her \n     family this year and that she won't be able to afford gas to \n     make it to work if prices keep going up.\n       4. Ruthann Booher, Crossville, TN--Ruthann and her husband \n     have had to make significant cuts in their driving and \n     grocery buying because of escalating costs. Her husband, who \n     is 62, is now considering quitting his job at Wal-Mart and \n     drawing Social Security since driving to work is so \n     expensive. They can't afford the payment on a new car with \n     better mileage.\n       5. Brenda Northern, Walland, TN--Brenda is 60 and can \n     barely afford to drive to visit her mother (who is 79) \n     anymore, and its getting harder and harder to make all her \n     payments. Her husband has to use diesel for his truck because \n     he moves mobile homes for a living and diesel prices keep \n     going up too. She says, ``I just do not know how we are going \n     to make it!''\n                                  ____\n\n       Hi my name is Christy Long, the gas prices are very hard to \n     deal with. I work 40 hrs a week at East TN Childrens Hospital \n     in Knoxville TN and make decent money. However, between my \n     health insurance, daycare, school fees, groceries, my \n     medicine because I am a diabetic on insulin, plus my house \n     payment, electric, water etc . . . Then buy gas for me to get \n     back in forth to work on . . . Humm lets just say that I \n     wished I could have government benefits for the other stuff \n     so that I could afford my gas. My husband and I whom he works \n     60 hrs a week at his job have considered me quitting work and \n     staying home due to the fact that we can not afford the gas \n     for me to get back and forth to work, plus eat, my medicine, \n     his medicine and just to live. It is really sad when you have \n     to pick do I want to buy my insulin prescription for $60 this \n     month or do I want to buy $60 worth of gas so that I can get \n     back and forth to work for a week. That has happened a couple \n     of times in the last 6 months to my family. Luckily I have \n     had a good doctor that has given me samples several times to \n     get me thru. Because as anybody would know without my insulin \n     I can not live.\n       You see my story is not my family can not go on vacation \n     this year or anything, my story is that I do not make enough \n     money to live and work. It is one or the other. . . Gas for \n     work or insulin to live . . . That is the decision that I \n     have had to make several times lately.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Christy Long,\n     Maynardville, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n       The high gas price is having a great impact on me and my \n     family. I work for the U.S. Postal Service. I have a rural \n     route, which means I use my own vehicle.\n       I am responsible for the maintenance, insurance and fuel \n     for my vehicle. Even though I receive a vehicle allowance to \n     operate my vehicle for the U. S. Postal Service, it is not \n     adequate.\n       My allowance is $26.60 per day. Since I am continuously \n     running, starting, stopping my vehicle, I go through about 5-\n     6 gallons of gas a day. At $3.87 a gallon (this what I paid \n     yesterday) and having to fill up my vehicle every other day, \n     it is costing me about $25.00 per day (that's $125.00 per \n     week or $500.00 per month.\n       That is only for the fuel. I also have to replace brakes, \n     tires and other items for frequently because of the nature of \n     the job I perform.\n       My wife works at Fort Campbell, Ky and we live about 40 \n     miles from her work. The cost for gas for her runs about \n     $120.00 per week.\n       Since it was mandated to add 10% ethanol to gasoline, we \n     get less miles per gallon so this means we use more gas.\n       Since there is a greater price we pay for gas, everyday \n     life (food, utilities, etc.) is more expensive. I served over \n     21 years in the military and I am proud of this service. \n     America is noted for its compassion for helping other \n     nations, however, we are doing our own country a disservice \n     by not taking care of our own.\n       This my story and I hope with enough stories like this we \n     can convince the powers that be we need to take care of \n     business soon. By this, I mean do more drilling and build \n     more refineries in America and stop depending on other \n     countries for our own survival.\n       Thanks for your concern and taking your time to address \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            James R. Edwards, Sr.,\n     Charlotte, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Sir, You asked how the high gasoline prices are \n     hurting me?\n       I can't afford to drive to Moline, Illinois to see my three \n     daughters nor to see two granddaughters graduate from high \n     school. I can't drive to Utah to see my Dad and sister. I \n     can't drive to New Mexico to see my mother. I can't even make \n     the trip to Branson, MO to help my elderly Aunt and Uncle \n     every other month. I used to make the round trip drive from \n     TN to MO to NM to UT to MO to TN once a year. Not now! Can't \n     afford the gasoline!! I used to go to IL to spend \n     Thanksgiving with my daughters. I don't think I can afford \n     that trip this year.\n       I am barely affording the gasoline to go to work four days \n     a week, shopping once a week and to Church on Sunday. That \n     all costs me around $48 a week. Soon I will have to quit my \n     job because I can't afford the gasoline to drive the 28 miles \n     a day. If I quit my job, what do I have left?\n       Goodness sakes! When will this all end? I can't afford to \n     go to work and eat one meal a day!! I am willing to work, if \n     I have a way to get there!\n       Thanks for asking my opinion on this horrible state of \n     affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kaye Nolen,\n     Dyer, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Alexander: My husband and I have lived in \n     Crossville, TN for 19 years. Never before have we had the \n     problems making ends meet as we are having now. My husband \n     works full time at WalMart. He doesn't make a whole lot of \n     money, but we were getting by. With the gas prices \n     skyrocketing day by day and the trickle down effect on \n     everything else, we have had to really tighten our belts. I \n     used to be able to go to the store a few times a week for \n     groceries that we would run out of. Now I only go once a \n     week. If I have forgotten something, or we run out, we have \n     to do without until I can go the next week. The price of \n     groceries is another factor and I realize it is mostly \n     because of the cost of transporting the goods to the stores. \n     It is also the cost of harvesting the crops due to the \n     gasoline used for farm equipment. It's hurting all of us.\n       My husband is 62 and is now seriously considering drawing \n     his Social Security and working 3 days a week. We would have \n     more money, but he would have to take a reduced amount \n     instead of waiting until he's 66 and being able to draw the \n     full amount. We have also considered getting a more fuel \n     efficient vehicle, but can't afford to make the payments. \n     We're actually caught between a rock and a hard place. And \n     there will be no vacation for us this year, or any year the \n     fuel prices are this ridiculous. We will just have to stay \n     home.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to vent my frustration. I \n     think you are doing a great job for the people of Tennessee \n     and I think you would make a great president.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ruthann Booher,\n     Crossville, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Northern, Brenda\n     Sent: Mon 6/16/2008 12:54 PM\n     To: Alexander, Senator (Alexander)\n     Subject: My family's Crisis!\n       Sen. Alexander, I appreciate the opportunity to address the \n     issue of increasing Gas & Diesel prices on my family in \n     particular, even though everyone is experiencing the same \n     problem.\n       I fill my car up each week and the price just keeps going \n     up, 2 weeks ago it was $53.00, the next week $61.00, and this \n     week $64.00 and my tank was not all the way empty either \n     time.\n       I drive to work the supermarket and stop by to check on my \n     Mother who is 79 now, and go to Church. I am 60 years old and \n     would love to have the opportunity to spend more time with my \n     Mother, my Husband, Children & Grandchildren, but Gasoline \n     keeps rising, which makes everything else more expensive, so \n     we have trouble meeting our payments, and no recreation at \n     all.\n       My Husband uses Diesel in his vehicle and also his Work \n     Trucks, and now that cuts down on his profit! He is just a \n     small business man who moves mobile homes, this is what he \n     has done for 44+ years, and makes less and less.\n       We are just simple Christian people with families trying to \n     make a living on two paychecks, we're a prime example of \n     those who are rapidly approaching retirement age and yet will \n     not be able to retire and have a few enjoyable years together \n     here on earth. I just do not know how we are going to make \n     it! I would love to spend time with my family, enjoy the few \n     years I figure I have left without having to struggle just to \n     buy gasoline to be able to get to work to get a payday that \n     buys less and less of the necessities of life.\n       One thing that would help save on gasoline would be, make \n     the work week 4 (10 hour shifts) instead of 5 (8 hour \n     shifts).\n       Since we are already there 2 more hours would not matter if \n     it would save us a day's supply of gasoline getting there and \n     back, also would save the companies in electricity etc.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Brenda Northern,\n                                                      Walland, TN.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I will inform Senators as to where \nwe are on the housing bill. Most of my colleagues know that we voted \nfor cloture yesterday with a substantial vote of 83 to 9--not something \nthat occurs with great frequency, getting that kind of strong, \nbipartisan support for the housing bill, which Senator Shelby and I \nhave spent weeks crafting, with the support of our members on the \nBanking Committee. The most recent vote was 19 to 2, on a committee \nwith 21 members, where we ended up with strong, bipartisan support to \ndeal with the foreclosure crisis in this country, to reform government-\nsponsored enterprises, and to provide for an affordable housing \nprogram. That is not to mention other provisions that came out of the \nFinance Committee, under the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, to deal with mortgage revenue bonds, tax incentives, first-\ntime home buyers, and counseling services. As well, we have expanded \nthe numbers to assist individuals who are seeking to stay in their \nhomes and are trying to achieve workouts with lenders at a cost that is \naffordable for them.\n  There are many aspects of this important bill. There is no more \nimportant issue before us today than dealing with our economy. One need \nonly look at the headlines of the major newspapers in the Nation this \nmorning saying that consumer confidence is the lowest it has been, \naccording to some, in 40 years. The prospects people see for themselves \nand their families are very low. That in itself is a source of great \nconcern, and it ought to be to every Member of this body--that our \nfellow citizens don't see a very bright future for themselves and that \nwe need to take some steps on energy and health care costs and housing. \nWe have 8,400 people every day filing for foreclosure. That ought to \nalarm everybody. We need to take some steps to allow people to work \nthis out and stabilize this cascading housing problem.\n  When you have home values falling by the hour and you have problems \nwith the lack of new starts, unemployment rates occurring, with it \nspreading to student loans and commercial lending, this problem has at \nits center the housing crisis and foreclosure crisis all across our \ncountry, and it is not localized in one or two areas.\n  The fact we have been able to put together a major proposal that \naddresses this issue, and yet as we stand here, I am stymied because \none Senator has decided this bill is not going to go forward--one--\nbecause it takes unanimous consent for us to move to the bill.\n  We already worked out a number of amendments on this bill. People \nhave ideas they want to bring to it, and I welcome those. We wish to \nget to those ideas, even take the agreements we have reached with \nRepublican and Democratic Senators. One Senator is saying: You can't do \nthat. Again 8,000 more people are about to lose their homes today, but \none Senator has said: No, I am sorry, but my bill is more important \nthan the 8,000 of you yesterday or the 8,000 tomorrow who will come up.\n  We are trying to get this bill done. There are several other \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, who have ideas they wish to bring \nto this debate. Some we can agree to, some we cannot. But they deserve \na debate and a vote on their idea. I welcome the opportunity to have \nthat conversation with them. In many cases, we will try to work them \nout if we can. Where that is impossible, then this body has a right or \nobligation to vote them up or down, whether or not to accept those \nideas.\n  We had very constructive conversations with the House of \nRepresentatives. I am very grateful to Speaker  Nancy Pelosi who has \nwelcomed our work here as we try to work out the differences between \nthe House-passed bill and our bill, which are not substantial, in my \nview. We ought to come to some agreement on those differences. \nCongressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, chairman of the Financial \nServices Committee in the House, has been working with us so we can \nresolve these differences. I had hoped before we left for the \nIndependence Day recess we would have been able to send a bill to the \nPresident for his signature. What greater signal could we send, as I \nsaid yesterday, to the American people than this Congress--highly \ndivided, partisan beyond belief in too many cases--was able to come \ntogether on an issue that affects so many of our fellow citizens. We \nare this close to doing it. But I cannot offer an amendment today or \ninvite Members to resolve their differences because one Senator has \ndecided we should not do anything except his bill.\n  Unfortunately, that is how this institution works too often. As \npeople know, I have been sitting here patiently for the last day and a \nhalf, along with Senator Shelby, trying to resolve these matters. We \nhave to wait until the end of this day. We will go another 5 or 6 hours \ndoing nothing, sitting around in quorum calls and listening to speeches \nuntil we run out the clock and then have an opportunity to get to these \nissues.\n  I know there are people who care about Medicare. They care about the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. People care about the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. The majority leader has laid this out in \nclear, concise terms that we need to deal with these matters before we \nleave, and we are going to do it the hard way or the easy way. But it \nrequires cooperation. It requires people being able to put aside their \ndifferences and let us get to the matters before us.\n  No other issue is more important. I apologize for getting emotional \nabout this issue, but it is awfully difficult to go back home when \npeople are facing gasoline prices that have gone through the ceiling, \nthey are watching their fellow citizens lose their homes, the values of \ntheirs, if not losing them, are declining, joblessness rising in the \ncountry, and they are wondering why we cannot manage to get anything \ndone on their behalf.\n  While we cannot solve every problem, here we have a collection of \nbills worked out in one package, crafted by Democrats and Republicans \ncoming together, and we cannot even get to debate the issue or bring up \nideas other Members have on how we might improve this legislation.\n  I wanted to inform my colleagues as to why we have not been able to \nget much done here. It is not for the lack of leadership by Harry Reid. \nHe has been leading and asking the other side to work with us to get \nthis job done. As he said last evening, there are moments, we all \nunderstand, when partisan politics take over. There are other moments \nwhen you have to set that aside, and this is one of those moments.\n  So my urging at this moment at 11:15 this morning is, would this one \nSenator reconsider what he is objecting to and allow us to get to this \nmatter. That Senator has had four different opportunities to vote on \nhis bill. I happen to support his bill, by the way. I think I am a \ncosponsor of it. If not a cosponsor, I certainly have been supportive \nof it. I also understand there are other issues with which we have to \ngrapple, and the housing issue is a major one for us.\n  We are right on the brink. In a couple of hours, we can resolve this \nmatter, vote on it, send it to the House, and hopefully they will \nagree, and send that bill to the President. We can do that literally in \nthe next 2 or 3 hours if I can only get an opportunity to raise these \nmatters on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am deeply grateful to the majority leader who has done everything \nconceivable to make this happen. What we are lacking is the kind of \ncooperation required to get this bill done. This is not a bill I would \nhave written on my money, nor would Senator Shelby. There are 100 of us \nhere. We all have our ideas on how we would frame these matters. But we \nare elected to a body that includes 99 other Members, and you have to \nsit down with each other and work to achieve anything. When you refuse \nto do that, you make it impossible to step forward.\n  My urging at this hour of the morning is let us get to this bill, \nallow these Members--Democrats and Republicans--to have their ideas \nbrought up, resolved, or voted on so we can conclude this work, send it \nto the House, and hopefully to the President of the United States for \nhis signature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time the Senate \nspends in quorum calls during today's session count toward the time \npostcloture.\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am filing at the desk today an amendment \nto the emergency supplemental that will be coming over, or is already \nhere, from the House to reinsert a provision that the Senate put in our \nversion of the emergency supplemental before it went to the House for \ntheir consideration. This amendment includes a 1-year funding for the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. What that \nsimply means is timber-dependent communities and school districts \nacross the country would receive their level of funding for one more \nyear until such time as we can fully reauthorize the act.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, in the extender legislation, has a \nreauthorization in it. But we don't know whether that will come \nimmediately following the Fourth of July recess or some time into the \nsummer. Here is the reality of the emergency funding about which we are \ntalking.\n  There are 775 counties and 4,400 school districts in 42 States that \nis now making critical hiring decisions for the coming school year that \nwill start at the end of August. These school districts need this \nmoney. It is quite simple. They have no other way of raising the \nresource that is now terminated as a result of our inability to move in \nthe appropriate fashion.\n  What we are talking about is 9 million schoolchildren who will be \naffected. In my State, numerous school districts and potentially \nseveral hundred teachers are getting their termination notices because \nthere simply is no money to hire or to continue to hire them. What are \nwe talking about? A timber-dependent county, a county where 90 percent \nof its landscape is owned by the Federal Government and 10 percent is \nowned in fee simple and pays taxes into the school district, and they \nhave no possible way of raising enough revenue when a third or a half \nof the revenue came from those public lands originally through timber \nsales.\n  Senator Wyden and I some years ago created this legislation. It is \nknown as Craig-Wyden or Wyden-Craig. We have helped these school \ndistricts, and we are fumbling here trying to accomplish that. We put \nit in our version of the supplemental. Now the supplemental comes back. \nIt is not a pure document. It is not exclusively a military funding \ndocument. It has veterans money in it. It has emergency money in it for \nFEMA to handle the disastrous flooding going on in the State of Iowa.\n  In my State of Idaho, in Clearwater County, we have a disaster. It \nisn't flooding. It isn't the Clearwater River over its banks. It is a \nschool district that is dramatically having to diminish the quality of \neducation because this Congress has not acted in a timely fashion, and \nwe simply roll over and say: Oh, well, we will probably get it done in \nJuly, but then again it might be August.\n  It is now we must act because in August, that school will be back in \noperation and that schoolteacher who was teaching some level of \nacademics in that high school or grade school will be gone because the \nmoney has not been replenished. I call that an emergency. I call that a \nneed to address the supplemental.\n\n  I have talked with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I \nhave talked with the ranking member. They, too, view this as a crisis. \nI know we all have our priorities, but in this case Senator Crapo, \nSenator Smith, Senator Domenici, Senator Stevens, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Bennett, and others agree with me. And there are numerous \nSenators on the Democratic side of the aisle. I have spoken a few \nmoments ago with Senator Wyden. The State of Oregon will be in crisis \nif we don't resolve this in a reasonable fashion.\n  This is simply a 1-year extension of funding at current levels. It is \nnot a new reauthorization. It represents about $400 million in the \nchairman's mark that moved out of here before. So this amendment, as I \nspeak, will be filed at the desk, and I would hope, in our effort to \nmove legislation and finish the supplemental, the emergency \nsupplemental, that we also recognize there are some domestic \nemergencies here at home, such as the flooding on the Mississippi, such \nas tornado-ravaged areas, such as school districts having to fire \nneeded and necessary educators to provide for the quality of education \nof their children because Congress did not responsibly fund public \nland, Federal public land-dependent counties, and created the crisis by \nour inaction.\n  With those comments, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \npresentation, if there is a Republican speaker on the floor, they be \nrecognized next, as has been the course, and that Senator Brown of Ohio \nbe recognized as the next Democratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Department of Defense Contracting\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday, there was a hearing in the \nCongress, on the House side, dealing with someone I have spoken about \non the floor at some length, and I wish to talk about that hearing and \nwhat it means. Then, following that, I wish to speak about the bill I \nintroduced yesterday dealing with the price of gas and oil and oil \nspeculation.\n  First, let me talk about the hearing yesterday and what we learned \nabout the Defense Department and the State Department and others \ndealing with this man. This man's name is Efraim Diveroli. He is 22 \nyears old and the president and chief executive officer of a firm that \nwas awarded $300 million in contracts by our Federal Government. So \nthis is a guy who took over a shell corporation that his dad had, and \nhe was awarded $300 million in Defense Department contracts. He was the \npresident of the company at age 22. He had a vice president, though. It \nis not as if the company was understaffed. This is a photograph of his \n25-year-old vice president, who is a massage therapist--David Packouz. \nHe was called a masseur, or massage therapist. So these two guys ran a \ncompany in Florida that had an unmarked office door. At one point, Mr. \nDiveroli, the CEO, says he was the only employee and at another point \nit was he and his vice president, the massage therapist.\n  They got $300 million from the Federal Government, from the Defense \nDepartment, and they were to provide weapons and ammunition to the \nAfghan fighters because our Defense Department wanted to help the \nAfghan fighters take on the Taliban in Afghanistan. Well, here is what \nthese folks provided to the fighters in Afghanistan--40-year-old \nChinese cartridges which came in boxes that were all taped and falling \napart--this is an example. They were made in China in the mid-1960s. It \nis pretty unbelievable. The fighters in Afghanistan said this was junk \ncoming from this company that got $300 million in contracts from the \nDefense Department.\n  Now, I had the three-star general come to my office. I am on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, and we shovel a lot of money \nout the door for a lot of these Defense needs, some legitimate, some \nnot, and I had a lengthy meeting with the three-star general who was in \ncharge of this. I said: How on Earth could you have given a contract to \na company run by a 22-year-old, who had very little experience, running \na shell company his dad owned, a company where his vice president was a \nmassage therapist? This is a joke, except it is not a joke when the \nAmerican taxpayers are fleeced. He gave me a hundred excuses, this \nthree-star general did.\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\n  But all he would have had to do is go to MySpace. Pull this man up on \nMySpace, the president of this company, and here is what he says on \nMySpace.\n\n       I like to go clubbing, go to a movie. I have taken a really \n     liking towards fine Scotch whiskey. I have had problems in \n     high school, so I was forced to work most of my teen years.\n\n  He probably grew up a little fast.\n\n       Got a decent apartment. Am content for the moment.\n\n  Go to MySpace. Is this the CEO of a company you want to give $300 \nmillion in contracts to?\n  This is an outrage. So a hearing was held yesterday, and here is what \nthe hearing disclosed. There was a watch list at the State Department. \nThis company--these guys--had small contracts with the State \nDepartment, and the State Department had compiled a watch list of \n80,000 individuals and companies suspected of illegal arms \ntransgressions and other things, including this company. Well, the fact \nis, the Defense Department never checked the State Department. \nContracts have been pulled from this little company, but the Defense \nDepartment never checked, so they give them a $300 million contract, or \na series of contracts, worth $300 million.\n  The reason they say it didn't show up is because they don't check on \ncontractors that maybe are bad contractors if the contract is less than \n$5 million. That is, apparently, an asterisk.\n  I mean, I don't understand this at all. Government officials failed \nto review several of these contracts from this little company that had \nbeen canceled or delayed. They never raised red flags because they fell \nunder the $5 million contract value that was the warning threshold. The \ncontracting officer with the Army Sustainment Command had overruled a \ncontracting team that raised concerns about this company. They said \nthere was substantial doubt, but nonetheless the company got the \ncontracts. Listen, this is shameful. We ought to do--and, yes, we in \nthe Senate as well--ought to do a detailed investigation. We should \nbring people here under subpoena, if necessary, to find out who made \nthese judgments and why they are still working for the Federal \nGovernment. Why aren't they long ago gone from the Federal payroll? \nThis is not the end of it or all of it. I have spoken about dozens and \ndozens of contracts that are similar to this.\n  At any rate, yesterday, this hearing occurred in the House. I commend \nCongressman Waxman, who has been doing some of the most significant \nwork in the Congress in investigating this. We need to investigate this \non the defense spending side as well, those who appropriate this \nfunding. This is shameful, and I think everybody involved in it ought \nto be embarrassed. We are shoveling money out the door to support the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  I have shown pictures on the floor of the Senate of one-hundred \ndollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap the size of bricks, and the guy \ndistributing that cash in Iraq said he told contractors our motto was: \nWe pay in cash, you bring a bag. It was like the Wild West, he said.\n  You think money isn't wasted? You think there isn't stolen money over \nthere, when you are distributing money out of the back of a pickup \ntruck and we are airlifting one-hundred dollar bills on C-130s, flight \nafter flight, full of cash?\n  This is unbelievable what is happening with this contracting abuse, \nand this is one, small example.\n  I think all those involved in it ought to be brought before \ncongressional committees and that we demand answers from them. Who is \nresponsible, who is accountable on behalf of the American taxpayer? If \nthey can't answer, they ought not be on the public payroll.\n  That takes care of my need for therapy to talk about this issue. It \nis almost unbelievable that the American taxpayer, en masse, is not \ngathering outside this Capitol saying, when we hear this kind of thing, \nwe are outraged. So let me be outraged on behalf of them and say this \ncannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\n                       Speculating on Oil and Gas\n\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the issue of the \nprice of gasoline. I had a guy in my office the other day that was the \npresident of one of the larger corporations and this company was \nengaged in trading and all these issues. He was a fast talker. I mean, \nit was unbelievable to me. When he finished talking, I was out of \nbreath. He was one of these guys who talked and talked and talked. His \npoint was: Look, everything is working fine. The price of oil, the \nprice of gas, that is what the market says it is. I said: Well, it \nappears to me there are substantial amounts of speculation. Over a \nperiod of time in this world we have seen some dramatic growth in \nspeculation in certain areas. When it happens, the markets break and \nyou have to come back and herd the speculators out and have markets \navailable for the legitimate transactions.\n  This person said: Speculation, are you kidding me? These are normal \ntransactions on the commodities market, the futures market for oil, as \nan example. There is supply, demand, and people are involved. I said: \nWell, tell me this, if you would: What has happened in the last 15 \nmonths? Tell me what has happened with respect to supply and demand \nthat justifies doubling the price of oil in the futures market? Can you \ntell me? Then he spoke for 45 minutes, almost uninterrupted, and had \nnot answered the question.\n  I said: That makes my point. At the end of this meeting, you can't \nanswer the question because nothing has happened in the last 15 months \nthat demonstrably alters the supply-and-demand relationship or that \njustifies what has happened with the price of oil. Nothing justifies \ndoubling the price of oil in the last 15 months. The only conclusion \nyou can come to--and many have and I certainly have--is that we have a \ncarnival of speculation in the futures market by a lot of big-time \nspeculators interested in making money. They do not want to own oil or \ntake possession of oil. They do not want to use oil. They wouldn't be \nable to recognize oil at first blush. They wouldn't even be able to \nlift a 30-gallon drum of oil. They just want to make money speculating \non oil.\n  So if we have a bunch of speculators in this carnival of greed who \nrush into these markets and drive up prices well beyond what the \nfundamentals would justify, it breaks the market. If the market is \nbroken, we have a responsibility to set it right. When the commodities \nmarket for oil was established in 1936 by legislation, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt said we have to be careful to have the tools to stop the \nspeculators from taking over these markets. There is a specific piece \nin the 1936 act that talks about excessive speculation.\n  There is excessive speculation in the marketplace now, and it is \nrunning up the price of oil and gas. It is hurting every single \nAmerican family, it is damaging this economy, it is dramatically \ninjuring industries--such as airlines, truckers, farming, and others. \nThe question is, What should we do about it?\n  Should we sit here somewhere in a crevasse between daydreaming and \nthumbsucking and decide to do nothing? Or should we finally decide we \nhave to take some action when a market is broken?\n  Let me go through a couple charts. I have used them before so it is \nrepetitious, but it seems to me it is useful repetition in describing a \nvery serious problem.\n  Here is what has happened to the price of oil. There is no event in \nhere that suggests this should be the price of oil. You double the \nprice. There is nothing in here that justifies doubling the price. The \nfact is, people are driving less in this period. There were 4.5 or 5 \nbillion fewer miles driven in this country in a 6-month period; 4.5 to \n5 billion fewer miles driven, less gasoline used. That means lower \ndemand. At the same time, in the first 4 or 5 months of this year, we \nsaw crude inventory stocks rise, not fall. If inventory is going up and \ndemand is going down, what is happening to the price of oil and \ngasoline? It is going up? That doesn't make any sense. That is not \nlogical. That is a market that is broken.\n  Let me analyze what all that means. This is what a commodity exchange \nlooks like. This is the New York Mercantile Exchange, called NYMEX. \nThere are a bunch of folks who trade. They come to work and do a \nlegitimate job. They are trained to do this job, and they are trading \non behalf of others. But what has changed is, instead of it being just \na legitimate market for\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nhedging between those who produce and those who consume, wanting to \nhedge a physical commodity, we have now people in this market who have \nno relationship to this commodity.\n  Will Rogers described it a decade ago. He described people who buy \nthings they will never get from people who never had it, making money \non both sides. That is speculation.\n  Here is what some folks have said about these issues. Let me \ndescribe, first, before I describe what some other folks have said \nabout it, the 1935 act. It says, this is the commodities act that \nestablishes this--\n\n       This bill authorizes the Commission . . . to fix \n     limitations upon purely speculative trades and commitments. \n     Hedging transactions are expressly exempted.\n\n  The point is the underlying bill authorizes the regulator, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, to fix limitations on purely \nspeculative trades. That is exactly what the Commission is supposed to \ndo. But the Commission has largely taken a vacation from reality. It \nseems to have no interest in regulating. I am talking especially about \nthe chairman and those who control the Commission.\n  Here is Fadel Gheit, 30 years as the top energy analyst for \nOppenheimer & Co. He testified before our committee. I have spoken to \nhim a couple times by phone. Here is what he says:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm convinced that \n     oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it \n     the world's largest gambling hall. . . . It's open 24/7. . . \n     . Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. . . . This is like \n     a highway with no cops on the beat and no speed limit and \n     everybody's going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues, if you want to understand what is \nhappening in this market, call Mr. Gheit. He has been involved as an \nenergy trader with the large companies. He will give you an earful. I \nhave had the opportunity to hear him not only in committee, but I \ncalled him as well and had a conversation about speculation.\n  The president of Marathon Oil Company: ``$100 oil isn't justified by \nthe physical demand of the market.''\n  I am going to have a hearing this afternoon with the head of the \nEnergy Information Administration, EIA. I fund this agency in my \nappropriations subcommittee--Mr. Caruso heads it. I wish to show what \nthe EIA has projected on all these occasions for the price of oil and \ngasoline.\n  In May of last year, they projected this yellow line. That is where \nthe price would go. In July of last year, they projected this yellow \nline. In September, they projected this. Do you see what the momentum \nis? In terms of what they are projecting, in every case they are \ndemonstrably wrong--not just wrong by a little, wrong by a lot.\n  We spend over $100 million for this agency to get the best and \nbrightest, to determine as best they can what is going to happen to the \nprice of oil. They have always believed the price is essentially going \nto remain about the same or go down. The price, however, has gone way \nup. Why? Because unbridled speculation exists in this market with \nspeculators driving up these prices.\n  Despite that, the EIA testifies and has testified repeatedly: They \nsee some speculation but not very much.\n  If they believe this represents the fundamentals in the marketplace, \nhow on Earth could the best estimators in an agency we spend $100 \nmillion a year on--how could they be this wrong? There is something \nfundamentally wrong with that piece.\n  Finally, 2 days ago, the House released a report that was done by a \nHouse subcommittee that talked about the explosion of speculation on \nthe futures market. It went from 37 percent speculative trades in 2000 \nto 71 percent of the trades now that are ``speculation.''\n  I describe all that to say I have introduced legislation. I am \ntalking to Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, hopeful of \ngarnering cosponsors to move this legislation that addresses this issue \nby saying to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: You have the \nauthority to do the following, and you should do the following, just \ngoing back and reading the underlying law that created you. No. 1, \nidentify those trades that represent legitimate hedging trades between \na producer and a consumer with a physical product in which they wish to \nhedge risk. That is precisely what the market was established for. \nDistinguish that kind of trading from all other trading which \nrepresents nonlegitimate hedging, or speculation.\n  Once you have determined what body of trading represents speculative \ntrading--and it has been a carnival of greed, in my judgment, rushing \nand pushing up the amount of speculative trading, as I have shown--once \nyou have done that, I suggest we impose a 25-percent margin on the \nspeculative trading that is going on, in order to try to wring some of \nthat excess speculation out of this market.\n  No. 2, I suggest the regulator have the opportunity to use their \nauthority to either revoke or modify all their previous actions, \nincluding their ``no action'' letters, in order to shine the light on \nand see and regulate all the transactions that have to do with American \nproducts or trading in this country.\n  Strangely enough, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission itself \nsaid, for example, the Intercontinental Exchange, largely owned by \nAmerican interests, that trades in London--that you can come here, you \ncan set up an office in Atlanta, you can trade on computers in Atlanta, \nand we will decide of our own volition that we will not regulate you \nand you will be outside the purview of our sight. That is an \nunbelievably bad decision, and it needs to be revoked--not just that \ndecision but so many others similar to it.\n  It would be nice if we would have a regulatory body that says our job \nis to regulate. We pay for regulatory bodies for the purpose of wearing \nthe striped shirts; they are the referees, they call the fouls.\n  I think, having taught some economics in college, that the best \nallocator of goods and services in this country that I know of is the \nmarketplace. Markets are wonderful. I am a big supporter of markets. \nBut when markets are broken, the Government has a responsibility to \nact. We have a regulator that has been oblivious to open markets, in \nfact has accelerated and actually helped break them. I believe our \nresponsibility at this point is to set this regulator straight and \ndecide here are the conditions by which we own up to the \nresponsibilities of the original act--allowing for legitimate trading \nand hedging but trying to shut down the speculation that has driven up \nthe price of gasoline and that injures every family and every business \nin this country and damages the American economy.\n  My hope is, in the coming couple days and weeks, that Congress, and \nthe Senate especially, will be able to consider the bill I have \nauthored. There are other good ideas as well. I welcome all of them. \nBut I think this is not a circumstance in which one of the options for \nthe Congress is to do nothing. The American people expect more and \ndeserve more and I think should get more from this Congress.\n  I have spoken to Senator Reid and many others, who are also very \ninterested in moving on these issues. I hope it will be bipartisan. I \nam very interested in having Republicans and Democrats work on \nperfecting these issues so we can take action very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business to be followed by the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Brown, and he would be followed by the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask I be added after Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And the Senator from Wisconsin be after Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, it is my intention--which I will not do \nright now because I know what would happen--to introduce an amendment \nto the housing bill that makes eminent sense. But I know and I have \nbeen told it would be objected to, so I will not do it, but I will \nexplain it in hopes that at a later time we will be able to get this \nin.\n  The amendment I have is simply a one-page amendment. What it does, it \nwould prohibit individuals who annually make more than $75,000 and \ncouples making more than $150,000 from\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nreceiving taxpayer-backed bailouts of troubled mortgages. The main \nprovision of the housing bailout bill is a program to allow troubled \nmortgage holders to refinance their mortgage into a Government-insured \nloan through the FHA. The bill allows the FHA to take on up to $300 \nbillion in troubled mortgages, into the taxpayer-backed program.\n  In this bill, as currently written, the value of an eligible loan \nunder the FHA is $550,000. The nationwide average value of a home is \nroughly $200,000. The average value of a home in Oklahoma is just under \n$150,000.\n  I believe it is bad policy to put taxpayers on the hook for borrowers \nwho took on more than they could afford and lenders who made bad loans \nto begin with. It is entirely unacceptable to have the Government put \ntaxpayers on the hook for someone who qualified for a loan more than \ntwo or three times what the average American can afford.\n  When Congress passed the economic stimulus package, Democrats \nvehemently argued certain people make too much money to benefit from a \nhandout from the U.S. Government; specifically, eligibility for the \nfull-time stimulus was capped at $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 \nfor couples. So this amendment says that if you are too rich to get a \nfull stimulus check, you are too rich to get a bailout.\n  Another provision of the housing bill provides an interest-free loan \nof $8,000 for first-time home buyers and applies income limits of \n$75,000--there it is again--for individuals and $150,000 for couples. \nIt is perfectly reasonable to apply those same income standards for \nindividuals who are getting a taxpayer-backed bailout on their \nmortgages.\n  Someone with a $550,000 mortgage pays approximately $3,300 a month on \nhousing alone--that is assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at a 6.3-\npercent interest rate. That comes to $39,600 a year in mortgage \npayments alone. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, average \nper capita income in the United States, in 2007, was $38,600; \ntherefore, someone with a $550,000 mortgage will be spending around \n$1,000 more on their home alone than the average American makes in an \nentire year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office came out and warned that 35 percent \nof the loans refinanced through the program will eventually default \nanyway. CBO also highlighted the perverse incentives in this bill, \nnoting that banks will use the program to offload their highest risk \nloans to taxpayers. CBO said:\n\n       . . . the cumulative [default rate] for the program would \n     be about 35 percent and that recoveries on defaulted \n     mortgages would be about 60 percent of the outstanding loan \n     amount. Those rates reflect CBO's view that mortgage holders \n     would have an incentive to direct their highest risk loans to \n     the program.\n\n  Washington should not be holding folks who have been responsible for \ntheir mortgage liability responsible for the irresponsible decisions of \nothers. We should not be putting taxpayers on the hook for bad loans \nmade by irresponsible lenders and borrowers. We most certainly should \nnot be putting taxpayers on the hook for individuals who can afford two \nor three times what the average taxpayer can afford.\n  This is especially true when there is no guarantee the program would \nnot have to be bailed out after the additional taxpayer dollars. There \nis a very good chance, in fact, that this program will require \nadditional tax dollars; that this is just the beginning.\n  On June 10, the New York Times reported that the FHA--the agency we \nare mandating in this bill to take on the worst loans made during the \nsubprime housing crisis--currently faces $4.6 billion in losses, four \ntimes the amount of losses than the previous year and over 20 percent \nof its capital reserves.\n  The day before the New York Times story, Reuters reported that the \nhead of FHA, Brian Montgomery, has serious concerns about the housing \nlegislation we are now considering:\n\n       Some in Congress are advancing legislation . . . that could \n     be problematic for the economy and the country.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       FHA is designed to help stabilize the economy . . . it is \n     not designed to be a lender of last resort, a mega-agency to \n     subsidize bad loans.\n\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported the FHA is having serious \ntrouble with the bad mortgages that are already on the books and will \nlikely require an appropriation of over 1 billion in Federal tax \ndollars as soon as next year.\n  This would be the first instance of a government subsidy for the FHA \nsince it was created in 1934.\n  The Journal reported:\n\n       The FHA, which essentially is filling the void left by the \n     collapse of the subprime market, will request a Government \n     subsidy for the first time in its 74-year history. The agency \n     says it will need $1.4 billion next year.\n\n  The American taxpayer, the taxpayers in my State of Oklahoma, should \nnot be put in a position where they are ultimately responsible for the \nirresponsible decisions of others, and they certainly should not be on \nthe hook for relatively well-off individuals, not to mention large \nlending companies that made poor financial decisions.\n  Lastly, let me say we are using the same standard, this $75,000 per \nindividual or $150,000 for a joint return, that would be the same level \nwe are using in the rest of this bill and other programs, including the \neconomic stimulus program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 70 years ago today President Roosevelt \nsigned the Fair Labor Standards Act into law. After two decades of \ndevastating Supreme Court opposition, a Supreme Court in those days \nwith a similar bias against workers that our Supreme Court has today--\nthink of Ledbetter and so many other cases they have made. But after \ntwo decades of devastating Supreme Court opposition, and 3 years after \nthat Supreme Court declared the National Industrial Recovery Act \nunconstitutional, Americans finally were assured of a minimum wage, \nreasonable work hours, and an end to child exploitation.\n  Senator Hugo Black, who sat at this desk in the Senate in the 1920s \nand 1930s, was fundamental in this historic achievement. Black, in the \nearly 1930s, prior to Roosevelt becoming President, had introduced \nlegislation calling for a 6-hour workday. It was considered so radical \nand so controversial that the 8-hour workday signed into law by \nPresident Roosevelt was considered more reasonable and more palatable, \nand the Congress went along.\n  Black, by this time, by the time the minimum wage actually went into \neffect, was a member of the Supreme Court appointed by President \nRoosevelt. Black, in those years leading up, joined with President \nRoosevelt, Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, and labor leader Sidney \nHillman to craft legislation that would withstand judicial challenge. \nIt was not an easy fight, but progressives stood firm for social \njustice and for economic justice. They said ``no'' to worker \nexploitation and they created a path to the American dream for \nmillions. As the minimum wage floor was established, other wages went \nup also, and more and more workers joined the middle class and as a \nresult came out of poverty and joined the middle class. For the first \ntime in our Nation's history, people who worked hard were assured of a \nreasonable standard of living and decent labor conditions.\n  Where is that commitment today? Today's low- and middle-income men \nand women have been hit hard by the failed economic policies of the \nlast 7 years, bad trade policy, bad tax policy, all up and down. We see \nwhat has happened to our economy in the Presiding Officer's home State \nof Pennsylvania, my State of Ohio, from Lima to Zanesville, and \neverywhere in between.\n  With gas at $4 a gallon, rising health care costs, skyrocketing food \nprices, it is more and more difficult for hard-working Americans to \nkeep pace. Now 70 years of progress is eroding. Income inequality is \nthe worst it has been in this country since before Roosevelt, since the \nDepression and the New Deal gave birth to the minimum wage.\n  Tim, from Cleveland Heights, OH, a suburb southeast of Cleveland, \nused to donate to food banks, soup kitchens, and charities before his \nfamily fell on hard times. He never thought he would need that help \nfrom others. But as the cost of living went up, Tim, who has a full-\ntime job--his wages did not keep\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\npace. It took 3 months of financial strain before Tim and his family \nrealized they needed to use the food bank he had been contributing to \nin the past.\n  Tim used to consider himself middle class. He does not picture \nhimself that way anymore. But there is reason for hope. In 2007, this \nCongress, the House and the Senate, passed the first minimum wage \nincrease in 10 years. Workers now earn $5.85 an hour, and will get a \nraise of 70 cents next month. This is a positive step but just the \nfirst. We must continue to push for a living wage for all of Ohio and \nAmerica's hard-working men and women.\n  Today someone earning a minimum wage and working full time makes only \n$10,700 a year. That is $6,000 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree. That, put mildly, is unacceptable. Congress must work to index \nthe minimum wage to inflation to give workers relief in these hard \ntimes.\n  Under current policy, wages stay low as prices go up. Wages in real \ndollars are far below the minimum wage, and in real dollars are far \nbelow what it was 40 years ago. Hard-working Americans are at the mercy \nof politics and business lobbies for an increase in pay, while CEOs of \ncorporations such as Exxon are reporting record paydays. This is \nunconscionable.\n  Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       A self-supporting and self-respecting democracy can plead \n     no justification for the existence of child labor, no \n     economic reason for chiseling workers' wages or stretching \n     workers' hours.\n\n  Like Roosevelt, we must stand for social and economic justice. If \nsocial justice and economic justice works for hard-working Ohio \nfamilies, hard-working American families, and social and economic \njustice builds a better society, we must do our part to ensure that \nthose who want to work can make a living wage.\n  We must fight in this Chamber for families who are struggling to stay \nabove the poverty line, families who work full time and play by the \nrules, pay their taxes, are involved in their communities, raising \ntheir kids. We must ask ourselves what kind of country we want this \ngreat country to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill, not in morning \nbusiness.\n  I am concerned we are not getting to a lot of the issues in this bill \nwe should get to. Although I am supportive of the underlying bill, one \nof the issues we are not getting to, and I do not understand it, is the \nneed to extend the renewable tax credits.\n  Senator Ensign and Senator Cantwell have brought forward an amendment \nto accomplish this. The renewable tax credits are those tax credits \nwhich create an incentive for using things that are more energy \nefficient: making your home more energy efficient, using solar, using \nwind, using wood pellet stoves, things which are basically alternative \nsources of energy, or doing additions to people's homes which make \ntheir homes more energy efficient.\n  At a time when gas prices are extraordinarily high, and oil prices \nare going through the roof, especially home heating oil--in fact, it is \nestimated home heating oil will be about $4.77 this week--it is \nessential that we do whatever we can as a government to encourage the \nuse of alternative sources and renewables and to encourage people to be \nmore energy efficient as they either build a new home or they refurbish \nand renovate their old homes.\n  That seems to be common sense to me. It has such common sense that \nthis proposal, the extension of the renewable tax credits, passed this \nbody with 88 votes. However, for some reason it is not being allowed to \nbe brought up on this bill.\n  It is very appropriate for this bill, it is even germane to this \nbill, as I understand it, which is a pretty heavy test to pass. But it \nis not being allowed to be brought up for a vote. I cannot understand \nthat. This is such an important action from the standpoint of giving \nconsumers and people who are struggling with high energy cost options. \nIt is something we should rush to do. It is not something that should \nbe delayed by the leadership of the other side of the aisle. But that \nis what is happening.\n\n  I join with Senator Ensign and Senator Cantwell and strongly \nencourage the leadership of the Senate Democrats to allow a vote on \nthis amendment and let it pass. If the House does not want to take it, \nthat is their choice. But I suspect the House will, because, again, it \nis common sense, and commonsense ideas usually lead to common ground, \nwhich leads to something happening around here.\n  When you have got 88 votes for something, it should be done. In the \nlarger context of the energy crisis which we face, this type of step is \ncritical. It is not going to solve the whole problem, we know that, but \nit is certainly part of the matrix of moving to a more positive result \nand getting our energy costs under control.\n  People in New Hampshire--this is true across the country, but people \nin New Hampshire are thinking about next winter and the cost of home \nheating oil is going to be extraordinary. It looks as if this will add \ntremendous stress, especially on people who live on a fixed income but \neven those who were able to adjust their income through working are \ngoing to find it difficult. They are going to find it difficult, \nbecause at $4 a gallon, if they have to commute to work--and most \npeople in New Hampshire have to commute; it is a rural State from the \nstandpoint of moving around--they are going to find it much more \nexpensive to commute. Most people use oil to heat their homes, and with \nhome heating oil at over $4.50 a gallon, you are talking about a \ndoubling of the oil costs from last year. That is going to overwhelm \nthe pocketbooks and the economic situation for a lot of people in New \nHampshire. It is going to be a real hardship. We need to do something \nwhich will relieve that.\n  This is one element of extending the renewable energy tax credits. \nBut another major element of it is for us to have an energy policy at \nthe national level which essentially promotes American production of \nenergy. We should produce more American energy and obviously we should \nconsume less. There is no question that conservation is a critical \nelement, as are renewables. But on the production side, there is no \nreason that we as a nation have locked up our capacity to use our \nresources in order to relieve the pressure on America's people who are \nnow having to pay these outrageous prices for energy, and with the \nrevenues from those purchases going overseas, in many instances to \nnations which do not like us all that much.\n  In addition, obviously every time we send a dollar overseas, it is a \ndollar that can't be invested here in more jobs, in more economic \nactivity, and the fact that we have now tripled what we are exporting \nin the way of resources, in the way of dollars, again to countries in \nsome instances that do not have a great deal of admiration for us, in \nmany ways are antagonistic to us--the exportation of those huge amounts \nof dollars, over $300 billion a year, is money which we need here in \nAmerica to make ourselves stronger.We are heading down a very dangerous \nroad here when we do not recognize that we need to produce American \nenergy and keep those dollars in the United States, rather than \nshipping them overseas.\n  Now, from the other side of the aisle we heard these proposals, we \nheard it from the Senator from North Dakota, that the way to address \nthis is to litigate; the way to address this is to regulate; the way to \naddress this is to tax.\n  Well, none of those initiatives add more resources to the mix. And \nthis is, in large part, an issue of supply and demand. The world is \nexpanding. India and China have a population base of almost 2.5 billion \npeople between them. We have 300 million people. They are growing \neconomically, and they are using a lot of energy to do that.\n  We have to recognize that if we are going to remain competitive and \nproductive and strong, we have got to produce energy here, we have got \nto conserve it--we have to produce more of it, and we have to use less.\n  As part of that initiative, we need to look at ways and places that \nwe can produce more, areas such as oil shale, for example. We have more \nreserves in oil shale, three times as much reserves in oil as Saudi \nArabia. The estimate is between 2 and 3 trillion barrels of reserves in \noil shale alone. We have huge\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nreserves in Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas. But both of those \ntypes of resources are being locked down by opposition, again \nregrettably by the other side of the aisle, which says we cannot drill \nin the Outer Continental Shelf except in the Gulf of Mexico, and we \ncannot use the oil shale reserves which are available.\n  In fact, 100 percent of the oil shale reserves have been put off \nlimits by policies of the other side of the aisle, supported by their \nnational Presidential candidate, Mr. Obama, and 85 percent of the oil \nin the lower 49 that is potentially out there on the Outer Continental \nShelf has been put off limits, again, by the other side of the aisle \nand, again, supported by Senator Obama. That is a huge amount of \nreserves which we are leaving in the ground while we buy oil at \nexorbitant prices from Venezuela, a country led by an individual who \nhates America; oil from Iran, a country where the entire government \nhates America and anything western.\n  Why do we do that? That makes no sense at all. Clearly, we have these \nreserves here, and they can be recovered in an environmentally safe and \nsound way. The example on the Outer Continental Shelf was shown when we \nsaw Katrina, a horrific disaster, a force 5 hurricane that came up the \nGulf of Mexico and wiped out one of our great cities, New Orleans. \nVirtually no oil or gas was spilled as a result of Hurricane Katrina. \nYet it went right across the Gulf of Mexico where all the major oil and \ngas rigs are. That proved beyond any question that gas and oil can be \nproduced on the Outer Continental Shelf with environmental safety.\n  There is a lot of it out there that has been locked down. Eighty-five \npercent of the potential leaseholds are no longer available because of \nthe position taken by the other side. In the area of oil shale, these \nhuge reserves which may be available to us are recoverable by drilling \nunderground and by doing almost all the effort to recover that oil \nunderground so that what actually comes out of the ground is virtually \nthe product that is used. We could essentially get all the oil we need \nin order to operate the armed services of the United States, the \nbiggest consumer of oil in this country, simply from oil shale because \nit is a heavy oil which is diesel-like fuel. Yet that is locked down; \n100 percent of that is locked down by the policies of the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  We can move on, of course, to another source that we need to use, \nwhich is nuclear power. Nuclear power is essential if we are going to \nproduce the electricity necessary to make this country productive and \nprosperous and to meet the need to reduce greenhouse gases which are \ncreating problems for us as a culture and for the world. The other side \nof the aisle has resisted and stopped construction of new nuclear \npowerplants. We are uniquely familiar with this in New Hampshire. We \nhad the last nuclear powerplant that went on line, Seabrook. It took us \nan extra 10 to 15 years to build that plant beyond what it should have \nrequired. It cost us almost $1 billion more than it should have cost, \nand almost all of those costs and delays were a function of protests \nundertaken by very activist elements led primarily by the Democratic \nParty within the State of New Hampshire.\n  There has never been an apology for what they did to the people of \nNew Hampshire--over a billion dollars of extra energy costs put on the \npeople of New Hampshire, a direct tax, and yet Seabrook, once it was \nturned on, has delivered power for almost 18 years and has delivered it \nsafely and at a fair price, to the point where New Hampshire actually \nexports energy to surrounding States as a result.\n  We know nuclear power can be safe. Nobody has ever died from nuclear \npower as compared with other types of power sources. We should not bar \nits development; we should encourage its development. We need new \nnuclear powerplants. We need new sources. We need to find and explore \nfor new sources of energy such as are available on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and in oil shale.\n  Yet, regrettably, what we run into here is that everybody can agree \non the need for conservation, but it doesn't appear we are going to \nagree on the need for renewables because that amendment is being \nstopped. But the idea that we should go out and produce more American \nenergy so we are not buying energy from Venezuela and from Iran, that \nis rejected, regrettably, by the other side of the aisle.\n  The policy presented in their energy plan was taxation, litigation, \nand regulation. We heard it again today. We just regulate our way into \na surplus of supply. That is not going to happen. You can't take a \ntrial lawyer and stick him in your oil tank, in your house, and get \nenergy. The simple fact is, giving the trial lawyers the ability to sue \nVenezuela isn't going to produce any more energy for the United States.\n  What it is probably going to do is create an atmosphere where \ncountries that dislike us within the OPEC group are going to say: The \nheck with you. You want to create a lawsuit against us, we don't have \nto sell you the energy or, when you send us your money, we don't have \nto reinvest in the United States. It is cutting off our nose to spite \nour face. It is a policy that is virtually absurd on its face because \nit will have so little productive effect on the price of energy.\n  The same could be said for taxation. We are going to create a \nconfiscatory tax on companies that produce energy, American companies. \nThose companies only control about 6 percent of the world's reserves. \nThe rest of the world's reserves are controlled by nations such as \nSaudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran. They are not going to be subject to \nthat tax, their companies. So that puts our companies immediately at a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  What do these companies which have been so vilified around here and \nsuch easy targets for the online press release really do with those \nprofits? They do two things: They reinvest them in trying to find more \nenergy, which will hopefully be American-produced energy, which is good \nbecause more supply reduces cost, or they distribute those profits to \nshareholders. Who are the shareholders? Most Americans are \nshareholders, and most American shareholdings are in these companies.\n  If you have a 401(k), if you are a member of a pension fund, if you \nare a union employee and you have a pension fund, the odds are good \nthat pension fund is invested in one of these companies that are going \nto be subject to this brand new taxation coming from the other side of \nthe aisle. There will be less money to explore and less money to \ndistribute back to working Americans through their pension funds and \ndividends. That is not going to produce any more energy; in fact, it \nwill produce less. That, again, accomplishes nothing except putting out \na press release which has nice cosmetics, but when you look behind it, \nit has no substance as to addressing the fundamental issue.\n  The fundamental issue is this: We, as a country, need more American \nenergy production, and we need to consume a lot less. There are two \nsides to the coin. We also need a renewable policy that works. That is \nwhy this amendment offered by Senators Ensign and Cantwell, and which \nhas such broad support here, should be voted on. It is a no-brainer. \nLet's at least move this part of the package of responsible energy \npolicy. I cannot understand why it is not being voted on, especially \nsince it is relevant to the housing bill. We should pass this in a \nnanosecond because it will at least help in a small way toward moving \nour energy policy in the right way, which is toward more renewables as \nwe address the issue of production and conservation along with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                      FISA Amendments Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose H.R. 6304, the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2008. I will vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed. This legislation has been billed as a compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats. We are asked to support it because it is \nsupposedly a reasonable accommodation of opposing views.\n  Let me respond to that as clearly as possible. This bill is not a \ncompromise; it is a capitulation. This bill will effectively and \nunjustifiably grant immunity to companies that allegedly participated \nin an illegal wiretapping program, a program that more than 70 Members \nof this body still know virtually nothing about. This bill will\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\ngrant the Bush administration, the same administration that developed \nand operated this illegal program for more than 5 years, expansive new \nauthorities to spy on Americans' international communications.\n  If you don't believe me, here is what Senator Bond had to say about \nthe bill:\n\n  I think the White House got a better deal than even they had hoped to \nget.\n\n  House minority whip Roy Blunt said:\n\n       The lawsuits will be dismissed.\n\n  There is simply no question that Democrats who had previously stood \nstrong against immunity and in support of civil liberties were on the \nlosing end of this backroom deal.\n  The railroading of Congress began last summer when the administration \nrammed through the so-called Protect America Act, or PAA, vastly \nexpanding the Government's ability to eavesdrop without a court-\napproved warrant. That legislation was rushed through this Chamber in a \nclimate of fear--fear of terrorist attacks and fear of not appearing \nsufficiently strong on national security. There was very little \nunderstanding of what the legislation actually did. But the silver \nlining was that the law did have a 6-month sunset. So Congress quickly \nstarted working to fix the legislation. The House passed a bill last \nfall. The Senate passed its bill, one that I believed was deeply \nflawed, in February.\n  As the PAA 6-month sunset approached in late February, the House \nfaced enormous political pressure simply to pass the Senate bill before \nthe sunset date, but the reality was that no orders under the PAA were \nactually going to expire in February. Fortunately, to their great \ncredit, the House stood firm in its resolve not to pass the Senate bill \nwith its unjustified immunity provisions. The House deserves enormous \ncredit for not buckling in the face of the President's attempts to \nintimidate them. Ultimately, the House passed new legislation in March, \nsetting up the negotiations that have led us here today.\n  I think it is safe to say that even many who voted for the Protect \nAmerica Act last year came to believe it was a mistake to pass that \nlegislation. While the House deserves credit for refusing to pass the \nSenate bill in February and for securing the changes in this new bill, \nthe bill is still a very serious mistake.\n  The immunity provision is a key reason for that. It is a key reason \nfor my opposition to the legislation and for that of so many of my \ncolleagues and, frankly, so many Americans. No one should be fooled \nabout the effect of this bill. Under its terms the companies that \nallegedly participated in the illegal wiretapping program will walk \naway from these lawsuits with immunity. They will get immunity. There \nis simply no question about it. Anyone who says this bill preserves a \nmeaningful role for the courts to play in deciding these cases is just \nwrong.\n  I am a little concerned that the focus on immunity has diverted \nattention away from the other very important issues at stake in this \nlegislation. In the long run, I don't believe this bill will be \nactually remembered as the immunity bill. I think this bill is going to \nbe remembered as the legislation in which Congress granted the \nexecutive branch the power to sweep up all of our international \ncommunications with very few controls or oversight.\n  Here I am talking about title I of the bill, the title that makes \nsubstantive changes to the FISA statute. I would like to explain why I \nam so concerned about the new surveillance powers granted in this part \nof the bill, and why the modest improvements made to this part of the \nbill don't even come close to being sufficient.\n  This bill has been sold to us as necessary to ensure that the \nGovernment can collect communications between persons overseas without \na warrant and to ensure that the Government can collect the \ncommunications of terrorists, including their communications with \npeople in the United States. No one disagrees that the Government \nshould have this authority. But the bill goes much further, authorizing \nwidespread surveillance involving innocent Americans at home and \nabroad.\n  First, the FISA Amendments Act, like the Protect America Act, will \nauthorize the Government to collect all communications between the \nUnited States and the rest of the world.\n  That could mean millions upon millions of communications between \ninnocent Americans and their friends, families, or business associates \noverseas could legally be collected. Parents calling their kids \nstudying abroad, e-mails to friends `` serving in Iraq--all of these \ncommunications could be collected, with absolutely no suspicion of any \nwrongdoing, under this legislation. In fact, the DNI even testified \nthat this type of ``bulk collection'' would be ``desirable.''\n  The bill's supporters like to say that the Government needs \nadditional powers to target terrorists overseas. But under this bill, \nthe Government is not limited to targeting foreigners outside the \nUnited States who are terrorists, or who are suspected of some \nwrongdoing, or who are members or agents of some foreign government or \norganization. In fact, the Government does not even need a specific \npurpose for wiretapping anyone overseas. All it needs to have is a \ngeneral ``foreign intelligence'' purpose, which is a standard so broad \nthat it basically covers all international communications.\n  That is not just my opinion. The DNI has testified that, under the \nPAA, and presumably this bill, the Government could legally collect all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas. Let me repeat \nthat. Under this bill, the Government can legally collect all \ncommunications--every last one--between Americans here at home at home \nand the rest of the world.\n  I should note that one of the few bright spots in this bill is the \ninclusion of a provision from the Senate bill to prohibit the \nintentional targeting of an American overseas without a warrant. That \nis an important new protection. But that amendment does not prevent the \nindiscriminate vacuuming up of all international communications, which \nwould allow the Government to collect the communications of Americans \noverseas, including with friends and family back home, without a \nwarrant.\n  I tried to address this issue of ``bulk collection'' several times, \nworking in the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and \nultimately on the Senate floor in February, when I offered an amendment \nthat would have required that there be some foreign intelligence \npurpose for the collection of communications to or from particular \ntargets. The vast majority of Democrats supported this effort, but, \nunfortunately, it was defeated. So the bill today we are considering \ndoes not address this serious problem.\n  Second, like the earlier Senate version, this bill fails to \neffectively prohibit the practice of reverse targeting and this is; \nnamely, wiretapping a person overseas when what the Government is \nreally interested in is listening to an American here at home with whom \nthe foreigner is communicating. The bill does have a provision that \npurports to address this issue. The bill prohibits intentionally \ntargeting a person outside the United States without an individualized \ncourt order if ``the purpose'' is to target someone reasonably believed \nto be in the United States. But this language would permit intentional \nand possibly unconstitutional warrantless surveillance of an American \nso long as the Government has any interest in the person overseas with \nwhom the American is communicating. And, if there was any doubt, the \nDNI has publicly said that the Senate bill--which contained identical \nlanguage as the current bill--merely ``codifies'' the administration's \nposition, which is that the Government can wiretap a person overseas \nindefinitely without a warrant, no matter how interested it may really \nbe in the American with whom that person overseas is communicating.\n  Supporters of this bill also will argue that it requires the \nexecutive branch to establish guidelines for implementing this new \nreverse targeting requirement. But the guidelines are not subject to \nany judicial review. And requiring guidelines to implement an \nineffective limitation is not a particularly comforting safeguard.\n  When the Senate considered the FISA bill earlier this year, I offered \nan amendment--one that had actually been approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--to make this prohibition on reverse targeting \nmeaningful. My amendment, which again had the support of the vast \nmajority of the Democratic caucus and was included in the bill passed \nby the House in March,\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nwould have required the Government to obtain a court order whenever a \nsignificant purpose of the surveillance is actually to acquire the \ncommunications of an American in the United States. This would have \ndone a far better job of protecting the privacy of the international \ncommunications of innocent Americans. Unfortunately, it is not in this \nbill.\n  Third, the bill before us imposes no meaningful consequences if the \nGovernment initiates surveillance using procedures that have not been \napproved by the FISA Court, and the FISA Court later finds that those \nprocedures were unlawful. Say, for example, that the FISA Court \ndetermines that the procedures were not even reasonably designed to \nwiretap foreigners rather than Americans. Under the bill, all of that \nillegally obtained information on Americans can be retained and used \nanyway. Once again, there are no consequences for illegal behavior.\n  Now, unlike the Senate bill, this new bill does generally provide for \nFISA Court review of surveillance procedures before surveillance \nbegins. But it also says that if the Attorney General and the DNI \ncertify that they don't have time to get a court order and that \nintelligence important to national security may be lost or not timely \nacquired, then they can go forward without this judicial approval. This \nis a far cry from allowing an exception to FISA Court review in a true \nemergency because arguably all intelligence is important to national \nsecurity and any delay at all might cause some intelligence to be lost. \nSo I am really concerned that this so-called exigency exception could \nvery well swallow the rule and undermine any presumption of prior \njudicial approval.\n  But whether the exception is applied broadly or narrowly, if the \nGovernment invokes it and ultimately engages in illegal surveillance, \nthe court should be given at least some flexibility after the fact to \ndetermine whether the government should be allowed to keep the results \nof illegal surveillance if it involves Americans. That is what another \none of my amendments on the Senate floor would have done, an amendment \nthat actually garnered 40 votes. Yet this issue goes completely \nunaddressed in the so-called compromise.\n  Fourth, this bill doesn't protect the privacy of Americans whose \ncommunications will be collected in vast new quantities. The \nadministration's mantra has been: Don't worry, we have minimization \nprocedures. Minimization procedures are nothing more than unchecked \nexecutive branch decisions about what information on Americans \nconstitutes ``foreign intelligence.'' As recently declassified \ndocuments have again confirmed, the ability of Government officials to \nfind out the identity of Americans and use that information is \nextremely broad. Moreover, even if the administration were correct that \nminimization procedures have worked in the past, they are certainly \ninadequate as a check against the vast amounts of Americans' private \ninformation that could be collected under this bill. That is why on the \nSenate floor joined with my colleagues, Senator Webb and Senator \nTester, to offer an amendment to provide real protections for the \nprivacy of Americans, j while also giving the Government the \nflexibility it needs to wiretap terrorists overseas. But this bill, \nlike the Senate bill, relies solely on these inadequate minimization \nprocedures.\n  The broad surveillance powers involving international communications \nthat are contained in this legislation are particularly troubling \nbecause we live in a world in which international communications are \nincreasingly commonplace. Thirty years ago it was very expensive, and \nnot very common, for most Americans to make an overseas call. Now, \nparticularly with e-mail, such communications happen all the time. \nMillions of ordinary, and innocent, Americans communicate with people \noverseas for entirely legitimate personal and business reasons. Parents \nor children call family members overseas. Students e-mail friends they \nhave met while studying abroad. Business people communicate with \ncolleagues or clients overseas. Technological advancements combined \nwith the ever more interconnected world economy have led to an \nexplosion of international contacts.\n  Supporters of the bill like to say that we just have to bring FISA up \nto date with new technology. But changes in technology should also \ncause us to take a close look at the need for greater protections of \nthe privacy of our citizens. If we are going to give the Government \nbroad new powers that will lead to the collection of much more \ninformation on innocent Americans, we have a duty to protect their \nprivacy as much as we possibly can. And we can do that without \nsacrificing our ability to collect information that will help us \nprotect our national security. This supposed compromise, unfortunately, \nfails that test.\n  I don't mean to suggest that this bill does not contain some \nimprovements over the bill that the Senate passed early this year. \nClearly it does, and I appreciate that. Certainly, it is a good thing \nthat this bill includes language making clear, once and for all, that \nCongress considers FISA and the criminal wiretap laws to be the \nexclusive means by which electronic surveillance can be conducted in \nthis country--a provision that Senator Feinstein fought so hard for. \nAnd it is a good thing that Congress is directing the relevant \ninspectors general to do a comprehensive report on the President's \nillegal wiretapping program--a report whose contents I hope will be \nmade public to the greatest degree possible. And it is a good thing \nthat the bill no longer redefines the critical FISA term ``electronic \nsurveillance,'' which could have led to a lot of confusion and \nunintended consequences.\n  All of those provisions are positive developments, and I am glad that \nthe ultimate product seemingly destined to become law contains these \nimprovements.\n  But I just can't pretend somehow that these improvements are enough. \nThey are nowhere close. When I offered my amendments on the Senate \nfloor in February, the vast majority of the Democratic caucus supported \nme. While I did not have the votes to pass those amendments, I am \nconfident that more and more Members of Congress will agree that \nchanges to this legislation need to be made. If we can't make them this \nyear, then Congress must return to this issue--and it must do so as \nsoon as the new President takes office. These issues are far too \nimportant to wait until the sunset date, especially now that it is set \nin this bill for 2012, another presidential election year.\n  But let me now turn to the grant of retroactive immunity that is \ncontained in this bill because on that issue there is no question that \nany differences between this bill and the Senate bill are only \ncosmetic. Make no mistake: This bill will result in immunity.\n  Under the terms of this bill, a Federal district court would evaluate \nwhether there is substantial evidence that a company received ``a \nwritten request or directive . . . from the Attorney General or the \nhead of an element of the intelligence community . . . indicating that \nthe activity was authorized by the President and determined to be \nlawful.''\n  But we already know from Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's \ncommittee report last fall that the companies received exactly these \nmaterials. That is already public information. So under the exact terms \nof this proposal, the court's evaluation would essentially be \npredetermined.\n  Regardless of how much information the court is permitted to review, \nwhat standard of review is employed, how open the proceedings are, and \nwhat role the plaintiffs are permitted to play, the court will \nessentially be required to grant immunity under this bill.\n  Now, proponents will argue that the plaintiffs in the lawsuits \nagainst the companies can participate in briefing to the court. This is \ntrue. But they are allowed to participate only to the extent it does \nnot necessitate the disclosure of classified information. The \nadministration has restricted information about this illegal program so \nmuch that, again, more than 70 Members of this Chamber alone don't even \nhave access to the basic facts about what happened. So let's not \npretend that the plaintiffs will be able to participate in any \nmeaningful way. And even if they could participate fully, as I said \nbefore, immunity is a foregone conclusion under the bill.\n  This result is extremely disappointing on many levels, perhaps most \nof all because granting retroactive immunity is unnecessary and \nunjustified. Doing this will profoundly\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\nundermine the rule of law in this country.\n  For starters, current law already provides immunity from lawsuits for \ncompanies that cooperate with the Government's request for assistance, \nas long as they receive either a court order or a certification from \nthe Attorney General that no court order is needed and the request \nmeets all statutory requirements. But if requests are not properly \ndocumented, FISA instructs the telephone companies to refuse the \nGovernment's request, and subjects them to liability if they instead \nstill decide to cooperate. Now, there is a reason for this. This \nframework, which has been in place for 30 years, protects companies \nthat act at the request of the Government while also protecting the \nprivacy of Americans' communications.\n  Some supporters of retroactively expanding this already existing \nimmunity provision argue that the telephone companies should not be \npenalized if they relied on a high-level Government assurance that the \nrequested assistance was lawful. But as superficially appealing as that \nargument may sound, it completely ignores the history of the FISA law.\n  Telephone companies have a long history of receiving requests for \nassistance from the Government. That is because telephone companies \nhave access to a wealth of private information about Americans--\ninformation that can be a very useful tool for law enforcement. But \nthat very same access to private communications means that telephone \ncompanies are in a unique position of responsibility and public trust.\n  And yet, before FISA, there were basically no rules at all to help \nthese phone companies resolve the tension between the Government's \nrequests for assistance in foreign intelligence investigations and the \ncompanies' responsibilities to their customers.\n  So this legal vacuum resulted in serious governmental abuse and \noverreaching. The abuses that took place are well documented and quite \nshocking. With the willing cooperation of the telephone companies, the \nFBI conducted surveillance of peaceful antiwar protesters, journalists, \nsteel company executives, and even Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  So Congress decided to take action. Based on the history of, and \npotential for, Government abuses, Congress decided that it was not \nappropriate--not appropriate--for telephone companies to simply assume \nthat any Government request for assistance to conduct electronic \nsurveillance was legal. Let me repeat that: A primary purpose of FISA \nwas to make clear, once and for all, that the telephone companies \nshould not blindly cooperate with Government requests for assistance.\n  At the same time, however, Congress did not want to saddle telephone \ncompanies with the responsibility of determining whether the \nGovernment's request for assistance was a lawful one. That approach \nwould leave the companies in a permanent state of legal uncertainty \nabout their obligations.\n  So Congress devised a system that would take the guesswork out of it \ncompletely. Under that system, which was in place in 2001, and is still \nin place today, the companies' legal obligations and liability depend \nentirely on whether the Government has presented the company with a \ncourt order or a certification stating that certain basic requirements \nhave been met. If the proper documentation is submitted, the company \nmust cooperate with the request and will be immune from liability. If \nthe proper documentation has not been submitted, the company must \nrefuse the Government's request, or be subject to possible liability in \nthe courts.\n  The telephone companies and the Government have been operating under \nthis simple framework for 30 years. The companies have experienced, \nhighly trained, and highly compensated lawyers who know this law inside \nand out.\n  In view of this history, it is inconceivable that any telephone \ncompanies that allegedly cooperated with the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping program did not know what their obligations \nwere. It is just as implausible that those companies believed they were \nentitled to simply assume the lawfulness of a Government request for \nassistance. This whole effort to obtain retroactive immunity is based \non an assumption that doesn't hold water.\n  That brings me to another issue. I have been discussing why \nretroactive immunity is unnecessary and unjustified, but it goes beyond \nthat. Granting companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal \nprogram this new form of automatic, retroactive immunity undermines the \nlaw that has been on the books for decades--a law that was designed to \nprevent exactly the type of actions that allegedly occurred here.\n  Remember, telephone companies already have absolute immunity if they \ncomplied with the applicable law. They have an affirmative defense if \nthey believed in good faith that they were complying with that law. So \nthe retroactive immunity provision we are debating here is necessary \nonly if we want to extend immunity to companies that did not comply \nwith the applicable law and did not even have a good faith belief that \nthey were complying with it. So much for the rule of law.\n  Even worse, granting retroactive immunity under these circumstances \nwill undermine any new laws that we pass regarding Government \nsurveillance. If we want companies to follow the law in the future, it \nsends a terrible message, and sets a terrible precedent, to give them a \n``get out of jail free'' card for allegedly ignoring the law in the \npast.\n  I find it particularly troubling when some of my colleagues argue \nthat we should grant immunity in order to encourage the telephone \ncompanies to cooperate with Government in the future. They want \nAmericans to think that not granting immunity will damage our national \nsecurity. But if you take a close look at the argument, it does not \nhold up. The telephone companies are already legally obligated to \ncooperate with a court order, and as I have mentioned, they already \nhave absolute immunity for cooperating with requests that are properly \ncertified. So the only thing we would be encouraging by granting \nimmunity here is cooperation with requests that violate the law. That \nis exactly the kind of cooperation that FISA was supposed to prevent.\n  Let's remember why. These companies have access to our most private \nconversations, and Americans depend on them to respect and defend the \nprivacy of these communications unless there is clear legal authority \nfor sharing them. They depend on us to make sure the companies are held \naccountable for betrayals of that public trust. Instead, this immunity \nprovision would invite the telephone companies to betray that trust by \nencouraging cooperation with illegal Government programs.\n  But this immunity provision does not just allow telephone companies \noff the hook for breaking the law. It also will make it that much \nharder to get to the core issue that I have been raising since December \n2005, which is that the President ran an illegal program and should be \nheld accountable. When these lawsuits are dismissed, we will be that \nmuch further away from an independent judicial review of this program.\n  Since 9/11, I have heard it said many times that what separates us \nfrom our enemies is respect for the rule of law. Unfortunately, the \nrule of law has taken it on the chin from this administration. Over and \nover, the President and his advisers have claimed the right to ignore \nthe will of Congress and the laws on the books if and when they see \nfit. Now they are claiming the same right for any entity that assists \nthem in that effort, no matter how unreasonable that assistance might \nhave been.\n  On top of all this, we are considering granting immunity when more \nthan 70 members of the Senate still--still--have not been briefed on \nthe President's wiretapping program. The majority of this body still \ndoes not even know what we are being asked to grant immunity for.\n  In sum, I cannot support this legislation. I appreciate that changes \nwere made to the Senate bill, but they are not enough. Nowhere near \nenough.\n  We have other alternatives. We have options. We do not have to pass \nthis law in the midst of a presidential election year, while George \nBush remains President, in the worst possible political climate for \nconstructive legislating in this area. If the concern is that orders \nissued under the PAA could expire as early as August, we could extend \nthe PAA for another 6 months, 9 months, even a year. We could put a 1-\nyear sunset on this bill, rather than\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nhaving it sunset in the next Presidential election year when partisan \npolitics will once again be at their worst. Or we could extend the \neffect of any current PAA orders for 6 months or a year. All of these \noptions would address any immediate national security concerns.\n  What we do not have to do and what we should not do is pass a law \nthat will immunize illegal behavior and fundamentally alter our \nsurveillance laws for years to come.\n  I have spent a great deal of time over the past year--in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and on the \nSenate floor--discussing my concerns, offering amendments, and debating \nthe possible effects of the fine print of various bills. But this is \nnot simply about fine print. In the end, my opposition to this bill \ncomes down to this: This bill is a tragic retreat from the principles \nthat have governed Government conduct in this sensitive area for 30 \nyears. It needlessly sacrifices the protection of the privacy of \ninnocent Americans, and it is an abdication of this body's duty to \nstand up for the rule of law. I will vote no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are at a critical moment. According to \nthe Mortgage Bankers, the rate of foreclosures and the percentage of \nloans in the process of foreclosure are at the highest recorded level \nsince 1979.\n  The delinquency rate for all mortgage loans on one- to four-unit \nresidential properties stood at 6.35 percent of all loans outstanding \nat the end of the first quarter of 2008. This is an increase of 151 \nbasis points from 1 year ago--a 1.5-percent increase--which is usually \nsignificant because it translates into thousands and thousands of \nAmericans who are facing foreclosure.\n  The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process was 2.47 percent \nat the end of the first quarter, more than double what it was a year \nprior.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, 5.65 percent of all loans are past \ndue, and 2.75 percent are in foreclosure.\n  That is a staggering statistic. Rhode Island has the unfortunate \ndistinction of having the highest foreclosure rate in New England and \nis fourth in the Nation for subprime foreclosures.\n  For many Rhode Islanders--in fact, the majority--their home is their \nwealth, their nest egg. Unfortunately, with such a high foreclosure \nrate, many Rhode Islanders are seeing their wealth erode as home prices \nfall. Thousands more are in default because they are no longer able to \nrefinance or sell their homes since their mortgages are now worth more \nthan the appraised value of their homes.\n  This week, the latest Case-Schiller home price index was released. \nHome prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas in April fell by 15.3 percent \nfrom a year earlier, signaling that the housing recession is not over. \nIn fact, it continues unabated.\n  More foreclosures will further exacerbate the overall decline in \nproperty values and have a dramatic and drastic effect on entire \ncommunities. It is clear that this vicious cycle in the mortgage and \nhousing markets is negatively impacting the entire economy.\n  In addition, as a result of the credit crunch in the mortgage \nmarkets, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now the largest player in the \nsecondary housing market. Combined, they are purchasing and \nsecuritizing almost 80 percent of the mortgage market right now and \nalmost single-handedly are keeping mortgage credit flowing throughout \nthe country.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are at a critical juncture, and we need to \nmake sure they are well capitalized and overseen by a strong and \nindependent regulator with more bank-like regulatory authorities.\n  Finally, we do not just have a credit crunch and a mortgage meltdown, \nwe also have a continuing and persistent affordable housing crisis in \nthis country. The irony is, we had an affordable housing crisis when \nprices were going up because people were being squeezed out of rental \nproperties. Rents were going up. People were being squeezed because \nthere was a real demand for upscale housing and not the same kind of \ndemand in the private market for affordable housing.\n  As the housing market declines, people are also squeezed. People lost \ntheir homes and are moving into apartments. The activity to build and \ndevelop affordable housing has not picked up at all. So we have the \nsituation where we also have to deal with affordable rental housing in \nparticular. In the wake of the foreclosure crisis, all of these factors \nare compounding the plight of Americans across the board. Homeowners \nare losing their homes, low-income Americans are struggling to find \nproperties to rent, and homeowners have seen the value of their housing \ninvestment--which represented their plans for the future and the future \nof their children--all being radically rewritten as we speak because of \na decline in the price of houses. We have seen for the first time a \nreversal in what had been a positive trend in home ownership. That is \nnow declining.\n\n  So I think we are working hard to try to respond to all these issues. \nHow do we inhibit, prevent, as much as we can, this drumbeat of \nforeclosures? How do we provide support for families who are looking \nfor affordable housing? How do we do it in a conscientious way and also \nstrengthen the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac? I think we have achieved that in this legislation, and now the \ntime is to move forward. That is why I am encouraging all of my \ncolleagues to support the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.\n  This bill includes the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act, \nwhich will allow us to create a world-class regulator for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, the housing \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises. This regulator will have broad, new \nauthorities to ensure the safe and sound operations of all these \ninstitutions. These powers will include establishing capital standards, \nsetting prudential management standards, enforcing orders through \ncease-and-desist authority, civil monetary penalties and also the \nauthority to remove officers and directors, restricting asset growth \nand capital distribution for those institutions which are \nundercapitalized. It can place a regulated entity into receivership, \nand it can review and approve new product offers. All of these are the \npowers which we have extended historically to bank regulators, and now \nthese powers are being extended to the regulator of three of the most \nprominent financial institutions in the country, although their focus \nis on housing exclusively, or generally.\n  This legislation expands the number of families Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae can serve by raising the loan limits in high-cost areas to \n150 percent of the conforming loan limit. It also significantly \nenhances the housing component of the GSEs' mission.\n  It includes provisions I authored that will dramatically expand \nFannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing mission by creating a \nnew housing trust fund and capital magnet fund, financed by annual \ncontributions from the enterprises, which will be used for the \nconstruction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. We expect \nthese programs to eventually provide between $500 million to $1 billion \nper year for the development of housing for low-income families. These \naffordable housing contributions are obtained by requiring Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac to set aside less than half a cent on each dollar of \nunpaid principal balance of the enterprises' total new business \npurchases. Eventually, 75 percent of the funds collected will be used \nfor the affordable housing trust fund and 25 percent will be allocated \nfor the payment of Government bonds to keep the bill deficit neutral.\n  I was very pleased to have worked out a compromise with all my \ncolleagues, particularly Senators Dodd and Shelby, that would allow the \nHOPE for Homeowners Program--the\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nprogram Senator Dodd has taken the lead in crafting which will resolve \nor attempt to resolve some of these foreclosure difficulties--to be a \nmandatory program that is deficit neutral and would not require any \npayments from the Federal taxpayers because it would use the proceeds \nfrom the Federal housing fund in the first 2 years to pay for this \nforeclosure program. I think this program is a great way to accomplish \nmany of the objectives we have. First, we do want to help people facing \nforeclosure, but we also do not want to necessarily engage taxpayer \nfunds in that process. This arrangement accomplishes those two \nobjectives.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I introduced a bill in November to \nimprove the mission of the GSEs that would, in fact, allocate all the \nmoney to affordable housing. The bill before us would help this \naffordable housing mission, but it would also allow, as I have said, \nfor the first 2 years, to allocate some of the resources to Senator \nDodd's proposal to prevent and assist in the foreclosure process.\n  Once we have the foreclosure program up and running, then, after 2 \nyears, the resources will be devoted to affordable housing, with 65 \npercent being used to create a permanent housing trust fund. The \nhousing trust fund will be managed by the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development, and it would distribute these funds to States via a \nformula. At least 75 percent of the funds distributed to the States \nmust be targeted to extremely low-income families.\n  Thirty-five percent of the affordable housing funds will be allocated \nto a capital magnet fund and will be used by the Secretary of the \nTreasury to run a competitive grant program to attract private capital \nfor and increase investment in affordable housing. Applicants for \nfunding will need to show they can leverage the funding by at least 10 \nto 1. We believe this will result in the creation of many more units of \naffordable housing than could be done otherwise. What we are requiring \nthese applicants to do is to enlist private capital in a ratio of at \nleast 10 to 1 to match the public capital and increase significantly \nthe scope of these programs and to house many more Americans. I think \nthis is a great way to incentivize and challenge private capital to \ncome into the field of affordable housing and to put more Americans in \ndecent, affordable rental housing.\n  The mission improvement section of the bill also strengthens Fannie \nMae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing goals. In particular, it \nwould align their goals regarding the purchase of affordable mortgages \nwith current Community Reinvestment Act income targeting definitions \nand ensure that these enterprises provide liquidity to both ownership \nand rental housing markets for low- and very low-income families. We \nwant to make sure we target these resources to those Americans \nparticularly struggling in a very difficult economy--low- and very low-\nincome Americans.\n  The legislation requires the enterprises to serve a variety of \nunderserved markets, such as rural areas, manufactured housing, and \naffordable housing preservation. It improves reporting requirements for \naffordable housing activities, including expansion of a public-use \ndatabase, and strengthens the new regulator's ability to enforce \ncompliance with these housing goals.\n  All of these affordable housing provisions are premised on the fact \nthat with Fannie and Freddie's Government benefits come many important \nresponsibilities to the public.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this legislation also contains a bill \nauthorized by Senator Dodd called the HOPE for Homeowners Act. I wish \nto commend him for his hard work in crafting these provisions and also \ncommend him for the judicious way he has managed this legislation.\n  In the last several weeks, this legislation has called for very \ncritical judgments about procedures and timing and substance. On every \none of those occasions, Senator Dodd, working closely with Senator \nShelby, has made some remarkable, wise, and judicious judgments, and I \ncommend him for that--both of them, and for their stewardship of this \nlegislation.\n  Now, this legislation Senator Dodd is proposing, the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act, would create a new temporary, voluntary program within \nthe Federal Housing Administration to back FHA-insured mortgages to \ndistressed borrowers. The program is vitally important and could not \ncome at a more important time.\n  Two weeks ago, the OCC--the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency--put out a report documenting the scope of the failure of the \nBush administration's efforts to stem the mortgage crisis. The \nadministration has been relying on a voluntary industry effort called \nHOPE Now. HOPE Now has been reporting that it has produced in excess of \n1 million loan modifications through this program. They have had events \nto tout it in the public and the press. They always mention this \nnumber.\n  The credibility of the HOPE Now numbers has been under attack for a \nwhile, primarily because they are self-reported numbers and because \nHOPE Now includes in its numbers ``payment plans,'' which are not loan \nmodifications but only delay troubled home borrowers. Apparently, the \nregulators themselves have begun to feel a little uncomfortable, and \nthe OCC decided to do its own report with its own numbers. They \nreported that voluntary mortgage industry efforts have resulted in only \n52,000 loan modifications out of 3 million seriously delinquent loans.\n\n  In addition to the 3 million seriously delinquent loans--loans over \n60 days or in bankruptcy or foreclosure--there are also 1.5 million \nforeclosures in process, and new foreclosures initiated during the same \nperiod total almost 300,000. In effect, foreclosures are running six \ntimes ahead of loan-modification efforts. Looking at it another way, \nloan modifications are less than 2 percent of seriously delinquent \nloans and only about 3 percent of foreclosures.\n  It is clear that the administration's argument that no new action is \nneeded has been proven wrong. The OCC data also clearly demonstrates \nthat helping mitigate the effects of this mortgage mess cannot be left \ncompletely up to the mortgage industry and voluntary efforts. ``Fuzzy \nmath'' and a lack of transparency are what got us into this mess. It \nshould not be used to try to cover up the fact that there is still a \nmajor problem.\n  That is why Senator Dodd's HOPE for Homeowners Program is so \nimportant. It is going to enable approximately 400,000 homeowners to \nrefinance into 30-year fixed mortgage products with FHA mortgage \ninsurance. Many of these homeowners have no other financing option \nsince their homes are now worth less than their mortgage. They are \n``underwater.''\n  Any lender who participates in the HOPE Program Senator Dodd is \nadvancing will have to write down the value of the mortgage to 90 \npercent of the current appraised value of the home. They will write off \nthe loss, and then the new loan for the homeowner will have to be for \n30 years at a fixed rate and with FHA mortgage insurance. In exchange \nfor getting a new loan with built-in equity, homeowners will have to \nshare future appreciation equally with the FHA.\n  The intent of the legislation is to set a floor on lender losses \nwhile at the same time putting families into 30-year fixed rate \nmortgages that will allow them to keep their homes. This legislation, \nwe hope, will help stabilize the housing markets in parts of the \ncountry that need the help the most.\n  In addition, most of the provisions from the Foreclosure Prevention \nAct of 2008 that passed the Senate by a vote of 88 to 8 on April 10 are \nincluded in this legislation. This section of the bill contains the \nBanking Committee's legislation to modernize, streamline, and expand \nthe reach of the FHA mortgage insurance program.\n  The FHA modernization section includes provisions I authored that \nwould expand access to home ownership counseling, provide for \ntechnology and staffing improvements at FHA, and update the FHA Home \nEquity Conversion Mortgage--HECM--Program, allowing seniors to safely \ntap into the equity of their home for other necessary expenses.\n  The FHA loan limit is increased from 95 percent to 110 percent of \narea median home price, with a cap at 150 percent of the GSE limit in \nhigh-cost areas, which currently will be $625,000. This should allow \nfamilies in older areas of the country to access home\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\nownership through FHA. It also requires a downpayment of at least 3.5 \npercent for any FHA loan.\n  In addition, the Foreclosure Prevention Act section of the bill \nprovides $3.92 billion in funding to communities hardest hit by \nforeclosure and delinquencies to purchase foreclosed homes at a \ndiscount and rehabilitate or redevelop the homes to stabilize \nneighborhoods and stem the significant losses in house values of \nneighboring homes. It also contains $150 million in additional funding \nfor housing counseling.\n  It contains some important provisions to help our returning soldiers \navoid foreclosure by lengthening the time a lender must wait before \nstarting the foreclosure process and providing the veterans--soldiers, \nsailors, marines, airmen of the current conflict--with 1 year of relief \nfrom increases in mortgage interest rates. In addition, the Department \nof Defense is required to establish a counseling program to ensure \nthese veterans can access assistance if facing financial difficulties. \nThe legislation also increases the VA loan guarantee amount, so that \nveterans have additional home ownership opportunity.\n  I am also pleased that the bill contains a provision I authored in my \nbill, S. 2153, to amend the Truth in Lending Act to improve home loan \ndisclosures. This provision will ensure that consumers are provided \nwith timely and meaningful disclosures in connection with not just home \npurchases but also for loans that refinance a home or provide a home \nequity line of credit. The bill requires that mortgage disclosures be \nprovided within 3 days of application and no later than 7 days prior to \nclosing. This should allow borrowers to shop for another mortgage if \nthey are not satisfied with the terms. If the terms of the loan change, \nthe consumer must be notified 3 days before closing of the changed \nterms.\n  If consumers apply for adjustable rate or variable rate payment \nloans, there will now be an explicit warning on the 1-page Truth in \nLending Act form that the payments will change depending on the \ninterest rate and an estimate of how those payments will change under \nthe terms of the contract based on the current interest rate. The bill \nalso provides a new disclosure that informs borrowers of the maximum \nmonthly payments possible under their loan. The bill provides the right \nto waive the early disclosure requirements if the consumer has a bona \nfide financial emergency that requires they close the loan quickly and \nincreases the range of statutory damages for TILA violations from the \ncurrent $200 to $2,000 to a range of $400 to $4,000.\n\n  Finally, it requires lenders to include a statement that the consumer \nis not obligated on the mortgage loan just because they received the \ndisclosures. This will give consumers the opportunity to truly shop \naround for the best mortgage terms for the first time ever. They will \nbe able to compare the payments and costs associated with a certain \nloan product and decide not to sign on the dotted line if they do not \nlike the basic terms of the loan.\n  I believe that giving consumers the information they need regarding \nthe maximum payment is absolutely critical. Borrowers need to better \nunderstand the full financial impact of entering into a particular loan \nearly in the process and before they actually consummate the loan.\n  There are many borrowers today who signed up for a loan with teaser \nrates with a monthly payment they could well afford and then were \nshocked 18 months later to get the adjusted rates that were staggering \nto them and were, for many, unaffordable. Many in good faith relied on \nwhat they thought would be the initial introductory loan. I do not \nthink they should be in that position. I think all the details, the \nmaximum loan amount under the current rate should be available upfront, \nnot hidden in a pile, literally a foot high, of closing documents.\n  They also have to have a chance to back out of the loan, if the terms \nare not acceptable to them, before closing the loan at the conference \nroom table.\n  I am pleased my Republican colleagues have agreed with the need to \nimprove mortgage disclosures also.\n  Finally, this legislation includes some important tax provisions that \nshould enhance and strengthen the low-income housing tax credit program \nand the mortgage revenue bond program. It also has a refundable first-\ntime home buyer credit of up to $8,000 to help reduce the stock of \nexisting unoccupied housing and a nonitemizer tax deduction for State \nand local property taxes from Federal income tax.\n  It is my hope this legislation will help more families to refinance \nout of bad loans, help stabilize the housing market, and improve the \nlaws and regulations so this type of foreclosure crisis never happens \nagain.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I wish to particularly thank \nChairman Dodd and Senator Shelby for including a number of bills and \ninitiatives that I have been working on in the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act that is before us today, and I hope we are going to be \nable to pass this important legislation in very short order.\n  The American people need a lot more than the current HOPE Now \nprogram, they need help now. I encourage all my colleagues, we should \nmove forward deliberately--today, I hope--on this important legislation \nand send it to our colleagues in the House.\n  I know Chairman Frank and his colleagues have done a remarkable job \non their side to pass legislation that is very close to ours. Together, \nwe should be able to send something to the President that he will, I \nhope, sign and will send a message to the American people that hope is \nnot just a fiction of rhetoric, but it is a reality--and not just hope, \nbut help is on the way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was going to be my first unanimous consent request. \nMy second one would be I ask consent that I be recognized following the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          County Payments Act\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the increasingly dire \nneed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act of 2000. It is commonly called the County Payments \nAct. We also need to fully fund the payment in lieu of taxes \nprovisions, otherwise commonly called PILT funding.\n  One hundred years ago, legislation was enacted to provide for the \nreturn of a percentage of the U.S. Forest Service gross receipts to the \nStates to assist counties that are home to our national forests with \nschool and road services. The reason for this legislation was that \nthese States, where there are very high percentages of Federal \nownership of property, have a much smaller property tax base for their \ncommunities. Particularly, many of these rural communities exist in \ncounties where most of the county--in some counties in Idaho over 90 \npercent of the county--is owned by the Federal Government. They have \nvirtually no property base. Yet they have all the other issues that \ncome with the land base to deal with in their counties--schools, roads, \nlaw enforcement, and the like. It was recognized that since the Federal \nGovernment was immune from paying property taxes, the Federal \nGovernment--which was the beneficiary from these counties and which had \nsuch significant land holdings in these counties--should provide some \nkind of compensation to the counties as an alternative to property \ntaxes, which they would pay if they were not the Federal Government and \nexempt from paying those taxes. That is where you get the payment in \nlieu of taxes, or PILT payment. The Secure Rural Schools and County \nSelf-Determination Act was something that followed up on the PILT \nlegislation. Without these funds, many rural communities that neighbor \nnational forests would be unable to fully meet school and road needs of \nlocal communities. In recent years, however, timber receipts have \neroded\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\nto the point where the Federal obligation to local rural communities is \nnot met through these receipts alone.\n  To compensate for the shortfall and to prevent the loss of essential \ncounty schools and roads infrastructure, Congress enacted the Secure \nRural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. This law has \nprovided assistance to communities whose regular Forest Service and \nBureau of Land Management receipt-sharing payments have declined \nsignificantly. Unfortunately, it expired at the end of 2006. While \nfunding to continue the program for 2007 was thankfully included in \nlast year's emergency supplemental, this funding has run out.\n  I stood on the floor of this Senate almost 5 months ago asking my \ncolleagues to make this overdue extension and funding a top priority or \nCongress. However, this extension has still not been achieved, and \ncounties and school districts that were facing job losses 5 months ago \nare in an increasingly more difficult situation. People are losing \ntheir jobs and families across the Nation are being impacted. The \neducation of children across this Nation is being affected. This is \nunacceptable.\n  In April, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators who sent a letter \nto the Senate Appropriations Committee seeking the inclusion of an \nextension and funding for the Secure Rural Schools and Self-\nDetermination Act of 2000 in the Fiscal Year 2008 Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act. The Emergency Supplemental that was \npassed by the Senate last month contained $400 million to continue \ncounty payments for another year. This funding would ensure the \ncontinued assistance for rural communities struggling to provide \nnecessary services in areas with large amounts Federal land. This \nbridge funding is essential to ensure the continuation of needed school \nservices in rural communities throughout the country while work \ncontinues on a longer term extension. I understand that unfortunately \nthis funding was stripped out of the supplemental in negotiations \nbetween the House and the administration.\n  I remind this body that a multiple year extension and funding for \ncounty payments and PILT has the overwhelming support of a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate. In fact, 74 Senators voted in favor of an \namendment to provide a mu1ti-year extension and funding in last year's \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. However, as previously \nmentioned, this extension was pared back to one-year funding in the \nversion that came out of conference and was enacted into law. Now, \nthere is no funding and far less time.\n  What does a failure to extend the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Act mean? It means the loss of more than 20,000 \ncounty and school employee jobs across the Nation. It means nearly \n7,000 teachers and educational staff are estimated to lose their jobs. \nMore than 100 teaching positions in Idaho alone will likely be \naffected. It means that 600 counties and more than 4,000 school \ndistricts in 42 States will not have the funds to fully provide needed \nservices. It means incredible uncertainty to rural communities, \ncounties, and families across the Nation during these difficult \neconomic times. It means more than 8,000 road miles will not be \nmaintained in Idaho alone. It means children in rural communities will \nhave decreased access to quality education.\n  To help visualize the impact on rural communities of a failure to \nextend the program, I want to share some Idaho examples that were \nshared with me from my constituents: Shoshone County, ID, with a \npopulation of 15,000, expects 15 school instructional staff and as much \nas 55 percent of the county's road department employees to be affected. \nIn Boise County, with a population of close to 7,000, the Road and \nBridge Department will have to lay off the majority of its employees--\none half to three-fourths of the employees--within 1 year and only \nperform those activities that are necessary to public safety. \nClearwater County, with a population of approximately 8,000, faces the \nloss of more than $500,000, which will greatly impact public safety \nbecause of lost services for road maintenance and law enforcement. I am \ntold that Boundary County, with a population of 11,000, will not be \nable to blacktop roads and will have to let them deteriorate to gravel-\nbased roads. We simply cannot allow this to occur in any State in this \nNation.\n  Congress needs to demonstrate it is serious about getting this done. \nFamilies in rural communities across this Nation deserve no less. It is \nshameful that Congress may be recessing once again and Members will be \nheading home to their home States without passing an extension. The \nword disappointing is an understatement. This puts services in rural \ncommunities across this Nation in jeopardy, and it is simply wrong. We \nall need to work together to make this more of a priority. Over the \nyears, this has been a bipartisan effort, and that simply must \ncontinue. This takes the commitment of all of us, including \nadministration, House and Senate leadership to get this done.\n  I understand that other domestic spending has been included in the \nsupplemental. I won't for a second diminish the need for those funds, \nbut I must point out that county payments are vitally important and \ndeserve to be included in the supplemental as well. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to press for the inclusion of county payment \nfunds. In December, Senators Craig, Smith, Murkowski, McCaskill, Dole, \nStevens and Bennett joined me in urging the Senate leadership to attach \na reauthorization of county payments and PILT funding to any \nlegislative vehicles expected to be enacted before Congress concluded \nwork for the year.\n  I continue to believe, as I did then, that we must pursue every \nopportunity to achieve enactment and attach an extension to every \nmoving legislative vehicle. The counties of the United States which \nhost our Federal properties are not allowed by Federal law to impose \nproperty tax on them for the services that those properties require.\n  This legislation honorably and fairly has met these responsibilities \nover the years until the last few years when Congress has struggled so \nhard to find its way through to extension and funding of these \nimportant needs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to act quickly, to act now, and to assure \nthat we give the necessary priority to this county funding to get us \npast this crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have received a request that the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, wishes to be \nrecognized upon the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond be recognized upon the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have an ongoing debate on the whole \nquestion of FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Since the \nbeginning of this debate, I have opposed legislation that does not \nprovide some kind of accountability for the 6 years of illegal \nwarrantless wiretapping that was started and, in fact, approved by this \nadministration.\n  The bill that has been presented to the Senate, as it stands now, \nabsent any amendments, seems intended to result in the dismissal of \nongoing cases against the telecommunication carriers that participated \nin the warrantless wiretapping program. It would lead to the dismissal \nof the cases without allowing a court ever to review whether the \nprogram itself was legal.\n  So the bill would have the effect of ensuring that this \nadministration, the administration that decided to carry out the \nillegal wiretapping, is never called to answer for its actions, and \nnever held accountable in a court of law. I cannot support that result.\n  It is now almost 7 years since the President began an effort to \ncircumvent the law in violation of the provisions of the governing \nstatute, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  I have said I believe that the conduct was illegal. In running its \nprogram of warrantless surveillance, the administration relied on \nresult-oriented legal opinions. These opinions were prepared in secret. \nThey were shown only to a tiny group of like-minded officials. This \nensured, of course, that the administration received not independent \nlegal advice, but the legal advice that it had predetermined it wanted.\n  A former head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel \ndescribed this program as a ``legal mess.''\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\nAnd this administration wants to make sure no court ever reviews this \nlegal mess.\n  The bill presented to the Senate seems designed to ensure that they \nare going to get their wish. The administration worked very hard to \nensure that Congress could not effectively review the program or the \nbasis for its arguments for immunity.\n  Since the existence of the program became known through the press, \nthe Judiciary Committee has repeatedly tried to obtain access to \ninformation its members needed so we could evaluate the \nadministration's legal arguments, which are squarely under the \njurisdiction of our committee.\n  Indeed, Senator Specter, when he was the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, prepared subpoenas to telecommunication carriers to obtain \nthis information. He wanted information from the telecommunications \ncarriers because the administration would not tell us directly what it \nhad done. But those subpoenas sought by a Republican chairman were \nnever issued.\n  As Senator Specter himself has explained publicly, Vice President \nCheney intervened with other Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee to undercut Senator Specter, and, of course, the Vice \nPresident then succeeded in blocking the subpoenas.\n  It was only just before the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees' \nconsideration of this bill that the Judiciary Committee members finally \nobtained access to some of the documents we had sought. I remind you, \nthough, that most Members of this Chamber, most Senators called upon to \nvote, have not seen those documents. I have seen them, and I would hope \nthat they would be made available to every Senator.\n  The Senators who have seen them have drawn very different \nconclusions. But no matter what conclusion you reach, you ought to get \naccess to the documents so that you can make an informed judgment.\n  I will not discuss the documents that are still held in secret, but I \nwill talk about the public reports. There are public reports that at \nleast one telecommunications carrier refused to comply with the \nadministration's request to cooperate with the warrantless wiretapping. \nAll Senators should have had the opportunity to know those facts so \nthey can make informed judgments whether there were legal claims that \nother carriers should have raised.\n  It is also clear that the Bush-Cheney administration did not want the \nSenate to evaluate the evidence and be able to draw its own \nconclusions. They wanted to avoid accountability.\n  Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, with all of the \nwork it has done on this issue, has not conducted a review of the \nlegality of the warrantless wiretapping program.\n  Now, I am not here to try to get the telephone companies. According \nto public reports, at least one company said no, presumably because it \nfeared that by complying it would break the law. Other phone companies, \naccording to the public statements, apparently believed they were doing \nwhat was best for their country. I am not out to get them.\n  In fact, I would have supported legislation to have the Government \nindemnify the telecommunications carriers for any liability incurred at \nthe behest of the Government. As I said, it is not a case of going \nafter the phone companies; I want accountability.\n  I supported alternative efforts by Senator Specter and Senator \nWhitehouse to substitute the Government for the defendants in these \ncases. In other words, take the phone companies out and substitute the \nGovernment so the cases can proceed to a determination on the merits.\n  These alternatives would have allowed judicial review of the legality \nof the administration's acts--I think it is clear that the \nadministration's actions were illegal--then let a court determine who \nwas responsible for those actions.\n\n  This bill does not provide that accountability. As I read the \nlanguage of the bill, it is designed to have the courts dismiss the \npending cases if the Attorney General simply certifies to the court \nthat the alleged activity was the subject of a written request from the \nAttorney General, and that request indicated the activity was \nauthorized by the President and determined to be lawful.\n  In other words, if the Attorney General said: Well, I do not care \nwhat the law says, I have determined that the President does not have \nto follow the law. If the Attorney General says, in effect, \nnotwithstanding the rule of law in this country, this President is \nabove the law, so, therefore, nothing he does is illegal. These kinds \nof baseless legal conclusions could form the basis for immunity under \nthis scheme.\n  That is really what this bill provides. That concerns me, as it \nshould concern everybody. We should not be dismissing Americans' claims \nthat their fundamental rights were violated based on the mere assertion \nof a party in interest that what it did was lawful.\n  Think about it: this would be like a police officer catching someone \ncommitting a burglary and saying: I am going to arrest you for \nburglary. And the burglar sitting there with a bag of burglary tools, \nhaving broken in the door, saying: You cannot do that because I thought \nabout this breaking and entering. I decided that in my case it is not \nillegal. And then the police officer has to say: Gee, I am sorry for \nthe inconvenience, sir, go on your merry way.\n  That is what we are saying. Or actually, it is even worse than that. \nIt is as if they actually arrested that burglar, they brought him into \ncourt, and the burglar stands up and says: Your Honor, I determined all \nby myself--disregarding you, Your Honor; disregarding the evidence, I \ndetermined all by myself--that even though I was involved in a \nburglary, I should not even be subject to the court's jurisdiction \nbecause I say that what I did was legal. Goodbye, Your Honor. Have a \nnice day. I am leaving.\n  That is what we are doing with this bill. In fact, there is not even \na determination by the current Attorney General that the wireless \nwiretapping program was lawful, perhaps because he could not make such \na determination. But all he has to do to ensure immunity is to certify \nthat the phone company acted at the behest of the administration and \nthat the administration indicated that the activity was determined to \nbe lawful.\n  Regardless of whether or not it actually was lawful, all the Attorney \nGeneral has to say is that it was determined to be lawful. We are not \ngoing to tell you when that determination was made. We are not even \ngoing to tell you whether the people who made that determination went \nto law school. It is lawful because the President is above the law; \ntherefore, we are off the hook.\n  I believe the rule of law is important. I do not believe any one of \nus, the 100 of us in this body, is above the law. I have been here with \nsix Presidents. I do not believe any one of them, Republican or \nDemocratic Presidents, is above the law. I do not believe Congress \nshould try to put a President above the law and seek to take away the \nonly viable avenue for Americans to seek redress for harm to their \nprivacy and liberty, and the only viable avenue of accountability for \nthe administration's lawlessness.\n  Why should we, the United States Senate, the conscience of the \nNation, why should we sit here and say: We are going to condone \nlawlessness, and even more importantly, we 100 people, acting on behalf \nof 300 million other Americans, are saying: We are never even going to \nlet you know who committed the unlawful acts and why.\n  Now, I recognize this legislation also contains important \nsurveillance authority. I support this new authority. I worked for \nyears to craft legislation that provides that important authority along \nwith appropriate protections for privacy and civil liberties. I have \nvoted for dozens of changes in the FISA legislation to be able to help \nour intelligence agencies.\n  In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee, under my leadership, \nreported such a bill last fall. So I commend House Majority Leader \nHoyer and Senator Rockefeller, who negotiated this legislation, for \nincorporating several additional protections to bring it closer to the \nbill we voted out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I note, in particular, the requirement of an inspector general review \nof this administration's warrantless wiretapping program. It is a \nprovision I have advocated at every single meeting we have had, open or \nclosed, through the course of the consideration of these matters. This \nreview will provide for a\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\ncomprehensive examination of the relevant facts about this program.\n  Actually, it should prove useful to the next President. I believe we \nshould have still more protections for privacy and civil liberties. If \nthis bill becomes law I will work with the next administration on \nadditional protections. Despite some improvements to the surveillance \nauthorities the bill authorizes, improvements I support, I will not \nsupport this legislation. The administration broke the law. They \nviolated FISA by conducting warrantless surveillance for more than 5 \nyears, and they got caught. Now they want us to cover their actions. \nThey want us to say: That's OK. Even though we don't know which one of \nyou decided to break the law, we are going to let you all off the hook. \nThe apparent purpose of title II of this bill is to ensure that they \nwill not be held to account. That is wrong. I will, therefore, oppose \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the measure. If the Senate proceeds \nto the bill, I will then support amendments to its unaccountability \nprovisions, including an amendment to strike the immunity provisions. \nBut if those are not successful, I will have to vote against it.\n  The bottom line is this: In America, nobody should be above the law. \nOne thing unites every single Senator. We want to keep our great and \ngood country safe. We all want to stop terrorists. We have spent \nhundreds of billions of dollars to do that. We have procedures to do \nthat. But one of the principles of this country and something we have \nalways preached to other countries is, that in good times and bad \ntimes, we follow the law. We did this during two world wars, in the \nRevolutionary War and in the Civil War.\n  I am imploring the Senate not to turn its back on over 200 years of \nhistory of following the law and saying, in this situation, we are \ngoing to condone an administration that broke the law. I cannot vote \nfor that. I cannot in good conscience vote for that. I cannot be true \nto my own oath of office and vote for that. Certainly, I would not want \nto tell the people of Vermont I voted for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \nremarks, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, be recognized, \nand that she be followed by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while my good friend from Vermont was on the \nfloor, I thought he raised some good questions. I believe we have good \nanswers for those questions. I know of his dedication and commitment to \nthe rule of law and accountability, his very distinguished service as \nhead of the Judiciary Committee. But there are several things I would \npoint out.\n  No. 1, we have been working on this entire issue of the President's \nterrorist surveillance program for better than a year now. We have \nreviewed all of the documents. We have had all of the people who \nadministered the program, who have given opinions on it, come in. I \ndispute his statement that there were 6 years of unlawful activity of \nthe President. He said no court will be able to review the illegality; \nno independent officials have reviewed it.\n  First, it is my understanding, although I was not one of them, that \nthe big eight at the time--that is, the Republican and Democratic \nleaders of the House and the Senate and the leaders of their \nIntelligence Committees--were briefed on this program before it \nstarted. I don't know the substance of the briefing. I would imagine \nthat they told them the problems in the existing old FISA law would \nmake it difficult to implement that law, given the new technology \nwhich, in fact, was the case. In any event, it went forward.\n  When the program was finally disclosed and briefed to the \nIntelligence Committee, I spent a good bit of time reviewing that. I \nhave studied constitutional law and made constitutional law arguments \nbefore. I believe if my friends who have questions about it will check \nthe Constitution and the appellate court's interpretation of article \nII, they will find that they assume the President does have power to \ncollect foreign intelligence information as an adjunct to his \nresponsibility to conduct foreign affairs.\n  There is no question that Congress cannot pass a law abrogating that \nconstitutional right. As a matter of fact, in one of the released \ncases, one of the cases made public by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, or FISC, they noted that Congress could not \nabrogate that constitutional right. It would be unconstitutional. For \nthose who raise the test of the steel cases, I don't necessarily accept \nthat test, that the enactments of Congress can affect the measure of \ncredibility and extent of the President's power. The Congress did pass \nthe authorization for the use of military force prior to the imposition \nof the terrorist surveillance program. We had access to the documents. \nBased on review of the documents, the Senate Intelligence Committee, by \na vote of 13 to 2, passed out the bill which is the essential framework \nthat is before us.\n  The courts can review to see that there are certifications by the \nAttorney General, directives by the President, and only if they find no \nsubstantial evidence to support that, then the suits will be dismissed.\n  My friend from Vermont said we ought to substitute the Government for \nthe phone company for judicial review. There is another provision in \nthe bill he should understand. If you want to sue the Government, there \nis no ban in this bill on suing the Government or suing Government \nofficials. That can go forward. That is not affected by this bill. \nThere has been extensive discussion over the legality of it. For those \nwho wish to have a trial on the legality of the program, there are \nother means still available. To penalize a phone company or other \ncarrier which, in good faith reliance on a representation of the \nAttorney General and the President of the United States, carried out a \nprogram that I believe is lawful to protect American citizens, I think \nis totally unwarranted.\n  Let me describe today for my colleagues and for those who may be \ninterested this long and difficult process which I believe has finally \naccomplished its goal. This week we have a chance to tell the American \npeople that the intelligence community on which our citizens, our \ntroops, and our allies rely to keep us safe from terrorists and other \nforms of evil in the world can continue to do its job. We can tell \nthose companies that answered their Government's call for help in the \naftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks that a grateful nation \nstands behind them and that they will be given the civil liability \nprotection they rightly deserve.\n  I strongly support voting for cloture on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 6304, the FISA Amendments Act, this afternoon. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues not only to do the same but also to oppose any \namendments offered to it. We have finally struck a deal with the House, \nand the House honored the deal last Friday by allowing no amendments on \nthe House floor. I ask my colleagues to hold up our end of the bargain. \nWhile it is in every Senator's right to offer an amendment, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote down all amendments no matter what they may be so \nthat we may send the bill immediately to the President for signature \nand make sure we don't have further gaps in our intelligence \nsystem which could appear once again if we do not pass this in a timely \nfashion. If we send it back to the House, there is no telling when a \nfinal bill could be back here for passage.\n\n  Let me describe briefly how we got here. Approximately a year ago, \nDirector of National Intelligence ADM Mike McConnell came to Congress \nand asked that we update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nChanges in technology resulted in court rulings or interpretations that \nmade it very difficult to use electronic surveillance effectively \nagainst terrorist enemies overseas. The problem came to a head in May \n2007, with a ruling that caused significant gaps in collection. \nAlthough the DNI at the time pleaded to Congress to help, the \nleadership of Congress did not move.\n  In the looming pressure of the August recess, the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, and I cosponsored the Protect America Act which \nCongress passed the first week of August last year. The act did exactly \nwhat it\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\nwas intended to. It closed the intelligence gaps that threatened the \nsecurity of our Nation and of our troops. But it was lacking in one \nimportant aspect, as we were not able to include in it the retroactive \ncivil liability protection from ongoing frivolous lawsuits against \nthose partners who had assisted the intelligence community in the \nPresident's program.\n  Following the passage of the Protect America Act, I am proud to say \nthat Senator Rockefeller and I worked on a bipartisan basis to come up \nwith a permanent solution to modernize FISA and give those private \npartners the needed retroactive liability protection. We worked closely \nfor months with the DNI, Department of Justice, and their experts from \nthe intelligence community to ensure there would be no unintended \noperational consequences from any of the provisions included in our \nbipartisan product. In February of this year, after many hearings, \nbriefings, and a lot of debate on the Senate floor, the Senate passed \nthe FISA amendments by a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 29.\n  The bill coming out of the Senate reflected the Intelligence \nCommittee's conclusion that the electronic communication service \nproviders who assisted the President's TSP acted in good faith and \ndeserved civil liability protection from frivolous lawsuits. The Senate \nbill also went farther than any legislation in history in protecting \nthe privacy interests of American citizens or U.S. persons whose \ncommunications might be acquired through targeting overseas. It also \nrequired the FISA approval to target U.S. persons overseas, if they are \ngoing to have collection initiated against them.\n  At the end of the day, there were many difficult compromises. Both \nsides gave, and we came up with a bill that was not only bipartisan but \nthe best piece of effort we could get out of this legislative process.\n  Although the Senate passed the bill before the Protect America Act \nexpired, in the House there was a clear majority. But the leadership \ndidn't let it come up. They went on recess. In the days following the \nexpiration, private partners refused to provide intelligence \ninformation, frankly, in light of the ongoing litigation, the \ntremendous threat to their business franchise, the fact that they and, \nparticularly their shareholders, who may be retired persons depending \non pensions and others, could be losing billions of dollars in the \nmarketplace because of the size of these outrageous lawsuits seeking \nbillions of dollars, when, in my view, there was no damage and no \ngrounds for recovery. Fortunately, after several days' negotiation, the \nintelligence community was able to get the providers to resume \ncooperation, but the intelligence lost in that time was gone, and we \nwill never know what we missed because the House leadership refused to \nbring up the Senate bill.\n  Some have accused me and my colleagues of saying at the time, \nfalsely, that the sky was falling. For a few days the sky was falling \nuntil a tenuous agreement was worked out between the executive branch \nand the providers. But the agreement was all predicated upon ongoing \nwork to pass a FISA modernization law in the near term. That is another \nreason why it is vital the Senate move immediately to consider the FISA \nAmendments Act. Once the House returned from the Easter recess, my good \nfriend and fellow Missourian, majority whip Roy Blunt, and I met with \nthe House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, asking him what he thought the \nHouse needed in order to allow the Senate bill a vote on the House \nfloor. We and our staffs began discussions and sent proposals back and \nforth attempting to come together. During that time, Roy Blunt and I \nconferred repeatedly with Congressmen Hoekstra and Smith and, of \ncourse, vetted our proposals with the intelligence community.\n  Finally, after four personal meetings over 2 months--and a tremendous \namount of staff work--between Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority Whip \nBlunt, and me--Whip Blunt and I delivered a proposal to Mr. Hoyer \nbefore Memorial Day, a deadline he had set.\n  This agreement was one that had been signed off on and fully \ndiscussed with Mr. Hoekstra, the vice chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, and Lamar Smith, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. We felt this was the best offer we could make on \nbehalf of the Republicans in the House and Senate, and it was agreed to \nby the intelligence community.\n  The Memorial Day deadline, however, came and went, and again the \nHouse went on recess. Finally, after more interaction among our staffs, \nI received word 2 weeks ago that the House Democrats were ready to work \nout final language. So Leader Hoyer and Whip Blunt and I met for a \nfifth time, this time inviting my colleague, Jay Rockefeller, to join \nus in the final negotiations. On June 12, the Democratic House leaders \ngave up their idea of having a commission take a look at the \nsurveillance program, which we believe would have been political, \nfurther interfering with the work of the Intelligence Committee and \nperhaps community, and perhaps lead to increased leaks about the \nprogram.\n  They agreed on a longer sunset than in previous bills. We abandoned \nthe idea that the FISA Court should be the one to assess compliance \nwith the minimization procedures used in foreign targeting. With the \nconcessions Republicans and the administration had already made, along \nwith some minor technical fixes, I am proud to say the intelligence \ncommunity was given the flexibility and tools it needs to keep us safe. \nWe had a compromise.\n  Now, I offer all that as background so the record is clear. That \nbrings us where we are today. Once we get on the bill, I will explain \nwhat is before us, and I will explain how statements from some about \nthis legislation is nothing short of fear mongering, such as from those \nwho are saying all Americans who talk to anyone overseas will be \nlistened to by the Government. That is flat wrong.\n  Americans cannot be targeted without a court order, period. If \nsomeone overseas is targeted and talks to an American, then the \nAmerican's end of the communication is what we call minimized, which \nmeans it is hidden, protected, suppressed. I will elaborate further on \nthis. But at this time, I simply ask my colleagues to vote for cloture \nso we may move immediately to the bill.\n  I note some of my colleagues from the Senate Intelligence Committee \nare seeking recognition, and I appreciate the work all members of the \ncommittee have done. I see my colleague from Georgia, who has been an \noutstanding help, and the Senator from California, who has offered many \nuseful ideas. This has been truly a year's long work, and we are happy \nto bring the final process before the Senate today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I am next in \nthe order. I ask unanimous consent that following my presentation the \nSenator from Vermont be recognized on our side. I know Senator \nChambliss is here on the Republican side and wishes to speak.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can we \npropose a unanimous consent request that following Senator Feinstein, I \nbe recognized to speak, and then Senator Sanders will be next?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I believe that was the Senator's \nrequest.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That was the intent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I begin my remarks by thanking the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, and the vice chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, Senator Bond, the House Speaker, and the \nHouse leadership for their distinguished work on this piece of \nlegislation. This has not been easy. It is certainly not without \ncontroversy. There are some major challenges to work through.\n  I want to begin by putting my remarks, at least, in context.\n  There is no more important requirement for national security than \nobtaining accurate, actionable intelligence. At the same time, there \nhave to be strong safeguards in place to ensure that the Government \ndoes not infringe on Americans' constitutional rights.\n  Yet if Congress does not act and pass this bill, as it was passed \noverwhelmingly in the House, both of these goals,\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\nI believe, are in jeopardy. Here is why. If this bill does not pass, \nour Nation would likely be forced to either extend the Protect America \nAct or leave the Nation bare until a new bill can be written. Neither \nof these are good options.\n  As I will describe, the Protect America Act does not adequately \nprotect Americans' constitutional rights. It was written to be a \ntemporary measure for 6 months, and it expired on February 5.\n  What many people do not understand is that surveillance conducted \nunder the Protect America Act will cease by the middle of August. It \nwill be impossible to write a new bill, to get it past both Houses, to \nhave it signed by the President in time to meet this deadline.\n  If that bill expires without this Congress passing new legislation, \nwe will be unable to conduct electronic surveillance on a large number \nof foreign targets. In other words, our intelligence apparatus will be \nlaid bare and the Nation will go into greater jeopardy. I truly believe \nthat.\n  The FISA legislation of 1978 cannot accommodate this number of \ntargets. It is simply inadequate for this new task due to changes in \ntechnology and the communications industry. That is precisely why FISA \nneeds to be modernized.\n  So taking no action means we will be opening ourselves, in my view, \nto the possibility of major attack. This is unacceptable.\n  So as I see it, our choice is a clear one: We either pass this \nlegislation or we extend the Protect America Act. For me, this \nlegislation is much the better option.\n  This bill, in some respects, improves even on the base bill, the 1978 \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It provides clear protections \nfor U.S. persons both at home and abroad. It ensures that the \nGovernment cannot conduct electronic surveillance on an American \nanywhere in the world without a warrant. No legislation has done that \nup to this point.\n  I think the improvements in this bill over the Protect America Act \nand the 1978 legislation are important to understand, and I wish to \nlist a few.\n  First, prior court review. This bill ensures that there will be no \nmore warrantless surveillance. Now, why do I say this? Under the \nProtect America Act--which is expiring, but we are still collecting \nsurveillance under it for now--the intelligence community was \nauthorized to conduct electronic surveillance for a period of 4 months \nbefore submitting an application for a warrant to the FISA Court. \nSurveillance could actually proceed for 6 months before there was a \nwarrant.\n  Under this bill, the Government must submit an application and \nreceive a warrant from the FISA Court before surveillance begins. No \nmore warrantless surveillance. This is, in fact, a major point.\n  In emergency cases, there can be a short period of collection--up to \n7 days--as the application is prepared. There has been a provision for \nemergency cases under FISA for some 30 years now. So that is prior \ncourt review for a U.S. person anywhere in the world if content is \ncollected.\n  Meaningful court review. This bill strengthens court review. Under \nthe Protect America Act, the Government submitted to the FISA Court its \ndetermination that procedures were in place to ensure that only people \noutside the United States would be targeted. The court could only \nreject an application for a warrant if it found that determination to \nbe ``clearly erroneous.'' This bill returns to the traditional FISA \nstandard, empowering the court to decide whether the Government's \ndetermination is ``reasonable.'' This is a higher standard of review, \nso the court review under this bill is meaningful.\n\n  Next, minimization. These first two improvements ensure that the \nGovernment will only be targeting people outside the country. That is \ngood, but it is not enough. There is always the possibility of someone \noutside the country talking to a U.S. person inside the country. The \nbill addresses this with a process known as minimization.\n  In 1978, Congress said that the Government could do surveillance on \nU.S. persons under a court warrant, but required the Government to \nminimize the amount of information on those Americans who get included \nin the intelligence reporting. In practice, this actually means that \nthe National Security Agency only includes information about a U.S. \nperson that is strictly necessary to convey the intelligence. Most of \nthe time, the person's name is not included in the report. That is the \nminimization process.\n  If an American's communication is incidentally caught up in \nelectronic surveillance while the Government is targeting someone else, \nminimization protects that person's private information.\n  Now, the Protect America Act did not provide for court review over \nthis minimization process at all. But this bill requires the court in \nadvance to approve the Government's minimization procedures prior to \ncommencing with any minimization program. That is good. That is the \nthird improvement.\n  Fourth, reverse targeting. There is an explicit ban on reverse \ntargeting. Now, what is reverse targeting? That is the concern that the \nNational Security Agency could get around the warrant requirement. If \nthe NSA wanted to get my communications but did not want to go to the \nFISA Court, they might try to figure out who I am talking with and \ncollect the content of their calls to get to me. This bill says you \ncannot do that. You cannot reverse target. It is prohibited. This was a \nconcern with the Protect America Act, and it is fixed in this bill.\n  Those are four reasons--good reasons. Here is a fifth: U.S. person \nprivacy outside the United States. This bill does more than Congress \nhas ever done before to protect Americans' privacy regardless of where \nthey are, anywhere in the world. Under this bill, the executive branch \nwill be required to obtain a warrant any time it seeks to direct \nsurveillance at a U.S. person anywhere in the world. So any U.S. person \nanywhere in the world is protected by the requirement that a warrant \nmust be received from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nbefore electronic surveillance can begin.\n  Previously, FISA only covered people inside the United States. The \nProtect America Act did the same thing.\n  Now, also under this bill, there will be reviews of surveillance \nauthorities by the Director of National Intelligence, the Attorney \nGeneral, the heads of all relevant agencies, and the inspectors general \nof all relevant agencies on a regular basis, and the FISA Court and the \nCongress will receive the results of those reviews.\n  So there will be regular reporting from the professionals in the \narena on how this bill is being followed through on--how electronic \nsurveillance is being carried out worldwide. The Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees will receive those reports. That, too, is \nimportant.\n  Also, under this bill, there will be a retrospective review of the \nPresident's Terrorist Surveillance Program. That is the program that \nhas stirred the furor. The bill requires an unclassified report on the \nfacts of the program, including its limits, the legal justifications, \nand the role played by the FISA Court and any private actors involved. \nThis will provide needed accountability.\n  In summary, all intelligence collection under the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program will be brought under court review and court \norders.\n  Everything I have described brings this administration back under the \nlaw. There is no more Terrorist Surveillance Program. There is only \ncourt-approved, Congressionally reviewed collection.\n  But what is to keep this administration or any other administration \nfrom going around the law again? The answer is one word, and it is \ncalled exclusivity.\n  It means that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the only, \nthe exclusive, means for conducting electronic surveillance inside the \nUnited States for foreign intelligence purposes.\n  The exclusivity language in this bill is identical in substance to \nthe amendment I offered in February, which received 57 votes in this \nSenate. It is section 102 of this bill.\n  This language reiterates what FISA said in 1978, and it goes further. \nHere is what this bill says:\n  Never again will a President be able to say that his authority--or \nher authority, one day, I hope--as Commander in Chief can be used to \nviolate a law duly enacted by Congress.\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n  Never again can an Executive say that a law passed to do one thing--\nsuch as use military force against our enemies--also overrides a ban on \nwarrantless surveillance. The administration has said that the \nresolution to authorize the use of military force gave this President \nthe right to go around FISA.\n  Never again can the Government go to private companies for their \nassistance in conducting surveillance that violates the law.\n  Now, this administration has a very broad view of Executive \nauthority. Quite simply, it believes that when it comes to these \nmatters, the President is above the law. I reject that notion in the \nstrongest terms.\n  I think it is important to review the recent history with this \nadministration to demonstrate why FISA exclusivity is so important.\n  At the very beginning of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, John \nYoo, at the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in a legal opinion that:\n\n      . . . [u]nless Congress made a clear statement in the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that it sought to \n     restrict presidential authority to conduct warrantless \n     searches in the national security area--which it has not--\n     then the statute must be construed to avoid [such] a reading.\n\n  That was the argument. I believe it is wrong. Congress wrote FISA in \n1978 precisely in the field of national security; there are other, \nseparate laws that govern wiretapping in the criminal context. In fact, \nthe Department of Justice has repudiated Yoo's notion.\n  But if the Department admitted that FISA did apply, it found another \nexcuse not to take the Terrorist Surveillance Program to the FISA \nCourt.\n  The Department of Justice developed a new, convoluted argument that \nCongress had authorized the President to go around FISA by passing the \nauthorization to use military force against al-Qaida and the Taliban.\n  This is as flimsy as the last argument.\n  There is nothing in the AUMF that talks about electronic surveillance \nor FISA, and I know of not one Member who believed we were suspending \nFISA when we authorized the President to go to war.\n  But that is another argument we lay to rest with this bill. Here is \nhow we do it. We say in the language in this bill that FISA is \nexclusive. Now, here is the major part: Only a specific statutory grant \nof authority in future legislation can provide authority to the Chief \nExecutive to conduct surveillance without a FISA warrant.\n  So we go a step further in exclusivity. We cover what Yoo was trying \nto argue and what others might argue on behalf of a Chief Executive in \nthe future, by closing the loophole and saying: You need specific \nstatutory authority by the Congress of the United States to go outside \nthe law and the Constitution.\n  The final argument the President has made is that even if FISA was \nintended to apply, and even if the AUMF didn't override FISA's \nprocedures, he still had the authority as Commander in Chief to \ndisregard the law.\n  Now, I have spoken on the floor before about how the President \nbelieves he is above the law and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company \nv. Sawyer case. In that case, Justice Jackson described how the \nPresident's power is at the ``lowest ebb'' when he is acting in \ncontravention to the will of the Congress.\n  This bill, again, makes it clear that the will of Congress is that \nthere will be no electronic surveillance inside the United States \nwithout a warrant, and it makes clear that any electronic surveillance \nthat is conducted outside of FISA or outside of another express \nstatutory authorization for surveillance is a criminal act. It is \ncriminalized. This is the strongest statement of exclusivity in \nhistory.\n  The reason I am describing all this is to build a case of legislative \nintent in case this is ever litigated, and I suspect it may well be.\n  So, finally, I wish to read into the Record the comments on \nexclusivity from a June 19, 2008, letter that Attorney General Mukasey \nand Director of National Intelligence McConnell wrote to the Congress. \nThe letter recognizes that the exclusivity provision in this bill \n``goes beyond the exclusive means provision that was passed as part of \nFISA [in 1978].''\n  So they essentially admit we are taking exclusivity to a new high. \nNevertheless, they acknowledge that the provision in this bill ``would \nnot restrict the authority of the government to conduct necessary \nsurveillance for intelligence and law enforcement purposes in a way \nthat would harm national security.''\n  I said in February I could not support a bill without exclusivity. \nThis is what keeps history from repeating itself and another President \nfrom going outside the law. I believe that with this language we will \nprevent it from ever happening again.\n  Now, a comment on title II of the bill, which is the telecom immunity \nsection. This bill also creates a legal process that may--and, in fact, \nis likely to--result in immunity for telecommunications companies that \nare alleged to have provided assistance to the Government.\n  I have spent a great deal of time reviewing this matter. I have read \nthe legal opinions written by the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nDepartment of Justice. I have read the written requests to \ntelecommunications companies. I have spoken to officials inside and \noutside the Government, including several meetings with the companies \nalleged to have participated in the program.\n  The companies were told after 9/11 that their assistance was needed \nto protect against further terrorist acts. This actually happened \nwithin weeks of 9/11. I think we can all understand and remember what \nthe situation was in the 3 weeks following 9/11.\n  The companies were told the surveillance program was authorized and \nthat it was legal, and they were prevented from doing their due \ndiligence in reviewing the Government's request. In fact, very few \npeople in these companies--these big telecoms--are actually cleared to \nreceive this information and discuss it. So that creates a very limited \nuniverse of people who can do their due diligence within the confines \nof a given telecommunications company.\n\n  For the record, let me also address what I have heard some of my \ncolleagues say. At the beginning of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, \nonly four Senators were briefed. The Intelligence Committee was not, \nother than the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n  I am one who believes it is right for the public and the private \nsector to support the Government at a time of need. When it is a matter \nof national security, it is all the more important.\n  I think the lion's share of the fault rests with the administration, \nnot with the companies.\n  It was the administration who refused to go to the FISA Court to seek \nwarrants. They could have gone to the FISA Court to seek these warrants \non a program basis, and they have done so subsequently.\n  It was the administration who withheld this surveillance program from \nthe vast majority of Members of Congress, and it was the administration \nwho developed the legal theories to explain why it could, in fact, go \naround the law.\n  So I am pleased this bill includes independent reviews of the \nadministration's actions to be conducted by the inspectors general of \nthe relevant departments.\n  All of that said, when the legislation was before the Senate in \nFebruary, I stated my belief that immunity should only be provided if \nthe defendant companies acted legally, or if they acted in good faith \nwith a reasonable belief that their actions were legal. That is what \nthe law calls for.\n  I moved an amendment to require the court to review the written \nrequests to companies to see whether they met the terms of the law. \nThat law requires that a specific person send a certification in \nwriting to a telecommunications company. That certification is required \nto state that no court order is required for the surveillance, that all \nstatutory requirements have been met, and that the assistance is \nrequired by the Government.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was not adopted, but I continue to \nbelieve it is the appropriate standard.\n  Now, the pending legislation does not assess whether the request made \nby the Government was, in fact, legal, nor whether the companies had a \ngood-faith and objective belief that the requests were legal. What this \nbill does provide is a limited measure of court\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nreview. It is not as robust as my amendment would have provided, but it \ndoes provide an opportunity for the plaintiffs to be heard in court, \nand it provides an opportunity for the court to review these request \ndocuments.\n  I believe the court should not grant immunity without looking into \nthe legality of the companies' actions. So if there is an amendment \nthat does support this, I would intend to vote for it.\n  But I believe the Record should be clear in noting that if this bill \ndoes become law, in my view, it does not mean the Congress has passed \njudgment on whether any companies' actions were or were not legal. \nRather, it should be interpreted as Congress recognizing the \ncircumstances under which the companies were acting and the reality \nthat we desperately need the voluntary assistance of the private sector \nto keep the Nation secure in the future.\n  I believe this bill balances security and privacy without sacrificing \neither. It is certainly better than the Protect America Act in that \nregard, and makes improvements over the 1978 FISA law.\n  As I said, if a new bill is not in place by mid-August, the Nation \nwill be laid bare and unable to collect intelligence.\n  This bill provides for meaningful and repeated court review of \nsurveillance done for intelligence purposes. It ends, once and for all, \nthe practice of warrantless surveillance, and it protects Americans' \nconstitutional rights both at home and abroad. It provides the \nGovernment with the flexibility it needs under the law to protect our \nNation. It makes it crystal clear that this is the law of the land and \nthat this law must be obeyed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nunanimous consent agreement be amended, and that following my comments, \nSenator Sanders be recognized, and that following Senator Sanders, \nSenator Hatch be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about H.R. 6304, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act.\n  Before I do that, I wish to make a couple comments relative to the \ncomments made by my colleague from California regarding the TSP or \nterrorist surveillance program implemented by the President within days \nafter September 11, and make sure Americans are very clear about two \npoints: First of all, Congress did know about this program. Members of \nCongress were briefed throughout the duration of this program. Members \nof Congress were briefed on a regular basis. That doesn't mean every \nMember of Congress but the leadership knew exactly what was going on, \nexactly what the President was doing. They were kept very informed.\n  Secondly, the targets of the terrorist surveillance program were not \nAmericans; the program targeted the communications of al-Qaida, that we \nknew--not guessed but that the intelligence community knew were used by \nal-Qaida. Today, al-Qaida gets up every morning, just as they did \nbefore and after September 11, and they think of ways to kill and harm \nAmericans. Our intelligence community, without getting into the details \nof it, suffice it to say, has done a magnanimous job since then in \nprotecting Americans.\n  The fact that we have not suffered another attack on domestic soil \nsince then indicates the terrific job that members of the intelligence \ncommunity have done. The terrorist surveillance program that was \nimplemented by the administration immediately after September 11 is a \nmajor factor in why we have not suffered another act of terrorism on \ndomestic soil. Information gathered from the terrorist surveillance \nprogram was used rightly to disrupt terrorist activity, both \ndomestically as well as abroad. Some of the instances where the \nterrorist surveillance program has stopped attacks and saved lives are \nvery public right now.\n  Again, I rise to comment on H.R. 6304. This critical legislation has \nbeen the subject of many negotiations and, although the legislation is \nnot perfect, I am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise \nbill. I commend Vice Chairman Bond, Congressman Hoyer, and Congressman \nBlunt on their work.\n  I am satisfied that this legislation will provide our intelligence \nagencies with the legal tools necessary to perform their jobs, the \nflexibility they require, and the capability to protect Americans' \ncivil liberties. However, I am perplexed it has taken Congress this \nlong to adopt meaningful legislation necessary to protect our country; \nlegislation which Congress knew, at least since last August, needed to \nbe enacted expeditiously. Normally, Congress is accused of being guided \nby expediency rather than principle but not usually in national \nsecurity matters. Intelligence is bipartisan. Securing our Nation is \nbipartisan. It is in every American's interest that Congress act \nquickly to protect our Nation from terrorist attack, espionage, or any \nother harm. Yet the bill before us now is substantially the same as S. \n2248, which was drafted in a bipartisan nature by Senators Rockefeller \nand Bond and passed the Senate over 4 months ago, on February 12, 2008, \nwith a supermajority vote of 68 in favor and only 29 in opposition.\n  Last summer, our intelligence community officials informed us that, \nas a result of a decision by the FISA Court and changes in technology, \nthey had lost the ability to collect intelligence on terrorists around \nthe world who wish to harm the United States. Congress responded to \nthese pleas from our intelligence community and passed the Protect \nAmerica Act, which temporarily fixed this problem, but we knew then we \nhad to have a more permanent solution. Despite this knowledge and \ndespite the hard work of the Senate Intelligence Committee for the \nprevious 10 months, Congress failed to fix FISA in February. The House \nleadership refused to consider the Senate-passed bill, despite stated \nsupport from a majority of that body's members. I can only surmise that \nthere were political, rather than substantive, reasons that prevented \nthis legislation from passing months ago. Some may say this is the \nnature of one of the political branches of Government. What no one \ntalks about is the harm this has caused.\n  But, as a result of the Protect America Act's expiration, our \ncollection efforts have been degraded. The public likely is not aware, \nnor may be many Members of this Chamber, but the members on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence have heard regularly about the \ndisruptions and legal obstacles that have occurred as a result of our \ninaction. The week after the Protect America Act expired, the Director \nof National Intelligence told us that ``we have lost intelligence \ninformation this past week as a direct result of the uncertainty \ncreated by Congress' failure to act.'' Gaps in our intelligence \ncollection began to resurface, and it has had a real and negative \nimpact on our national security.\n  Our intelligence collection relies on the assistance of U.S. \ntelecommunications carriers. These communication providers are facing \nmultimillion dollar lawsuits for their alleged assistance to the \nGovernment after September 11, 2001. After the expiration of the \nProtect America Act, many providers began to delay or refuse further \nassistance. Losing the cooperation of just one provider could mean \nlosing thousands of pieces of intelligence on a daily basis. According \nto the Director of National Intelligence, uncertainty about potential \nliability caused many carriers to question whether they could continue \nto provide assistance after the expiration of the Protect America Act.\n  In just 1 week after its expiration, we lost significant amounts of \nintelligence forever. We will never be able to recover those lost \ncommunications, nor will we ever know what we missed.\n  For this reason, it is crucial that any FISA legislation include \nretrospective, as well as prospective, immunity for telecommunications \nproviders who assist the Government in securing our national security. \nTitle II of this bill, just as title II of S. 2248, provides the \nminimum protections needed for our electronic service providers. In a \ncivil suit against a communications provider, the Government may submit \na certification that any assistance provided was pursuant to a \nPresidential authorization and at the time determined to be lawful. The \ndistrict courts may review this certification, and if it finds that it \nis supported by substantial evidence, the court must dismiss\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nthe case. This is not a commentary on, or a court sanction of, the \nPresident's alleged terrorist surveillance program. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  Unlike many countries which regularly suppress an individual's speech \nor violate an individual's right to privacy, a cornerstone of our \ndemocratic and free society is a limited Government--one that doesn't \nsanction Government intrusion on an individual's private life. The \nGovernment cannot infringe upon an individual's rights without due \nprocess. But, in order to preserve those rights, Americans rely upon \nthe Government to provide that freedom and security to protect them \nfrom harm, whether it be from a criminal on the streets or from an \ninternational terrorist.\n  Under U.S. criminal law, the U.S. frequently requests the assistance \nof private citizens and companies in order to combat crime. These \ncompanies provide assistance, usually pursuant to a court order--\nbut not always--to help keep Americans safe. When assistance is needed \nto combat terrorism overseas, patriotic U.S. companies step up to the \nplate and help their country. At a minimum, these companies rely upon \nGovernment assurances that their assistance is lawful. When sued in a \ncourt, they are sometimes unable to supply a defense for their actions \nwithout exposing Government secrets or jeopardizing Government \ninvestigations. Instead, they rely on the Government to come to their \ndefense and assert Government sanction. In the case of the President's \nterrorist surveillance program--which despite leaks in the press, \nremains highly classified and secret--these companies are defenseless. \nIf the Government can show a court its assurances--still classified--\nthat the assistance was lawful, and the court determines upon \nsubstantial evidence that the company acted pursuant to a Presidential \nauthorization or other lawful means, then our American companies should \nnot be liable.\n\n  If any constitutional or privacy violation occurred, an aggrieved \nindividual may still sue the Government. This bill, however, assures \nAmerica's corporations that their good-faith assistance will not \nsubject them to frivolous lawsuits from individuals who really are \nalleging a claim against the Government, not those who assist it. \nOrdinarily, Americans should be protected against Government intrusion, \nbut it should not be at the cost of higher phone and Internet access \nbills for customers just so these corporations can defend themselves \nagainst frivolous lawsuits.\n  This legislation preserves liability protection for Americans, and I \nam pleased to see that our bipartisan, bicameral negotiators sustained \nthis provision. Title II of this legislation is largely the same as \nwhat was in the Senate-passed bill. I commend the House for passing \nlegislation including this provision and the Senate for now taking \nmuch-needed action.\n  One thing that came out of the debate on this particular aspect of \nthe bill within the Intelligence Committee was the fact that in this \nsituation it is pretty obvious that the Government was in a crisis \nsituation just following September 11. We had just been attacked by \nterrorists. We needed the assistance of private corporations in \nAmerica. When we asked for their assistance, they stepped up to the \nplate. We know it is going to happen again. It may not be a terrorist \nattack next time; it may be some other crisis that is inflicted upon \nAmerica. At that point in time, we are going to need the assistance of \nthe private sector in America again. If we don't tell the private \nsector, in this particular case, that we are going to protect them and \nmake sure they suffer no loss as a result of stepping up to help \nprotect Americans following September 11, then should we expect the \nprivate sector to step up next time, whatever the crisis may be? The \nanswer to that is obvious, and, in a very bipartisan way within the \nIntelligence Committee, there was general agreement that is the way we \nshould proceed.\n  The only real and meaningful differences between this bill and the \nSenate-passed bill are more judicial involvement in the President's \nconstitutional duty to conduct foreign affairs and protect our Nation. \nOur intelligence agencies will be allowed to collect intelligence \nagainst individuals located outside the United States, without having \nto first seek individual court orders in each instance.\n  Rather than having to seek numerous court orders and losing time and \nvaluable collection opportunities, this legislation will require a \nreasonable belief that the target is outside the United States, so our \nintelligence analysts have the ability to assess and task new \ncollection in real time; that is, before the bad guys get away, switch \nphones, and continue their planning. Unlike the Senate-passed bill, \nthis legislation requires prior court review and approval of the \ntargeting and minimization procedures submitted by the Attorney \nGeneral, our chief law enforcement and legal advisor, and the Director \nof National Intelligence, our primary national security adviser.\n  I wish to state in the record that the exigent circumstances \nprovision included in this legislation is not meant to be limited. \nRather, it is a provision necessary to allow the retention of \nintelligence gathered in those situations where prior court approval \nwas not practical.\n  Under no circumstance is it acceptable for intelligence gathered \nunder an exigent circumstance, and later found to be acceptable by the \ncourt, to be discharged. Intelligence does not wait for court orders, \nand it must be collected timely. The intelligence community should not \nhave to wait for a court order to continue collection against those who \nseek to harm America. If the court later determines that the targeting \nand certifications were lawful, then our intelligence officials should \nbe allowed to review that which was collected.\n  It is now time for us to make more permanent changes to FISA to \nensure we have the ability to obtain intelligence on terrorists and our \nadversaries. Although not a perfect bill, the FISA Amendments Act will \nfill the gaps identified by our intelligence officials and provide them \nwith the tools and flexibility they need to collect intelligence from \ntargets overseas, while at the same time providing significant \nsafeguards for the civil liberties of Americans. This bill will ensure \nthat we do not miss opportunities to target and collect foreign \nterrorist communications just because our operators had to get \npermission from a U.S. court first.\n  Let me be clear, these amendments to FISA would only apply to \nsurveillance directed at individuals who are located outside of the \nUnited States. This is not meant to intercept conversations between \nAmericans or even between two terrorists who are located within the \nUnited States. The Government still would be required to seek the \npermission of the FISA Court for any surveillance done against people \nphysically located within the United States, whether a citizen or not.\n  In fact, this legislation will provide new protections for U.S. \ncitizens under our law. Under this bill, for the first time, a court \norder must be obtained to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign \nintelligence purposes against an American who is located outside the \nUnited States. It also includes a prohibition on reverse targeting; \nthat is, our intelligence agencies will not be allowed to target an \nindividual overseas with the intent and purpose of obtaining a U.S. \nperson's communications.\n  I am satisfied that the FISA Amendments Act will close gaps in our \nintelligence collection as well as provide some legal certainty to \nthose patriotic companies that assist us. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and give our professional intelligence officials the \nconfidence they need to secure our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nstrong opposition to H.R. 6304, the FISA Amendments Act, and my \nopposition to invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to this \nlegislation.\n  Let me tell you what I think this debate is about and what it is not \nabout. What it is not about is whether anyone in the Senate or the \nCongress is not going to do everything he or she can to protect the \nAmerican people from another terrorist attack. It is not about whether \nwe are going to be as vigorous as we can in hunting down terrorists. It \nis not about whether we are going to be vigilant in the war against \nterrorism. That is what it is not about. What it is\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nabout essentially is whether we can be forceful and successful in \nfighting terrorism while we protect the constitutional rights that make \nus a free country. That is what this debate is about.\n  I happen to believe that with strong law enforcement, with a strong \nand effective judiciary, with a Congress working diligently, we can be \nvigorous and successful in protecting the American people against \nterrorism and we can do it in a way that does not undermine the \nconstitutional rights which people have fought for hundreds of years to \nprotect--the Constitution, which today remains one of the greatest \ndocuments ever written in the history of humanity.\n  We hear a whole lot about the word ``freedom.'' Everybody in the \nSenate and the House is for freedom. But what do we mean by freedom? \nWhat we mean by freedom is that we want our kids to be able to read any \nbook they want to read without worrying that the FBI is going to come \ninto a library or a bookstore to check on what they are reading. We \nwant people to be able to write letters to the editor critical of the \nPresident, critical of their Congressmen or their Senator without \nworrying that somebody is going to knock on their door. We want people \nto have the freedom to assemble, to demonstrate without worrying that \nsomeone has a camera on them and is taking notes and later on there \nwill be retribution because they exercised their freedom of assembly \nand their right to dissent.\n  That is really what the debate is about. It is not whether you are \nfor protecting the American people against a terrorist attack. That is \nnot what the debate is. The debate is whether we, as a great country, \nwill be capable of doing that within the context of our laws, within \nthe context of our Constitution, and understanding that we are a nation \nof laws and not of men, regardless of who the President is.\n  Before I go into deeper concerns, I begin by recognizing the very \nhard work done by members of both the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee in the Senate and in the House. We all know these \nare not issues resolved, and while I have strong disagreements with the \nfinal product, I know that the intentions of all the Members on both \nsides of the aisle were honorable.\n  Although there have been some improvements made to this bill that the \nSenate passed earlier this year, including having the inspector general \nreview the so-called terrorist surveillance program and making it clear \nthat FISA and criminal law are the exclusive process by which the \nelectronic surveillance can take place rather than some broad power of \nthe President, this final legislation is something I simply cannot \nsupport.\n  This legislation does not strike the right and appropriate balance \nbetween ensuring that our intelligence community has the tools it needs \nto protect our country against international terrorism and protecting \nthe civil liberties of law-abiding Americans. Instead, it gives a get-\nout-of-jail-free card to companies that may well have violated the \nprivacy and constitutional rights of millions of innocent Americans.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment that will be offered, \nas I understand it, by Senators Dodd, Feingold, and Leahy to strike \ntitle II of the Intelligence bill which deals with retroactive \nimmunity. This is a very important amendment, and I hope a majority of \nthe Members of the Senate will support it.\n  It is important in this debate to put the discussion of this FISA \nlegislation in a broader context. The context, sadly, in which we must \nview this legislation has everything to do with the history of what \nthis administration currently in power has done since 9/11. Sadly, what \nthey have done is shown the people of our country and people all over \nthe world that they really do not understand what the Constitution of \nthe United States is about and, in fact, they do not understand, in \nmany instances, what international human rights agreements, such as the \nGeneva Convention, are all about.\n  So when we enter this debate, we should not look at it that this is \nthe first time we are addressing the issue of fundamental attacks on \nAmerican civil liberties. This has been going on year after year. This \nis more of the same from an administration which believes, to a \nsignificant degree, that they are an imperial Presidency, that in the \nguise of fighting terrorism, a President has the right to do anything \nagainst anybody for any reason without understanding what our \nConstitution is about or what our laws are about.\n\n  Let me give a few examples to remind my colleagues what kind of \ncredibility, or lack thereof, this administration has in the whole area \nof civil liberties.\n  Among other things, this administration has pushed for, successfully, \nthe passage of the original PATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization. Under that bill, among many things, an area I was \ninvolved in when I was in the House was a provision that says, without \nprobable cause, the FBI can go into a library or bookstore and find out \nthe books you are reading, and if the librarian or bookstore owner were \nto tell anybody, that person would be in violation of the law. Do we \nwant the kids of this country to be frightened about taking out a book \non Osama bin Laden because somebody may think they are sympathetic to \nterrorism? I don't think so. What freedom is about is encouraging our \nyoung people and all Americans to investigate any area they want. I \ndon't want the people of this country to be intimidated. That is not \nwhat free people are about.\n  Further, under this administration, we have seen an illegal and \nexpanded use of national security letters by the FBI.\n  We have seen the NSA's warrantless wiretap program, which, in fact, \nis what we are discussing today.\n  We have seen the President using signing statements to ignore the \nintent of Congress's law in an unprecedented way. The President says: \nOh, yes, I am going to sign this bill, but, by the way, I am not going \nto enforce section 387; I don't like that section. Mr. President, that \nis not the way the law works. If you don't like it, you have the power \nto veto. You cannot pick and choose what provisions you want. But that \nis, to a large degree, what this President has done.\n  What we have seen in recent years is a profiling of citizens engaged \nin constitutionally protected free speech and peaceful assembly. As I \nmentioned earlier, the right to dissent, the right to protest is at the \nheart of what this country is about. I do not want Americans to be \nworried that there is a video camera filming them and they will be \npunished somewhere down the line because they exercised their freedom \nof speech.\n  We have seen data mining of personal records.\n  We have seen the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, which has embarrassed us \nbefore the entire world.\n  We have seen a broad interpretation of congressional resolutions \nregarding use of military force as justification for unauthorized \nsurveillance and other actions.\n  We have seen extraordinary renditions of detainees to countries that \nallow torture. All over the world, people are looking at the United \nStates of America and saying: What is going on in that great Nation? We \ntell them to be like us, to support democracy, to support human rights, \nand then we engage in torture and we pick people up and we take them to \ncountries where they are treated in horrendous ways. This is certainly \none of the reasons respect for the United States has gone down all over \nthis world, which is a tragedy unto itself but obviously makes it \nharder for us to bring countries together in the important fight \nagainst international terrorism.\n  We have seen an administration that has gotten rid of the rights of \ndetainees to file habeas corpus petitions--simply put people away, deny \nthem access to a lawyer, deny them the right to defend themselves.\n  We have seen political firings in the Office of the U.S. Attorney.\n  We have seen destruction of CIA tapes.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  So the issue we are debating today has to be seen in the broader \ncontext that for the last 7 years, there has been a systematic attack \non our Constitution by an administration which believes that, in the \nguise of fighting terrorism, they can do anything they want against \nanybody they want without getting court approval or without respecting \nour Constitution and the rule of law.\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n  I wish to touch on one point. I know Senator Feingold, Senator Leahy, \nand Senator Dodd have touched on this bill at great length. I just want \nto focus on one issue, and that is the retroactive immunity granted to \nthe telecommunications companies.\n  Why is it important that we support the amendment which does away \nwith that retroactive immunity? It is very simple. The argument is that \nthe President of the United States went to these companies and said: \nLook, I need your help in doing something, and the companies obliged.\n\n  Then the issue is, well, why are we punishing them, even if they \nbroke the law? And the answer is pretty simple: It is precisely that we \nare a nation of laws and not of men. If we grant them retroactive \nimmunity, what it says to future Presidents is, I am the law because I \nam the President, and I will tell you what you can do. And because I \ntell you what to do or ask you to do something, that is, by definition, \nlegal. Go and break into my political opponent's office. Don't worry \nabout it; I am the President. I am saying it is for national security. \nThose guys are bad guys, just do it. I am the President, and that is \nall that matters.\n  That is the precedent that we are setting today, and I think it is a \nvery bad precedent. Trust me, Verizon and these other large \ntelecommunications companies, multi, multibillion-dollar companies, \nhave a lot of lawyers. They have a lot of good lawyers. And what we \nknow, in fact, is that some of the telecommunications companies--at \nleast one that comes to mind--said: No, Mr. President, sorry, that is \nunconstitutional. That is illegal, I ``ain't'' gonna do it. I applaud \nthem for that. But others said: Hey, the President is asking us, we are \ngoing to do it.\n  The point is, the President is not the law. The law is the law. The \nConstitution is the law. And I don't want to set a precedent today by \nwhich any President can tell any company or any individual: You go out \nand do it; don't worry about it; no problem at all. That is not what \nthis country is about.\n  So let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying this is a very important \nissue which concerns millions and millions of Americans. Bottom line, \nevery American, every Member of the Senate understands we have to do \nevery single thing we can to protect the American people from terrorist \nattacks. There is no debate about that. Some of us believe, however, \nthat we can be successful in doing that while we uphold the rule of \nlaw, while we uphold the Constitution of this country, which has made \nus the envy of the world and for which we owe the Founders of our \ncountry and those who came after, fighting to protect those civil \nliberties, so much.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, Congress has been working on FISA \nmodernization since April of 2007. That is over 425 days ago. It is \nsimply amazing to me that it would take this long. As I have often \nsaid, the Constitution of the United States was written in about 115 \ndays, and that included travel time on horseback for the Founding \nFathers. We have spent plenty of time on this issue.\n  So why is it taking so long? Should this issue be controversial? I \ncan only surmise that the delay is due to the ominous sounding \nterrorist surveillance program. That is the program where the President \nhad the audacity to allow the intelligence community to listen to \ninternational communications where at least one person was suspected to \nbe a member of al-Qaida--the same al-Qaida who killed nearly 3,000 \ninnocent American civilians on September 11; the same al-Qaida who \nsince that day has committed attacks in Istanbul, Algiers, Karachi, \nIslamabad, Casablanca, London, Madrid, Mombasa, the Gulf of Aden, \nRiyadh, Tunisia, Amman, and Bali; the same al-Qaida whose mission \nstatement can be summed up in three words: ``Death to America.''\n  This is the group the President targeted. He wanted an early warning \nsystem to help prevent future attacks--a terrorist smoke detector, if \nyou will. We often are reminded that we are fighting against an \nunconventional enemy, one that has asymmetrical advantages against us. \nAl-Qaida is not a nation state and adheres to no treaties or principles \non the conduct of war. They wear no uniforms. They hide in peace-loving \nsocieties and deliberately conduct mass attacks against unarmed \ncivilians. But we also have asymmetrical advantages.\n  As the most technologically sophisticated Nation in history, we have \nhuge advantages that derive from this expertise. We are also--and I \ncertainly see this as an asymmetrical advantage over the barbarism that \nis al-Qaida--a nation of laws. Finally, our surveillance laws are going \nto be modernized so we can continue to use our own technological \nsuperiority to help prevent future attacks against our public and the \npublic of nations that have joined us in our fight to liquidate al-\nQaida.\n  This is what the President was always intent on doing. So he \ninitiated the terrorist surveillance program, and the administration \nprovided appropriate briefings to the chairs and ranking members of the \nSenate and House Intelligence Committees and to the leaders of both \nparties in both Chambers. When a new Member of Congress assumed one of \nthose positions, they were given a similar briefing.\n  Last year, the Senate Intelligence Committee and numerous staff \nconducted a full review of the terrorist surveillance program and found \nno wrongdoing.\n  So why has it taken us so long to get here, and what is the concern \nthat has caused the delay; that the President listened to the \ninternational communications of al-Qaida after 9/11? No President would \never engage in this type of activity, except of course President \nWoodrow Wilson, who authorized interceptions of communications between \nEurope and the United States, and President Franklin Roosevelt, who in \n1940 authorized interception of all communications into and out of the \nUnited States.\n  I guess the fourth amendment and the media's outrage were more \nflexible under Democratic Presidents. But let's leave these situations \naside and continue to focus on the program one of my Democratic \ncolleagues previously called ``one of the worst abuses of executive \npower in our history.''\n  With all due respect to my colleague, if listening to the \ninternational communications of al-Qaida is one of the biggest power \ngrabs in the country's history, then our Nation has lived a charmed \nexistence, worthy of envy throughout the world.\n  We should never forget the reasons for the creation of this program. \nIt is no accident that America has not been attacked since September \n11. Is it more than luck? Did al-Qaida take a hiatus from terrorist \nattacks? Given al-Qaida's numerous foreign attacks during this same \ntimeframe, I think the answer is clearly no. So something must be \nworking. Perhaps the terrorist surveillance program has played a role.\n  But what about warrantless wiretapping? That phrase certainly means \nsomething illegal, right? Not really. As often as that phrase is \nrepeated, what does it really mean? Does warrantless wiretapping \nautomatically mean unconstitutional? That is certainly what we are led \nto believe by the hand-wringing blatteroons of the day. But this is \nsimply not true.\n  The fourth amendment does not proscribe warrantless searches or \nsurveillance. It proscribes unreasonable searches or surveillance. For \nexample, let's look at a few of the numerous warrantless searches that \nare performed every day: Waiting for warrantless searches at the U.S. \nBorder Inspection Station. Look at that mess.\n  Look at this: Waiting for warrantless searches at the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. It is done every day that the court is in session, and even when \nit isn't sometimes. Waiting for warrantless searches at the National \nArchives. In other words, waiting to be searched before viewing the \nfourth amendment. This happens every day. I see that there are members \nof the public in the gallery above. Every last one of them went through \na warrantless search just to get into this building.\n  So the question becomes whether a warrantless search or surveillance \nof international communications involving al-Qaida is reasonable or, to \nput it another way, whether signals intelligence against a declared \nenemy of the United States is reasonable. In my opinion, and I think in \nthe opinion of the vast majority of our body, it certainly is.\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n  Let's also look at what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nof Review, the highest court that has considered this issue, has said:\n\n       The Truong court, as did all the other courts to have \n     decided the issue, held that the President did have inherent \n     authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information. We take for granted that the \n     President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, \n     FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional \n     power.\n\n  That is out of in re: Sealed, case 310 F3d, 717, the FISA Court of \nReview, 2002.\n  While the phrase ``warrantless wiretapping'' has been cited \nincessantly, there is another phrase mentioned nearly as often, and \nthat is ``domestic spying.'' In order to better evaluate this phrase, \nlet's look at what the President said in a December 17, 2005, radio \naddress that described the TSP.\n\n       In the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our Nation, \n     I authorized the National Security Agency, consistent with \n     U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international \n     communications of people with known links to al-Qaida and \n     related terrorist organizations. Before we intercept these \n     communications, the government must have information that \n     establishes a clear link to these terrorist networks.\n\n  I don't see anything in that statement about domestic spying. I \nthought the definition of the word ``domestic'' was pretty clear. If \nthe program intercepted communications in which at least one party was \noverseas, not to mention a member of al-Qaida, then it seems fairly \nobvious that those calls were--and I will emphasize this--not domestic.\n  Is this a domestic call? A foreign terrorist calling a terrorist \nwithin the United States? I hardly think so. Is this really such a hard \nconcept? The last time I flew overseas, I didn't fly on a domestic \nflight. I flew on an international flight. My last phone bill showed \nthere is a big difference between domestic calls and international \ncalls.\n  Domestic spying may sound catchy and mysterious, but it is a \ncompletely inaccurate, even misleading, way to describe the TSP \nterrorist surveillance program--or FISA modernization. Why don't we \ndescribe them as international spying, which is what they really are? \nIsn't that a more accurate description? But I imagine international \nspying wouldn't raise the same level of fear and distrust in our \nGovernment that some on the left try to foster.\n  So while I regret the political machination that has turned this \nseemingly straightforward issue on its head, I am hopeful the time for \ndebate is finally over. Yet some have suggested Congress should not \npass a bill modernizing FISA. Even after such a prolonged period and \nextensive debate on the issue, they would prefer that we do nothing.\n  We are now hearing about efforts to strike or amend the immunity \nprovisions in the compromise bill so that Members may express their \nviews.\n  Is this really necessary? Did the multiple times the Senate has \nconsidered and rejected similar efforts mean nothing?\n  Look at this: The Senate has affirmed telecom civil liability \nprotection in six separate votes. On October 18, 2007, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee rejects the amendment to strike the immunity \nprovisions 12 to 3. That was bipartisan, by the way. On November 15, \n2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejects amendment to strike \nimmunity provisions 12 to 7. Again, bipartisan. On 12/13/07, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee rejects stand-alone Government substitution bill 13 \nto 5. On January 24, 2008, the full Senate tables the Judiciary's \nsubstitute, which does not include immunity, 60 to 36. On February 12, \n2008, the full Senate rejects the amendment to substitute the \nGovernment for telecoms 68 to 30. On February 12, 2008, the full Senate \nrejects amendment to strike immunity provisions 67 to 31.\n  The last time I saw that and looked at those numbers, those were all \nbipartisan votes. The civil liability provision in the Senate bill, \nwhich has been tweaked in this compromise, is supported by a bipartisan \nmajority of the House and Senate, after all this hullabaloo.\n  In addition, let us not forget the opinions of the State attorneys \ngeneral who previously wrote to Congress to express their support for \ncivil liability protection.\n  Look at all the State attorneys general who endorse immunity. State \nattorney general of Wisconsin, the attorney general of Rhode Island, \nthe attorney general of Oklahoma, the attorney general of Colorado, the \nattorney general of Florida, the attorney general of Alabama, the \nattorney general of Arkansas, the attorney general of Georgia, the \nattorney general of Kansas, the attorney general of my beloved home \nState of Utah, the attorney general of Texas, the attorney general of \nNew Hampshire, the attorney general of Virginia, the attorney general \nof North Dakota, the attorney general of North Carolina, the attorney \ngeneral of South Carolina, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, \nattorney general of South Dakota, attorney general of Nebraska, the \nattorney general of West Virginia, the attorney general of Washington.\n  These are all legal officers, by the way, attorneys general of those \nvery States.\n  Another complaint that has been mentioned is that this bill does not \nhave adequate oversight. We have heard allegations that:\n\n       the government can still sweep up and keep the \n     international communications of innocent Americans in the \n     U.S. with no connection to suspected terrorists, with very \n     few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power.\n\n  We have heard other allegations that this bill does not provide \nadequate protections for innocent Americans. Make no mistake. The role \nof the Federal judiciary into the realm of foreign intelligence \ngathering is greatly expanded by this legislation.\n  So when we hear the incessant claims that this legislation lacks \nmeaningful review, I want people to be absolutely crystal clear on the \nstaggering amount of oversight in this bill.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was created by the 1978 \nFISA law for solely one purpose: This is Title 50 of the U.S. Code \n1803(a): ``a court which shall have jurisdiction to hear applications \nfor and grant orders approving electronic surveillance.''\n  Let's think about this. It is America in 1978. The Church Committee \nhas published information about known abuses by the Government \ninvolving surveillance against American citizens. The public wanted \naction. So what did the 95th Congress do?\n  Did it create a Court with the authority to review and approve the \nintelligence community's foreign targeting techniques? No.\n  Did it create a Court with the ability to review and approve the \ntechniques used to minimize incidental interceptions involving \nAmericans? No.\n  Did it mandate the intelligence community to get a warrant when \ntargeting United States persons overseas? No.\n  But the 110th Congress will mandate each and every one of those \nthings by passing this bill.\n  For the first time, the FISC will review and approve targeting \nprocedures to ensure that authorized acquisitions are limited to \npersons outside of the United States.\n  For the first time, the FISC will review and approve minimization \ntechniques.\n  For the first time, the FISC will ensure that the foreign \ntargeting procedures are consistent with the fourth amendment.\n\n  So given the staggering amount of oversight, there must be some \nsweeping new surveillance authority that would necessitate these \nchanges, right? Wrong.\n  The ``broad new surveillance authority'' that we hear so much about \nis directed at one thing: the Government can target foreign citizens \noverseas after the FISC reviews and approves the targeting and \nminimization procedures. In layman's terms: the Government can listen \nto foreign citizens overseas to collect foreign intelligence \ninformation. That doesn't sound like broad sweeping authority to me. In \nfact, it is less authority than the Government had before.\n  Let me enumerate some of the many restrictions on this authority:\n  No. 1, the Government can't intentionally target any person known to \nbe in the U.S.\n  No. 2, the Government can't intentionally target a person outside the \nU.S. if the purpose is to target a known person in the U.S.--reverse \ntargeting.\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n  No. 3, the Government can't acquire domestic communications in the \nU.S.\n  No. 4, the targeting has to be consistent with the fourth amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  And there is more: the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence have to develop and adopt guidelines to ensure compliance \nwith these limitations. These guidelines must be submitted to \nCongressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees as well as the \nFISC.\n  The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence shall \nassess compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures at \nleast every 6 months. This assessment must be submitted to the FISC, \nand the Intelligence and Judiciary committees of both chambers of \nCongress.\n  The Inspectors General of the Department of Justice and each element \nof the intelligence community may review compliance with the targeting \nand minimization procedures.\n  Finally, this bill authorizes a horde of inspectors general to \nconduct a full review of certain communications surveillance \nactivities--a review that the Senate Intelligence Committee has already \nconducted on a bipartisan basis and found nothing wrong. Vice Chairman \nBond and the other negotiators agreed to narrow the scope of this \nreview so that there would be minimal or no operational impact on our \nintelligence analysts. It should come as no surprise that we want \nintelligence analysts to focus on analysis, not spend limited time and \nresources digging up documents for redundant IG reviews.\n\n  So for those who criticize this bill as lacking oversight, I wonder \nif any level would be enough? I have no doubt that some would only be \nsatisfied by specific individual warrants for each and every foreign \nterrorist overseas. This would complete the twisted logic that somehow \ngiving complete constitutional protections to foreign terrorists leads \nto more protections for Americans. Do we really need to remind people \nthat foreign citizens outside of our country, particularly members of \nterrorist organizations, enjoy no--none--no protections from our \nConstitution?\n  Make no mistake about the power the FISA Court will possess in \nforeign intelligence gathering following passage of this bill. If the \nCourt finds any deficiency in the certification submitted by the \nAttorney General or Director of National Intelligence, then the FISC \ncan direct the Government to cease or not initiate the foreign \ntargeting. In other words--our collection would go dark. Fortunately, \nthe Government will be able to rightly begin acquisitions pending an \nappeal to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.\n  This is surely an intimidating environment for our intelligence \nanalysts. Essentially, any accident or mistake will be highlighted to \nCongress. Unforgiving is not the word. I wonder how many private \ncitizens would enjoy having policies at their jobs where any \ninadvertent error would result in notification to and review by \nCongress?\n  I will suggest that the amount of oversight in this bill should be \nrevisited in the future; not to increase it, but rather to mandate more \nrealistic and appropriate levels of review.\n  The multiple oversight initiatives in this legislation are not \nfulfilled by magic. It takes a tremendous amount of time and resources \nby the very analysts whose primary job is to track terrorists. As great \nas our analysts are, they can't be two places at once. There are only \nso many of them, and they don't have unlimited resources. It is worth \nnoting what Director of National Intelligence McConnell said to \nCongress last September:\n\n       Prior to the Protect America Act, we were devoting \n     substantial expert resources towards preparing applications \n     that needed FISA Court approval. This was an intolerable \n     situation, as substantive experts, particularly IC subject \n     matter and language experts, were diverted from the job of \n     analyzing collection results and finding new leads.\n\n  The leaders of our intelligence community have to make wise choices \nwhen allocating the time and expertise of analysts, and their hands \nshould not be unnecessarily tied by Congress. Analytic expertise on \ntarget is a finite resource; a finite resource which the public must \nunderstand is rendered against an enemy whose resources and \ncapabilities remain obscured to us, while its intent remains deadly.\n  But I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the inclusion of these \nonerous oversight provisions, which no previous Congress felt the need \nto add. How many times have we heard claims that the Protect America \nAct would permit the Government to spy on innocent American families \noverseas on their vacations? Or innocent American soldiers overseas \nserving our country? Or innocent students who are simply studying \nabroad?\n  Painting this type of picture only feeds the delusions of those who \nwear tin foil hats around their house and think that 9/11 was an inside \njob.\n  Do we think so little of the fine men and women of our intelligence \ncommunity that we assume they would rather target college kids in \nEurope than foreign terrorists bent on nihilistic violence?\n  The absurdity of these accusations cannot be understated and we \nshould not tolerate them. We should never forget that our intelligence \nanalysts are not political appointees. They serve regardless of which \nPresident is in office, or which political party is represented. They \ntake an oath to defend the Constitution. And rather than respect and \ntrust their judgment and integrity, we layer oversight mechanisms that \ntreat them like 16-year-olds who just got their first job and have to \nbe birdwatched for fear they are stealing money from the cash register.\n\n  Now I agree there are some instances in which we may want to target \nindividuals studying abroad. I am not necessarily talking about \ninstitutions of higher learning like the Sorbonne, but rather terrorist \ntraining camps spread through some hostile regions of foreign \ncountries. These are the type of schools that our intelligence \ncommunity is interested in. When it comes to these students, I want to \nknow what they are up to.\n  Here is a good illustration: Supposed ``Graduation'' of Taliban \nMembers on June 9, 2007. I want to know what they are about.\n  After addressing some of the critiques of this bill by others, let me \noffer one of my own. This bill calls for prior court review and \napproval of certifications presented to the FISC before foreign \nintelligence collection can begin. As I have consistently stated \nthroughout these FISA modernization discussions, I believe this \nprinciple is unjustified and unwise.\n  The idea that the executive branch of the Government needs the \nexplicit approval of the judiciary branch before collecting foreign \nintelligence information from foreign citizens in foreign countries is \nsimply wrongheaded and is contrary to our Constitutional principles. I \ndon't care if the President represents the Democratic party, Republican \nparty, Green party, Independent party, or Whig party; he shouldn't need \npermission to track foreign terrorists.\n  With that said, I am encouraged that the bill includes a provision \nwhich would allow collection before court review of procedures if \n``exigent circumstances'' exist. Even with this provision, I am \ntroubled that one of my Democratic colleagues in the House made the \nfollowing statement last week about this provision:\n\n       This is intended to be used rarely, if at all, and was \n     included upon assurances from the administration that agrees \n     that it shall not be used routinely.\n\n  This begs the question, is tracking terrorists not an ``exigent \ncircumstance''? I urge the executive branch to utilize this provision \nappropriately and as often as necessary following the informed judgment \nof those with the appropriate acumen to make such decisions. The phrase \n``intelligence * * * may be lost'' means what it says: if the executive \nbranch determines that we may lose intelligence while waiting for the \nCourt to issue an order, then the Intelligence Community should do what \nour Nation expects: it should act and act quickly. The executive branch \nshould not hesitate to utilize this authority because of fear of \nreprisal from those who may seek to advance political agendas--which we \nhave seen plenty of, and some on this floor today.\n\n  Finally, I want to highlight the extensive efforts of the negotiators \nof this bill in both chambers. I especially want to express my \nappreciation and gratitude to my friend and colleague Kit Bond, the \ndedicated vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who adeptly \nnavigated and managed the\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\ntense and tedious negotiations to bring about the opportunity for \npassage of this historic legislation, the most extensive rewrite of \nforeign intelligence surveillance laws in 30 years.\n  As you can tell from the tone of my remarks, I am less than pleased \nat some of the compromises made in these negotiations. I don't like the \nexpansion of the judiciary branch into what I believe are activities \nrightly under the executive's prerogative. But I came to the Senate to \nachieve improvements for the American people, not to be an ideologue. \nMy entire career as a legislator has been in recognition that \ncompromise gets more done for the public than obstruction. The people \nof Utah didn't send me to the Senate to obstruct business, but to get \nbusiness done. Nowhere is this more important than on matters where the \nCongress is enjoined by our citizens to improve the national security. \nI am a pragmatist, and I am a realist. Part of being a realist, these \ndays, is to recognize that there is a disturbing backlash against the \nnational security policies of this administration. Fueled by \ndissatisfaction over mistakes in Iraq, over frustration that the fight \nthere and in Afghanistan continues into its seventh year, and that Al \nQaeda remains a credible and deadly threat, many people in the majority \nparty have gone beyond criticism to denunciation, to condemnation and \nobstruction. I am hoping that the general election before us will \nprovide the opportunity for a truly grand debate on what we consider \nare threats, and how we believe we must continue to address them. But \nso far the debate has not been joined, and the rhetoric is becoming \nmore poisonous. I have come to this floor and expressed my own \ncriticisms of this administration, but I have never had reason to \ncondemn them as operating in bad faith when it came to defending this \nNation.\n  I know this President. The President is a wonderfully good man. He \nhas done everything in his power to try to protect us. He is an honest \nman. He has had untoward criticism from the media day in and day out. \nHe has been deliberately maligned by people who should know better.\n  Yes, this administration has made mistakes, but they have not been \nmade intentionally. It is pathetic the way the media and many have \ntreated this President. I think we have got to go back to where we \nrespect our President and we show some degree of tolerance for the \ntough job that being President is.\n  It is regrettable for me that the rhetoric around the terrorism \nsurveillance program has devolved too often into fire but no light. So \nwhile I am concerned about some of the compromises made in this bill, I \nam grateful for all of the work done to bring it to a vote this week. \nWe have to have this bill to protect the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this monumental and historic \nlegislation. Our country continues to be both the envy of the world and \nthe target of those who seek to advance their warped, violent ideology. \nWe know the threats are out there. We do not have to live our lives in \nfear, but we should acknowledge that the world changed on September 11 \nand we must remain vigilant.\n  Let's ensure that all of the dedicated and noble professionals who \nplay a part in ensuring our liberty and safety are not hampered by \npartisan problems that we have the ability and responsibility to \ncorrect.\n  The legislation before us makes an important and admirable attempt to \ndo just that. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and \nsupport final passage. It is overdue. It has been delayed too long. We \nhave been playing around with this far too long. There have been so \nmany unjust criticisms, I am sick of them, to be honest with you. It is \nalmost as though politics has to rear its ugly head every time we turn \naround here. A lot of it is driven by the fact that people resent the \nPresident of the United States. They do so unjustly, without proper \nsense, in ways that are detrimental to our country and future \npresidencies that will come into office. This President has had very \ndifficult problems to handle.\n  I believe I am the longest serving person on the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I have been around a long time. I have seen \na lot of things. I have tried to help prior Presidents as I have played \na role on the Intelligence Committee. I have done so, I believe, \nwithout resorting to partisan attacks. We have had too many partisan \nattacks around here, and I think too many vicious attacks against the \nPresident and, I might add, against these unnamed, highly classified \nunknown, except by those in the intelligence community, telecom \ncompanies that patriotically helped our country to protect us, that \nhave gone through untold expense, the deprivation and harm caused by \nthe zealousness of those who believe that only they can protect the \ncivil liberties of this country, when, in fact, that is what the \ntelecom companies were cooperating to do.\n  I thank all of the Intelligence Committee staffers who have played \nsuch a big role in helping this bill to come to the floor. We have a \nvery dedicated staff on the Intelligence Committee. I have to say that \nin this current Intelligence Committee I have seen more partisanship \nthan I have seen in the past. But, by and large, when we passed the \noriginal bill out of the committee, it was passed 13 to 2, and we \nworked together in a very good way on that committee.\n  So I thank those staffers who worked so hard to try and help us all \nresolve this set of difficulties. I hope everybody in the Senate will \nvote for this bill and send it out with resounding victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, soon the Senate will take up the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. It, of course, is known as FISA. FISA \nmay not be a household word to most Americans, but a properly written \nFISA reauthorization is exceptionally important to the well-being of \nour country and it needs to meet a simple test: It must allow our \ncountry to fight terrorism ferociously and still protect our individual \nliberty.\n  I do not know how many Senators have traveled to the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue to personally read the legal opinions from the \nDepartment of Justice on the warrantless wiretapping program that is at \nthe center of this debate. Someday these opinions are going to become \npublic. Someday the American people will see how flimsy the legal \nreasoning is behind warrantless wiretapping. Someday the American \npeople will see the damage that is done to our Nation when the \nexecutive branch tries to rewrite important national security law in \nsecret.\n  The warrantless wiretapping program is not the first of this \nadministration's counterterrorism programs that is built on legal \nquicksand. We have seen the coercive interrogation program, and the \ndetention program at Guantanamo. Again and again on these vital \ncounterterrorism programs, the administration has overreached, it has \nfallen short, and then it has come to the Congress and asked that the \nCongress clean up these legal messes. I am especially troubled by the \nprovisions in this reauthorization of the FISA bill that grant blanket \nretroactive immunity to any telecommunications company that \nparticipated in the warrantless wiretapping program. I want to spend a \nfew minutes to unpack this issue and discuss why I think it is such a \nsignificant mistake to reauthorize the program in this fashion and to \nhave what amounts to a blanket amnesty provision for those who may have \nbeen involved in illegal activity.\n  Many have argued that companies that were asked to participate in the \nwarrantless wiretapping program should be treated leniently since they \nacted during a state of national panic and confusion. I have given this \nargument a lot of thought and, frankly, I think there is a valid \nrationale behind that thinking if you are talking about a short period \nof time. But that is not what is being discussed here. The warrantless \nwiretapping program did not last for a few weeks or a few months as \nAmerica worried about the prospect of another attack. It went on for \nnearly 6 years. At some point during that nearly 6-year period, any \ncompany participating in the program had an obligation to stop and to \nconsider whether what they were doing was legal.\n  Others have suggested that if you do not give amnesty to the \ncompanies now, it is going to be impossible to get\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\ncooperation from other companies in the future in the fight against \nterrorism. I do not buy that argument. Our country is full of patriotic \ncitizens and businesses that are eager to do their part and to serve \ntheir Nation. I will say, I think it is insulting to suggest that \nAmerican businessmen and women will be less patriotic if the Congress \ndoes not grant amnesty to the phone companies. People of this country \nlove our Nation, and I believe they step up, they come forward whenever \nthey can.\n  I hope, however, that they are not going to say: Well, okay, when the \nGovernment breaks the law we will automatically step forward in those \ninstances. When American businesses are asked to participate in a \nprogram that looks as if it could be illegal, we all say, that is the \ntime to hold on. I think it is important, particularly for our major \nbusinesses, to follow the law and not just the words of the President. \nI am disappointed that this legislation includes this amnesty \nprovision. I hope as colleagues continue to examine the bill, they \nunderstand what is at issue.\n  If the legislation passes, the Attorney General will be able to stop \nany of the lawsuits against the companies dead in their tracks. All the \nAttorney General will have to do is tell the judges considering these \ncases that any corporation that participated in the program was told by \nthe Government that what they were doing was legal. They will not have \nto actually prove it was legal, they will not have to provide any \nevidence, they will not have to cite any statutes, they will not have \nto make any legal arguments whatsoever.\n  In my view, this amounts to self-certification. Self-certification \nruns counter to the whole idea of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct in the first place. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is \nbased on the notion that the way to keep classified intelligence \nactivities from intruding on Americans' privacy is to make sure there \nis a significant measure of independent judicial oversight. The judges \nin this situation will be allowed to examine as many documents as they \nlike. But, in this instance, they will not actually be allowed to \nexercise independent judgment at all. As long as they see a piece of \npaper, a piece of paper that gets held up from a few years ago, a \nPresidential permission slip, if you will, that claims the program is \nlegal, they will be required to grant immunity to the phone companies. \nEven the distinguished leader in the House, the minority whip, has \nacknowledged that this would be a mere ``formality.''\n  The concept of independent oversight that is so central to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and that has worked so well in \npractice simply, in my view, should not be transformed into an approach \nthat effectively permits the administration to self-certify with \nrespect to these particular cases.\n  I want to be clear that I cannot begin to divine how various matters \nin litigation will come out. In addition to the constitutional issues \nthat are at stake, there is a number of contentious matters regarding \nstanding, injury, a host of very difficult legal problems involved. I \nthink the judges in these cases will need to consider all of the issues \nif the cases go forward. That is what makes the judicial process in the \noriginal statute so important. It is independent. They look at all of \nthe factors that are relevant. But I will say that I did not think the \nCongress or I should substitute our judgment for the judgment of the \ncourts, and that is, in effect, what happens if the legislation goes \nforward as written and blanket immunity is granted to every company \nthat participated in the program.\n  It saddens me to have to oppose the legislation as written. I do so \nknowing that the bill contains a number of very important provisions \nand, with respect to individual liberty and the rights of our people, \ncontains some significant steps forward. I am especially grateful to \nSenators Rockefeller and Bond for working very closely with me to \nensure that Americans who travel overseas don't lose their rights when \nthey leave America's shores. That is the status today, regrettably. In \nthis area, Senators Rockefeller, Bond, myself, Whitehouse, Feingold, a \nnumber of us who serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nworked in a constructive, good-faith way with the Bush administration. \nIn this legislation, we have put into law that in the digital age, your \nrights are going to travel with you. You don't lose your rights. If you \nare a serviceman from the State of Missouri or a businessperson from \nanother part of the country, you won't lose your rights when you leave \nAmerican soil. That is as it should be. It is a significant expansion \nof the individual liberties of our citizens. They should not give up \ntheir rights when they travel. They ought to have rights that do travel \nin a world with modern communications and modern transportation. That \nprovision is part of this reauthorization.\n  However, I feel so strongly about the ill-advised nature of the \nprovisions that provide for blanket amnesty that I must oppose this \nbill as written. I think when history looks back at what happened, the \nwarrantless wiretapping program, they are going to say that this \nprogram, along with several other flawed counterterrorism programs that \nhave come from this administration, was a mistake. We should not \ncompound those mistakes by reauthorizing this legislation that contains \na blanket grant of immunity at a time when Americans understand that it \nis possible to fight terrorism relentlessly, fight terrorism \nferociously without trashing our rights and liberties simultaneously.\n  We can do better. The Senate will have an opportunity to do better. A \nnumber of colleagues are going to be advocating proposals to strip the \nlegislation of the amnesty provision. I hope those provisions will be \nsuccessful.\n  I would like to pass this bill when we have an opportunity to strike \na better balance between fighting terrorism aggressively and protecting \nthe liberties of our citizens.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before our colleague leaves the Chamber, I \ncommend him for his statement. I had a chance to listen to part of it \nbefore coming to the floor of the Senate. This is a long-held view of \nmy colleague when it comes to civil liberties and the rule of law. I \ncommend him for remaining consistent in that insistence. He is \nabsolutely correct that this is not a choice between security or \nliberty. In fact, I argue, as he has, that when we begin to retreat on \nthe rule of law, we become less secure as a people. We have learned \nthat lesson painfully throughout history. This is the time for us to be \nvigilant, both in terms of our security and also when it comes to our \nrights. This is an issue that ought not divide people based on our \ndetermination to deal with terrorism or those who wish to do great harm \nto our country but to recognize that historically, when we have been \nmotivated by fear and have failed to stand up for basic rights, we have \nmade horrendous mistakes. When we have stood up for our rights as well \nas insisting on our security, we have done our job as a generation, as \nprevious ones have as well.\n  This is one of those moments history will look back upon. Why did we \nsay that 17 phone companies that relied on a letter and not much more \nthan that decided for over 5 years to invade the privacy of millions of \nAmericans and would still be doing it today but for a whistleblower who \nrevealed the program? Why did they not seek the FISA Court, as 18,748 \nother cases that been submitted and only 5 examples when they were \nturned down seeking a warrant since 1978? Why in this case did the Bush \nadministration decide to avoid that normal process and go with a simple \nletter, without any legal justification I can determine, and get that \nkind of reaction? Why should we not know that? Why should not the \nAmerican people know that? What happened here?\n  That is what the Senator is insisting upon. We will not know the \nanswers to those questions if we, as a legislative body, by a simple \nvote here, declare that the courts have no business examining the \nlegality of this action. We will avoid that responsibility by casting a \nvote to keep this immunity process in place. I will be joining him. In \nfact, I will be offering the amendment to strike the immunity \nprovisions, to do our job when it comes to dealing with FISA, to \nmodernizing it, but not to grant immunity to 17 phone companies.\n  Quest, to their great credit, when they were given that letter, said: \nWe need more legal justification. They did\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nnot engage in this program. Not all phone companies did. But the ones \nthat did bear the responsibility to determine whether what they did was \nlegal. We will never know the answer to that if the Senator from Oregon \nand I do not prevail on our amendment.\n  I commend him immensely for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, the Senate today--hopefully, tomorrow--returns to \ndebating the matter of modernizing FISA and, more specifically, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008. After many \nmonths of careful and often very difficult negotiations, we bring to \nthe Senate an agreement that many believed could actually never be \nachieved, that is bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting the \nNation's security and civil liberties, supported by the House, by the \nSenate, as well as both the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  The bill before us reflects the fact that FISA, as it was created in \n1978, has increasingly become outdated and hindered our Nation's \nability to collect intelligence on foreign targets in a timely manner. \nIt is the direct result of changing technologies, advances in \ntechnology, in telecommunications, and the need to evolve and meet \ntoday's threat facing our Nation; namely, global terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The fact is, as telecommunications technology has changed, \nintelligence agencies have been presented with collection opportunities \ninside the United States against targets overseas. Yet, because of the \nway FISA was written in 1978, they could not take full advantage of \nthese new opportunities.\n  Finding a solution to this problem has not been easy. It was made \nmore complicated by the President's decision, in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, disaster, to go completely outside of the FISA \nrather than work with Congress to fix the situation. That decision was \ncomplicated even further by the fact that the President put \ntelecommunication companies in a precarious position by not giving them \nthe legal security of the FISA Court, even when they were told their \nefforts were legal and necessary to prevent another terrorist attack.\n  Early last year, at the start of our tenure as the new chairman and \nvice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Bond and I \nagreed that our top priority was going to be to modernize FISA. It had \nto be our top priority for the year. Even then, I don't think we \nunderstood how complex and difficult this endeavor would be or even \njust how important it would be to our intelligence efforts and to the \nwar against terrorism. It is a monumental bill, and it redoes, for the \nfirst time in 30 years, proper handling of collection, which is why I \nam so pleased to stand before you today and say that we have succeeded.\n  The laborious process of consultation with Members of both bodies and \nboth parties and legal and intelligence officials in the executive \nbranch has worked. We have produced a strong, smart policy that will \nmeet the needs of our intelligence community and protect America's \ncherished civil liberties.\n  For procedural reasons, the bill now before the Senate is a new bill \nwhich passed the House on Friday by a vote of 293 to 129. You can run \nthat out to a 70-percent vote. While formally a new bill, it is the \nproduct of compromise between the FISA bills developed, debated, and \namended in both Houses in the course of the past year.\n  In the absence of a formal conference, there is no conference report \nthat describes this final bill. To help fill that void, I have \nprepared, as manager of the bill, a section-by-section analysis which \nbuilds on the analysis in our earlier Senate report and includes the \nchanges that have followed. I hope it will be of assistance to the \nSenate in consideration of this final legislation as well as to the \npublic and all those who will have responsibility to implement the \nbill.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe summary of the bill's legislative history and a description of its \nfour titles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 H.R. 6304, FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008\n\n              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation\n\n  Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Chairman of the Select Committee on \n                              Intelligence\n\n       The consideration of legislation to amend the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (``FISA'') in the 110th \n     Congress began with submission by the Director of National \n     Intelligence (``DNI'') on April 12, 2007 of a proposed \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Modernization Act of 2007, \n     as Title IV of the Administration's proposed Intelligence \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The DNI's proposal \n     was the subject of an open hearing on May 1, 2007 and \n     subsequent closed hearings by the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, but was not formally introduced. It is \n     available on the Committee's website: http://\nintelligence.senate.gov/070501/bill.pdf. In the Senate, the \n     original legislative vehicle for the consideration of FISA \n     amendments in the 110th Congress was S. 2248. It was reported \n     by the Select Committee on Intelligence on October 26, 2007 \n     (S. Rep. No. 110-209 (2007)), and then sequentially reported \n     by the Committee on the Judiciary on November 16, 2007 (S. \n     Rep. No. 110-258 (2008)). In the House, the original \n     legislative vehicle was H.R. 3773. It was reported by the \n     Committee on the Judiciary and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence on October 12, 2007 (H. Rep. No. 110-373 \n     (Parts 1 and 2)(2007)). H.R. 3773 passed the House on \n     November 15, 2007. S. 2248 passed the Senate on February 12, \n     2008, and was sent to the House as an amendment to H.R. 3773. \n     On March 14, 2008, the House returned H.R. 3773 to the Senate \n     with an amendment.\n       No formal conference was convened to resolve the \n     differences between the two Houses on H.R. 3773. Instead, \n     following an agreement reached without a formal conference, \n     the House passed a new bill, H.R. 6304, which contains a \n     complete compromise of the differences on H.R. 3773.\n       H.R. 6304 is a direct descendant of H.R. 3773, as well as \n     of the original Senate bill, S. 2248, and the legislative \n     history of those measures constitutes the legislative history \n     of H.R. 6304. The section-by-section analysis and explanation \n     set forth below is based on the analysis and explanation in \n     the report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on S. \n     2248, at S. Rep. No. 110-209, pp. 12-25, as expanded and \n     edited to reflect the floor amendments to S. 2248 and the \n     negotiations that produced H.R. 6304.\n\n\n                      Overall Organization of Act\n\n       The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (``FISA Amendments Act'') \n     contains four titles.\n       Title I includes, in section 101, a new Title VII of FISA \n     entitled ``Additional Procedures Regarding Certain Persons \n     Outside the United States.'' This new title of FISA (which \n     will sunset in four and a half years) is a successor to the \n     Protect America Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-55 (August 5, 2007) \n     (``Protect America Act''), with amendments. Sections 102 \n     through 110 of the Act contain a number of amendments to FISA \n     apart from the collection issues addressed in the new Title \n     VII of FISA. These include a provision reaffirming and \n     strengthening the requirement that FISA is the exclusive \n     means for electronic surveillance, important streamlining \n     provisions, and a change in the definitions section of FISA \n     (in section 110 of the bill) to facilitate foreign \n     intelligence collection against proliferators of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       Title II establishes a new Title VIII of FISA which is \n     entitled ``Protection of Persons Assisting the Government.'' \n     This new title establishes a long-term procedure, in new FISA \n     section 802, for the Government to implement statutory \n     defenses and obtain the dismissal of civil cases against \n     persons, principally electronic communication service \n     providers, who assist elements of the intelligence community \n     in accordance with defined legal documents, namely, orders of \n     the FISA Court or certifications or directives provided for \n     and defined by statute. Section 802 also incorporates a \n     procedure with precise boundaries for liability relief for \n     electronic communication service providers who are defendants \n     in civil cases involving an intelligence activity authorized \n     by the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, \n     2007. In addition, Title II provides for the protection, by \n     way of preemption, of the federal government's ability to \n     conduct intelligence activities without interference by state \n     investigations.\n       Title III directs the Inspectors General of the Department \n     of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Office of National \n     Intelligence, the National Security Agency, and any other \n     element of the intelligence community that participated in \n     the President's Surveillance Program authorized by the \n     President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, \n     to conduct a comprehensive review of the program. The \n     Inspectors General are required to submit a report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress, within one year, that \n     addresses, among other things, all of the facts necessary to \n     describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use \n     of the product of the President's Surveillance Program, \n     including the participation of individuals and entities in \n     the private sector related to the program.\n       Title IV contains important procedures for the transition \n     from the Protect America Act to the new Title VII of FISA. \n     Section 404(a)(7) directs the Attorney General and the DNI, \n     if they seek to replace an authorization under the Protect \n     America Act, to\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\n     submit the certification and procedures required in \n     accordance with the new section 702 to the FISA Court at \n     least 30 days before the expiration of such authorizations, \n     to the extent practicable. Title IV explicitly provides for \n     the continued effect of orders, authorizations, and \n     directives issued under the Protect America Act, and of the \n     provisions pertaining to protection from liability, FISA \n     court jurisdiction, the use of information acquired and \n     Executive Branch reporting requirements, past the statutory \n     sunset of that act. Title IV also contains provisions on \n     the continuation of authorizations, directives, and orders \n     under Title VII that are in effect at the time of the \n     December 31, 2012 sunset, until their expiration within \n     the year following the sunset.\n\n               Title I. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\n\n     Section 101. Targeting the Communications of Persons Outside \n         the United States\n       Section 101(a) of the FISA Amendments Act establishes a new \n     Title VII of FISA. Entitled ``Additional Procedures Regarding \n     Certain Persons Outside the United States,'' the new title \n     includes, with important modifications, an authority similar \n     to that granted by the Protect America Act as temporary \n     sections 105A, 105B, and 105C of FISA. Those Protect America \n     Act provisions had been placed within FISA's Title I on \n     electronic surveillance. Moving the amended authority to a \n     title of its own is appropriate because the authority \n     involves not only the acquisition of communications as they \n     are being carried but also while they are stored by \n     electronic communication service providers.\n     Section 701. Definitions\n       Section 701 incorporates into Title VII the definition of \n     nine terms that are defined in Title I of FISA and used in \n     Title VII: ``agent of a foreign power,'' ``Attorney \n     General,'' ``contents,'' ``electronic surveillance,'' \n     ``foreign intelligence information,'' ``foreign power,'' \n     ``person,'' ``United States,'' and ``United States person.'' \n     It defines the congressional intelligence committees for the \n     purposes of Title VII. Section 701 defines the two courts \n     established in Title I that are assigned responsibilities \n     under Title VII: the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     (``FISA Court'') and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court of Review. Section 701 also defines ``intelligence \n     community'' as found in the National Security Act of 1947. \n     Finally, section 701 defines a term, not previously defined \n     in FISA, which has an important role in setting the \n     parameters of Title VII: ``electronic communication service \n     provider.'' This definition is connected to the objective \n     that the acquisition of foreign intelligence pursuant to this \n     title is meant to encompass the acquisition of stored \n     electronic communications and related data.\n     Section 702. Procedures for Targeting Certain Persons Outside \n         the United States Other than United States Persons\n       Section 702(a) sets forth the basic authorization in Title \n     VII, replacing section 105B of FISA, as added by the Protect \n     America Act. Unlike the Protect America Act, the collection \n     authority in section 702(a) is to be conducted pursuant to \n     the issuance of an order of the FISA Court, or pursuant to a \n     determination of the Attorney General and the DNI, acting \n     jointly, that exigent circumstances exist, as defined in \n     section 702(c)(2), subject to subsequent and expeditious \n     action by the FISA Court. Authorizations must contain an \n     effective date, and may be valid for a period of up to one \n     year from that date.\n       Subsequent provisions of the Act implement the prior order \n     and effective date provisions of section 702(a): in addition \n     to section 702(c)(2) which defines exigent circumstances, \n     section 702(i)(1)(B) provides that the court shall complete \n     its review of certifications and procedures within 30 days \n     (unless extended under section 702(j)(2)); section \n     702(i)(5)(A) provides for the submission of certifications \n     and procedures to the FISA Court at least 30 days before the \n     expiration of authorizations that are being replaced, to the \n     extent practicable; and section 702(i)(5)(B) provides for the \n     continued effectiveness of expiring certifications and \n     procedures until the court issues an order concerning their \n     replacements.\n       Section 105B and section 702(a) differ in other important \n     respects. Section 105B authorized the acquisition of foreign \n     intelligence information ``concerning'' persons reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. To make clear that \n     all collection under Title VII must be targeted at persons \n     who are reasonably believed to be outside the United States, \n     section 702(a) eliminates the word ``concerning'' and instead \n     authorizes ``the targeting of persons reasonably believed to \n     be located outside the United States to collect foreign \n     intelligence information.''\n       Section 702(b) establishes five related limitations on the \n     authorization in section 702(a). Overall, the limitations \n     ensure that the new authority is not used for surveillance \n     directed at persons within the United States or at United \n     States persons. The first is a specific prohibition on using \n     the new authority to target intentionally any person within \n     the United States. The second provides that the authority may \n     not be used to conduct ``reverse targeting,'' the intentional \n     targeting of a person reasonably believed to be outside the \n     United States if the purpose of the acquisition is to target \n     a person reasonably believed to be in the United States. If \n     the purpose of the acquisition is to target a person \n     reasonably believed to be in the United States, the \n     acquisition must be conducted in accordance with other titles \n     of FISA. The third bars the intentional targeting of a United \n     States person reasonably believed to be outside the United \n     States. In order to target such United States person, \n     acquisition must be conducted under three subsequent sections \n     of Title VII, which require individual FISA court orders for \n     United States persons: sections 703, 704, and 705. The fourth \n     limitation goes beyond targeting (the object of the first \n     three limitations) and prohibits the intentional acquisition \n     of any communication as to which the sender and all intended \n     recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be \n     located in the United States. The fifth is an overarching \n     mandate that an acquisition authorized in section 702(a) \n     shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth \n     Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides for ``the \n     right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \n     papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures.''\n       Section 702(c) governs the conduct of acquisitions. \n     Pursuant to section 702(c)(1), acquisitions authorized under \n     section 702(a) may be conducted only in accordance with \n     targeting and minimization procedures approved at least \n     annually by the FISA Court and a certification of the \n     Attorney General and the DNI, upon its submission in \n     accordance with section 702(g). Section 702(c)(2) \n     describes the ``exigent circumstances'' in which the \n     Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence may \n     authorize targeting for a limited time without a prior \n     court order for purposes of subsection (a). Section \n     702(c)(2) provides that the Attorney General and the DNI \n     may make a determination that exigent circumstances exist \n     because, without immediate implementation of an \n     authorization under section 702(a), intelligence important \n     to the national security of the United States may be lost \n     or not timely acquired and time does not permit the \n     issuance of an order pursuant to section 702(i)(3) prior \n     to the implementation of such authorization. Section \n     702(c)(3) provides that the Attorney General and the DNI \n     may make such a determination before the submission of a \n     certification or by amending a certification at any time \n     during which judicial review of such certification is \n     pending before the FISA Court.\n       Section 702(c)(4) addresses the concern, reflected in \n     section 105A of FISA as added by the Protect America Act, \n     that the definition of electronic surveillance in Title I \n     might prevent use of the new procedures. To address this \n     concern, section 105A redefined the term ``electronic \n     surveillance'' to exclude ``surveillance directed at a person \n     reasonably believed to be located outside of the United \n     States.'' This redefinition, however, broadly exempted \n     activities from the limitations of FISA's individual order \n     requirements. In contrast, section 702(c)(4) does not change \n     the definition of electronic surveillance, but clarifies the \n     intent of Congress to allow the targeting of foreign targets \n     outside the United States in accordance with section 702 \n     without an application for a court order under Title I of \n     FISA. The addition of this construction paragraph, as well as \n     the language in section 702(a) that an authorization may \n     occur ``notwithstanding any other law,'' makes clear that \n     nothing in Title I of FISA shall be construed to require a \n     court order under that title for an acquisition that is \n     targeted in accordance with section 702 at a foreign person \n     outside the United States.\n       Section 702(d) provides, in a manner essentially identical \n     to the Protect America Act, for the adoption by the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the DNI, of targeting \n     procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that \n     collection is limited to targeting persons reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. As provided in the \n     Protect America Act, the targeting procedures are subject to \n     judicial review and approval. In addition to the requirements \n     of the Protect America Act, however, section 702(d) provides \n     that the targeting procedures also must be reasonably \n     designed to prevent the intentional acquisition of any \n     communication as to which the sender and all intended \n     recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be \n     located in the United States. Section 702(d)(2) subjects \n     these targeting procedures to judicial review and approval.\n       Section 702(e) provides that the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the DNI, shall adopt, for acquisitions \n     authorized by section 702(a), minimization procedures that \n     are consistent with section 101(h) or 301(4) of FISA, which \n     establish FISA's minimization requirements for electronic \n     surveillance and physical searches. Section 702(e)(2) \n     provides that the minimization procedures, which are \n     essential to the protection of United States citizens and \n     permanent residents, shall be subject to judicial review and \n     approval. This corrects an omission in the Protect America \n     Act which had not provided for judicial review of the \n     adherence of minimization procedures to statutory \n     requirements.\n       Section 702(f) provides that the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the DNI, shall adopt guidelines to ensure \n     compliance with\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n     the limitations in section 702(b), including the prohibitions \n     on the acquisition of purely domestic communications, on \n     targeting persons within the United States, on targeting \n     United States persons located outside the United States, and \n     on reverse targeting. Such guidelines shall also ensure that \n     an application for a court order is filed as required by \n     FISA. It is intended that these guidelines will be used for \n     training intelligence community personnel so that there are \n     clear requirements and procedures governing the appropriate \n     implementation of the authority under this title of FISA. The \n     Attorney General is to provide these guidelines to the \n     congressional intelligence committees, the judiciary \n     committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     and the FISA Court. Subsequent provisions implement the \n     guidelines requirement. See section \n     702(g)(2)(A)(iii)(certification requirements); section \n     702(l)(1) and 702(l)(2) (assessment of compliance with \n     guidelines); and section 707(b)(1)(G)(ii) (reporting on \n     noncompliance with guidelines).\n       Section 702(g) requires that the Attorney General and the \n     DNI provide to the FISA Court, prior to implementation of an \n     authorization under subsection (a), a written certification, \n     with any supporting affidavits. In exigent circumstances, the \n     Attorney General and DNI may make a determination that, \n     without immediate implementation, intelligence important to \n     the national security will be lost or not timely acquired \n     prior to the implementation of an authorization. In exigent \n     circumstances, if time does not permit the submission of a \n     certification prior to the implementation of an \n     authorization, the certification must be submitted to the \n     FISA Court no later than seven days after the determination \n     is made. This seven-day time period for submission of a \n     certification in the case of exigent circumstances is \n     identical to the time period by which the Attorney General \n     must apply for a court order after authorizing an emergency \n     surveillance under other provisions of FISA, as amended by \n     this Act.\n       Section 702(g)(2) sets forth the requirements that must be \n     contained in the written certification. These elements \n     include: that the targeting and minimization procedures have \n     been approved by the FISA Court or will be submitted to the \n     court with the certification; that guidelines have been \n     adopted to ensure compliance with the limitations of \n     subsection (b) have been adopted; that those procedures and \n     guidelines are consistent with the Fourth Amendment; that the \n     acquisition is targeted at persons reasonably believed to be \n     outside the United States; that a significant purpose of the \n     acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information; \n     and an effective date for the authorization that in most \n     cases is at least 30 days after the submission of the written \n     certification. Additionally, as an overall limitation on the \n     method of acquisition. permitted under section 702, the \n     certification must attest that the acquisition involves \n     obtaining foreign intelligence information from or with \n     the assistance of an electronic communication service \n     provider.\n       Requiring an effective date in the certification serves to \n     identify the beginning of the period of authorization (which \n     is likely to be a year) for collection and to alert the FISA \n     Court of when the Attorney General and DNI are seeking to \n     begin collection. Section 702(g)(3) permits the Attorney \n     General and DNI to change the effective date in the \n     certification by amending the certification.\n       As with the Protect America Act, the certification under \n     section 702(g)(4) is not required to identify the specific \n     facilities, places, premises, or property at which the \n     acquisition under section 702(a) will be directed or \n     conducted. The certification shall be subject to review by \n     the FISA Court.\n       Section 702(h) authorizes the Attorney General and the DNI \n     to direct, in writing, an electronic communication service \n     provider to furnish the Government with all information, \n     facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the \n     acquisition authorized under subsection 702(a). It requires \n     compensation for this assistance and provides that no cause \n     of action shall lie in any court against an electronic \n     communication service provider for its assistance in \n     accordance with a directive. Section 702(h) also establishes \n     expedited procedures in the FISA Court for a provider to \n     challenge the legality of a directive or the Government to \n     enforce it. In either case, the question for the court is \n     whether the directive meets the requirements of section 702 \n     and is otherwise lawful. Whether the proceeding begins as a \n     provider challenge or a Government enforcement petition, if \n     the court upholds the directive as issued or modified, the \n     court shall order the provider to comply. Failure to comply \n     may be punished as a contempt of court. The proceedings shall \n     be expedited and decided within 30 days, unless that time is \n     extended under section 702(j)(2).\n       Section 702(i) provides for judicial review of any \n     certification required by section 702(g) and the targeting \n     and minimization procedures adopted pursuant to sections \n     702(d) and 702(e). In accordance with section 702(i)(5), if \n     the Attorney General and the DNI seek to reauthorize or \n     replace an authorization in effect under the Act, they shall \n     submit, to the extent practicable, the certification and \n     procedures at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such \n     authorization.\n       The court shall review certifications to determine whether \n     they contain all the required elements. It shall review \n     targeting procedures to assess whether they are reasonably \n     designed to ensure that the acquisition activity is limited \n     to the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located \n     outside the United States and prevent the intentional \n     acquisition of any communication whose sender and intended \n     recipients are known to be located in the United States. The \n     Protect America Act had limited the review of targeting \n     procedures to a ``clearly erroneous'' standard; section \n     702(i) omits that limitation. For minimization procedures, \n     section 702(i) provides that the court shall review them to \n     assess whether they meet the statutory requirements. The \n     court is to review the certifications and procedures and \n     issue its order within 30 days after they were submitted \n     unless that time is extended under section 702(j)(2). The \n     Attorney General and the DNI may also amend the certification \n     or procedures at any time under section 702(i)(1)(C), but \n     those amended certifications or procedures must be submitted \n     to the court in no more than 7 days after amendment. The \n     amended procedures may be used pending the court's review.\n       If the FISA Court finds that the certification contains all \n     the required elements and that the targeting and minimization \n     procedures are consistent with the requirements of \n     subsections (d) and (e) and with the Fourth Amendment, the \n     court shall enter an order approving their use or continued \n     use for the acquisition authorized by section 702(a). If it \n     does not so find, the court shall order the Government, at \n     its election, to correct any deficiencies or cease, or not \n     begin, the acquisition. If acquisitions have begun, they may \n     continue during any rehearing en banc of an order requiring \n     the correction of deficiencies. If the Government appeals to \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, any \n     collection that has begun may continue at least until that \n     court enters an order, not later than 60 days after filing of \n     the petition for review, which determines whether all or any \n     part of the correction order shall be implemented during the \n     appeal\n       Section 702(j)(1) provides that judicial proceedings are to \n     be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Section 702(j)(2) \n     provides that the time limits for judicial review in section \n     702 (for judicial review of certifications and procedures or \n     in challenges or enforcement proceedings concerning \n     directives) shall apply unless extended, by written order, as \n     necessary for good cause in a manner consistent with national \n     security.\n       Section 702(k) requires that records of proceedings under \n     section 702 shall be maintained by the FISA Court under \n     security measures adopted by the Chief Justice in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the DNI. In \n     addition, all petitions are to be filed under seal and the \n     FISA Court, upon the request of the Government, shall \n     consider ex parte and in camera any Government submission or \n     portions of a submission that may include classified \n     information. The Attorney General and the DNI are to retain \n     directives made or orders granted for not less than 10 years.\n       Section 702(l) provides for oversight of the implementation \n     of Title VII. It has three parts. First, the Attorney General \n     and the DNI shall assess semiannually under subsection (l)(1) \n     compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures, \n     and the Attorney General guidelines for compliance with \n     limitations under section 702(b), and submit the assessment \n     to the FISA Court and to the congressional intelligence and \n     judiciary committees, consistent with congressional rules.\n       Second, under subsection (l)(2)(A), the Inspector General \n     of the Department of Justice and the inspector general \n     (``IG'') of any intelligence community element authorized to \n     acquire foreign intelligence under section 702(a) are \n     authorized to review compliance of their agency or element \n     with the targeting and minimization procedures adopted in \n     accordance with subsections (d) and (e) and the guidelines \n     adopted in accordance with subsection (f). Subsections \n     (l)(2)(B) and (l)(2)(C) mandate several statistics that the \n     IGs shall review with respect to United States persons, \n     including the number of disseminated intelligence reports \n     that contain references to particular U.S. persons, the \n     number of U.S. persons whose identities were disseminated in \n     response to particular requests, and the number of targets \n     later determined to be located in the United States. Their \n     reports shall be submitted to the Attorney General, the DNI, \n     and the appropriate congressional committees. Section \n     702(l)(2) provides no statutory schedule for the completion \n     of these IG reviews; the IGs should coordinate with the heads \n     of their agencies about the timing for completion of the IG \n     reviews so that they are done at a time that would be useful \n     for the agency heads to complete their semiannual reviews.\n       Third, under subsection (l)(3), the head of an intelligence \n     community element that conducts an acquisition under section \n     702 shall review annually whether there is reason to believe \n     that foreign intelligence information has been or will be \n     obtained from the acquisition and provide an accounting of \n     information pertaining to United States persons similar to \n     that included in the IG report. Subsection (l)(3) also \n     encourages the\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\n     head of the element to develop procedures to assess the \n     extent to which the new authority acquires the communications \n     of U.S. persons, and to report the results of such \n     assessment. The review is to be used by the head of the \n     element to evaluate the adequacy of minimization procedures. \n     The annual review is to be submitted to the FISA Court, the \n     Attorney General and the DNI, and to the appropriate \n     congressional committees.\n     Section 703. Certain Acquisition Inside the United States \n         Targeting United States Persons Outside the United States\n       Section 703 governs the targeting of United States persons \n     who are reasonably believed to be outside the United States \n     when the acquisition of foreign intelligence is conducted \n     inside the United States. The authority and procedures of \n     section 703 apply when the acquisition either constitutes \n     electronic surveillance, as defined in Title I of FISA, or is \n     of stored electronic communications or stored electronic \n     data. If the United States person returns to the United \n     States, acquisition under section 703 must cease. The \n     Government may always, however, obtain an order or \n     authorization under another title of FISA.\n       The application procedures and provisions for a FISA Court \n     order in sections 703(b) and 703(c) are drawn from Titles I \n     and III of FISA. Key among them is the requirement that the \n     FISA Court determine that there is probable cause to believe \n     that, for the United States person who is the target of the \n     surveillance, the person is reasonably believed to be located \n     outside the United States and is a foreign power or an agent, \n     officer or employee of a foreign power. The inclusion of \n     United States persons who are officers or employees of a \n     foreign power, as well as those who are agents of a foreign \n     power as that term is used in FISA, is intended to permit the \n     type of collection against United States persons outside the \n     United States that has been allowed under existing Executive \n     Branch guidelines. The FISA Court shall also review and \n     approve minimization procedures that will be applicable to \n     the acquisition, and shall order compliance with such \n     procedures.\n       As with FISA orders against persons in the United States, \n     FISA orders against United States persons outside of the \n     United States under section 703 may not exceed 90 days and \n     may be renewed for additional 90-day periods upon the \n     submission of renewal applications. Emergency authorizations \n     under section 703 are consistent with the requirements for \n     emergency authorizations in FISA against persons in the \n     United States, as amended by this Act; the Attorney General \n     may authorize an emergency acquisition if an application is \n     submitted to the FISA Court in not more than seven days.\n       Section 703(g) is a construction provision that clarifies \n     that, if the Government obtains an order and target a \n     particular United States person in accordance with section \n     703, FISA does not require the Government to seek a court \n     order under any other provision of FISA to target that United \n     States person while that person is reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.\n     Section 704. Other Acquisitions Targeting United States \n         Persons Outside the United States\n       Section 704 governs other acquisitions that target United \n     States persons who are outside the United States. Sections \n     702 and 703 address acquisitions that constitute electronic \n     surveillance or the acquisition of stored electronic \n     communications. In contrast, as provided in section \n     704(a)(2), section 704 addresses any targeting of a United \n     States person outside of the United States under \n     circumstances in which that person has a reasonable \n     expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required if the \n     acquisition occurred within the United States. It thus covers \n     not only communications intelligence, but, if it were to \n     occur, the physical search of a home, office, or business of \n     a United States person by an element of the United States \n     intelligence community, outside of the United States.\n       Pursuant to section 704(a)(3), if the targeted United \n     States person is reasonably believed to be in the United \n     States while an order under section 704 is in effect, the \n     acquisition against that person shall cease unless authority \n     is obtained under another applicable provision of FISA. \n     Likewise, the Government may not use section 704 to authorize \n     an acquisition of foreign intelligence inside the United \n     States.\n       Section 704(b) describes the application to the FISA Court \n     that is required. For an order under section 704(c), the FISA \n     Court must determine that there is probable cause to believe \n     that the United States person who is the target of the \n     acquisition is reasonably believed to be located outside the \n     United States and is a foreign power, or an agent, officer or \n     employee of a foreign power. An order is valid for a period \n     not to exceed 90 days, and may be renewed for additional 90-\n     day periods upon submission of renewal applications meeting \n     application requirements.\n       Because an acquisition under section 704 is conducted \n     outside the United States, or is otherwise not covered by \n     FISA, the FISA Court is expressly not given jurisdiction to \n     review the means by which an acquisition under this section \n     may be conducted. Although the FISA Court's review is limited \n     to determinations of probable cause, section 704 anticipates \n     that any acquisition conducted pursuant to a section 704 \n     order will in all other respects be conducted in compliance \n     with relevant regulations and Executive Orders governing the \n     acquisition of foreign intelligence outside the United \n     States, including Executive Order 12333 or any successor \n     order.\n     Section 705. Joint Applications and Concurrent Authorizations\n       Section 705 provides that if an acquisition targeting a \n     United States person under section 703 or 704 is proposed to \n     be conducted both inside and outside the United States, a \n     judge of the FISA Court may issue simultaneously, upon the \n     request of the Government in a joint application meeting the \n     requirements of sections 703 and 704, orders under both \n     sections as appropriate. If an order authorizing electronic \n     surveillance or physical search has been obtained under \n     section 105 or section 304, and that order is still in \n     effect, the Attorney General may authorize, without an order \n     under section 703 or 704, the targeting of that United States \n     person for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence \n     information while such person is reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.\n     Section 706. Use of Information Acquired Under Title VII\n       Section 706 fills a void that has existed under the Protect \n     America Act which had contained no provision governing the \n     use of acquired intelligence. Section 706(a) provides that \n     information acquired from an acquisition conducted under \n     section 702 shall be deemed to be information acquired from \n     an electronic surveillance pursuant to Title I of FISA for \n     the purposes of section 106 of FISA, which is the provision \n     of Title I of FISA that governs public disclosure or use in \n     criminal proceedings. The one exception is for subsection (j) \n     of section 106, as the notice provision in that subsection, \n     while manageable in individual Title I proceedings, would \n     present a difficult national security question when applied \n     to a Title VII acquisition. Section 706(b) also provides that \n     information acquired from an acquisition conducted under \n     section 703 shall be deemed to be information acquired from \n     an electronic surveillance pursuant to Title I of FISA for \n     the purposes of section 106 of FISA; however, the notice \n     provision of subsection (j) applies. Section 706 ensures that \n     a uniform standard for the types of information is acquired \n     under the new title.\n     Section 707. Congressional Oversight\n       Section 707 provides for additional congressional oversight \n     of the implementation of Title VII. The Attorney General is \n     to fully inform ``in a manner consistent with national \n     security'' the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees about implementation of the Act at least \n     semiannually. Each report is to include any certifications \n     made under section 702, the reasons for any determinations \n     made under section 702(c)(2), any directives issued during \n     the reporting period, a description of the judicial review \n     during the reporting period to include a copy of any order or \n     pleading that contains a significant legal interpretation of \n     section 702, incidents of noncompliance and procedures to \n     implement the section. With respect to sections 703 and 704, \n     the report must contain the number of applications made for \n     orders under each section and the number of such orders \n     granted, modified and denied, as well as the number of \n     emergency authorizations made pursuant to each section and \n     the subsequent orders approving or denying the relevant \n     application. In keeping the congressional intelligence \n     committees fully informed, the Attorney General should \n     provide no less information than has been provided in the \n     past in keeping the committees fully and currently informed.\n     Section 708. Savings Provision\n       Section 708 provides that nothing in Title VII shall be \n     construed to limit the authority of the Government to seek an \n     order or authorization under, or otherwise engage in any \n     activity that is authorized under, any other title of FISA. \n     This language is designed to ensure that Title VII cannot be \n     interpreted to prevent the Government from submitting \n     applications and seeking orders under other titles of FISA.\n     Section 101(b). Table of Contents\n       Section 101(b) of the bill amends the table of contents in \n     the first section of FISA.\n     Subsection 101(c). Technical and Conforming Amendments\n       Section 101(c) of the bill provides for technical and \n     conforming amendments in Title 18 of the United States Code \n     and in FISA.\n     Section 102. Statement of Exclusive Means by which Electronic \n         Surveillance and Interception of Certain Communications \n         May Be Conducted\n       Section 102(a) amends Title I of FISA by adding a new \n     Section 112 of FISA. Under the heading of ``Statement of \n     Exclusive Means by which Electronic Surveillance and \n     Interception of Certain Communications May Be Conducted,'' \n     the new section 112(a) states: ``Except as provided in \n     subsection (b), the procedures of chapters 119, 121 and \n     126 of Title 18, United States Code, and this Act shall be \n     the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and \n     the interception of domestic wire, oral, or electronic \n     communication may be conducted.'' New section 112(b) of \n     FISA provides that only an express statutory authorization \n     for electronic surveillance or the interception of \n     domestic wire, oral, or electronic communications, other \n     than as an amendment to FISA or chapters 119, 121, or 206 \n     of Title 18 shall constitute an additional exclusive means \n     for the\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\n     purpose of subsection (a). The new section 112 is based on \n     a provision which Congress enacted in 1978 as part of the \n     original FISA that is codified in section 2511(2)(f) of \n     Title 18, United States Code, and which will remain in the \n     U.S. Code.\n       Section 102(a) strengthens the statutory provisions \n     pertaining to electronic surveillance and interception of \n     certain communications to clarify the express intent of \n     Congress that these statutory provisions are the exclusive \n     means for conducting electronic surveillance and interception \n     of certain communications. With the absence of reference to \n     the Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. 107-40, \n     (September 18, 2001) (``AUMF''), Congress makes clear that \n     this AUMF or any other existing statute cannot be used in the \n     future as the statutory basis for circumventing FISA. Section \n     102(a) is intended to ensure that additional exclusive means \n     for surveillance or interceptions shall be express statutory \n     authorizations.\n       In accord with section 102(b) of the bill, section 109 of \n     FISA that provides for criminal penalties for violations of \n     FISA, is amended to implement the exclusivity requirement \n     added in section 112 by making clear that the safe harbor to \n     FISA's criminal offense provision is limited to statutory \n     authorizations for electronic surveillance or the \n     interception of domestic wire, oral, or electronic \n     communications which are pursuant to a provision of FISA, one \n     of the enumerated chapters of the criminal code, or a \n     statutory authorization that expressly provides an additional \n     exclusive means for conducting the electronic surveillance. \n     By virtue of the cross-reference in section 110 of FISA to \n     section 109, that limitation on the safe harbor in section \n     109 applies equally to section 110 on civil liability for \n     conducting unlawful electronic surveillance.\n       Section 102(c) requires that when a certification for \n     assistance to obtain foreign intelligence is based on \n     statutory authority, the certification provided to an \n     electronic communication service provider is to include the \n     specific statutory authorization for the request for \n     assistance and certify that the statutory requirements have \n     been met. This provision is designed to assist electronic \n     communication service providers in understanding the legal \n     basis for any government requests for assistance.\n       In the section-by-section analysis of S. 2248, the report \n     of the Select Committee on Intelligence (S. Rep. No. 110-209, \n     at 18) described and incorporated the discussion of \n     exclusivity in the 1978 conference report on the original \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, in particular the \n     conferees' description of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. \n     v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) and the application of \n     the principles described there to the current legislation. \n     That full discussion should be deemed incorporated in this \n     section-by-section analysis.\n     Section 103. Submittal to Congress of Certain Court Orders \n         under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\n       Section 6002 of the Intelligence Reform Act and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-458), added a Title VI to \n     FISA that augments the semiannual reporting obligations of \n     the Attorney General to the intelligence and judiciary \n     committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. Under \n     section 6002, the Attorney General shall report a summary of \n     significant legal interpretations of FISA in matters before \n     the FISA Court or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \n     Review. The requirement extends to interpretations presented \n     in applications or pleadings filed with either court by the \n     Department of Justice. In addition to the semiannual summary, \n     the Department of Justice is required to provide copies of \n     court decisions, but not orders, which include significant \n     interpretations of FISA. The importance of the reporting \n     requirement is that, because the two courts conduct their \n     business in secret, Congress needs the reports to know how \n     the law it has enacted is being interpreted.\n       Section 103 improves the Title VI reporting requirements in \n     three ways. First, as significant legal interpretations may \n     be included in orders as well as opinions, section 103 \n     requires that orders also be provided to the committees. \n     Second, as the semiannual report often takes many months \n     after the end of the semiannual period to prepare, section \n     103 accelerates provision of information about significant \n     legal interpretations by requiring the submission of such \n     decisions, orders, or opinions within 45 days. Finally, \n     section 103 requires that the Attorney General shall submit a \n     copy of any such decision, order, or opinion, and any \n     pleadings, applications, or memoranda of law associated with \n     such decision, order, or opinion, from the period five years \n     preceding enactment of the bill that has not previously been \n     submitted to the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees.\n\n\n    Overview of Sections 104 through Section 109. FISA Streamlining\n\n       Sections 104 through 109 amend various sections of FISA for \n     such purposes as reducing a paperwork requirement, modifying \n     time requirements, or providing additional flexibility in \n     terms of the range of Government officials who may authorize \n     FISA actions. Collectively, these amendments are described as \n     streamlining amendments. In general, they are intended to \n     increase the efficiency of the FISA process without depriving \n     the FISA Court of the information it needs to make findings \n     required under FISA.\n     Section 104. Applications for Court Orders\n       Section 104 of the bill strikes two of the eleven \n     paragraphs on standard information in an application for a \n     surveillance order under section 104 of FISA, either because \n     the information is provided elsewhere in the application \n     process or is not needed.\n       In various places, FISA has required the submission of \n     ``detailed'' information, as in section 104 of FISA, ``a \n     detailed description of the nature of the information sought \n     and the type of communications or activities to be subjected \n     to the surveillance.'' The DNI requested legislation that \n     asked that ``summary'' be substituted for ``detailed'' for \n     this and other application requirements, in order to reduce \n     the length of FISA applications. In general, the bill \n     approaches this by eliminating the mandate for ``detailed'' \n     descriptions, leaving it to the FISA Court and the Government \n     to work out the level of specificity needed by the FISA Court \n     to perform its statutory responsibilities. With respect to \n     one item of information, ``a statement of the means by which \n     the surveillance will be effected,'' the bill modifies the \n     requirement by allowing for ``a summary statement.''\n       In aid of flexibility, section 104 increases the number of \n     individuals who may make FISA applications by allowing the \n     President to designate the Deputy Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') as one of those \n     individuals. This should enable the Government to move more \n     expeditiously to obtain certifications when the Director of \n     the FBI is away from Washington or otherwise unavailable.\n       Subsection (b) of section 104 of FISA is eliminated as \n     obsolete in light of current applications. The Director of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency is added to the list of \n     officials who may make a written request to the Attorney \n     General to personally review a FISA application as the head \n     of the CIA had this authority prior to the establishment of \n     the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n     Section 105. Issuance of an Order\n       Section 105 strikes from Section 105 of FISA several \n     unnecessary or obsolete provisions. Section 105 strikes \n     subsection (c)(1)(F) of Section 105 of FISA which requires \n     minimization procedures applicable to each surveillance \n     device employed because Section 105(c)(2)(A) requires each \n     order approving electronic surveillance to direct the \n     minimization procedures to be followed.\n       Subsection (a)(6) reorganizes, in more readable form, the \n     emergency surveillance provision of section 105(f), now \n     redesignated section 105(e), with a substantive change of \n     extending from 3 to 7 days the time by which the Attorney \n     General must apply for and obtain a court order after \n     authorizing an emergency surveillance. The purpose of the \n     change is to help make emergency authority a more practical \n     tool while keeping it within the parameters of FISA.\n       Subsection (a)(7) adds a new paragraph to section 105 of \n     FISA to require the FISA Court, on the Government's request, \n     when granting an application for electronic surveillance, to \n     authorize at the same time the installation and use of pen \n     registers and trap and trace devices. This will save the \n     paperwork that had been involved in making two applications.\n     Section 106. Use of Information\n       Section 106 amends section 106(i) of FISA with regard to \n     the limitations on the use of unintentionally acquired \n     information. Currently, section 106(i) of FISA provides that \n     unintentionally acquired radio communication between persons \n     located in the United States must be destroyed unless the \n     Attorney General determines that the contents of the \n     communications indicates a threat of death or serious bodily \n     harm to any person. Section 106 of the bill amends subsection \n     106(i) of FISA by making it technology neutral on the \n     principle that the same rule for the use of information \n     indicating threats of death or serious harm should apply no \n     matter how the communication is transmitted.\n     Section 107. Amendments for Physical Searches\n       Section 107 makes changes to Title III of FISA: changing \n     applications and orders for physical searches to correspond \n     to changes in sections 104 and 105 on reduction of some \n     application paperwork; providing the FBI with administrative \n     flexibility in enabling its Deputy Director to be a \n     certifying officer; and extending the time, from 3 days to 7 \n     days, for applying for and obtaining a court order after \n     authorization of an emergency search.\n       Section 303(a)(4)(C), which will be redesignated section \n     303(a)(3)(C), requires that each application for physical \n     search authority state the applicant's belief that the \n     property is ``owned, used, possessed by, or is in transmit to \n     or from'' a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. In \n     order to provide needed flexibility and to make the provision \n     consistent with electronic surveillance provisions, section \n     107(a)(1)(D) of the bill allows the FBI to apply for \n     authority to search property that also is ``about to be'' \n     owned, used, or possessed by a foreign power or agent of a \n     foreign power, or in transit to or from one.\n     Section 108. Amendments for Emergency Pen Registers and Trap \n         and Trace Devices\n       Section 108 amends section 403 of FISA to extend from 2 \n     days to 7 days the time for applying for and obtaining a \n     court order after an emergency installation of a pen register \n     or trap and trace device. This change harmonizes among FISA's \n     provisions for electronic surveillance, search, and pen \n     register/\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\n     trap and trace authority the time requirements that follow \n     the Attorney General's decision to take emergency action.\n     Section 109. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n       Section 109 contains four amendments to section 103 of \n     FISA, which establishes the FISA Court and the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.\n       Section 109(a) amends section 103 to provide that judges on \n     the FISA Court shall be drawn from ``at least seven'' of the \n     United States judicial circuits. The current requirement--\n     that the eleven judges be drawn from seven judicial circuits \n     (with the number appearing to be a ceiling rather than a \n     floor) has proven unnecessarily restrictive or complicated \n     for the designation of the judges to the FISA Court.\n       Section 109(b) amends section 103 to allow the FISA Court \n     to hold a hearing or rehearing of a matter en banc, which is \n     by all the judges who constitute the FISA Court sitting \n     together. The Court may determine to do this on its own \n     initiative, at the request of the Government in any \n     proceeding under FISA, or at the request of a party in the \n     few proceedings in which a private entity or person may be a \n     party, i.e., challenges to document production orders under \n     Title V, or proceedings on the legality or enforcement of \n     directives to electronic communication service providers \n     under Title VII.\n       Under section 109(b), en banc review may be ordered by a \n     majority of the judges who constitute the FISA Court upon a \n     determination that it is necessary to secure or maintain \n     uniformity of the court's decisions or that a particular \n     proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance. En \n     banc proceedings should be rare and in the interest of the \n     general objective of fostering expeditious consideration of \n     matters before the FISA Court.\n       Section 109(c) provides authority for the entry of stays, \n     or the entry of orders modifying orders entered by the FISA \n     Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \n     Review, pending appeal or review in the Supreme Court. This \n     authority is supplemental to, and does not supersede, the \n     specific provision in section 702(i)(4)(B) that acquisitions \n     under Title VII may continue during the pendency of any \n     rehearing en banc and appeal to the Court of Review subject \n     to the requirement for a determination within 60 days under \n     section 702(i)(4)(C).\n       Section 109(d) provides that nothing in FISA shall be \n     construed to reduce or contravene the inherent authority of \n     the FISA Court to determine or enforce compliance with any \n     order of that court or with a procedure approved by it.\n     Section 110. Weapons of Mass Destruction\n       Section 110 amends the definitions in FISA of foreign power \n     and agent of a foreign power to include individuals who are \n     not United States persons and entities not substantially \n     composed of United States persons that are engaged in the \n     international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \n     Section 110 also adds a definition of weapon of mass \n     destruction to the Act that defines weapons of mass \n     destruction to cover explosive, incendiary, or poison gas \n     devices that are designed, intended to, or have the \n     capability to cause a mass casualty incident or death, and \n     biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that are designed, \n     intended to, or have the capability to cause illness or \n     serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons. \n     Section 110 also makes corresponding, technical and \n     conforming changes to FISA.\n\n  Title II. Protections for Electronic Communication Service Providers\n\n       This title establishes a new Title VIII of FISA. The title \n     addresses liability relief for electronic communication \n     service providers who have been alleged in various civil \n     actions to have assisted the U.S. Government between \n     September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, when the Attorney \n     General announced the termination of the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program. In addition, Title VIII contains \n     provisions of law intended to implement statutory defenses \n     for electronic communication service providers and others who \n     assist the Government in accordance with precise, existing \n     legal requirements, and for providing for federal preemption \n     of state investigations. The liability protection provisions \n     of Title VIII are not subject to sunset.\n     Section 801. Definitions\n       Section 801 establishes definitions for Title VIII. Several \n     are of particular importance.\n       The term ``assistance'' is defined to mean the provision \n     of, or the provision of access to, information, facilities, \n     or another form of assistance. The word ``information'' is \n     itself described in a parenthetical to include communication \n     contents, communication records, or other information \n     relating to a customer or communications. ``Contents'' is \n     defined by reference to its meaning in Title I of FISA. By \n     that reference, it includes any information concerning the \n     identity of the parties to a communication or the existence, \n     substance, purport, or meaning of it.\n       The term ``civil action'' is defined to include a ``covered \n     civil action.'' Thus, ``covered civil actions'' are a subset \n     of civil actions, and everything in new Title VIII that is \n     applicable generally to civil actions is also applicable to \n     ``covered civil actions.'' A ``covered civil action'' has two \n     key elements. It is defined as a civil action filed in a \n     federal or state court which (1) alleges that an electronic \n     communication service provider (a defined term) furnished \n     assistance to an element of the intelligence community and \n     (2) seeks monetary or other relief from the electronic \n     communication service provider related to the provision of \n     the assistance. Both elements must be present for the lawsuit \n     to be a covered civil action.\n       The term ``person'' (the full universe of those protected \n     by section 802) is necessarily broader than the definition of \n     electronic communication service provider. The aspects of \n     Title VIII that apply to those who assist the Government in \n     accordance with precise, existing legal requirements apply to \n     all who may be ordered to provide assistance under FISA, such \n     as custodians of records who may be directed to produce \n     records by the FISA Court under Title V of FISA or landlords \n     who may be required to provide access under Title I or III \n     of FISA, not just to electronic communication service \n     providers.\n     Section 802. Procedures for Implementing Statutory Defenses\n       Section 802 establishes procedures for implementing \n     statutory defenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no civil action may lie or be maintained in a federal or \n     state court against any person for providing assistance to an \n     element of the intelligence community, and shall be promptly \n     dismissed, if the Attorney General makes a certification to \n     the district court in which the action is pending. (If an \n     action had been commenced in state court, it would have to be \n     removed, pursuant to section 802(g) to a district court, \n     where a certification under section 802 could be filed.) The \n     certification must state either that the assistance was not \n     provided (section 802(a)(5)) or, if furnished, that it was \n     provided pursuant to specific statutory requirements \n     (sections 802(a)(1-4)). Three of these underlying \n     requirements, which are specifically described in section 802 \n     (sections 802(a)(1-3)), come from existing law. They include: \n     an order of the FISA Court directing assistance, a \n     certification in writing under sections 2511(2)(a)(ii)(B) or \n     2709(b) of Title 18, or directives to electronic \n     communication service providers under particular sections of \n     FISA or the Protect America Act.\n       The Attorney General may only make a certification under \n     the fourth statutory requirement, section 802(a)(4), if the \n     civil action is a covered civil action (as defined in section \n     801(5)). To satisfy the requirements of section 802(a)(4), \n     the Attorney General must certify first that the assistance \n     alleged to have been provided by the electronic communication \n     service provider was in connection with an intelligence \n     activity involving communications that was (1) authorized by \n     the President between September 11, 2001 and January 17, 2007 \n     and (2) designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack or \n     preparations for one against the United States. In addition, \n     the Attorney General must also certify that the assistance \n     was the subject of a written request or directive, or a \n     series of written requests or directives, from the Attorney \n     General or the head (or deputy to the head) of an element of \n     the intelligence community to the electronic communication \n     service provider indicating that the activity was (1) \n     authorized by the President and (2) determined to be lawful. \n     The report of the Select Committee on Intelligence contained \n     a description of the relevant correspondence provided to \n     electronic communication service providers (S. Rep. No. 110-\n     209, at 9).\n       The district court must give effect to the Attorney \n     General's certification unless the court finds it is not \n     supported by substantial evidence provided to the court \n     pursuant to this section. In its review, the court may \n     examine any relevant court order, certification, written \n     request or directive submitted by the Attorney General \n     pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or by the parties pursuant to \n     subsection (d). Section 802 is silent on the nature of any \n     additional materials that the Attorney General may submit \n     beyond those listed in subsection (b)(2) if the Attorney \n     General determines they are necessary to provide substantial \n     evidence to support the certification, such as if the \n     Attorney General certifies that a person did not provide the \n     alleged assistance.\n       If the Attorney General files a declaration that disclosure \n     of a certification or supplemental materials would harm \n     national security, the court shall review the certification \n     and supplemental materials in camera and ex parte, which \n     means with only the Government present. A public order \n     following that review shall be limited to a statement as to \n     whether the case is dismissed and a description of the legal \n     standards that govern the order, without disclosing the basis \n     for the certification of the Attorney General. The purpose of \n     this requirement is to protect the classified national \n     security information involved in the identification of \n     providers who assist the Government. A public order shall not \n     disclose whether the certification was based on an order, \n     certification, or directive, or on the ground that the \n     electronic communication service provider furnished no \n     assistance. Because the district court must find that the \n     certification--including a certification that states that a \n     party did not provide the alleged assistance--is supported by \n     substantial evidence in order to dismiss a case, an order \n     failing to dismiss a case is only a conclusion that the \n     substantial evidence test has not been met. It does not \n     indicate whether a particular provider assisted the \n     government.\n       Subsection (d) makes clear that any plaintiff or defendant \n     in a civil action may submit any relevant court order, \n     certification, written request, or directive to the district \n     court for review and be permitted to participate in the \n     briefing or argument of any legal\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n     issue in a judicial proceeding conducted pursuant to this \n     section, to the extent that such participation does not \n     require the disclosure of classified information to such \n     party. The authorities of the Attorney General under section \n     802 are to be performed only by the Attorney General, the \n     Acting Attorney General, or the Deputy Attorney General.\n       In adopting the portions of section 802 that allow for \n     liability protection for those electronic communication \n     service providers who may have participated in the program of \n     intelligence activity involving communications authorized by \n     the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, \n     2007, the Congress makes no statement on the legality of the \n     program. This is in accord with the statement in the report \n     of the Senate Intelligence Committee that ``Section 202 [as \n     the immunity provision was then numbered] makes no assessment \n     about the legality of the President's program.'' S. Rep. No. \n     110-209, at 9.\n     Section 803. Preemption of State Investigations\n       Section 803 addresses actions taken by a number of state \n     regulatory commissions to force disclosure of information \n     concerning cooperation by state regulated electronic \n     communication service providers with U.S. intelligence \n     agencies. Section 803 preempts these state actions and \n     authorizes the United States to bring suit to enforce the \n     prohibition.\n     Section 804. Reporting\n       Section 804 provides for oversight of the implementation of \n     Title VIII. On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General is to \n     provide to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on any certifications made under section 802, a description \n     of the judicial review of the certifications made under \n     section 802, and any actions taken to enforce the provisions \n     of section 803.\n     Section 202. Technical Amendments\n       Section 202 amends the table of contents of the first \n     section of FISA.\n\n                 Title III. Review of Previous Actions\n\n       Title III directs the Inspectors General of the Department \n     of Justice, the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the National \n     Security Agency, and any other element of the intelligence \n     community that participated in the President's surveillance \n     program, defined in the title to mean the intelligence \n     activity involving communications that was authorized by the \n     President during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, \n     and ending on January 17, 2007, to complete a comprehensive \n     review of the program with respect to the oversight authority \n     and responsibility of each such inspector general.\n       The review is to include: all of the facts necessary to \n     describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use \n     of the product of the program; access to legal reviews of the \n     program and information about the program; communications \n     with, and participation of, individuals and entities in the \n     private sector related to the program; interaction with the \n     FISA Court and transition to court orders related to the \n     program; and any other matters identified by any such \n     inspector general that would enable that inspector general \n     complete a review of the program with respect to the \n     inspector general's department or element.\n       The inspectors general are directed to work in conjunction, \n     to the extent practicable, with other inspectors general \n     required to conduct a review, and not unnecessarily duplicate \n     or delay any reviews or audits that have already been \n     completed or are being undertaken with respect to the \n     program. In addition, the Counsel of the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice is \n     directed to provide the report of any investigation of that \n     office relating to the program, including any investigation \n     of the process through which the legal reviews of the program \n     were conducted and the substance of such reviews, to the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who shall \n     integrate the factual findings and conclusions of such \n     investigation into its review.\n       The inspectors general shall designate one of the Senate \n     confirmed inspectors general required to conduct a review to \n     coordinate the conduct of the reviews and the preparation of \n     the reports. The inspectors general are to submit an interim \n     report within sixty days to the appropriate congressional \n     committees on their planned scope of review. The final report \n     is to be completed no later than one year after enactment and \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       The Congress is aware that the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Justice has undertaken a review of the program. \n     This review should serve as a significant part of the basis \n     for meeting the requirements of this title. In no event is \n     this title intended to delay or duplicate the investigation \n     completed to date or the issuance of any report by the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Justice.\n\n                       Title IV. Other Provisions\n\n     Section 401. Severability\n       Section 401 provides that if any provision of this bill or \n     its application is held invalid, the validity of the \n     remainder of the Act and its application to other persons or \n     circumstances is unaffected.\n     Section 402. Effective Date\n       Section 402 provides that except as provided in the \n     transition procedures (section 404 of the title), the \n     amendments made by the bill shall take effect immediately.\n     Section 403. Repeals\n       Section 403(a) provides for the repeal of those sections of \n     FISA enacted as amendments to FISA by the Protect America \n     Act, except as provided otherwise in the transition \n     procedures of section 404, and makes technical and conforming \n     amendments.\n       Section 403(b) provides for the sunset of the FISA \n     Amendments Act on December 31, 2012, except as provided in \n     section 404 of the bill. This date ensures that the \n     amendments by the Act will be reviewed during the next \n     presidential administration. The subsection also makes \n     technical and conforming amendments.\n     Section 404. Transition Procedures\n       Section 404 establishes transition procedures for the \n     Protect America Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act Amendments of 2008.\n       Subsection (a)(1) continues in effect orders, \n     authorizations, and directives issued under FISA, as amended \n     by section 2 of the Protect America Act, until the expiration \n     of such order, authorization or directive.\n       Subsection (a)(2) sets forth the provisions of FISA and the \n     Protect America Act that continue to apply to any acquisition \n     conducted under such Protect America Act order, authorization \n     or directive. In addition, subsection (a) clarifies the \n     following provisions of the Protect America Act: the \n     protection from liability provision of subsection (l) of \n     Section 105B of FISA as added by section 2 of the Protect \n     America Act; jurisdiction of the FISA Court with respect to a \n     directive issued pursuant to the Protect America Act, and the \n     Protect America Act reporting requirements of the Attorney \n     General and the DNI. Subsection (a) is made effective as of \n     the date of enactment of the Protect America Act (August 5, \n     2007). The purpose of these clarifications and the effective \n     date for them is to ensure that there are no gaps in the \n     legal protections contained in that act, including for \n     authorized collection following the sunset of the Protect \n     America Act, notwithstanding that its sunset provision was \n     only extended once until February 16, 2008. Additionally, \n     subsection (a)(3) fills a void in the Protect America Act and \n     applies the use provisions of section 106 of FISA to \n     collection under the Protect America Act, in the same manner \n     that section 706 does for collection under Title VII.\n       In addition, subsection (a)(7) makes clear that if the \n     Attorney General and the DNI seek to replace an authorization \n     made pursuant to the Protect America Act with an \n     authorization made under section 702, as added by this bill, \n     they are, to the extent practicable, to submit a \n     certification to the FISA Court at least 30 days in advance \n     of the expiration of such authorization. The authorizations, \n     and any directives issued pursuant to the authorization, are \n     to remain in effect until the FISA Court issues an order with \n     respect to that certification.\n       Subsection (b) provides similar treatment for any order of \n     the FISA Court issued under Title VII of this bill in effect \n     on December 31, 2012.\n       Subsection (c) provides transition procedures for the \n     authorizations in effect under section 2.5 of Executive Order \n     12333. Those authorizations shall continue in effect until \n     the earlier of the date that authorization expires or the \n     date that is 90 days after the enactment of this Act. This \n     transition provision is particularly applicable to the \n     transition to FISA Court orders that will occur as a result \n     of sections 703 and 704 of FISA, as added by this bill.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Before laying out where this bill improves upon the \nSenate-passed bill--and it does--let me first restate how proud I am of \nour efforts in February that laid the foundation for the final action \nwe will soon take. Our Senate bill established the framework for a \njudicial review of the targeting and minimization procedures which are \nat the heart of the present compromise. It also established clear \nauthority and procedures for individual judicial orders where there is \nprobable cause for targeting Americans overseas. This may long be \nregarded as the single most important innovation of the act we will \nsoon pass.\n  Additionally, during debate on our Senate bill, we identified other \nneeded improvements that have been addressed in this compromise, \nincluding strengthening exclusivity, something Senator Feinstein was a \ngreat advocate of, and also a shorter sunset, something Senator Cardin \nwanted to see happen; that is, when the bill sunsets, and it will end \nbefore the end of the next administration.\n  The bottom line is, we started with a good product in February and, \nthrough hard work and compromise with all parties in both Houses, we \nhave made it even stronger. And we have. We have. We are all slightly \naghast at what we were able to do. So let me mention a few of the key \nfeatures in this new compromise.\n  First, the agreement makes changes in the provisions related to \ntargeting foreigners overseas to increase protections for Americans. It \nrequires the\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nFISA Court to approve targeting and minimization procedures before \ncollections begin in virtually all instances. The Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence can move forward without a court \norder only in what will be extremely rare instances, if emergency \ncircumstances exist. And there is a way that is done which is time \nminimized, a total of 37 days, but it doesn't happen.\n  It preserves the definition of ``electronic surveillance.'' That is \nimportant. It doesn't sound very interesting, but it is important. It \npreserves that definition found in title I of FISA to ensure that there \nare no unintended consequences--that sounds like gobbledygook, but it \nisn't--relating to when a warrant must be obtained under FISA or how \ninformation obtained using FISA can be used. In other words, we leave \nthe definition of ``telecommunications'' exactly as it is. We do not \nchange it. If there is to be a change, then there must be legislative \naction to expand or make that change.\n  But unintended consequences is when something you do in one bill \naffects something that happened in another bill, and you just do not \nknow it at the time you are doing it. You have to be very careful about \nthat. So that is why we did that.\n  Second, the agreement contains additional measures compared to the \nSenate bill to improve oversight and accountability--the two greatest \nneeds we have in the Congress and for the administration.\n  It shortens the sunset of the legislation to December 31, 2012, to \nensure the FISA modernization law we are going to pass is reviewed in \nthe next administration.\n  It requires a comprehensive review by multiple inspectors general of \nthe President's warrantless surveillance program to ensure Congress has \na complete set of facts about the program. We will have them. We will \nbe informed. The public will be informed about that.\n  Third, the agreement assures that no past or future congressional \nauthorization for the use of military force may be used to justify the \nconduct of warrantless surveillance electronically, unless Congress \nexplicitly provides that can happen. That means the President cannot \never do what he did again. No other President can ever do that. FISA \nrules, and only the Congress can make the change.\n  With enactment of this agreement, there will be no question that \nCongress intends that only an express statutory authorization for \nelectronic surveillance or interception may constitute an additional \nexclusive means for that surveillance or interception. It is logical, \nand it is necessary.\n  This is reinforced by the clarification that criminal and civil \npenalties can be imposed for any electronic surveillance that is not \nconducted in accordance with FISA or specifically listed provisions of \ntitle XVIII. We are prepared to do criminal, civil fines. It is in the \nbill. It will happen if somebody tries to do something.\n  Finally, with respect to the liability protection provisions of title \nII, the new language is improved in a number of ways. The agreement \nmakes clear that the district court has the authority to review the \ndocuments provided to the companies to determine whether the Attorney \nGeneral has met the statutory requirements for the certification under \nthe statute.\n  In addition, the plaintiffs are given their fair day in court in our \nbill, as the parties to the litigation are explicitly provided the \nopportunity to brief the legal and constitutional issues before the \ncourt, to the court. And the district court, in deciding the question, \nmust go beyond whether the Attorney General abused his discretion in \npreparing his certification to seek the dismissal of a lawsuit. Under \nthe agreement, the district court must decide whether the Attorney \nGeneral's certification is supported by ``substantial evidence.'' It is \na good bar.\n  These are important additions and clarifications, and I hope many of \nmy colleagues will recognize how far we have come. Remember, this is a \nbill that the House would not even vote on a couple of months ago. They \nwould not even vote on it. So we just went over to them, to Steny \nHoyer, who deserves all praise for being an unbelievable moderator, \nbringer-together of opinions and people and a lot of people who are \nreluctant over there about doing anything, and gradually, through \ncompromise, through extensive consultation, worked it out so they could \nagree on the bill. Indeed, Speaker Pelosi went to the floor of the \nHouse and spoke as to why she was going to vote for the bill--which she \ndid.\n  Now, before I conclude, I must say a few words about all the people--\nand spare me on this, I say to the Presiding Officer--who worked \ntogether to make this happen.\n  House majority leader Steny Hoyer is--I have down here in my text ``a \nnear saint.'' I have decided that is in extremis. I think he is \nextraordinary--extraordinary. He deserves tremendous credit for his \nability to bring people together with strongly divergent views and not \ngive up until a compromise is achieved. He has everything on his plate, \nbut he always seemed to have time for--he kept saying he was not really \nschooled in this, but he knew everything that was going on.\n  Vice Chairman Bond and House Minority Whip Blunt also deserve our \nthanks and our praise for their hard work and unending commitment. The \nother leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees--Silvestre Reyes, Peter Hoekstra, John Conyers, Lamar Smith, \nand on our side Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter--not all of whom have or \nwill support the final bill--also deserve thanks for their valuable \ncontributions for making the legislation a much better product.\n  My own leader, Harry Reid, deserves special credit for insisting that \nwe persevere on protecting national security and civil liberties, even \nthough at times he believed he himself could not support our ultimate \ncompromise. I do not know what that result will be, but he has been \nterrific in pushing us.\n  In addition, we would not have reached this critical juncture without \nthe unlimited support of the Director of National Intelligence, Mike \nMcConnell, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, and the dedicated staff of \nthe DNI, DOJ, and NSA counsel, in particular Ben Powell, Brett Gerry, \nJohn Demers, Vito Potenza, and Chris Thuma. I did not think I would be \nsaying those words, but I am saying them, and I do believe them deeply. \nAll of those individuals worked with us for months on this issue, \nputting in long hours, even at times when there was not light at the \nend of the tunnel.\n  As we know all too well, the legislative efforts of the House and the \nSenate would come to a screeching halt if we were forced to operate \nwithout the seamless efforts of our staffs.\n  I would like to thank my exceptionally talented staff: Andy Johnson, \nMike Davidson, Alissa Starzak, Chris Healey, and Melvin Dubee--all of \nwhom brought an enormous amount of expertise, creativity, and \nperseverance to the table.\n  I want to single out Mike Davidson. Mike Davidson is a very smart \nlawyer. He has this way of when everything is collapsing all about \nhim--it is kind of a let's come and reason together. Let's be \npractical. He is such a good person and so smart and so respected for \nwhat he knows that people follow his lead. It was in many ways because \nof him that a lot of our problems got solved. He would not quit on \nthem, and he would keep saying: Now, let's deal with this practically. \nAnd he uses his hands just in that manner. It worked because we have a \nbill.\n  I would also like to thank Mariah Sixkiller, Brian Diffel, Joe Onek, \nMike Sheehy, Jeremy Bash, Wyndee Parker, Eric Greenwald, Chris Donesa, \nLou DeBaca, Perry Apelbaum, Ted Kalo, and Caroline Lynch in the House \nof Representatives; and in the Senate, Louis Tucker, Jack Livingston, \nKathleen Rice, Mary DeRosa, Zulima Espinel, Matt Solomon, Nick Rossi, \nRon Weich, Serena Hoy, and Marcel Lettre for their efforts.\n  I may have left somebody out. But I think the Presiding Officer \nthinks I have probably done enough. It is heartfelt, and if you have \nbeen through the process you really feel what people put into it and \nwhat they give up.\n  Madam President, this is a very proud day for the Senate, for \nnational security and civil liberties, and for the Congress in general. \nI would venture to say this may be the most important bill we will pass \nthis year. We have proven that compromise is not a lost virtue and that \ngood, sound policy is not only possible, it is achievable.\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see my good friend from West Virginia on \nthe floor. While I have some disagreement with him on the effort he has \nmade on the FISA bill, I commend my friend from West Virginia. He has \nthe thankless task of heading up the Intelligence Committee, which is a \ndifficult job. I wish to acknowledge that and recognize that. My \nrespect for him and the work he is doing and trying to do on this issue \nis something I respect immensely. Unfortunately, we don't agree on one \naspect--at least one aspect--of this bill, but that in no way \ndiminishes my respect for the effort he has made to try to produce as \ngood a bill as he can under the circumstances. You only have to try and \nmanage a bill around here to understand how difficult that can be, as \nsomeone who is engaged right now in this housing proposal.\n  Senator Shelby and I have spent weeks putting together a bill that \nhas enjoyed almost unanimous support in our committee--19 to 2--coming \nout of the Banking Committee. We had the vote of 83 to 9 the other day \non a cloture motion to deal with a proposal we put together covering \neverything from mortgage revenue bonds and tax incentives for people to \nbuy foreclosed properties, not to mention the GSE--the government \nsponsored enterprises--reform, an affordable housing program in \nperpetuity to assist rental housing opportunities in the Nation, as \nwell as the HOPE for Homeowners Act to deal with the foreclosure \ncrisis. Here we are now approaching the late afternoon of Wednesday. We \nhad the cloture vote yesterday morning, about 30 hours ago. We have yet \nto have one amendment I can deal with because one Senator is insisting \nthat his bill be paramount, that we disregard the efforts we have made \nto listen to ideas, to take additional suggestions that have come from \nother Members to incorporate as part of this bill.\n  Senator Kohl of Wisconsin has a very good proposal which we have \nworked out. Senator Sununu has made a proposal as well and we have been \nable to modify it and work with him to be a part of it. Senator Isakson \nhas made a proposal we are working on to deal with a date in this bill \nthat could make a difference. Senator Bond has a proposal we are \nworking on dealing with disclosures. Senator Kohl and Senator Nelson \nare working on a proposal dealing with 401(k)s. All of these ideas have \nto be held in abeyance because one Senator won't even let us consider \nthese matters on the floor, to bring them up and to deal with them.\n  It is awfully difficult to understand, when you consider that between \n8,000 and 9,000 people every day are filing for foreclosure in this \ncountry. This is the center of our economic problems in the Nation.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported today in a banner headline that \nconsumer confidence in this Nation is at the lowest point it has been \nsince the late 1980s, early 1990s. A report yesterday actually takes it \nback to 1967. We are also told that home values are declining by the \nhour in this country. The Case-Schiller Index indicates that home \nvalues may decline by as much as 30 percent over the next 2 or 3 years. \nThis is affecting student loans, it is affecting municipal finance, and \nit is affecting commercial borrowing. We are literally in a stall with \nthe economy growing worse and the level of optimism and confidence of \nthe American people declining at a rapid rate.\n  There is nothing more important we could do before adjourning for the \nnext week to go home for Independence Day than to deal with this bill. \nWe could literally complete this housing bill in about an hour. That is \nabout all it would take to consider the amendments we can agree to, to \nadopt the ones we have, and then move this bill off this floor, out of \nthis Chamber to the point that I think the House may accept what we \nhave done, and send the bill to the President for his signature.\n  What better message to send to those who are facing potential \nforeclosure, of losing their most important and valuable asset that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans will ever have, not just in \nfinancial terms, but in the context of having a home for their \nfamilies. This is something most Americans wish for their children, \nwish for their grandchildren, wish to have themselves, that idea of a \nhome where you grow up and live. The fact that between 8,000 and 9,000 \npeople--not on a weekly basis, not on a monthly basis, but every single \nday--every day we are home next week, every day we are gone from here, \nremind yourselves that another 9,000 people are beginning to file \nforeclosure and losing their homes. Neighborhoods collapse, values in \nthese neighborhoods go down, and we see the continued suffering that \ngoes on in our country, all because I can't even bring up and allow \nconsideration of some amendments on this bill.\n  We have been at this now since January, trying to put this together \nand here we are in late June and still unable to get even consideration \nof amendments or to vote on some we may disagree with. There are many \nothers of our colleagues here who have some ideas. I failed to mention \nSenator Voinovich. We have proposals from Senator Levin and Senator \nStabenow involving important projects in their State, not to mention \nMassachusetts as well. There are a number of other things included in \nthis legislation providing the kind of support for those who are out \nthere, including counseling to people going through foreclosure or who \ncould go through foreclosure. All of these elements could make a \ndifference; the community development block grants to mayors, county \nsupervisors, and Governors that could provide some targeted help in \nneighborhoods that have foreclosed properties.\n  We learn from screaming headlines on a daily basis--you need not hear \nmy voice; just listen to what is going on in almost every State in the \ncountry. Now the States of California and Nevada are particularly hard-\npressed, as well as Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and Ohio are seeing \nthese numbers at record levels. The State of Nevada, in fact, I think, \non a per capita basis has the worst foreclosure rate in the country, \nwhat that State is going through and the people are suffering from in \nthat jurisdiction, with 10, I am told, centers around the State trying \nto help people hang on to their homes if they can.\n  Here we have a proposal that would provide that kind of relief, a \nsystem that would allow for workouts where people could have a new \nmortgage they could afford to pay, as well as paying into the program \nat some cost, and the lenders taking, of course, a significant cut in \nwhat they would otherwise be getting. But it would allow us to keep \npeople in their homes.\n  So in those States that are feeling this particularly, I want them to \nknow there are those of us here--and they ought to know the majority \nleader of this body, Senator Harry Reid, has been on the forefront of \ntrying to get this bill up, trying to allow us to vote on it to get the \njob done. I wish to thank him for that, as the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, to have a majority leader who understands this priority is \nat the top of our list. I am deeply grateful to him for making it \npossible for us to get as far as we have.\n  But to know we are down here with a few remaining hours before we \nwill be leaving for a week or 10 days; knowing that in that period of \ntime, unnecessarily, in my view, more Americans may end up paying that \nawful price, watching their home value decline, watching them possibly \nlose their homes; that idea of being able to build that equity and \nprovide for your children's education, to contribute to your \nretirement, to deal with an unexpected illness in the family where that \nequity could make a difference, all of that is eroding because we can't \nget off the dime because we have a colleague who wants to insist that \nhis proposal be paramount, that we drop everything else and deal with \nthat bill. I say that respectfully. I have been here 27 years and this \nhappens periodically. But at this moment, at this time, facing the \nworst crisis in housing since the Great Depression, this is not the \nkind of reaction we ought to be getting.\n  I am going to come here periodically as long as we are here to talk \nabout this. I will make unanimous consent requests, or the leader will, \nto try and\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nlet us move on this. When objection is heard, then that Senator ought \nto have the courage, in my view, to stand up and express that objection \non why we can't deal with this housing bill. Even if you disagree with \nthe bill, allow us to vote. Allow your colleagues to offer their \namendments. They need to explain to the American people why it is that \nafter all of this effort, with an 83-to-9 vote yesterday, that \nDemocrats and Republicans want to do something about housing, but we \ncan't get a bill up and can't consider these outstanding amendments.\n  I apologize to my colleagues for this, but they ought to know what is \ngoing on and why it is. Members have asked me: Why aren't we voting? \nWhy can't we bring up these matters? The reason is because I need \nunanimous consent to do so and one Senator can object, and because they \nobject, none of these other amendments, Republican or Democratic \namendments, can be considered or modified, even, in this context. So \nthat is why we are here and where we are. If people are wondering why, \nafter this long time, despite the efforts of bringing people together, \nwe are not managing to get this bill done, that is the reason. My hope \nis that common sense and reasonableness may prevail in the coming hour \nor so that will allow us to get to this. But if we are unable to do so, \nthen that is the reason.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am hoping very shortly we will vote on \nor act on or somehow pass an amendment that I have offered, offered on \nthe previous housing bill which, incidentally, I thought was a much \nbetter bill than this one.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for--well, Madam President, I am \ngoing to continue to tell you that.\n  The teaser rate problem is one which has afflicted many borrowers in \nMissouri. They get these offers for loan rates. They are told, \nverbally, that they can get a good rate when the time expires. The \nproblem is, it is not in writing. So we would require full disclosure \nin advance, written down. If the people are going to make a \nrepresentation, it has to be a binding representation. My amendment is \ndesigned to advise consumers, before they purchase a home, what they \nare going to have to pay.\n  I understand there is a modification that will make this amendment \nacceptable to all sides. I think it is terribly important to avoid \nputting so many people, in the future, in the trap that they now find \nthemselves, that we require they disclose what the rates will be, and \nif they want to offer good terms, they put them in writing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as modified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time postcloture has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to concur, with an amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise to engage Senator Dodd in a \ncolloquy discussing the amendment offered by Senator Dole concerning \nappraisal standards. I would like to acknowledge the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina for her efforts in crafting this amendment.\n  In December of last year, Attorney General Cuomo of New York, along \nwith Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and OFHEO entered into an agreement to \ncreate a mortgage appraiser code of conduct. I applaud the work of the \nattorney general of New York for being proactive in trying to come up \nwith a code of conduct in order to deal with some of the problems in \nthe mortgage appraisal process.\n  While the ``code of conduct'' moves things in a positive direction, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are secondary market players, and the \nattorney general of New York has authority to deal with the conduct \nthat touches upon the State of New York. In order to fully address the \nissue and create a unified standard affecting all mortgage originators, \nthere must be a process involving all of the appropriate regulatory \nauthorities including the Federal banking regulators who participate in \nthe congressionally authorized Federal Financial Institutions \nExamination Counsel, FFIEC, subcommittee on appraisals. This would also \nprovide regulated institutions with adequate opportunity to participate \nin the process.\n  The National Bank Act authorizes national banks to engage in mortgage \nlending, subject to OCC regulation. Since the early 1990s, each of the \nFederal banking regulators has had standards in place that deal with \nthe conduct of mortgage appraisers. These standards were put in place \nto address many of the safety and soundness concerns that we are \ngrappling with today. While I recognize the need to update and \nstrengthen these standards, I believe that we need to be mindful of \nthat structure, and rely upon it as part of the effort to reform the \nappraisal process.\n  The appraisal is a key component in ensuring sound underwriting both \nfor banks and the consumer. I believe that the key concept of appraisal \nindependence is laudable and although incorporated into Federal banking \nregulation, perhaps this construct needs to be strengthened.\n  Our goal should be to ensure that a standard exists that avoids \ninconsistencies, provides stronger consumer protection, and protects \nthe safety and soundness of lending institutions. I believe that as a \nwake-up call to the regulators that their standards must be revamped \nand their enforcement stepped up.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and agree with him on several fronts. \nThe first is that I commend Attorney General Cuomo for his aggressive \npursuit in ferreting out fraudulent appraisal practices. Law \nenforcement has said repeatedly that unscrupulous appraisers are the \n``enablers'' of mortgage fraud.\n  Appraisers, seeking new business, are eager to ``hit the number'' \nneeded to make sure a mortgage is approved. If they fail to give the \nlenders and brokers the appraisal needed to close the loan, they simply \ndon't get any more referrals from those lenders. As a result, \nappraisers were inflating their estimates of house value, adding to the \nfrenzy that created the housing bubble.\n  The guidelines negotiated by Attorney General Cuomo with Fannie and \nFreddie, and approved by OFHEO, seek to ensure that this kind of \npressure cannot be brought to bear on appraisers. They are designed to \nensure independence and address the significant evidence of collusion \nbetween lenders and appraisers that Mr. Cuomo uncovered.\n  I understand there is great concern about the process for the reforms \nthe attorney general is demanding. I also understand that some people \ndon't like the new standards which will affect the practices of the \nlenders that sell their mortgages to Fannie and Freddie.\n  As a result, I agree with my colleague that the Federal banking \nagencies have a role in this process. These agencies already have \nregulations in place that set forth appraisal standards for their \nlenders. However, the appraisal fraud over the past couple of years, \nand the attorney general's action, should serve as a wake-up call to \nthe regulators that their standards must be revamped and their \nenforcement stepped up.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4984 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Dole amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendments of the House--this is on the housing bill--\nstriking titles VI through XI to the amendment of the Senate; and \nfinally that the Senate then disagree to the amendments of the House \nadding a new title and inserting a new section to the amendment of the \nSenate to H.R. 3221, notwithstanding rule XXII; further that a \nmanagers' amendment which has been cleared by the managers and the \nleaders also be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I will object. I have been attempting, \nwith the Senator in the chair right now, to attach the Clean Energy Tax \nStimulus amendment to the housing bill and get a vote on it. This is an \namendment that passed on the housing bill a couple months ago by a vote \nof 88 to 8 in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate.\n  People say: What does this have to do with housing? Well, it has \nseveral things to do with housing. There is energy efficiency built in \nfor new home construction. If somebody wants to upgrade their home with \nrenewable energy products, they can do that with the help of tax \ncredits in this amendment. It is a good amendment because this country \nis facing an energy crisis and gasoline prices are too high; home \nheating oil is too high; and natural gas has gone up by 70 percent. We \nneed to have more renewable energy in the United States. All we have to \ndo is have a vote on this amendment, and we could proceed with the \nhousing bill.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In a moment. I would say in closing that people have \nsaid--we can't do this. The House of Representatives would object \nbecause it isn't ``paid for.'' Well, there is $2.4 billion in unoffset \ntax provisions included in the Dodd/Shelby amendment and a large amount \nof this does not even relate to housing. Why should the House of \nRepresentatives accept $2.4 billion worth in tax incentives not paid \nfor and object to our clean energy tax provisions at the same time? \nThat is an example of why there is inconsistency in objecting to our \namendment being voted on.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to ask, through the Chair, \nthe Senator from Nevada if he could tell me the name of the State that \nhas had 17 consecutive months leading the Nation in foreclosures.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, there is no question that the whole \ncountry is facing a housing crisis and it is not just housing; it \nactually is leading to a liquidity problem, and my State like others \nhas experienced difficulties. I wish to solve this problem, and improve \nthis bill with the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus amendment----\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been very patient while my dear \nfriend, the junior Senator from Nevada, has talked about this. Here is \nthe situation in which we find ourselves. Everyone knows we have an \nextenders package. I have a letter on my desk that has been spread on \nthe Record previously--218 House Members have signed it--saying the \nHouse will not accept anything that is not paid for on the extenders. \nWe have a letter that is now also a part of the Record, more than 400 \ncompanies, most of them Fortune 400 companies, say it is very important \nto pass the extenders legislation paid for. We also had a statement in \nThe Hill newspaper yesterday, where the National Association of \nManufacturers said: Why can't they pass this bill? It is very important \nto pass the extenders. It is the most important thing the manufacturers \nneed in the country.\n  We have a situation where there was an agreement made on this bill, \nthe housing bill. The agreement was that they would be related to \nhousing. With all due respect, everyone knows the matter relating to \nthe extenders that my dear friend from Nevada talks about has--you have \nto stretch a lot to have it related to housing. Why would we want to \nsend something to the House and have them send it back to us? We have a \nsituation on the housing bill that Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nare going to take care of--the pay-fors. That is all part of the deal, \nand everyone knows that.\n  This is a situation where Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd have worked \nvery hard, and not only have they been working with the House, but they \nhave been working with the White House on this housing bill.\n  Let's look at where we are. The Senate has turned this week to a \nnumber of issues. We have had four main bills: Housing, FISA--the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act--Medicare fix, which is important \nto do; and the supplemental appropriations bill. As of this minute, we \nhaven't passed any of those because there have been continued \nobjections from the minority.\n  Now, there is no need to whip out a Velcro chart about the number of \nfilibusters we have had, but that is the reason we are in the position \nwe are in today, because we have this great big funnel of legislation \nthat needs to get done and now we have the little spout and that spout \nis the Fourth of July and it is hard to stuff everything into that. So \nwe have a situation now where there is no reason why housing, the \nMedicare fix, the supplemental appropriations bill can't be passed in \nthe next couple days.\n  We have all talked about FISA. I voted on the motion to proceed, not \nbecause I like the bill, but I think it is very important that there be \nan opportunity to offer amendments on it. Senator Bond and Senator \nRockefeller recognize that and know they would also feel it appropriate \nto have amendments on this legislation, but right now it appears we are \nnot going to have that opportunity. FISA enjoys support from both sides \nof the aisle. It, too, could be easily dealt with before the Fourth of \nJuly recess. All these bills are critical to the health, safety, and \nwell-being of the American people.\n  With thousands of American families losing their homes every day--\n8,500 new foreclosures every day--and millions more facing the \nshockwaves of abandoned properties and falling equity--and sometimes \nrapidly falling equity--it is important we act quickly. This housing \nlegislation raises limits on Federal home loans; it creates a privately \nfunded program to help distressed homeowners; it modernizes the Federal \nHousing Authority to keep pace with the current housing conditions; and \nit provides foreclosure counseling moneys to families in need.\n  This housing legislation enjoys overwhelming bipartisan support. \nThere is no reason we shouldn't pass this legislation.\n  On FISA, I recognize that Members of the House and Senate have worked \nhard for 3 months to come up with these improvements. Some of my \nDemocratic colleagues will support a FISA compromise. I respect their \ndecision. Even though I may disagree with the majority of the Senate, I \nhave an obligation, as I said last night, to do everything I can to \nmove this forward. We should be able to do that this week.\n  The Medicare bill, also known as the doctors' fix, passed by a \nstunning 355-to-59 vote in the House of Representatives--355 to 59. \nRepublican leaders in the House openly supported this legislation or \nthey wouldn't have gotten a vote such as that. This legislation will \nboth help Medicare beneficiaries and head off the looming cuts facing \ndoctors in many different ways. This bill was very similar to a bill \ndrafted by Senator Baucus and supported by every Senate Democrat and \nnine Republicans in the Senate earlier this month. It represents the \nonly chance this body has to head off cuts to doctors before they take \neffect at the end of the month. There is no reason we can't pass the \nMedicare doctors' fix this week.\n  Who supports this legislation? AARP, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Cancer Society, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security, the \nNational Council on Aging, and dozens more--dozens more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a full list of the scores of other \norganizations be printed in the Record that support this Medicare fix--\nfixing it now. It has to be done before the end of the month.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Alliance for Retired Americans, Alzheimer's Association, \n     American Academy of Audiology, American Academy of \n     Dermatology, American Academy of Otolaryngology, American \n     Academy of Ophthalmology, American Association for Geriatric \n     Psychiatry, American Association for Homecare, American \n     Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American College of \n     Cardiology, American College of Physicians, American College \n     of Radiology, American College of Osteopathic Internists, \n     American College of Surgeons, American Counseling \n     Association, American Clinical Laboratory Association, \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, \n     American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, \n     American Hospital Association, American Medical Association.\n       American Mental Health Counselors Association, American \n     Optometric Association, American Psychological Association, \n     American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Society of \n     Plastic Surgeons, Association for Community Affiliated Plans, \n     American Osteopathic Association, California Medical \n     Association, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Clinical Social \n     Work Association, Federation of American Hospitals, Food \n     Marketing Institute, Kidney Care Partners, Leadership Council \n     of Aging Organizations, Medical Group Management Association, \n     Medicare Rights Center, Mental Health America, National \n     Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, \n     National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and National \n     Association of State Mental Health Program Directors.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare, National Community Pharmacists Association, \n     National Council on Aging, National Rural Health Association, \n     Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, Society of Hospital \n     Medicine and Suicide Prevention Action Network USA (SPAN \n     USA).\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is legislation that every State in the \nUnion is calling us about, their Governors and other representatives, \nto please take care of this. That is what we need to do. Are we doing \nthis to take care of the doctors? Partially, yes, but the other reason \nwe are doing it is we are doing it to preserve Medicare. If we do not \ndo this, there will be more doctors who drop out of taking care of \nMedicare patients.\n  What does that mean? It also means there will be other people who are \nreimbursed by insurance companies and other health care providers who \nbase their reimbursement on what Medicare pays. So we have to do this \nfix. It is not only to take care of the doctors, it is to take care of \npatients and Americans from one end of this country to the other.\n  Finally, we have a supplemental appropriations bill. I would hope we \ncould pass that before the Fourth of July recess. It is an emergency \nsupplemental. We know it funds the war fighting. No matter how people \nfeel about the money that has gone to pay for this war, costing us in \nIraq alone $5,000 every second, I would hope everyone understands we \nare not going to vote on the war funding in this measure that is before \nus now. But we have other things we have to vote on or the war funding \nwould not come forward, and that is important issues such as the GI \nbill of rights and unemployment\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\ncompensation extension which States are drastically in need of.\n  It does other good things. There is money in here as a result of the \nfloods that have taken place. That is important. There are Medicaid \nfixes. Out of the seven regulations that are causing a problem with \nevery Governor in America, six of them will be repealed by this \nlegislation. So there is no reason that we can't do this legislation.\n  I have said repeatedly we can pass all four of these bills this week. \nWe can do them tomorrow, as a matter of fact. But as with everything \nelse we try to accomplish around here in a closely divided Senate, \npassing them will require the cooperation of Members from both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The filibuster chart is now up to 78. Of course, this is an alltime \nrecord for obstructionism. I have said our Republican colleagues, on \noccasion, have acted Orwellian this year; they say one thing and do \nanother. I guess today is an appropriate day to say this because it is \nGeorge Orwell's birthday today. He would be 105 today.\n  So I would hope everyone understands there will be no going home \ntomorrow unless we complete the things we are obligated to the American \npeople to complete. Now, some say, well, that may mean we are going to \nhave to be here Saturday. Yes, it may mean we have to be here Saturday \nbecause that is the way it is, and if we can't complete our work by \nSaturday, then we can continue our work. It wouldn't be the first time \nin the history of this country that important legislation was worked on \nduring a holiday. Now, the Fourth of July doesn't come until next \nFriday or Saturday, a week from the day after tomorrow. So we may have \nto work here. Everyone should understand that. Everyone has \nobligations. I do. I don't get to go home as much as a lot of people. I \nwould love to be able to go home on Friday, but we may not be able to. \nWe have to, in my opinion, complete the supplemental appropriations. \nThat is extremely important. We have to complete the Medicare \nlegislation before we go. If we can complete FISA, I am not going to \nstand in the way of that. I think we should do that too. It appears \nnow, realistically, with this objection to the housing bill, it appears \nvery clear to me that is going to take more time, and we will not be \nable to do it by the day after tomorrow, but we are going to complete \nit. We have gone too far to do that. I tell all those people who are \nobjecting to our completing this housing legislation: We will complete \nit. It may not be tomorrow, it may not be Friday, it may have to wait \nuntil the first week we get back. I understand the procedural aspects \nof that. It could require two more cloture votes, but two more cloture \nvotes would only bring us to 80. We have worked through more difficult \nthings than that. We have a relatively short work period in July, and \nit is guaranteed that we will do--we will complete the work on the \nhousing bill the first week we get back.\n  So that is the best I can do. I am not upset with anyone. It has been \nan interesting day, but it is a day that focuses attention on the work \nwe need to do. I haven't even mentioned the FAA extension. We have to \ndo that some way. We tried to do that, and that was objected to. We \nhave this global AIDS bill the President wants to do. I had a good \nconversation with Senator Enzi a few minutes ago, and he said he had \nthree people who were objecting to that. He has taken care of two of \nthem today. He is going to deal with the other one tomorrow. I hope, in \nfact, that is the case. So there is a lot of work we need to do, and I \nhope we can do it. But everyone should understand we are not walking \nout of here at 2 o'clock tomorrow. If this means we have to stay until \nafter midnight to file cloture on various things, we will do that. We \nhave work we have to do for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me brighten our day and lift the \nmood of my good friend, the majority leader. I think by any standard \nthis is going to be a week of considerable bipartisan accomplishment \nfor the American people. We have a great likelihood of completing the \nsupplemental. As everyone knows, the war portion of the supplemental, \nwe don't even have to vote on again. The only thing we will be voting \non, again, on the supplemental are the domestic parts of it that are \nwidely supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  We all agree we need to do the so-called docs' fix. There is some \ndifference of opinion about exactly how to craft that. Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley have a history of being able to come together and \nwork these things out in a way that makes sense for both sides.\n  The FISA bill enjoys almost, I assume, unanimous support on this side \nof the aisle and more than half the votes on the other side of the \naisle. There is no reason we would not get there on that.\n  As the majority leader has pointed out, at some point along the way, \nthe cobwebs and trip wires and other problems the housing bill has run \ninto will be circumvented by the majority and we will get to final \npassage on a piece of legislation that the vast majority of people on \nboth sides of the aisle think is important.\n  So I finish today with optimism about the chances of considerable \naccomplishment for the American people before the week is out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the business \nbefore the Senate is the postcloture time on the FISA legislation; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Yes, we are on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 6304.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is the FISA legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, I want to thank our colleagues. I \nthank the majority leader for his tremendous help in getting us this \nfar on the housing bill. We have worked together, and we would not have \nbeen this far without the cooperation of the minority leader as well. \nSo I thank Senator McConnell for that. I am grateful for my colleagues \nto let us get cloture. Before we leave here--and the Presiding Officer \nknows how important this legislation is to our States--if we can get \nthis done, I cannot think of a better message to send to the country \nthan having Democrats and Republicans come together to make a \ndifference to thousands of constituents who, over the next week and a \nhalf, will be in foreclosure and in danger of losing their homes.\n  I am grateful for the vote we just had on the Dodd-Shelby substitute. \nThere are other hurdles to go because of the way this matter was sent \nto us. Any individual Senator can drag this out further. Given the \noverwhelming vote we have had, it seems to me it would be in our \ninterest to try to get to the other amendments that remain and make \nthis bill as supportive as we can in recognition of what the other body \nhas done, with the hopes that the President might even have this on his \ndesk for signature while we are back in our States during the \nIndependence Day holiday. I think we can do it if we really want to. It \nis not that much of a difference that remains. As long as one or two \nindividuals insist that we go through all of the remaining procedural \nhoops, they can delay the outcome. The outcome will happen. \nUnfortunately, their delays will cause others who might otherwise have \nbeen helped by this bill to possibly lose their homes. I think that is \ntragic indeed.\n  I hope the leadership will prevail upon those Senators to allow us to \ncontinue the amendment process, get through the hurdles, and complete \nwork on this bill before we leave.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \nfew minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Corporate Responsibility in Iowa\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address an issue of corporate \nresponsibility, particularly as it relates to my hometown of New \nHartford, IA, and the flood that recently took place there, and whether \na large chain\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nof convenient stores that is headquartered across Wisconsin is going to \ntake the corporate responsibility of continuing to serve a small town \nthat has been devastated by a flood.\n  It has been a tough and challenging time for Iowans over the past few \nweeks. I have come to the floor on a few occasions already to update my \ncolleagues on the natural disasters that have hit Iowa so hard.\n  Tornadoes and floods have caused economic and emotional toil and pain \nand have, sadly, taken 24 lives across the Midwest.\n  Just a mile from my farm is the town of New Hartford, where I have \nlived my entire 74 years. It is a modest town of about 650 people. On \nMay 25, the north edge of the town suffered extensive damage from a \ntornado.\n  That same tornado destroyed half the town of Parkersburg, IA, just 10 \nmiles west of my hometown of New Hartford, and continued damaging towns \nover a 43-mile range, including Dunkerton and Hazleton, as that tornado \ntraveled east.\n  Then came the floods. The town and residents of New Hartford were \ndevastated by the flood waters of what we call Beaver Creek. Much of \nthe town's homes and businesses suffered damages from the floods.\n  But Iowans are resilient people. The residents and the entire \ncommunity are pulling together to help their neighbors get back on \ntheir feet.\n  But one resident is abandoning the people of New Hartford. Kwik Star \nhas announced that the only convenience gas store in town will not be \nrebuilt. The decision by Kwik Star to not reopen their store is a \nserious setback for the town of New Hartford.\n  These folks have endured a tornado and a damaging flood, but they are \nworking to rebuild, pull themselves together, and somehow get their \nlives back to normal.\n  But the one gas station and convenience store will not be around to \nhelp with that rebuilding. They view the damage to their facility as \ntoo great, too daunting to overcome. This news has added another \ndevastation to the residents of the community. We get the story: Well, \nwe will not rebuild in New Hartford. We will put one double the size of \nthat one in Parkersburg, so then all the people in New Hartford can \ndrive 10 miles to get whatever they would get in their local community.\n  This is a large chain of convenience stores. I am begging for \ncorporate responsibility, to continue to serve the community. And, \nparticularly, don't ditch people when they are most in need.\n  Well, their decision doesn't sit well with the residents of New \nHartford. As you can tell, it doesn't sit well with me.\n  As the residents are cleaning up their homes, parks, and businesses, \nKwik Star has decided to abandon them. Kwik Star is hurting my \nneighbors and friends emotionally and economically.\n  If they don't see the value in rebuilding in New Hartford, why should \nthe residents have any hope? These folks are doing everything they can \nto bring their properties back from this disaster, to rebuild our \nhometown, and Kwik Star is leaving them high and dry during this time \nof devastation.\n  It is not just the emotional pain of their decision that hurts the \npeople of New Hartford, IA; it is also economic because Kwik Star \nemployed 15 people before the flood. Three full-time employees--Deana \nAckerson, Brenda Smith, and Barb Harper--have each worked for Kwik Star \nfor many years.\n  Twelve other employees--Cindy Huberg, John Mulder, John Anderson, \nMatt Winkelman, Rich Moore, Teresa Peverill, Carol Grooms, Lauri and \nRoger Palmersheim, Mitch Konken, Pam Hargema, and Heather Hugelucht--\ndepended on Kwik Star for employment as well.\n  The bottom line is that the residents of New Hartford are clinging to \ntheir hope that the town will come back even stronger than before these \ndisasters. They are using that hope to get through this.\n  But Kwik Star is dashing that hope. Kwik Star is telling them that \ntheir town no longer deserves a gas station and convenience store. One \nflood is all that this big corporation can seem to handle. If you want \ngas, milk, or bread, you will have to drive 10 miles to get it in a \nnew, refurbished store that is twice as large.\n  I can tell them that in another town, just 15 miles away, they had a \nflood, and they had two stores in that town. One of the two stores in \nWaverly was flooded, but they are going to rebuild that store. I don't \nunderstand this. I am working for tax changes, which is the very same \nthing we did for Katrina in New Orleans, and with the help of Senator \nBaucus and Congressman Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, we are working to enact tax relief for victims of natural \ndisasters similar to what was done to the victims of the hurricane. I \nhope this will encourage Kwik Star to stay in New Hartford.\n\n  This includes expensing for demolition and cleanup of debris. Another \nmajor provision would allow additional depreciation to greatly reduce \nor eliminate the business tax liability for the current year, including \nan operating loss carryback, as an example, for 5 years, which ought to \nbe plenty of incentive for these businesses to continue in the \ncommunities where they work.\n  In the case of the floods, we are talking about 250 different \ncommunities in eastern Iowa, just as an example; and, in addition, \nWisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana--and now it looks as though it is \ngoing to cover Missouri as well.\n  I am pushing these provisions to help businesses such as Kwik Star \ncope with the cost of damage and rebuilding.\n  Mr. President, I am here to appeal to this major convenience store \nand corporation serving the Midwest, the Kwik Star Corporation, and \ntell them that New Hartford is worthy of a convenience store. Our \nresidents deserve Kwik Star's commitment to the community. They need to \nknow that a company they have depended on and they have done business \nwith for over 20 years will reverse this decision and join them in \nbringing New Hartford back from disaster.\n\n\n                             Iowa Flooding\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to provide another update on \nthe flooding in Iowa. As you are aware, Iowa is in the middle of a \ncrisis. Across the State, floods have devastated homes, businesses, \nfarms, and communities, and that continues.\n  I have been traveling back and forth to Iowa to see the catastrophic \ndamage, and I have been anguished to see my fellow Iowans suffering. \nPeople are hurting, and it will take a long time and a lot of hard work \njust to get back to normal.\n  However, in the midst of this devastation, I have also witnessed \nincredible examples of the spirit of Iowa. I have seen Iowans come \ntogether in communities across the State sandbagging, consoling, \nsharing, and providing a helping hand to neighbors and strangers alike. \nThis spirit of dedication, a natural inclination to put others before \nself, is what makes me most proud to call myself an Iowan.\n  I cannot talk about the spirit of Iowa without talking about the \ndedication and efforts of our police, fire, emergency medical services, \nNational Guard forces, and the Civil Air Patrol. These first responders \nare the frontline of defense for all Iowans. These selfless individuals \ncome to the aid of all Iowans, putting duty first to help others defend \ntheir homes, livelihoods, and lives. They do this without thinking \ntwice and put others' lives before their own. They have worked \ntirelessly to build levees, to sandbag, to secure dangerous areas, and \nto make water rescues. They have suffered loss, just as all Iowans \nhave; but they never waiver and they always continue to come to the aid \nof others.\n  For instance, police and fire stations across the flood zone have \nbeen damaged or destroyed. News reports have documented how the fire \nstation in Columbus Junction, IA, was under 10 feet of water. Other \nreports point to devastation of police, fire, and EMS facilities across \nthe State, including the second largest city in our State, Cedar \nRapids. Despite this, first responders still continue to provide \nsecurity and to help communities in distress. Their efforts are nothing \nshort of heroic.\n  It is not just local police, fire, EMS personnel who are helping out. \nLaw enforcement officers with the Iowa State Patrol and from other \nagencies across the State have come to the flood zone to lend a helping \nhand.\n  Some have come from out of State. For instance, Coast Guard rescue \nteams based out of St. Louis came to\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nprovide search and rescue. State troopers and police officers from \nNebraska and Minnesota have helped the Cedar Rapids Police Department \nkeep the city secure as the floodwaters recede and cleanup begins.\n  I appreciate the sacrifice and dedication these folks have made to \nhelp Iowa in its time of need.\n  But it does not stop there. The Iowa National Guard has deployed over \n4,000 of their members across the State, providing vital manpower to \nassist local communities. They have used their skills and training to \nhelp meet numerous local needs. They have helped with sandbagging, \nshoring up levees, saving homes and businesses, and they have secured \nbridges and patrolled levees. They have been assisting local law \nenforcement with security. They have distributed clean drinking water \nto communities that have no running water and provided generators to \nthose without power.\n  The National Guard has also provided air support via helicopters to \nsupport the assessment of damage and transportation of vital equipment. \nThe list of needs met by our Iowa Guardsmen goes on and on, and their \ndedication knows no bounds.\n  In fact, one Iowa Guardsman, National Guard SPC Curtis L. White, had \nto change his wedding plans when he was deployed in support of the \nflood effort. He married his wife Daniele on Thursday, June 19, on the \nviaduct on the corner of Highway 92 and 2nd Street in Columbus Junction \nwhere he had been assisting with the flood operations. I thank him, his \nnew wife, and his fellow Iowa National Guard soldiers and airmen for \ntheir sacrifices and compassion for their fellow Iowans.\n  I also thank those in the Iowa wing of the Civil Air Patrol who flew \nSenator Harkin and this Senator around the State to view the impacted \nareas. The Civil Air Patrol also flew photo missions to examine the \nextent of flooding. I commend the Civil Air Patrol for their \ndedication.\n  Finally, I thank the men and women across the State who are serving \nin hospitals, emergency rooms, long-term care facilities, community \nhealth centers, home health agencies, and hospices. Many of these \npeople lost their homes to flooding, and yet they still showed up at \nwork to do the right thing. They are to be commended for those efforts.\n  I know these folks were on the frontline working to evacuate patients \nfrom places such as Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids as floodwaters \nrose. When this happened, facilities such as Saint Luke's Hospital in \nthe same city and others nearby jumped up without hesitation to take in \nthese displaced hospital patients.\n  We cannot forget the hard work and dedication of our health care \nprofessionals during this crisis, and as they are on the road to \nrecovery. With people such as these, I have no doubt that facilities \nsuch as Mercy Medical Center will be fully operational in no time.\n  As the floodwaters start to recede and Iowa moves toward rebuilding, \nthe responsibility of public safety will still be on the shoulders of \nour first responders. These capable men and women who serve in law \nenforcement, fire departments, EMS, the National Guard, and in \nhospitals across the State need all the resources we can provide them \nin this time of need. We have a responsibility to make sure they are \nequipped for the job and any future natural disasters we have.\n  That is why I led the Iowa congressional delegation in writing to \nFederal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Justice, asking that deadlines for law enforcement and \nfirst responder grant programs be extended for communities impacted by \nthe flooding.\n  Communities in Iowa should not be penalized from receiving grants \nbecause they have not had the time to hurry up and beat a deadline that \ndoes not take into consideration such natural disasters. These \ncommunities should be given special consideration for applying for \ngrant moneys because of the extensive damage.\n  Programs such as the Assistance to Firefighters and the Staffing for \nAdequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters can provide vital \nassistance to fire departments that were impacted by the flooding. \nThese departments may need new equipment, radios, computers, and \nrepairs to their fire stations. These grants can provide that \nassistance.\n  Further, programs such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Program, called Byrne/JAG, as we all know it around here, \nand the Community Oriented Policing Services, and we refer to that as \nthe COPS Program, can also provide these same types of resources to \npolice departments in need.\n  Iowans will soon be facing a long process toward rebuilding. It will \nnot be easy. However, I am proud to say that I know Iowans will be \nhelping others to rebuild in the Iowa spirit of hard work and \ngenerosity. We in Congress are doing all we can on our end to ensure \nthat first responders in the field have the resources they need.\n  So I applaud, maybe now a third or fourth time but you cannot do it \ntoo many times, these brave men and women who serve their communities \nand carry on the spirit of Iowa.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6145-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Ms. \nGloria Hughes for her committed service to Nevada. Ms. Hughes will be \nretiring on June 30, 2008, after over three decades of service in the \nMineral County Assessor's office.\n  Ms. Hughes began her service in 1973 as a deputy clerk. She then \nserved as deputy assessor, senior deputy assessor, and chief deputy \nassessor. In 1994, she was elected to her first of four terms as \nassessor.\n  As sssessor of Mineral County, Gloria has worked tirelessly to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of her office, never losing heart \nwhen she encountered obstacles. For example, Gloria won a 12 year \nbattle to obtain an office vehicle, which helps the staff fulfill their \nappraisal duties throughout rural Mineral County. Ms. Hughes' \nrealization of this goal and others like it ensured that her office was \nconsistently the best it could be. Indeed, the State department of \ntaxation repeatedly gave the Mineral County Assessor's office perfect \nmarks in every category of methods and procedures of tax assessment.\n  True to her nature, Ms. Hughes expresses regret that she will not be \nable to see all of her goals for Mineral County realized, but is \noptimistic that the dedicated employees she leaves behind will fulfill \nthem when the time is right.\n  Gloria will be missed by her employees--whose best interests she \nworked for ceaselessly--and the citizens of Mineral County who were the \nfortunate beneficiaries of her fervent commitment to her job, her \ncounty, and her state.\n  I am grateful to Ms. Hughes for her service and proud to honor her \nand her achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6145-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6145-S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF BOB STOLDAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, I rise today to recognize Bob Stoldal, a \nlegend in Nevada news and the Las Vegas community for more than 40 \nyears. Mr. Stoldal's first experience in a news office came in 1960, \nworking for the Las Vegas Review Journal--first as a janitor, then as a \ntypesetter. In the next year he was hired by KLAS radio as a graveyard-\nshift radio disk jockey, where he was known to his listeners as Bob \nFree.\n  Over the past five decades, Mr. Stoldal has worked as a reporter, \nanchor, news director, and vice president of news for KLAS. He was the \nfirst ever general manager of Las Vegas One and held that position for \nthe past 10 years.\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\n  Bob's dedication to accuracy in media content and high ethical \nstandards in broadcast journalism have defined his career. He demands \njournalistic excellence and integrity from himself and those who work \nfor him. Bob's demand for excellence has earned KLAS countless national \nand regional awards and recognitions.\n  Besides upping the ante for Nevada journalism, Bob Stoldal has \nimpacted the field on a national level. Mr. Stoldal has been a staunch \nadvocate for cameras in courtrooms and pioneered the charge to allow \ncameras in southern Nevada's courtrooms, adding a degree of public \nscrutiny to our legal system.\n  Mr. Stoldal's dedication to Las Vegas and his community extends far \nbeyond the realm of media.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of the brave lance corporal from Richmond, IN. Layton Crass, 22 \nyears old, died on June 14, 2008, in Farah Province, Afghanistan, from \ninjuries sustained while his unit was conducting combat operations. He \nwas a member of the U.S. Marine Corps, Golf Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th \nMarines from Twentynine Palms, CA.\n  Layton graduated from Richmond High School in 2005. Outgoing and \nactive in school, Layton also loved rollerblading, paintball, and \ncomputers. Public service was a family tradition for Layton; his father \nis a veteran and his brother, Donald, serves in the U.S. Marines, as \nwell. In high school, Layton was part of the Richmond Police Youth \nCadet Program and, according to his family, surprised no one when he \nenlisted in the Marines. It had been his ambition since he was 16 years \nold.\n  Before his deployment in Afghanistan, Layton served an 8-month tour \nin Iraq. Layton never wavered in his commitment to his country or to \nthe Armed Services. His friend, Dustin Gibbs, told a local newspaper \nthat he joined the Marines because of Layton's inspiration. Gibbs had \nthis to say of his comrade: ``He was a true friend and an extremely \nbrave man. He had a huge heart and made quite an impact on my life and \nmy future to come.'' These words illustrate the great influence Layton \nhad on those lucky enough to know him. His memory will live on long \npast his years through the many lives he touched.\n  Today, I join Layton's family and friends in mourning his death. \nLayton will forever be remembered as a son, brother, and friend to \nmany. He is survived by his parents Donald and Lynne Shingledecker \nCrass; his sister Dusty Nichole Throop and her husband Nicholas; his \nbrother Devin James Crass and his wife Megan Elizabeth; his nephew, \nBrenton Isaiah Throop; and his grandparents, Mary Ann and Bob Coons, \nZeb and Darlene Crass and Virginia Shingledecker.\n  While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Layton. Today and always, Layton will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Layton's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Layton's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Layton Bradly Crass in the \nofficial record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope that Layton's family can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Layton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6146-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6146-S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 541, \nadopted on May 21, which is a resolution designed to support \nhumanitarian assistance in Somalia. As you know, Somalia has seen one \ngovernment after another fail to deliver for the Somali people for the \nbetter part of two decades. At the same time, the situation in Somalia \nand the broader Horn of Africa is of great strategic importance to the \nUnited States and of deep concern to me personally, having traveled to \nthe region on several occasions.\n  I do not think that we can overestimate the scale of the humanitarian \nchallenges facing Somalia. At least a million people were uprooted \nduring fighting between the Transitional Federal Government and Islamic \ninsurgents last year, and their plight has become graver because of \nrecord food prices, drought, and hyperinflation. The 250,000 Somalis in \na small corridor outside Mogadishu is now considered the largest camp \nof internally displaced persons in the world.\n  The goal of the international community has been to support the \nformation of a viable government of national unity in Somalia to help \nstabilize the situation on the ground, and this resolution is designed \nto support this goal. Nevertheless, we should recall that the country \nrecently faced the terrible prospect of rule by Islamic extremists and \nthat without Ethiopia's intervention, the TFG would not have had this \nopportunity to bring some measure of stability to the country.\n  For its part, Ethiopia eliminated the threat of a Taliban-like state \ntaking root on its eastern border and scored a major victory in the war \non terrorism. And for our part, this accomplishment furthered U.S. \ninterests by helping ensure that the Somali government did not threaten \nor seek to destabilize its neighbors or provide protection for \nterrorists that threaten the United States and its allies.\n  While I support the broad goal of stability for Somalia and a \nsustainable peace, let me be clear on an important point. No Somali \ngovernment should include factions with ties to al-Qaida or al-Shabaab.\n  Both groups seek to undermine the stability of the TFG, which is the \ninternationally recognized government of Somalia, through violence and \nintimidation. While al-Qaida's status and animosity towards the United \nStates has been clear for a long time, we should also not underestimate \nthe threat that al-Shabaab also poses to stability in Somalia and the \nentire region. Indeed, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated \nthe group as a foreign terrorist organization and as a specially \ndesignated global terrorist on February 29.\n  In its assessment of the group's activities, the State Department \nexplains the organization scattered leaflets on the streets of \nMogadishu warning participants in last year's reconciliation conference \nthat they intended to bomb the conference venue. Al-Shabaab promised to \nshoot anyone planning to attend the conference and to blow up \ndelegates' cars and hotels. The group has claimed responsibility for \nshooting deputy district administrators, as well as several bombings \nand shootings in Mogadishu targeting Ethiopian troops and Somali \ngovernment officials. In short, terrorist organizations such as al-\nQaida and al-Shabaab seek to undermine the hard-fought and tenuous\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\npeace that has been achieved and their influence in Somalia must be \ncurbed.\n  In addition, while I support the resolution's call for Ethiopia to \ndevelop a timeline for the ``responsible'' withdrawal of its troops \nfrom Somalia, it is important to emphasize that this resolution does \nnot call for either an immediate withdrawal or a rigid timeline \nirrespective of the availability of replacement peacekeeping forces. \nAny such inflexible approach would be counterproductive, undermine the \nTFG, and threaten the important gains that have already been achieved.\n  Just as the presence of Ethiopian troops in Somalia derives, in part, \nfrom the intra-party Somali conflict, their departure should not occur \nuntil African Union or other international troops have arrived to keep \nthe peace secure. To date, unfortunately, only 2,500 of 8,000 pledged \nAU peacekeepers have arrived. While some have claimed the presence of \nEthiopian troops itself is destabilizing, there is no doubt in my mind \nthat the alternative would be far worse.\n  Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not comment on the impact that \nEritrea has had in terms of making the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops \nmore challenging. According to the United Nations, Eritrea is \nsupporting insurgent groups to undermine the TFG. Under these \ncircumstances, not only would it leave a vacuum for the Ethiopian \ntroops to be withdrawn early, but such a withdrawal would be seized \nupon by Eritrean-backed insurgents to destabilize the situation in \nSomalia. This is why this resolution calls on Eritrea to play a \nproductive--and not a destructive--role in Somalia.\n  The United States has a deep and profound interest in securing the \npeace in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa. There is no doubt that \nserious challenges remain. Nevertheless, I look forward to our \ncontinuing to work with our friend and ally Ethiopia, as well as the \nAfrican Union, United Nations, and other countries in the region to \nsecure a brighter future for all those people in Somalia who yearn to \nlive their lives in peace and with the opportunity to provide for their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6147-S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 323(d) of S. Con. Res. 70, the \n2009 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to make appropriate adjustments in aggregates, allocations, \nand other levels assumed in the resolution to reflect the budgetary \nimpact of certain legislation.\n  I am filing adjustments pursuant to section 323(d) for legislation \nthat Congress cleared prior to the adoption of S. Con. Res. 70 but for \nwhich the necessary information to incorporate their budgetary effects \nwas not available at the time the conference report was filed. The \nrevisions are for public law 110-232, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nFill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008, and public law \n110-245, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the combined effect of the \nadjustments, including accompanying changes in debt service, is to \nreduce the on-budget deficit assumed in S. Con. Res. 70 by $965 million \nin 2008, while increasing it by $933 million in 2009 and by roughly $1 \nbillion over the 2009 to 2013 period. On a unified basis, the \nlegislation is expected to lower deficits by $322 million over the 2008 \nto 2013 period. Because the revisions are being made for legislation \nthat has already cleared Congress, they will neither raise nor lower \nthe amount of room available to Congress under the budgetary aggregates \nand committee allocations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a set of tables \nwhich show the revised allocations, aggregates, and other levels for S. \nCon. Res. 70, the 2009 budget resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009--S.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           42ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 4, our Nation will celebrate the \n42nd anniversary of the signing of the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA. While we mark this important anniversary, the country also \ncelebrates the enactment earlier this year of the first major reforms \nto FOIA in over a decade--the OPEN Government Act--which will \nreinvigorate and strengthen this vital open government law for many \nyears to come.\n  Now in its fourth decade, the Freedom of Information Act remains an \nindispensable tool for shedding light on bad policies and Government \nabuses.\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\nThe act has helped to guarantee the public's ``right to know'' for \ngenerations of Americans. Today, thanks to the reforms contained in the \nOPEN Government Act, which was signed into law on December 31, \nAmericans who seek information under FIOA will experience a process \nthat is much more transparent and less burdened by delays than it has \nbeen in the past. This is very good news. But there is still much more \nto be done to ensure that FOIA remains an effective tool for keeping \nour democracy open and free.\n  A key component of the OPEN Government Act is the creation of an \nOffice of Government Information Services, OGIS, within the National \nArchives and Records Administration. The office would mediate FOIA \ndisputes, review agency compliance with FOIA, and house a newly created \nFOIA ombudsman. Establishing a fully funded OGIS is essential to \nreversing the troubling trend of the last 7 years towards lax FOIA \ncompliance and excessive Government secrecy.\n  I am pleased that the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies--a panel on which I \nserve--last week rejected the President's budget proposal to move the \nfunctions of OGIS to the Department of Justice. I will continue to work \nvery hard to ensure that OGIS is fully funded within the National \nArchives--as Congress intended--so that this important office has the \nnecessary resources to fully comply with the OPEN Government Act.\n  There is also more work to be done to further strengthen FOIA. \nEarlier this year, I was pleased to join with Senator John Cornyn in \nintroducing the OPEN FOIA Act, S. 2746, a bill that requires Congress \nto clearly and explicitly state its intention to create a statutory \nexemption to FOIA when it provides for such an exemption in new \nlegislation. While there is a very real need to keep certain Government \ninformation secret to ensure the public good and safety, excessive \nGovernment secrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act provides a safeguard against the growing trend \ntowards FOIA exemptions, and would make all FOIA exemptions clear and \nunambiguous, and vigorously debated, before they are enacted into law. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will consider this bill at its business \nmeeting this week, and I urge all members to support this legislation \nto further restore the public's trust in their Government.\n  As we reflect upon the celebration of another FOIA anniversary, we in \nCongress must also reaffirm our commitment to open and transparent \ngovernment. As I have said many times, open government is not a \nDemocratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American value and a \nvirtue that all Americans hold dear. It is in this bipartisan spirit \nthat I join Americans from across the political spectrum in celebrating \nthe 42nd anniversary of the birth of FOIA and all that this law has \ncome to symbolize about our vibrant democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE RESCUERS OF KEITH KENNEDY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the dedication of \nall those involved in the safe and miraculous return of Keith Kennedy, \nan autistic man from Shoreview, MN, who spent this past week alone, \nwithout food or shelter, lost in the woods of northwestern Wisconsin.\n  His safe return has been called a miracle, but this miracle would not \nhave been possible without the commitment of the hundreds of \nvolunteers, law enforcement officers, firefighters and medics who \nselflessly gave their time and continued to search for Keith, even when \nall hope seemed lost.\n  Special recognition must go to Gary Ruiz and Jim Cotroneo, two St. \nPaul firefighters who found Keith against all odds. Their efforts, and \nthe efforts of their colleagues who joined them in this search, ensured \na joyful ending to what could so easily have been another tragedy.\n  I cannot fail to mention Keith's parents, Bruce and Linda Kennedy, \nwhose spirit of hope was by all accounts an inspiration to those who \nparticipated in bringing Keith home safely. Their bravery and the \nbravery of their son are an inspiration to us all.\n  I believe this story shows once again the willingness of Minnesotans, \nand of our friends in Wisconsin, to go beyond what is asked of them to \ncome together as a community and support those in need. My hope is that \nthe actions of all those who gave of themselves so that Keith could \nreturn home, will inspire others to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6149-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6149-S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, earlier this week, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo .senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Crapo, Thank you for the opportunity to tell my \n     story. I am nearly 70 years old and for 40 to 50 years have \n     dreamed of a vacation in Jasper National Park in Canada. This \n     year was to be the year to go. I had a new vehicle, a \n     competent driver to share the driving, and I had the money. \n     Well, I had the money until the price of gas began to rise so \n     sharply. I had to cancel this dream trip. I may never get to \n     Jasper.\n       My sister and I made weekly trips to Boise for religious \n     purposes. Because of the cost of gas, we had to cut that back \n     to twice a month.\n       I have a little patch of strawberries that produces more \n     than I can use. I have shared with friends, family and \n     neighbors nearby. There are many who I would love to share \n     with (and they would love to have them), but they live too \n     far to make it worth the trip with the high cost of gas.\n       My sister and I are on a limited budget (Social Security), \n     and the cost of gas has caused the prices of food and other \n     things we have to buy to skyrocket. We live at least 20 miles \n     from town, one way. It costs over three times for gas to go \n     to town than it used to. There are no buses in our area.\n       My personal opinion is that the environmentalists should \n     either donate their money to pay for foreign fuel or let us \n     produce that which we have in our own country. I think they \n     are being very selfish, and I wish a bunch of those \n     characters had to live on less than $1,000 per month.\n           Sincerely,\n     Delores, Melba.\n                                  ____\n\n       With the gas prices the way they are, my family has to stay \n     home instead of camping, fishing and other family activities \n     we have done in the past. The grocery stores have had to \n     raise the prices because of the price of fuel. My wife \n     travels 55 miles a day for work in a car that is on its last \n     leg. I cannot replace it because of the money that we are \n     spending in fuel. I never worried about ``filling my tank'' \n     before, but now I cannot fill my tank because of the price of \n     fuel. I feel like my government wants the fuel to keep going \n     up and up. Everybody says that the oil companies are making a \n     fortune, but they make 4 cents a gallon and taxes are 50 \n     cents a gallon. So who is making the money, the oil companies \n     or the government? Please help us by lowering the fuel prices \n     even if we have to rely on the oil in the United States and \n     not buy from the Middle East.\n     Jason, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator, I am concerned about your ignorance on why \n     prices not only at the pump but on anything we buy are up. \n     The Federal Reserve is most responsible for this inflation. \n     It is taught in economics 101. The Federal Reserve has \n     inflated our dollar 50 percent in the last 7 years, according \n     to their statistics. That means 7 years ago, if you had \n     $100,000 in the bank, it would only buy half as much today \n     ``say $50,000''. This means if you made $10.00 an hour seven \n     years ago and your wages stayed the same, you only have the \n     buying power of $5.00/hour.\n       The Federal Reserve inflates our money supply. They will \n     not give the M3 numbers out because there's a conscious \n     effort not to let the public know what they are doing. You \n     must kick the can, do your research on how inflation really \n     works before you even talk about making changes. If you are \n     to fix the problem, go to the Congress and ask them to fire \n     the Federal Reserve.\n       Sure, energy prices are up, and these big companies are \n     making big profits. The big oil companies are only in the \n     right place at the right time. The Federal Reserve was voted \n     in wrongly Dec 24, 1913. This was when no one could vote \n     against the creation of the\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n     Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is responsible for the \n     Great Depression. They are responsible now for our inflation. \n     Please takes steps and ask Congress to remove this private \n     agency and go to gold standard.\n     Kevin, Rathdrum.\n                                  ____\n\n       Fortunately, I can live, work, and shop within a 2-mile \n     radius of home. However, we're reluctant to pull our RV down \n     the road, which causes a loss of business for those tourist \n     areas we would have visited.\n       I believe the best way to reduce gas prices is to increase \n     production--drill off the coasts (like China and Cuba are \n     doing now), and in Alaska; extract oil from coal and shale; \n     and exploit other known resources. A massive effort to build \n     nuclear plants would also be wise. It is time to tell the \n     environmentalists where to ``get off''. The planet is not \n     getting warmer, and certainly not at the hands of man.\n     Scott.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, Thank you for your time and ears. I am \n     married with three children at home (two girls, ages 15 and \n     16; and one boy, 10 years old). Ten years ago, my wife and I \n     were receiving government assistance; now we are both college \n     graduates and working in professional positions, yet we still \n     feel the pain at the pump. I can only imagine how hard it is \n     affecting those who are still on government assistance, or \n     those less fortunate without a higher education. I have \n     personally bought relatives gas in the last month, not \n     because they asked but because I knew they needed it.\n       Our family has felt the crunch with rising fuel prices. \n     Fuel costs have taken away money from other pertinent bills \n     in our household, especially our energy/power bill. Our \n     family has scaled back traveling and fun family activities \n     such as going to Mariners baseball games. After all, baseball \n     is as American as apple pie. I know these aren't priorities \n     in most households, but activities like these are ones which \n     my family enjoys our time together. When you are raising \n     teenagers you really appreciate these times because teens are \n     hard to convince that family time is truly important. My wife \n     and I bought two small import vehicles (4-cylinders) because \n     we saw this fuel crisis coming. Maybe there could be \n     incentives for using energy-efficient vehicles, not \n     specifically imports but fuel-efficient vehicles. We have a \n     large SUV, but we only drive it when we travel or have to \n     transport the entire family.\n       Please help contain the ever-rising fuel crisis. Families \n     are affected in more ways than we can imagine, especially the \n     poor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard, Lenore.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked for my story here it is.\n       As a retired person and gas prices so high, I do not go \n     anywhere. What bothers me more is the profit taking by oil \n     companies, record profit earning 300 percent and over. Now is \n     the time to own stock in oil. Is this not just greed, ripping \n     off of the American public? We have back-up supplies; we have \n     other sources of energy. We have a government that is not \n     doing its job of protecting the people from being taken \n     advantage of. Why are our government officials allowing this \n     to happen? OPEC does control a lot but are they not beholden \n     to us for some of our products? Can we not hold them over the \n     barrel--for some of the product we send them? OK, a head of \n     lettuce $4.00 each? What is happening with this country? All \n     I am seeing is greed.\n       We have oil in Alaska; we have oil in Texas. Drill more \n     here; supply ourselves. Why are we shipping oil out? Why not \n     keep our oil here so that OPEC can't hold us up at the bank?\n           Sincerely,\n     Claudia, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I am very pleased for the opportunity \n     to say something that will be heard. I bought a nice little \n     3-bedroom house in Caldwell, thinking the drive would be \n     long, but something I could handle because I have a car that \n     gets decent gas mileage. Well, with the high gas prices, I \n     have left my home in Caldwell and moved to Boise to be able \n     to keep my job and have something left to live on. Of course \n     with the housing market, it is not selling. I know a lot of \n     people like me who are sharing homes with others due to the \n     increase in gas, electricity, and food prices. Right now \n     living in Boise, it is still costing me 150.00 a month for \n     gas, and I live about 15 minutes from work. Living in \n     Caldwell it was three times the amount. That is one whole \n     paycheck for me. I learned to eat noodles and potatoes \n     instead of other things that would be better for me to eat. \n     Can you imagine the people who are living on that who do not \n     have a good job? I go to work, home and church. Now you may \n     think that is not much of a life. I used to go for drives and \n     visit friends, but that is not possible at this time due to \n     the high cost of everything. We in this country know how to \n     cut back and buckle down to do what needs to be done to help, \n     but our government has let things get way out of hand. We as \n     the voting public are supposed to have a say in things and \n     too many have sat back and said nothing. Something must be \n     done. We have far too long been dependent on others for our \n     fuel, when we have the resources right here in this great \n     country. I do not mean to sound negative, but there is \n     nothing left for us to give. It is time those who have been \n     elected begin giving back to those who support them!\n       I pray someone is listening.\n     Jeannie, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The amount of fuel that I use is as minimal as I can get. I \n     do not do anything except drive back and forth to work and to \n     the grocery store on weekends. I do very little, if any, \n     extra driving. I would love to go camping or up in our \n     wonderful mountains to go fishing, but I cannot afford the \n     gas that it would take to do this. I have been trying to find \n     a way to purchase a different automobile that would get \n     better mileage, but if you do not have extra money, it is \n     real hard to try to save. I use one tank of gas a month to do \n     what I do and, at today's price, that costs me $120.00; soon \n     it will be $150.00; then who knows. I understand price \n     increases, but this is ridiculous. We need to have relief \n     now. I do not understand how one group of people can put all \n     of our own oil in such problems by not allowing us to drill \n     for our own gas and oil. This problem stems from green people \n     who have no idea how anyone else lives. We do not now nor \n     will we ever have mass transit that will remove our cars from \n     the highway.\n       I feel that we need to drill and produce our own oil and \n     gas as much as we can; then we can tell all of these \n     countries that do not like us goodbye, and we can keep our \n     money here to help people in the U.S. that need help.\n       Thank you very much for the space to vent. I am not sure it \n     will come of anything, but we can hope.\n       God bless the USA.\n     Rick.\n                                  ____\n\n       With fuel prices increasing so rapidly, we aren't \n     travelling as much or planning a vacation. We are making \n     cutbacks in many areas. However, I was recently visiting my \n     parents in Idaho Falls. They are retired and on a limited \n     income, so I have worried a bit about their finances with the \n     rising fuel prices that not only affect transportation but \n     everything. We stopped at a grocery store known to have the \n     lowest prices consistently. As I approached the check out I \n     saw a family and the mom's voice was starting to rise in \n     intensity and volume. She was under a lot of stress. Her \n     children were near and her husband was, too. She was adding \n     up the cost of the meager amount of groceries in their cart \n     and starting to put back basic items. The children and \n     husband looked at her. She said, ``I only have a half tank of \n     gas left. I only have a half tank of gas left,'' she \n     repeated. ``I just filled it up and I only have \\1/2\\ tank \n     left.'' She turned to her husband and asked him if he had \n     driven her car yesterday. He replied, ``No.'' Tears came to \n     my eyes as I realized what this young, small, responsible \n     family was going through. Tension was mounting, money was \n     very tight, without fuel, how would they get to work? With \n     fuel costing at least double what it recently was, how would \n     they have enough to stretch? I hadn't realized that people \n     were already having to make choices between fuel and food. \n     Many, many Idahoans are independent and hard-working. They do \n     not look for government hand-outs. They are resourceful. They \n     grow gardens, glean fields nearby, cook from scratch and \n     stretch their dollars in many ways. They make things work. \n     But there comes a point when dollars do not stretch farther, \n     salaries aren't increasing as rapidly as expenses, second \n     jobs are scarcer to find. I live in Boise, a city with more \n     transportation options. We are biking more; my husband has \n     the privilege of biking to work. This family did not! Rural \n     areas have few transportation options besides personal \n     vehicles, and the distance to almost anywhere is great.\n       I believe as we use and develop our own resources in our \n     great country that people will rise to the occasion and find \n     solutions before we run out of fuel. When we encourage \n     personal initiative and do not take a dependency attitude we, \n     the people, can accomplish amazing things.\n     Karla, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       We must start drilling for domestic oil, start making \n     nuclear power plants and oil refineries. I will not support \n     anyone who does not and will be willing to help support those \n     leaders who do.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       My story is not special, but I think it is too common. I am \n     a 55-year-old woman. I am my sole support. I live in Emmett, \n     but there are no jobs there. I work in Boise, a 30-mile drive \n     one way. I do not make a lot of money and, with the mortgage \n     industry the way it is, I cannot afford to move. Homes are \n     not selling in Emmett. I wonder how much higher things are \n     going to go. Soon it will be a choice of food or gas. Which \n     would you choose?\n       I am disgusted with our government. They do nothing, and I \n     know they do not have to suffer the way we do. I feel our \n     government has forgotten they work for us, not that we are \n     supporting them.\n     Candace, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I am lucky enough to live within three \n     miles of where I work, so transporting myself has not \n     impacted me as much as most in my community. Where I am hit \n     hard, though, is the cost of the organic and healthy food I \n     buy. Since spending a lot of time trying to get myself \n     healthy and researching about pesticides and about \n     environmental toxins, I had to make the decision to vote with \n     my dollars. I have spent a\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\n     much higher percentage on the important organics such as \n     tomatoes, berries, greens, and some other staples that are \n     most chemical-laden in the conventional counterpart. And I am \n     happy to do so to help a growing sector of sustainable \n     farmers. I always felt that, in the long run, this would come \n     back to benefit all as our country turned to more sustainable \n     and nutritious agriculture.\n       After studying some of the recent documentaries about our \n     food supply, and the big corporate welfare, and how the farm \n     bill works, I realized that, for some reason, our system \n     prefers us eating the 2,000 mile irradiated, grown for shelf \n     life, nutrient void produce. Organic and sustainable farming \n     hasn't really been given the chance in the past, but I do \n     have hope that because of rising fuel costs that maybe our \n     officials will wake up and support locally grown and sold \n     agriculture (at the expense of big agri and big oil). It will \n     be cheaper with less transportation costs, but to get off the \n     ground we need some government intervention that gives \n     incentives for farmers to take the risk. We subsidize all the \n     corn out there to make us obese with its crack of sweeteners \n     and processed puffed foods and to feed more farm animals than \n     we really have business eating, ($79 hamburgers???); why do \n     we not give nutrition a fair shake. Why do we not try to \n     learn some of Europe's successes and shape a healthy \n     community-based food system? So what I can do is look at my \n     plate as half full on this issue; that is how high fuel costs \n     can benefit me most.\n       Thank you,\n     Ryan.\n                                  ____\n\n       The high energy prices are affecting our family negatively. \n     Higher grocery prices. Gas prices were 1.46 when Bush took \n     office. Unfortunately, Senator Crapo's vote to support the \n     war in Iraq is one reason that gas prices are so high.\n     Brian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live in Jerome, Idaho, a rural community. We live between \n     Twin Falls and Jerome, my wife works in Twin Falls and I work \n     in Jerome. Since our area is rural and there is not any form \n     of mass transit like in larger cities the high gas prices are \n     killing us. My wife works for Twin Falls school district and \n     they got a 2 percent raise this year and I got a 3 percent \n     raise. The gas prices have taken all of our raises plus much \n     more. We do not take any long drives other than to work. Life \n     has changed in a big way and not to the positive side. The \n     following is an email I received and I did check it out on \n     the internet. Why are we not tapping into this oil field?\n       1. Ever heard of the Bakken Formation? Google it. I did, \n     and again, blew my mind. The U.S. Geological Service issued a \n     report in April ('08) that only scientists and oilmen/women \n     knew was coming, but man was it big. It was a revised report \n     (hadn't been updated since '95) on how much oil was in this \n     area of the western 2/3 of North Dakota; western South \n     Dakota; and extreme eastern Montana . . . check this out:\n       ``The Bakken is the largest domestic oil discovery since \n     Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, and has the potential to eliminate all \n     American dependence on foreign oil. The Energy Information \n     Administration (EIA) estimates it at 503 billion barrels. \n     Even if just 10% of the oil is recoverable . . . at $107 a \n     barrel, we're looking at a resource base worth more than $5.3 \n     trillion.\n       `` `When I first briefed legislators on this, you could \n     practically see their jaws hit the floor.

It is a formation known as the Williston Basin, \n     but is more commonly referred to as the `Bakken.' And it \n     stretches from Northern Montana, through North Dakota and \n     into Canada. For years, U.S. oil exploration has been \n     considered a dead end. Even the `Big Oil' companies gave up \n     searching for major oil wells decades ago. However, a recent \n     technological breakthrough has opened up the Bakken's massive \n     reserves . . . and we now have access of up to 500 billion \n     barrels.

Get all your fellow Senators to emphasize conservation \n     and to practice what they preach.

Show me that the federal bureaucracy really can reduce \n     the waste of our energy and natural resources. Start with \n     your office and your staff. Hypocrisy is so yesterday!\n       3. Quit the whining that we must drill in the ANWR. The so-\n     called Naval Reserves established in the 1920s are now being \n     ``developed'' for oil and gas exploitation; an area the size \n     of the State of Indiana.\n       4. Show us that oil and gas drilling can be done properly. \n     The massive operations in Wyoming are creating a gawd-awful \n     mess.\n       5. Encourage our nation's truck carriers to pay their \n     drivers by the hour and not by the mile. Then, the drivers \n     will have a decent incentive to drive at the speed limit and \n     conserve fuel.\n       6. Then, if you dare, encourage the USPS to eliminate \n     Saturday deliveries, and keep those 200,000 residential-\n     delivery jitneys off the road.

This \n     is because of what has been done to the U.S. dollar during \n     the Bush/Republican years. Deficit spending and a disastrous \n     war in Iraq have frittered away a budget surplus and progress \n     toward reducing our national debt. Rather than act as the \n     party of fiscal responsibility, the Republican Party has \n     frittered our national financial health away.\n       Over the last few years, it was plainly obvious what was \n     being done to the dollar from a spendthrift Congress and \n     markets acted accordingly. And, if you believe that your \n     currency is going to become worthless, the only way to \n     preserve your net worth is to own tangible things, \n     particularly commodities. This is what has spurred this \n     massive commodity boom--lack of faith in the dollar. I have \n     been invested in a basket of commodities for over four years \n     now, one of the best investments I have ever made. My \n     decision was based heavily on the irresponsible Congress.\n       If you have any doubts about this relationship, look no \n     further than those bad unemployment numbers from June 6th. \n     Intuitively, you'd think that lots of unemployed people would \n     cause oil prices to drop on weaker demand. Yet oil had its \n     biggest one day rise in history, starting the minute those \n     unemployment numbers came out. Why? Because bad unemployment \n     numbers puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to hold rates \n     steady or lower them at a time when the Fed wants to raise \n     them before inflation gets any further out of control. This \n     is bad for the dollar; the dollar dropped as well that day.\n       Let me give you a quick example of the effect the weak \n     dollar has had on gas prices. Let's say the dollar magically \n     went back to par with the Euro, where it used to be not so \n     very long ago. Gasoline would be around $2.70 per gallon! A \n     strong dollar would also pop this balloon of commodity \n     speculation we are seeing and drive down prices even further.\n       So if you truly want to fix high gasoline prices, it is \n     time to face up to the giant elephant in the room that is the \n     irresponsible fiscal policy of the U.S. Congress and stop \n     this huffing and puffing about drilling on the continental \n     shelf and ANWR. Even a hint of real fiscal responsibility \n     would go a long way toward strengthening the dollar. We \n     cannot drill our way out of this problem, as much as\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n     the oil companies would like to have you believe that. \n     Because of the very same weak dollar, U.S. oil reserves are \n     extremely profitable at this time, so it is no surprise they \n     are pushing hard for expanded drilling.

Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a \nstatement given by Mrs. Sheng Xiong, a spokeswoman for her husband \nHakit Yang and other families of Hmong-American citizens from St. Paul, \nMN, that are being detained by the the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, \nLPDR, regime. This statement was given by Mrs. Xiong at a congressional \nforum on Laos on January 31, 2008, organized by the Center for Public \nPolicy Analysis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Statement to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                     Statement by Mrs. Sheng Xiong\n\n       I want to thank Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Congressman \n     Frank Wolf, Congressman Patrick Kennedy, Congresswoman Tammy \n     Baldwin and other Members of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives for co-hosting today's U.S. Congressional \n     Forum on Laos in cooperation with Mr. Philip Smith, Executive \n     Director of the Center for Public Policy Analysis, Dr. Jane \n     Hamilton-Merritt, Lao Hmong scholar; Vaughn Vang of the Lao \n     Human Rights Council of Wisconsin and Minnesota; Khamphet \n     Moukdarath of the United League for Democracy in Laos and T. \n     Kumar, Advocacy Director of Amnesty International. I \n     appreciate their leadership on the current human rights \n     crisis in Laos, especially facing the Hmong people, and the \n     serious situation regarding the arrest and imprisonment in \n     Laos of my husband, Hakit Yang, and his two Hmong-American \n     colleagues from St. Paul, Minnesota last year.\n       The U.S. Government granted Normalized Trade Relations \n     (NTR) to Laos in 2005. Today, it encourages citizens to \n     consider foreign investments in the communist state despite \n     the country's atrocious human rights records and the \n     unjustified arrest, jailing and continued detention of three \n     Hmong-American citizens from St. Paul, Minnesota including my \n     husband Mr. Hakit Yang.\n       On July 10, 2007, Hakit Yang, Congshineng Yang and Trillion \n     Yuhaison departed the United States for Laos to pursue \n     business investment opportunities. The men were staying at \n     the #5 Guest House in Phousavan, Laos when they were arrested \n     by secret police forces. They were detained in Phonthong \n     Prison and later transferred to an unknown destination. \n     Several unofficial reports suggest they are being detained in \n     the North of Laos near the Vietnam border.\n       The last phone call and communication was received from \n     Yuhaison on August 26, 2007 at approximately 9:00 am (CST). \n     Yuhaison called Hakit's older brother Xai Yang, and stated \n     that he was calling from a security guard's cell phone and \n     confirmed that all three men had been arrested without \n     warrant. Yuhaison sounded very worried and wanted Xai to \n     contact the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane right away.\n       A U.S. Embassy staff confirmed with local Lao authorities \n     that three U.S. Citizens were arrested, however, the \n     authorities refused to release any names. According to the \n     U.S. Embassy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not \n     confirm the situation over the phone, but it appeared they \n     knew about the cases.\n       The U.S. Embassy contacted the Lao government who denied \n     having any record of the men entering their country and any \n     U.S. Citizens being detained or arrested. Later, the Lao \n     government changed their previous denials and admitted that \n     the men did indeed enter Laos, but allegedly claimed that \n     they had allegedly departed Laos via the Lao-Thai Friendship \n     Bridge on August 29, 2007. Despite repeated requests from the \n     U.S. Embassy no departure cards have ever been produced as \n     evidence for their departure. Other documents produced are \n     clearly bogus and fabricated allegedly claiming to support \n     the Lao government's false claims that my husband and the \n     other two departed from Laos to Thailand, which is not \n     factual.\n       It has been many months since the arrest and disappearance \n     of Hakit Yang, Congshineng Yang and Trillion Yuhaison. To \n     this day, our family has not received any concrete answers \n     from the U.S. Embassy in Laos nor the State Department. I \n     have been in contact with the other men's families and they \n     also have not received any answers.\n       The U.S. Government and U.S. Embassy have a responsibility \n     to inform U.S. Citizens that there are no real protections in \n     place to safeguard their civil and legal rights. The U.S. \n     Government has failed to properly hold the Laos Government \n     accountable for the disappearance of these U.S. investors.\n       Hakit, Congshineng, and Trillion represent the first of \n     many U.S. investors and tourists to travel to Laos under the \n     new Normalised Trade Relations agreement but their \n     disappearance clearly proves that no U.S. Citizen is safe in \n     Laos and no U.S. citizen should invest in the current Lao \n     regime until proper protections can be put in place, to \n     safeguard the civil, legal and human rights of all U.S. \n     Citizens traveling to Laos.\n       I respectfully ask that the U.S. Government and U.S. \n     Embassy in Laos continue to investigate the arrest and \n     disappearance of Hakit, Congshineng, and Trillion and to \n     press the Lao government for humanitarian access to the three \n     U.S. citizens and their unconditional and immediate release.\n       The Lao government continues to jail my husband and the two \n     other Americans from St. Paul that he was traveling with in \n     clear violation and contempt of international law. Lao and \n     Hmong Americans should not invest in the current regime in \n     Laos, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. NTR Trade Status \n     to Laos should be revoked by the U.S. Congress; and, U.S. \n     foreign aid and assistance to the Lao regime should also be \n     cut by the U.S. Congress and U.S. Government completely, \n     including all de-mining funding, until at least such time as \n     my husband Hakit Yang, Congshineng and Trillion, as Hmong-\n     American citizens, are released from prison in Laos and \n     brought home safely to America and their homes and families \n     in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n       We will not forget and not give up fighting until we have \n     truthful answers and the Lao regime releases Hakit Yang, \n     Congshineng and Trillion. We appeal to the U.S. Congress, the \n     U.S. Government and international community for assistance in \n     pressing the Lao regime to release our family members and \n     restore human rights and freedom to them so that we can be \n     reunited and these American citizens can return home once \n     again from this terrible darkness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6152-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6152-S6153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF JEANNA HENRY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I recognize the outstanding \ncontributions of Jeanna Henry, whose dedication to the Environmental \nProtection Agency earned her the Glen Witmer Award. Jeanna, noted for \nher dedication, resourcefulness, and sheer joy in her work, is an \nexcellent example of the quality employees who serve us at the EPA.\n  The Glen Witmer Award is presented each year to the employee whose \nservice is distinguished by concern for our environment, enthusiasm for \nenvironmental programs, a logical approach to problem solving, \nattention to detail, resourcefulness and initiative, and an ability to \ninteract with people in a manner that fosters cooperation, \nunderstanding, and resolution of environmental problems. It is the \nhighest award that may be presented to an employee by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Jeanna grew up in Delmar, MD--the town too big for one State--and \ngraduated from Salisbury State University in 1996 with a degree in \nenvironmental health and minors in biology and chemistry. Following \nthrough on a goal she set her freshman year of college, Jeanna went on \nto work as an environmental scientist at the EPA upon winning a \nNational Network for Environmental Management Studies Fellowship. \nCurrently an enforcement officer at EPA's Waste and Chemical Management \nDivision in Wilmington, DE, she has managed a multitude of hazardous \nwaste and underground storage tank enforcement cases, all with \nmotivation, professionalism, and extraordinary attention to detail.\n  Beyond her achievements in her field, Jeanna is most noted for her \nwork ethic, exceptional communication skills, and for the passion that \nshe brings to all of her undertakings. New employees often gravitate \ntowards her because despite her heavy workload, she is never too busy \nto take time out to help others. She has become a mentor for new \nemployees, a role model for her peers, and an absolute joy to her \nsupervisors.\n  Jeanna is not only an outstanding employee, but a remarkable person, \nas well.

In World War II, he served \nas an officer in the Pacific Theater and after earning his law degree \nin 1956, set up a legal practice at the vanguard of the civil rights \nmovement. He helped to successfully win equal pay for Black employees \nin several cases, to integrate State labor unions, and served five \nterms as president of the Urban League of Greater New Orleans. Justice \nOrtique not only worked to achieve racial equality but also to achieve \nracial harmony and served three terms as president of the New Orleans \nCommunity Relations Council. He negotiated for the Black community with \nWhite civic leaders helping to bring about the peaceful desegregation \nof lunch counters, bathrooms, and other public facilities in New \nOrleans before the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nwould guarantee these rights.\n  Justice Ortique was a courtly figure with a mild manner that belied \nhis courage, convictions, and ability to effect change.

Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 18 \nthrough 20, the residents of New Salem, ND, will celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  New Salem began on an April day in 1882 when young John Christiansen \nhopped off a westbound freight train. The only sign of civilization he \nsaw were the train tracks behind him and the belongings he brought. \nSoon after his arrival a Colonization Bureau out of Chicago sent \nsettlers to the area and gave the colony its independence for $600. A \nchurch, land office, lumber yard, drugstore, and general store were \nsoon built, and by the end of 1883, the town was ready for great plains \nliving.\n  Known nationally as the home of the world's largest Holstein cow, New \nSalem is a community filled with pride and energy. ``Salem Sue'' stands \n38 feet high, weighs over 6 tons, and was erected by the New Salem \nLions Club in 1974 to honor the dairymen of North Dakota. New Salem \nalso has a nine-hole golf course, public swimming pool, and numerous \nparks to entertain residents and tourists.\n  To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the community of New Salem is \norganizing a celebration that will include a parade, demolition derby, \nmixed golf scramble, pitchfork fondue, and numerous outdoor activities. \nA street dance down New Salem's Main Street will also be held. It \npromises to be a wonderful event.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating New \nSalem, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring New Salem and all the other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as New Salem \nthat have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is \nwhy this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  New Salem has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6153-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             125TH ANNIVERSARY OF RICHARDTON, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On July 11 through 13, the residents of Richardton will \ngather to celebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Richardton is located in Stark County in the southwest part of the \nState. Oscar L. Richard named the town in 1882 after his relative, C.B. \nRichard, who was an agent for the Hamburg-American Steamship Co., which \npromoted German-Russian settlement in this area. The post office was \nestablished a year later by Adolph Norberg. In 1906, the village was \nincorporated, and Richardton was officially recognized as a city in \n1935.\n  Richardton has a prominent Roman Catholic monastery, which was \nfounded by Bishop Vincent DePaul Wehrle in 1899. Vincent was the first \nAbbot of the monastery, which was named St. Mary's Priory, from 1903-\n1910. Under his leadership, the great twin-tower cathedral was built in \n1906.\n  St. Mary's faced significant challenges after its completion in 1910 \nwhich eventually led to its closure. Abbot Alcuin Deutsch of St. John's \nAbbey in Minnesota wanted to revive the Richardton community because it \nwas still struggling financially. In 1926, Abbot Deutsch and other \nmonks around North Dakota helped reopen the monastery with the name \nAssumption Abbey. Assumption Abbey remains in operation today.\n  Richardton's attractions also include a golf course, bed and \nbreakfasts, restaurants, motels and much more. Residents of Richardton \ntake great pride in their community. To celebrate their 125th \ncentennial anniversary, the community will be holding a 5k walk/run, a \nparade, games, an antique car show, a Rough Rider Rodeo, a dance, and a \nfireworks show.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nRichardton, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in \nwishing them well in the future. By honoring Richardton and all other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nRichardton that have helped shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Richardton has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6153-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6153-S6154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING KENWAY CORPORATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the Kenway \nCorporation, an outstanding small business from my home State of Maine \nthat recently earned the distinguished recognition of Manufacturer of \nthe Year by the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership, or Maine \nMEP. A fiberglass manufacturer located in Maine's capital city of \nAugusta, the Kenway Corporation has for over 60 years been known for \nits high-quality products. The MEP's Manufacturer of the Year award is \npresented every year to a company that has achieved world-class status \nand has applied the best manufacturing practices necessary to succeed \nin the marketplace.\n  The Kenway Corporation formally began operations as Kenway Boats in \n1947 in the rural community of Palermo, ME. Originally focused on \nbuilding wooden crafts, the firm switched its concentration to \ncomposites in the 1960s and has since grown into a tremendously \nsuccessful manufacturing company. Today, Kenway manufactures corrosion-\nresistant fiberglass for a variety of industries, including marine, \npulp and paper, and power. Notably, in 1991, Kenway moved its venture \nto Augusta and increased its manufacturing facilities to more than \n10,000 square feet. The firm is expanding again this year by doubling \nits current size while consolidating its operations. Additionally, \nsince 2003, the company has increased its staff more than twofold, to \nnearly 80 employees, and Kenway is seeking to provide even more jobs in \nthe near future. Kenway has attracted a loyal customer base ranging \nfrom coast to coast and even to Puerto Rico.\n  The Kenway Corporation's products are highly advanced and heavily \nsought after by numerous companies. Kenway\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nmakes process piping that is used in petrochemical and wastewater \ntreatment facilities, as well as in power plants and paper mills. In \naddition, the firm manufactures an assortment of custom designed \ndampers, tanks, scrubbers, shower pipes, and railcar drip pans to \nprevent corrosion and chemical leakage. Kenway's employees engage in an \narray of intensive manufacturing processes, including laminating, \nvacuum resin transfer molding, and pultrusion.\n  Since its inception 61 years ago, the Kenway Corporation has wisely \ntaken advantage of tools available to small businesses. In 2007, the \nMaine Department of Economic and Community Development designated \nKenway a Pine Tree Zone business, making it eligible for targeted tax \nbenefits to better compete in today's global economy. The company had \npreviously won a $100,000 grant from the Maine Technology Institute, \nwhich allowed Kenway to install sensor systems in its piping to \ntransfer hazardous materials.\n  Early last year, Kenway returned to its historic roots of \nshipbuilding by purchasing Maritime Skiff from its retiring \nMassachusetts owners. Now operating under the name Maritime Marine, the \ncompany makes small, fuel-efficient skiffs and family fishing boats \nwith fiberglass decks and hulls. Kenway received a $400,000 community \ndevelopment block grant to properly incorporate Maritime Skiff into its \npresent operations, a transition that has thus far yielded positive \nresults. To generate additional interest in Maritime's line of vessels, \nthe company recently began offering a lifetime no-rot warranty on all \nof its models.\n  A powerhouse and leader in fiberglass manufacturing for nearly a half \ncentury, the Kenway Corporation's name is synonymous with quality \ncraftsmanship and innovative production. Through intelligent growth and \nadjusting to economic conditions, Kenway has been successful at staying \nahead of the curve and maintaining its preeminent position. I commend \nKen Priest, company president, and everyone at the Kenway Corporation \nfor their accomplishment in garnering the respected Manufacturer of the \nYear award from the Maine MEP and wish them well in their continuing \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6154-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING SHANE BRYAN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A resolution adopted by the Council of the City of \n     Tehachapi, California, expressing its support for the \n     original and historic view of the Second Amendment; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       POM-402. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to appropriate the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers the total amount of \n     funds collected from the Harbor Maintenance Tax; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 127\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana, more than most other states, is keenly \n     aware of the importance of maintaining waterway channels \n     clear for navigation with several major rivers, including the \n     Mississippi River, flowing through the state and is also \n     keenly aware that dredging navigation channels and letting \n     the dredge material merely flow out to the Gulf of Mexico is, \n     in essence, letting Louisiana merely flow out to the Gulf of \n     Mexico; and\n       Whereas, if the total amount of funds collected from the \n     Harbor Maintenance Tax is appropriated to the Corps of \n     Engineers, those funds could be used to help fund the \n     dredging necessary to maintain the navigation channels open \n     for commerce; and\n       Whereas, an ancillary use of dredging activity that has \n     become essential to the preservation of Louisiana's coastline \n     is beneficial use of dredge material whereby the material \n     dredged from waterways is then taken and ``planted'' where it \n     can be used to preserve and grow land in the coastal areas \n     where Louisiana is losing land at an alarming rate; and\n       Whereas, coastal Louisiana was formed by the depositional \n     processes of the Mississippi River over the past seven \n     thousand five hundred years; and\n       Whereas, the thick fluvial deposits that comprise the \n     Mississippi River Delta are naturally prone to compaction \n     under their own weight, but if sediment supplies are \n     sufficient, the delta can build and maintain its surfaces as \n     sea level rises; and\n       Whereas, the land building processes of the Mississippi \n     River have been halted in South Louisiana by a combination of \n     levees which prevent seasonal overbank flooding and sediment \n     deposition, dredged waterways which channel freshwater and \n     sediment to the Gulf of Mexico, and upstream dam construction \n     which prevent sediment from naturally reaching the Louisiana \n     coast; and\n       Whereas, over fifteen hundred square miles of Louisiana's \n     coastal wetlands and barrier islands have been lost to open \n     water since the early 1930s, and scientists project that \n     another five hundred square miles will be lost by 2050, if \n     current resource management practices continue; and\n       Whereas, more than one hundred twenty million tons of river \n     sediment that could be used to sustain the Mississippi Delta \n     will be lost to the Gulf of Mexico each year if nothing is \n     done to restore the natural hydrology of the Mississippi \n     River; and\n       Whereas, prevention of wetland loss in the Mississippi \n     River Deltaic Plain, which comprises most of the southeastern \n     Louisiana coastal zone, is dependent upon restoring flows of \n     fresh water and sediment to the delta; and\n       Whereas, an international team of scientists convened for \n     the express purpose of advising the state of Louisiana about \n     its coastal land loss problem in 2006 concluded that, ``The \n     most fundamental and essential action needed to achieve a \n     sustainable coast is to reduce, to the greatest extent \n     possible, the amount of Mississippi River sediment and \n     freshwater flowing directly into the deep waters of the Gulf. \n     These valuable resources, which originally built coastal \n     Louisiana, can only benefit the coast if they are redirected \n     to inshore and nearshore waters. This would occur naturally \n     if the river were not artificially maintained for navigation \n     along its present course into deep water''; and\n       Whereas, fully appropriating to the Corps of Engineers the \n     revenue received from the Harbor Maintenance Tax could \n     provide the funds essential to both dredge rivers for \n     navigation purposes as intended by the imposition of the tax \n     and, to go a step further, as authorized by the tax, to use \n     that dredge material for beneficial uses in restoring and \n     preserving coastal Louisiana. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to appropriate to the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers the total amount of \n     funds collected from the Harbor Maintenance Tax so that those \n     funds can be used for dredging navigation channels and, where \n     possible, the beneficial use of dredged material to protect, \n     restore, and conserve wetlands along the coast of Louisiana. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-403.

These brave Americans \n     deserve the respect and gratitude of our nation and all \n     efforts should be made to resolve the Prisoner of War-Missing \n     in Action issue in their honor. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the members \n     of the South Carolina House of Representatives, by this \n     resolution, urge the United States Congress to appoint an \n     independent counsel to investigate the Prisoner of War-\n     Missing in Action issue regarding unresolved matters \n     pertaining to United States personnel unaccounted for from \n     this nation's wars and conflicts beginning with World War II. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the President of the United States, the United States Senate \n     and House of Representatives, and the members of the South \n     Carolina Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-404. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Tennessee urging the adoption of a Veterans \n     Remembered Flag; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution, No. 901\n\n       Whereas, there are flags for all branches of the armed \n     services, as well as flags for POWs and MIAs, but there is no \n     flag to honor the millions of former military personnel who \n     have served our nation; and\n       Whereas, a flag is the symbol of recognition for a group or \n     an ideal; veterans compose a group and certainly represent an \n     ideal, and surely deserve their own symbol; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that 20,400,000 veterans have \n     served in our nation's military, comprising a significant \n     portion of our country's population; and\n       Whereas, a Veterans Remembered Flag would memorialize and \n     honor all past, present, and future veterans and provide an \n     enduring symbol to support tomorrow's veterans today; and\n       Whereas, displaying and flying this flag would honor the \n     lives of millions of men and women who have served our \n     country in times of war, peace, and national crisis; and\n       Whereas, the symbolism of this unique flag's design would \n     be all-inclusive and would pay respect to the history of our \n     nation, to all branches of the military, and would serve to \n     honor those who have served or died in the service of our \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, in memorializing America's veterans, the Veterans \n     Remembered Flag includes specific symbolism and should be \n     designed in substantially the following form:\n       (a) It depicts the founding of our nation through the \n     thirteen stars that emanate from the hoist of the flag and \n     march to the large red star, representing our nation and the \n     five branches of our country's military that defend her: the \n     Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard.\n       (b) The white star indicates a veteran's dedication to \n     service.\n       (c) The blue star honors all men and women who have ever \n     served in our country's military.\n       (d) The gold star memorializes those who fell defending our \n     nation.\n       (e) The blue stripe which bears the title of the flag \n     honors the loyalty of veterans to our nation, flag, and \n     government.\n       (f) The green field represents the hallowed ground where \n     all rest eternally; and\n       Whereas, the Veterans Remembered Flag would serve to honor \n     all veterans who have served in our country's Armed Forces; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate of the One Hundred Fifth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     urges the Congress of the United States to act expeditiously \n     to adopt a Veterans Remembered Flag as described herein. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, \n     the President and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate, and each \n     member of the Tennessee Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-405. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission addressing the incidental taking of marine animals \n     by once-through cooling power plants; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, a cornerstone of the value and uniqueness of \n     California's 1,100 mile coastline and adjacent coastal waters \n     is the richness and diversity of marine life, including fish, \n     marine mammals, birds and plants; and\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has \n     jurisdiction over the state-owned tide and submerged lands \n     from the shoreline out three nautical miles into the Pacific \n     Ocean, as well as the lands underlying California's bays, and \n     navigable lakes and rivers; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is charged with managing these \n     lands pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, a common law \n     precept that requires these lands be protected for public use \n     and needs including commerce, navigation, fisheries, water \n     related recreation and ecological preservation; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has aggressively sought correction \n     of adverse impacts on the biological productivity of its \n     lands including litigation over contamination off the Palos \n     Verdes Peninsula and at Iron Mountain, the adoption of best \n     management practices for marinas, and litigation to restore \n     flows to the Owens River; and\n       Whereas, California has a significant number of power \n     plants that use once-through cooling (OTC), the majority of \n     which are located on bays and estuaries where sensitive fish \n     nurseries for many important species are located; and\n       Whereas, the environmental costs of persistent entrainment \n     and impingement from once-through cooling to marine and \n     coastal life and ecosystems are high; and\n       Whereas, OTC harms the environment by killing large numbers \n     of wildlife, including fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles, \n     as well as larvae and eggs, as they are drawn through fish \n     screens and other parts of the power plant cooling system; \n     and\n       Whereas, regulations adopted under Section 316(b) of the \n     federal Clean Water Act recognize the adverse impacts of OTC \n     by effectively prohibiting new power plants from using such \n     systems and requiring existing power plants to reduce OTC \n     impacts; and\n       Whereas, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled \n     that restoration measures do not minimize the impacts of \n     once-through cooling and cannot be used to comply with Clean \n     Water section 316(b); and\n       Whereas, the California State Water Resources Control Board \n     is currently developing a state policy to implement Clean \n     Water Act Section 316(b), which, in the draft released for \n     public comment, will require the phase out of OTC technology \n     at coastal power plants; and\n       Whereas, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is \n     evaluating applications, necessitated by the pernicious \n     impacts of OTC, from thirteen power generating stations \n     located in California requesting authority for incidental \n     take of marine mammals and seven applications from power \n     generating stations in California requesting permits for \n     incidental take of sea turtles; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has imposed conditions on its \n     leases to reduce the impact of OTC and is seriously concerned \n     about the environmental consequences of the proposed \n     incidental take of marine animals as a result of OTC; and\n       Whereas, alternative cooling methods such as repowering \n     older power plants are readily available and used nationwide, \n     and can eliminate OTC and its attendant environmental impacts \n     and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions currently associated \n     with fossil fuel power generation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, That it \n     urges the NMFS to: (1) make any incidental take permit \n     consistent with phasing out OTC, and at the minimum, include \n     a clause requiring expiration of the permit if OTC is no \n     longer permitted at the requesting facility or generally \n     within the state; (2) deny any incidental take permit for \n     power plants that have discontinued use of OTC; (3) require \n     that information regarding historical and anticipated take be \n     substantiated and made available to the Commission and the \n     public prior to the issuance of any incidental take permit, \n     and referenced in any draft and/or final permit; and (4) \n     require, if an incidental take permit is issued, that \n     stringent controls be implemented to eliminate or prevent to \n     the maximum extent possible the take or harassment of marine \n     wildlife; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State Lands Commission supports OTC \n     alternatives, such as repowering projects, that eliminate \n     OTC, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental \n     impacts, and are part of an overall plan that moves the state \n     towards increased use of renewables and energy conservation; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Commission's Executive Officer transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to \n     the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service, to the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, to the United States \n     Environmental Protection\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\n     Agency, to the United States Supreme Court, to the Chairs of \n     the State Water Resources Control Board, to the California \n     Energy Commission, to the Public Utilities Commission, to the \n     California Coastal Commission, to the California Air \n     Resources Board, to the California Independent Systems \n     Operator, and to the California Ocean Protection Council, all \n     grantees, and all current lessees of public trust lands that \n     utilize OTC.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-406. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii approving the \n     establishment of a state-province affiliation between the \n     State of Hawaii and the Province of Negros Oriental of the \n     Republic of the Philippines; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                       House of Resolution No. 85\n\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii is actively seeking to expand \n     its international ties and has an abiding interest in \n     developing goodwill, friendship, and economic relations \n     between the people of Hawaii and the people of Asian and \n     Pacific countries; and\n       Whereas, as part of its effort to achieve this goal, Hawaii \n     has established a number of sister-state agreements with \n     provinces in the Pacific region; and\n       Whereas, because of the historical relationship between the \n     United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines, \n     there continue to exist valid reasons to promote \n     international friendship and understanding for the mutual \n     benefit of both countries to achieve lasting peace and \n     prosperity as it serves the common interests of both \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, there are historical precedents exemplifying the \n     common desire to maintain a close cultural, commercial, and \n     financial bridge between ethnic Filipinos living in Hawaii \n     with their relatives, friends, and business counterparts in \n     the Philippines, such as the previously established sister-\n     city relationship between the City and County of Honolulu and \n     the City of Cebu in the Province of Cebu; and\n       Whereas, similar state-province relationships exist between \n     the State of Hawaii and the Provinces of Cebu, Ilocos Norte, \n     Ilocos Sur, and Pangasinan, whereby cooperation and \n     communication have served to establish exchanges in the areas \n     of business, trade, agriculture and industry, tourism, \n     sports, health care, social welfare, and other fields of \n     human endeavor; and\n       Whereas, a similar state-province relationship would \n     reinforce and cement this common bridge for understanding and \n     mutual assistance between ethnic Filipinos of both the State \n     of Hawaii and the Province of Negros Oriental; and\n       Whereas, with its vast fertile land resources, Negros \n     Oriental's major industry is agriculture and lists its \n     primary crops as sugarcane, corn, coconut, and rice, but the \n     province is emerging as a technological center in the Central \n     Philippines with its growing business process outsourcing and \n     other technology-related industries, and is also becoming a \n     notable tourist destination in the Visayas, making the \n     province much like Hawaii; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, That Governor Linda Lingle of the State of Hawaii, or \n     her designee, be authorized and is requested to take all \n     necessary actions to establish a state-province affiliation \n     with the Province of Negros Oriental in the Republic of the \n     Philippines; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Governor or her designee is requested to \n     keep the Legislature of the State of Hawaii fully informed of \n     the process in establishing the affiliation and involved in \n     its formalization to the extent practicable; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Province of Negros Oriental be afforded \n     the privileges and honors that Hawaii extends to its sister \n     states and provinces; and be it further\n       Resolved, That if by June 30, 2013, the state-province \n     affiliation with the Province of Negros Oriental has not \n     reached a sustainable basis by providing mutual economic \n     benefits through local community support, the state-province \n     affiliation shall be withdrawn; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, Hawaii's \n     Congressional delegation, the Governor of the State of \n     Hawaii, the President of the Republic of the Philippines \n     through its Honolulu Consulate General, and the Governor and \n     Provincial Board of the Province of Negros Oriental, Republic \n     of the Philippines.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-407. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to waive single state agency requirements \n     with regard to the administration of funds under the Homeland \n     Security Grant Program; to the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 209\n\n       Whereas, on March 12, 1987, the President of the United \n     States directed all affected agencies to issue a grants \n     management common rule to adopt government-wide terms and \n     conditions for grants to state and local governments; and\n       Whereas, consistent with their legal obligations, all \n     federal agencies administering programs that involve grants \n     and cooperative agreements with state governments must follow \n     the policies outlined in the federal Office of Management and \n     Budget Circular A-102, as revised and amended; and\n       Whereas, the Office of Management and Budget is authorized \n     to grant deviations from the requirements when permissible \n     under existing law, however deviations are permitted only in \n     exceptional circumstances; and\n       Whereas, according to a guidance document from the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the governor of each state \n     must designate a State Administrative Agency to apply for and \n     administer the funds under the Homeland Security Grant \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii State Civil Defense is the State \n     Administrative Agency for these purposes in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, according to the Office for Domestic Preparedness \n     Information Bulletin No. 112 (May 26, 2004), the State \n     Administrative Agency is obligated to pass through no less \n     than eighty per cent of its total grant award to local units \n     of government within the State; and\n       Whereas, according to the Office for Domestic Preparedness \n     Information Bulletin No. 120 (June 16, 2004), the remaining \n     twenty per cent can be retained at the state level; and\n       Whereas, qualifying state and local government agencies in \n     Hawaii can apply to Hawaii State Civil Defense for State \n     Homeland Security Grant Program funds, and Hawaii State Civil \n     Defense allocates funds based on investments and how well the \n     program capabilities of the various state agencies tie \n     together; and\n       Whereas, a single state agency requirement in the \n     application and allocation of funds under the Homeland \n     Security Grant Program is misplaced because it grants \n     considerable discretion to one state agency for the \n     allocation of funds, with no oversight by the state \n     legislature; and\n       Whereas, it is traditionally the role of the state \n     legislature as the policy making branch of the government to \n     determine how financial resources should be allocated; and\n       Whereas, state legislatures should have greater input and \n     oversight regarding the allocation of funds under the \n     Homeland Security Grant Program, now: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, That the United States Congress is requested to enact \n     legislation to waive the single state agency requirement with \n     regard to the administration of funds under the Homeland \n     Security Grant Program and to provide state legislatures with \n     authority to approve the allocation of funds under the \n     Homeland Security Grant Program; and it be it further\n       Resolved That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Hawaii \n     congressional delegation, and the State Adjutant General.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-408.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nemployers to notify their employees of the availability of the earned \nincome credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleague from the House, Rep. Rahm Emanuel, an important and \nnoncontroversial bill designed to increase the percentage of eligible \nfamilies that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, every year.\n  The bill is endorsed by the Service Employees International Union, \nSEIU, Wal-Mart, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the \nCitizens for Tax Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nCorporate Voices for Working Families, the College and University \nProfessional Association for Human Resources, TJ Maxx, Kindred \nHealthcare, and Cintas.\n  Even in these tough economic times, Wal-Mart is still the nation's \ntop private employer, and they place a huge emphasis on keeping their \nbusiness costs low. If they are taking such a lead role on this bill, \nit should send a strong signal to the business community and to \nRepublicans that it is a good idea and that the cost burden on business \nis next to nothing.\n  The EITC is a hugely important and popular program for working \nfamilies. Started under President Ford after President Nixon advanced a \nsimilar program, and expanded under virtually every President since, \nthe EITC sends a message that if you work hard and play by the rules, \nyou shouldn't live in poverty.\n  I know the program isn't perfect, but it's the best tax tool we have \nfor helping working families make ends meet. Combined with the recent \nincrease in the minimum wage that Democrats pushed through the \nCongress, the EITC is improving the lives of million of families.\n  For tax year 2006, more than $44 billion in benefits were distributed \nto more than 22.4 million American families. That shows what a success \nthe program is.\n  As one of the most populous states, with millions of working families \nof modest means, the numbers for New York State by itself are \nimpressive. In 2006, nearly 1.5 million New York families took \nadvantage of the EITC, claiming $2.8 billion in benefits. That's an \naverage of $1,867 per family. But if the estimates from the Government \nAccountability Office are right and 25 percent of eligible families do \nnot file for the credit, that's almost 500,000 families in my state who \nare missing out.\n  At an average EITC benefit of nearly $1,900, that means that more \nthan $900 million could be going back into the pockets of New Yorkers--\nwithout a single change in the law--if we could find a way to reach \nthese families. It could represent a second stimulus package for \n500,000 working families as large as the one we passed earlier this \nyear--and all eligible families have to do is ask for it.\n  With gasoline costing over $4 a gallon, and health care and tuition \ncosts on the rise, if we can get an average of $1,900 into the pockets \nof 500,000 New York families, or 7.5 million people nationally--that's \nan opportunity we can't pass up.\n  Since these families are eligible for the credit under current law, \nit's not a policy that has to be scored or ``paid for'' under the PAYGO \nrules, because current law assumes these benefits will be paid. I can't \nimagine anyone objecting to this bill.\n  The Emanuel/Schumer legislation simply requires that employers notify \ntheir workers of their potential eligibility for the EITC when they \nsend out the annual W-2 wage notice. To satisfy the notice requirement, \nemployers would provide either a copy of IRS Notice 797, which explains \nhow one qualifies for the EITC, or a separate written notice that is \ndescribed in the language of the bill.\n  For those that might be concerned about the cost to business, our \nbill exempts firms with less than 25 employees.\n  This is a bill that is such common-sense, and represents such little \ncost to business, and offers such a large potential benefit to so many \nfamilies, that it's something that we ought to be able to pass \nunanimously before the end of the year.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n  Rep. Emanuel and I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson \ntoday about the bill. Even though the Bush Administration is nearing \nits end, the goals of this legislation could be accomplished via \nregulation or executive order, and I urge the Administration to take \nsuch action and render the bill moot. Rep. Emanuel and I would be happy \nnot to have to pass this bill. Otherwise, we will push it and hope to \npass it with broad bipartisan support by year's end. With unions and \nmajor employers both supporting the bill, there really should be no \nobjection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Earned Income Credit \n     Information Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds:\n       (1) President Gerald Ford and Congress created the earned \n     income credit (EIC) in 1975 to offset the adverse effects of \n     Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on working poor \n     families and to encourage low-income workers to seek \n     employment rather than welfare.\n       (2) President Ronald Reagan described the earned income \n     credit as ``the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the \n     best job-creation measure to come out of Congress.''\n       (3) Over the last 30 years, the EIC program has grown into \n     the largest Federal anti-poverty program in the United \n     States. In 2005, 22.8 million tax filers received $42.4 \n     billion in tax credits through the EIC program.\n       (4) In 2007, the EIC provided a maximum Federal benefit of \n     $4,716 for families with 2 or more children, $2,853 for \n     families with a single child, and $428 for a taxpayer with no \n     qualifying children.\n       (5) Based on analysis conducted by the General \n     Accountability Office, 25 percent of those eligible to \n     receive the EIC do not take advantage of the tax benefit.\n       (6) Based on analysis conducted by the Joint Economic \n     Committee, working Americans may have lost out on \n     approximately $8 billion in unclaimed earned income credits \n     in 2004.\n       (7) In response to a study by the California Franchise Tax \n     Board that found that there were approximately 460,000 \n     California families that qualified, but did not file, for the \n     EIC, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law Assembly \n     Bill 650, the Earned Income Tax Credit Information Act, on \n     October 13, 2007. The law requires that California employers \n     notify employees of their potential eligibility for the EIC.\n       (8) In order to ensure that tax benefits designed to assist \n     working Americans reach the maximum number of people, the \n     Federal Government should enact a similar law.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to inform the \n     greatest possible number of Americans about their potential \n     eligibility for the earned income credit in a way that is \n     neither costly nor burdensome for employers or the \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Henry Paulson,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Paulson: Over the last 30 years, the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit (EITC) has grown into the largest Federal \n     anti-poverty program in the United States. In 2006, over 22 \n     million taxpayers received almost $44 billion through the \n     EITC. During its history, the program has been supported by \n     both Democrats and Republicans. President Ronald Reagan \n     described the earned income credit as ``the best anti-\n     poverty, the best pro-family, the best job-creation measure \n     to come out of Congress.''\n       As you know, millions of eligible Americans fail to take \n     advantage of this critical program, costing themselves \n     billions in tax benefits. Based on an analysis conducted by \n     the General Accountability Office, 25 percent of those \n     eligible to receive the EITC do not take advantage of it. The \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that between 20 and \n     25 percent of taxpayers who are eligible don't claim the \n     credit. While this issue has been a persistent source of \n     concern, it is particularly troubling now when Americans are \n     contending with record high gas prices and surging costs for \n     other consumer goods.\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n       On October 13, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed \n     into law Assembly Bill 650, the Earned Income Tax Credit \n     Information Act. The legislation seeks to reduce the number \n     of eligible taxpayers who fail to take advantage of the EITC \n     by requiring California employers to notify their employees \n     of their potential eligibility for the EITC. We believe that \n     the California law should serve as a model for federal \n     action, and will shortly introduce legislation to accomplish \n     this goal.\n       We bring this to your attention because we believe that the \n     goal of increasing awareness of the EITC, and thus expanding \n     the number of taxpayers who access it, can also be \n     accomplished through administrative rule-making.\n       Earlier in the year, you played a critical role in \n     providing needed economic stimulus to working Americans that \n     is now helping to soften the brunt of our current economic \n     downturn. By increasing the number of eligible taxpayers who \n     take advantage of the EITC program, you can build on this \n     accomplishment and add further stimulus by providing, in some \n     cases, thousands of dollars of assistance that can be used to \n     buy gas or groceries, or pay the mortgage.\n       For this reason, we ask you to explore what the \n     Administration can do to improve EITC outreach efforts, and \n     specifically ask that you examine the possibility of \n     requiring employers to provide information to their employees \n     about the EITC at the same time that they provide W-2 \n     statements. Earlier this year, at an EITC Awareness Day \n     event, you noted: ``Ensuring that more eligible families \n     receive their EITC is important this year, as it is every \n     year. I encourage people all across America to check to see \n     if you are eligible for the Earned Income Credit.'' We \n     couldn't agree more, but believe we should also look to \n     employers to help taxpayers take advantage of critical \n     federal tax programs like the EITC.\n       Finally, we are aware that the Administration instructed \n     federal agencies on May 9, 2008 to not undertake any new \n     rulemaking procedures after June 1, 2008. We sincerely hope \n     that this policy will not prevent the Administration from \n     helping hardworking Americans who need it the most.\n       We look forward to your response and thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rahm Emanuel,\n       House Democratic Caucus Chair.\n     Charles Schumer,\n       Senate Democratic Caucus Vice-Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs Boxer, Mr. \n        Cardin, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 3191. A bill to develop and promote a comprehensive plan for a \nnational strategy to address harmful algal blooms and hypoxia through \nbaseline research, forecasting and monitoring, and mitigation and \ncontrol while helping communities detect, control, and mitigate coastal \nand Great Lakes harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Harmful Algal \nBloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2008. This bill would enhance the \nresearch programs established in the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia \nResearch and Control Act of 1998 and reauthorized in 2004, which have \ngreatly enhanced our ability to predict outbreaks of harmful algal \nblooms and the extent of hypoxic zones. But knowing when outbreaks will \noccur is only half the battle. By funding additional research into \nmitigation and prevention of HABs and hypoxia, and by enabling \ncommunities to develop response strategies to more effectively reduce \ntheir effects on our coastal communities, this legislation would take \nthe next critical steps to reducing the social and economic impacts of \nthese potentially disastrous outbreaks.\n  I am proud to continue my leadership on this important issue and I \nparticularly want to thank my counterpart on this key piece of \nlegislation, Senator Bill Nelson. My partnership with Senator Breaux on \nthe first two harmful algal bloom bills proved extremely fruitful, and \nI am pleased that the Gulf of Mexico--whose coastal residents are \nseverely impacted by both harmful algal blooms, also known as HABs, and \nhypoxia--will continue to be so well represented as this program moves \ninto the future. I also want to thank the bill's additional co-\nsponsors, Senators Cantwell, Kerry, Vitter, Voinovich, Boxer and Levin \nfor their vital contributions. We all represent coastal States directly \naffected by harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, and we see first hand the \necological and economic damage caused by these events.\n  In New England blooms of Alexandrium algae, more commonly known as \n``red tide'', can cause shellfish to accumulate toxins that when \nconsumed by humans lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a \npotentially fatal neurological disorder. Therefore, when levels of \nAlexandrium reach dangerous levels, our fishery managers are forced to \nclose shellfish beds that provide hundreds of jobs and add millions of \ndollars to our regional economy. Red tide outbreaks--which occur in \nvarious forms not just in the northeast, but along thousands of miles \nof U.S. coastline--have increased dramatically in the Gulf of Maine in \nthe last 20 years, with major blooms occurring almost every year.\n  In 2005, the most severe red tide since 1972 blanketed the New \nEngland coast from Martha's Vineyard to Downeast Maine, resulting in \nextensive commercial and recreational shellfish harvesting closures \nlasting several months at the peak of the seafood harvesting season. In \na peer-reviewed study, economists found that the 2005 event caused over \n$2.4 million in lost landings of shellfish in the State of Maine alone, \nand more than $10 million throughout New England.\n  In May of this year, scientists once more predicted an abundance of \nAlexandrium off the New England coast, marking the onset of yet another \nsevere harmful algal bloom in the area. Just yesterday, Maine's \nDepartment of Marine Resources announced the closure of additional \nshellfish beds covering many areas from Cutler east to the Canadian \nborder, and today the Food and Drug Administration asked the National \nMarine Fisheries Service to issue a closure of a section of Federal \nwaters near George's Bank to the harvest of ocean quahogs and surf \nclams.\n  Still, while this year's bloom has tracked the pattern of the 2005 \nevent, thanks to previous investments in HAB programs, localized \ntesting has led to fewer closures. Unlike 2005 when nearly the entire \ncoast of Massachusetts and much of Maine was declared off-limits to \nshell fishermen, in this year's bloom, some unaffected areas remain \nopen despite being directly adjacent to contaminated beds. These \ndetailed forecasting and testing measures will greatly reduce the \neconomic impact such outbreaks impose on our coastal communities, and \nis directly attributable to the efforts authorized in previous HAB \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, while we have made great strides in bloom prediction \nand monitoring, it is clear that these problems have not gone away, but \nrather increased in magnitude. Harmful algal blooms remain prevalent \nnationwide, and areas of hypoxia, also known as ``dead zones'', are now \noccurring with increasing frequency. Within a dead zone, oxygen levels \nplummet to the point at which they can no longer sustain life, driving \nout animals that can move, and killing those that cannot. The most \ninfamous dead zone occurs annually in the Gulf of Mexico, off the \nshores of Louisiana. In 2007, researchers there predicted the biggest \nhypoxic zone ever recorded, covering more than 8,500 square miles. Dead \nzones are also occurring with increasing frequency in more areas than \never before, including off the coasts of Oregon and Texas.\n  The amendments contained in this legislation would enhance the \nNation's ability to predict, monitor, and ultimately control harmful \nalgal blooms and hypoxia. Understanding when these blooms will occur is \nvital, but the time has come to take this program to the next level--to \ndetermine not just when an outbreak will occur, but how to reduce its \nintensity or prevent its occurrence all together. This bill would build \non NOAA's successes in research and forecasting by creating a program \nto mitigate and control HAB outbreaks.\n  This bill also recognizes the need to enhance coordination among \nState and local resource managers--those on the front lines who must \nmake the decisions to close beaches or shellfish beds. Their decisions \nare critical to protecting human health, but can also impose \nsignificant economic impacts. The bill would mandate creation of \nRegional Research and Action Plans that would identify baseline \nresearch, possible State and local government actions to prepare for \nand mitigate the impacts of HABs, and establish outreach strategies to \nensure the public is\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\ninformed of the dangers these events can present. A regional focus on \nthese issues will ensure a more effective and efficient response to \nfuture events.\n  Mr. President, if enacted, this critical reauthorization would \ngreatly enhance our Nation's ability to predict, monitor, mitigate, and \ncontrol outbreaks of HABs and hypoxia. Over half the U.S. population \nresides in coastal regions, and we must do all in our power to \nsafeguard their health and the health of the marine environment. The \nexisting Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Program has done a laudable \njob to date, and this authorization will allow them to expand their \nscope and provide greater benefits to the Nation as a whole. I thank my \ncosponsors again for their efforts in developing this vital \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will address an ongoing problem that adversely affects \nlocal communities and coastal areas around my home State of Florida and \nacross coastal States nationwide.\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I, along with Senators Cantwell, Kerry, \nVitter, Levin, Voinovich, Boxer, Cardin, and Mikulski, are introducing \na bill that would reauthorize and enhance the Harmful Algal Bloom and \nHypoxia Research and Control Act, HABHRCA, which was enacted in 1998 \nand reauthorized 4 years ago. This act has enabled critical monitoring, \nforecasting, and research activities that have greatly improved our \nunderstanding and prediction of harmful algal blooms, nuisance blooms \nlike red drift, and low-oxygen or hypoxia events that plague our \nestuaries and coastal waters.\n  While the accomplishments made to date through HABHRCA are certainly \nvaluable and to be commended, more work lies ahead. In Florida, harmful \nalgal blooms, including red tides, and frequent red drift events \ncontinue to occur along our coasts.\n  According to experts from Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, most of \nFlorida's red tides are caused by a microscopic algae called Karenia \nbrevis, which creates blooms that can last for months and cover \nhundreds of square miles. What makes this organism so harmful are the \ntoxins it produces. These toxins can kill fish, birds, and other marine \nanimals. For humans, the toxins trigger respiratory problems, eye and \nskin irritation, and shellfish poisoning when the toxins accumulate in \noysters and clams. When these blooms die, the decomposing algae strip \noxygen from the water column. These hypoxic conditions deprive fish, \nmanatees, and other animal species of the oxygen they need to survive.\n  A particularly devastating and intense red tide struck the Florida \ngulf coast in the summer of 2005, causing widespread animal deaths and \npublic health and economic problems. The St.\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nPetersburg/Clearwater Area Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated \nupwards of $240 million in losses for the Tampa region as a result of \nthis bloom.\n  Scientists have told us that red tides are a lot like hurricanes \ncomplex but natural phenomena that can have profound impacts on our \nenvironment and society. Although we may not be able to stop this \nnatural process, we can do more to predict it and take actions to \nminimize its impacts on our citizens and natural resources.\n  While red drift algae lack the toxins associated with red tide, they \ncan nonetheless cause enormous problems along Florida's beaches. We \nhave had numerous red drift events in Florida over the last few years. \nIn March 2007, some witnesses described clumps of red drift algae the \nsize of hay bales floating on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and \nwashing onshore from Fort Myers to Anna Maria Island. Scientists have \nalso been looking into whether nutrients from the decomposing algae may \nfeed subsequent blooms, keeping local waters in a terrible cycle.\n  Other algal blooms are impairing waterways and causing social and \neconomic problems in my state. Earlier this month, a water treatment \nplant on the Caloosahatchee River in Lee County had to be closed \ntemporarily due to a bloom of blue-green algae.\n  It is clear that harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events can have \ndevastating impacts on water and air quality, aquatic species, \nwildlife, and beach conditions, which in turn affect public health, \ncommercial and recreational fishing, tourism, and related businesses in \nour coastal communities. The question becomes, what can we do to stop \nthis? If we can't stop these events, how can we better plan for them \nand take steps to minimize the impacts?\n  We have learned from scientists and researchers, many of whom were \nfunded by HABHRCA-authorized programs, that some harmful algal blooms \nand red drift events can be triggered by excess nutrients from upland \nareas that wash into rivers and are delivered to the coast. Because \nthis problem often crosses political and geographic boundaries, we must \npursue solutions that are regional in nature and bring together \nexpertise from all levels of government, from academia, and from other \noutside groups who have a stake in keeping our coastal waters healthy, \nclean, and productive.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked together to craft a bill that will \nnot only continue critical research on harmful algal blooms and \nhypoxia, but help address some of these pressing needs that exist on \nevery coast--from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, to the Pacific and \nthe Great Lakes. Our bill will help integrate and improve coordination \namong the government's programs that study and monitor these events. \nThe bill would also improve how regional, state, and local needs are \nconsidered when prioritizing research grants and developing related \nproducts. Most importantly, this bill would focus new resources on \ntranslating research results into tools and products that state and \nlocal governments can use to help prevent, respond to, and mitigate the \nimpacts of these events.\n  Although we have made significant progress in identifying some of the \ncauses and consequences of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia since 1998, \nmuch work remains to find solutions that minimize the occurrence of \nthese events and that enable our coastal communities to become \nresilient to the impacts. This legislation to amend and reauthorize the \nHarmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Act represents an important step \ntoward realizing those goals.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize Senator Snowe for her \nleadership on this issue. As the sponsor of both the original \nlegislation in 1998 and the 2004 amendments, her expertise on harmful \nalgal blooms and the impacts of these events on her constituents has \nproved invaluable as we developed the measure before us today. I look \nforward to working with Senator Snowe, in her role as ranking member of \nthe Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard Subcommittee of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, as well as with \nChairman Cantwell and the other members of our subcommittee, to debate \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3197. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to exempt for \na limited period, from the application of the means-test presumption of \nabuse under chapter 7, qualifying members of reserve components of the \nArmed Forces and members of the National Guard who, after September 11, \n2001, are called to active duty or to perform a homeland defense \nactivity for not less than 90 days; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when our National Guard and Reserve \nmembers return from active duty, the last thing they should have to \nworry about is struggling to catch up on the bills. Sadly, acute \nfinancial challenges are often exactly what greet our bravest men and \nwomen when they come home.\n  For those families who are struggling to make ends meet after serving \nour country, today I am introducing a bill, the National Guard and \nReservists Debt Relief Act, that would give these families a little \nbreathing room. My bill would waive the means test for entering into \nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection for National Guard and Reserve members \nwho have served since September 11, 2001. The bill would give these \nfamilies a little more time to reorganize their finances so that they \ncan get their lives back in order after serving.\n  The 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act \nchanged the U.S. bankruptcy code to make it significantly harder for \nindividuals to receive protection from their creditors via bankruptcy, \nby requiring filers to pass a means test based on an individual's \nincome and expenses for the 6 month period preceding a bankruptcy \nfiling.\n  My bill would exempt returning Guard and Reserve members from this \nmeans test, both because our finest men and women deserve greater \nfinancial protection and because they are uniquely disadvantaged by the \nmeans test criteria. Despite receiving much-deserved active duty pay \nfor their service, National Guard and Reserve members often take a pay \ncut when they leave their jobs for a deployment. But because the means \ntest includes the past 6 months of income in its calculation, men and \nwomen with little current income may not qualify for bankruptcy \nprotection.\n  This is an issue that will become increasingly important in my home \nstate of Illinois. The Illinois National Guard is preparing for the \nlargest deployment of soldiers since World War II, with more than 2,700 \ncurrently training for deployment to Afghanistan. For the men and women \nin this group who find themselves in unfortunate financial \ncircumstances when they return home, particularly if our economy \ncontinues to slow, this bill would help by allowing these men and women \nto file for bankruptcy if they desperately need that help.\n  I am pleased that the House version of this legislation, championed \nby my good friend Representative Jan Schakowsky, passed the House by \nvoice vote earlier this week. I urge my Senate colleagues to support \nthis bill just as strongly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to adolescents and young adults \nwith serious mental health disorders as they transition to adulthood; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. I\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Dodd \nto introduce a bill that will have a tremendous impact on millions of \nyoung adults in America who will suffer from mental illness in their \nlifetime. The Healthy Transition Act of 2008 is an important bill and I \nlook forward to its passage.\n  Senator Dodd has been an ardent champion for children, and as the \nSponsor of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act in 2004 and the bill to \nreauthorize the successful grant program again last year, it has been \nan honor to work with him to ensure our Nation's youth and their mental \nhealth needs are not forgotten.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleague Representative Pete Stark \nfor working with me on this important issue and for joining me in \nrequesting a report by the Government Accountability Office,GAO last \nyear on the barriers facing youth with serious mental health disorders \nas they age into adulthood. It has been a pleasure to work with him on \ndrafting legislation that we will introduce today as I know he shares a \npassion for improving the lives of our children and young adults.\n  This time in a young person's life is so difficult with the pressures \nof being independent, finding a first job, going to college and really \ndiscovering who you are. For so many of our Nation's youth this time is \nmade so much more difficult by their struggle with mental illness. My \nson Garrett struggled with his transition to adulthood and in his \nability to access the help he needed during this critical time. These \nyoung adults deserve our attention, our support and our compassion.\n  Finally, I want to thank the many stakeholders and advocates that \nhave put so much time and dedication into working with us to introduce \nthis bill, the Healthy Transition Act of 2008. They include the \nNational Alliance on Mental Illness, the Children's Defense Fund, the \nNational Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health, the \nBazelon Center for Mental Health Law, and the American Psychological \nAssociation, just to name a few.\n  The findings of the GAO report that Congressman Stark and I \nrequested, tells us that at least 2.4 million young adults aged 18-26 \nhad a mental illness in 2006. We know that this number could be greatly \nunderstated as it does not count young adults who are \ninstitutionalized, incarcerated or homeless--all of which are groups \nthat are known to have higher rates of mental illness.\n  These young people have such tremendous challenges that cause them to \ndemonstrate lower rates of high school graduation and college \nattendance than their peers who do not suffer from mental illness. They \nalso have lower propensity to find employment and remain stable in \ntheir communities. In my home State of Oregon, this transition-age \npopulation was found to be 80 percent less likely than any other \npopulation in the State with mental health needs to receive services.\n\n  However, from this report, and the work innovative States are doing \nto support our young people, we know that we can do a better job of \nhelping these youth. We can do better at ensuring they can remain \nstable in their communities, that they can live healthy lives, and that \nthey can prosper as adults.\n  The bill that Senator Dodd, Representative Stark and I are \nintroducing today will support States that want to do better for our \nNation's young adults with mental illness. As the GAO found, too often \nservices are not directed at this population or young adults are shoved \ninto a system that was designed for a different age group with \ndifferent needs.\n  Our bill, the Healthy Transition Act of 2008, will provide grants to \nStates to first develop statewide coordination plans to assist \nadolescents and young adults with a serious mental health disorder to \nacquire the skills and resources they need to make a healthy transition \nto adulthood. After this plan has been submitted and evaluated by \nSAMHSA, States may then compete for a second round of grants to help \nthem implement the plan that they have made.\n  Lastly, this bill will develop a Committee of Federal Partners that \nwill coordinate service programs that assist adolescents and young \nadults with mental illness at the federal level and provide technical \nassistance to States as they implement their plans. They also will \nreport to Congress on their activities so that we can ensure they are \ndoing their best to make sure these vulnerable young adults get the \nhelp and support they need.\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n  This is such a critical time in a person's life and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues to make sure it is as healthy and \npositive an experience as it can be. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its passage. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res 601\n\n       Whereas Americans are living longer and the cost of \n     retirement continues to rise, in part because the number of \n     employers providing retiree health coverage continues to \n     decline, and retiree health care costs continue to increase \n     at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement, and that the actual amount of retirement savings \n     of workers lags far behind the amount that will be needed to \n     adequately fund their retirement years;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options for \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for their own retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them through their \n     employers access to defined benefit and defined contribution \n     plans to assist them in preparing for retirement, yet many of \n     them may not be taking advantage of employer-sponsored \n     defined contribution plans at all or to the full extent \n     allowed by the plans as prescribed by Federal law; and\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to save adequate funds for retirement and the \n     availability of preferred savings vehicles to assist them in \n     saving for retirement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 19 through October 25, 2008, as \n     ``National Save for Retirement Week'';\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week;\n       (3) supports the need to raise public awareness of \n     efficiently utilizing substantial tax revenues that currently \n     subsidize retirement savings, revenues in excess of \n     $170,000,000,000 for the fiscal year 2007 budget;\n       (4) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and the \n     availability of tax-preferred employer-sponsored retirement \n     savings vehicles; and\n       (5) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe this week with \n     appropriate programs and activities with the goal of \n     increasing retirement savings for all the people of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6170-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 602--A BILL SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n              ``NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Whitehouse, \nMr. Johnson, and Mr. Smith) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, we are going to come in tomorrow and see \nwhat we can get accomplished. I believe we can get a few things done. I \nhave already outlined what we need to do before we leave. With some \ncooperation we can get that done. If not--as I said here about a half \nhour ago, 45 minutes ago--if people want to play out this clock, people \nwill have to be here Friday and Saturday. I hope that would be it, but \nwe will have to wait and see. In that the Fourth of July doesn't occur \nuntil a week after we leave here anyway, people should keep in mind \nthat there may be a need for us to work the next few days. I hope that \nis not necessary. We will have to see what happens. It is a shame.\n  I know we talked about the fact that we need to complete the housing \nbill, but we will complete that the first week we get back. By then \nSenators Dodd and Shelby maybe will have more things worked out with \nthe House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/25/senate-section/article/S6171-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 26, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.
