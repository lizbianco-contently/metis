The debate will continue until 10:30 \non the four pending Iraq-related amendments.\n  The debate time until 10:30 is equally divided and controlled between \nthe two leaders, with the final 20 minutes shared by the two leaders. I \nwill have the last 10 minutes of that 20-minute period.\n  There will be 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote. After the first \nvote, the remaining votes in sequence will be limited to 10 minutes. I \nhope Members would not leave the Chamber area during the votes as time \nfor the votes will have to be strictly enforced. Since these amendments \nare first-degree amendments, except for the Feingold amendment, Members \nhave until 9:30 this morning to file any germane second-degree \namendments.\n  Once these Iraq-related amendments are disposed of, then the managers \nof the water resources legislation hope to shortly conclude the entire \nlegislation. I hope that can be the case.\n  With the cooperation of the Senate last night, we have moved the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to the immigration legislation \nuntil Monday, May 21. This will allow negotiations to continue for a \nfew more days.\n  I mentioned that a lot of work is needed to be done this week, \nincluding the supplemental appropriations bill and the budget \nresolution. We have other things we are working on to get teed up for \nnext week. We have so much to do, Mr. President.\n  Also, last night, with the cooperation of the Republican leader and \nthe rest of the Senate, we forged a path for the consideration of these \ntwo items, these two items tomorrow, the budget and the WRDA matter. So \nI, again, thank the Members for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6157-7", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the desk should get their clocks out because \nI am going to suggest the absence of a quorum and that time will have \nto run equally from both sides. So each time that I have allotted will \nbe reduced by whatever time the people don't show up here to get in \ntheir remarks.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll of the \nSenate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 2 \nminutes that remain allocated to Senators Whitehouse and Leahy be \nallocated to me for my presentation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        iraq amendments to wrda\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we speak, more than 150,000 brave \nAmerican troops are in the middle of a violent civil war in Iraq, with \nmore troops on the way. Meanwhile, the President has repeatedly made it \nclear that nothing--not the wishes of the American people, not the \nadvice of military and foreign policy experts, not the concerns of \nmembers of both parties--will discourage him from pursuing a war that \nhas no end in sight.\n  Congress cannot wait for the President to change course--we must \nchange the course ourselves. Iraq's problems will not be solved by an \nopen-ended, massive U.S. military engagement. And our own national \nsecurity will be weakened until we bring this war to a close.\n  That is why I am pleased to join the majority leader and Senators \nDodd, Whitehouse, Sanders, Leahy, Kerry, Kennedy, Boxer, Wyden and \nHarkin in introducing an amendment to bring this war to a close. Our \namendment, which is the same as the Feingold-Reid bill, would require \nthe President to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq within \n120 days of enactment, and would require redeployment to be completed \nby March 31, 2008. At that point, with our troops safely out of Iraq, \nfunding for the war would be ended, with three specific and limited \nexceptions: protecting U.S. infrastructure and personnel; training and \nequipping Iraqi security forces; and, perhaps most important, \nconducting ``targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, \nagainst members of al-Qaida and other international terrorist \norganizations.'' By enacting Feingold-Reid, we can finally focus \non what should be our top national security priority--defeating al-\nQaida.\n\n  Some have suggested that cutting off funds for the war could mean \ncutting off funds for the troops. They would have people believe that, \nunder my approach, our brave troops will be left to fend for themselves \nin Iraq, without training, equipment, or resources.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Using our power of the purse \nto end our involvement in the war would in no way endanger our brave \nservicemembers. By setting a date after which funding for the war will \nbe terminated--as this amendment proposes--Congress can ensure that our \ntroops are safely redeployed without harming our troops, as we did in \nSomalia in 1993.\n  While Feingold-Reid is not the only amendment we are considering, it \nis the only amendment that would bring this war to a close. I regret to \nsay that the Levin-Reid amendment accomplishes very little, once the \nPresident gets through certifying and waiving whatever he needs to \ncertify and waive to keep his policies in place.\n  Levin-Reid and the Warner amendment would ensure that Congress \nreceives more reports on Iraqi progress in meeting benchmarks. We don't \nneed reports to tell us that the President's policy isn't working. And \nwe don't need reports to show us that our continued military presence \nin Iraq is a mistake, one that the America people overwhelmingly \noppose. It is long past time for benchmarks, let alone benchmarks that \naren't tied to meaningful consequences. Feingold-Reid will move us \ntoward ending the war. Levin-Reid will move us backward.\n\n  As long as the President's Iraq policy goes unchecked, our courageous \ntroops will continue to put their lives on the line unnecessarily, our \nconstituents will continue to pour billions of their dollars into this \nwar, our military readiness will continue to erode, and our ability to \nconfront and defeat al-Qaida will be jeopardized. I urge my colleagues \nto support Feingold-Reid and oppose Levin-Reid.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Police Corporal Bruce McKay\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to express the sorrow of the people \nof New Hampshire and myself and Kathy, on the passing of Corporal Bruce \nMcKay, who died in the line of duty as a police officer in Franconia, \nNew Hampshire, last Friday, May 11.\n  This is a traumatic event for us as a State and as this is the second \ntime within a year a police officer has been shot in New Hampshire and \ndied. To lose two of these gentlemen who were so extraordinary in the \nspan of a year is truly a sad and difficult event for us as a State.\n  Corporal McKay was, like so many police officers, just an exceptional \nindividual who did his job of protecting us, of being out there on \npatrol, making sure that we are safe in our homes and going about our \nbusiness on a daily basis. Corporal McKay worked in a very small town, \nthe idyllic and pastoral town of Franconia, NH, a place where people go \nto get away from the hustle and bustle and threat and difficulty of the \nurban American lifestyle. It's right up in the mountains of New \nHampshire, just past Franconia Notch, one of our most famous and \nbeautiful spots. It is a place where many people have come to write and \nto live and movie stars and Supreme Court justices have retired there.\n  It is not a place where you'd expect a violent act like this to \noccur. But doing his job on patrol, making what appeared to be a \nroutine stop, he was attacked and shot to death by the individual he \npulled over. This is a trauma not only for our State and for the Town \nof Franconia, especially, but even more\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\noverwhelmingly for his daughter, Courtney, and his parents, Bruce and \nCatherine, and our sympathies and prayers go out to them.\n  We thank him for his service. We thank all officers of the law who \nput their lives on the line every day and serve us and give us the \nprotection and safety which is so important to our lives.\n  On behalf of Kathy and me, and to the extent I can, the people of New \nHampshire, we express our condolences and our sympathies to his family \nduring this extraordinarily difficult time. His service will be \ntomorrow. I had hoped to attend it, but unfortunately, the budget will \nbe here on the floor tomorrow and as the ranking Republican on the \nbudget, I feel it is my responsibility to be here to represent the \nRepublican position on that bill. Our hearts and prayers go out to him \nand his family, and we send his family all our support during this very \ndifficult time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 3 minutes under a \nprevious consent order.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, American troops must come home from \nIraq. Because more than 3,000 of our men and women have lost their \nlives, and tens of thousands more have returned home wounded, American \ntroops must come home from Iraq.\n  Because hundreds of billions of America's tax dollars have been sunk \ninto the sands and marshes of Iraq, with much of that funding lost to \nwaste, fraud, or abuse by those who have neither Iraq's nor America's \nbest interests at heart, America's troops must come home from Iraq.\n  Because the public records of this conflict--reflected in the many \nretired generals who have spoken out against the conduct of the war, \nand the many books and articles chronicling its planning and \nexecution--reveal catastrophic mistakes and misjudgments that have \nraised serious questions about this administration's very capacity for \nleadership, American troops must come home from Iraq.\n  Because that same administration misused and distorted intelligence, \narguing that America should go to war on the basis of information that \nproved to be untrue or highly misleading, American troops must come \nhome from Iraq.\n  Because despite the millions of Americans who joined together to call \nfor a new direction in Iraq, this President chose instead to escalate \nthe conflict, American troops must come home from Iraq.\n  Because the President and Vice President and their political allies \nwould rather pick a political fight with this Congress, using false \nrhetoric, such as ``micromanaging'' and ``precipitous withdrawal,'' \nthan answer tough questions from the American people, American troops \nmust come home from Iraq.\n  Because the prospect of our troops' redeployment is the single most \npowerful force at our disposal to galvanize unity and cooperation among \nthe Iraqi factions and effect real change, American troops must come \nhome from Iraq.\n  And because even after all this, this President still refuses to \nlisten to the American people and stubbornly fails to give this country \nthe change of course it demands, it is up to this Congress to act to \nbring American troops home from Iraq.\n  Some claim this strategy is risky, but the greater risk by far would \nbe to fail to seize the opportunity a redeployment of our troops \npresents us. To announce clearly to the world that American troops will \nsoon leave Iraq will change the dynamic there in a positive way. It may \nbe the only way we can change the dynamic there in a positive way. It \nwill give us the chance to renew and rebuild diplomatic ties in the \nregion and around the world that have been so badly damaged by this \nPresident and this President's war, and restore America's prestige and \nstanding among our friends. It will send a signal to the insurgents who \nfoment violence in Iraq that they will no longer be able to use the \nUnited States military presence as a recruiting tool for extremists, \nand it will motivate efforts by the Iraqis to secure and stabilize \ntheir Nation.\n  It will give the Iraqis the impetus to step forward and do the things \nour military leaders say they must do for the surge to succeed--things \nthey have been disgracefully slow in doing, such as passing a \nhydrocarbon law to allow equal sharing of oil revenues among all \nIraqis, and measures to facilitate elections, as an example.\n  It will give our country the time and resources to restore our \nextraordinary military to the strength and level of readiness our \ntroops deserve. And it will give us the freedom and the resources to \nlook to the many challenges that still confront us here at home, from \nsoaring gas prices to a broken health care system.\n  To achieve all these things, we must take the first step. We must \nmake it clear we will bring our troops home from Iraq. The measure \noffered by Senator Feingold, with the support of the distinguished \nmajority leader, is a smart strategy. It has a responsible schedule and \nit will be an effective step to repair what the President has left \nbroken.\n  It would require the President to redeploy our troops from Iraq by \nMarch 31, 2008. After that date, funds would only be available for \nthree specific limited purposes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 15 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The limited purposes for funding would be: targeted \ncounterterrorism operations, protecting United States infrastructure \nand personnel, and training and equipping Iraqi security forces.\n  This plan gives our troops in the field the resources they need today \nand a strategy that is worthy of their service as they look to \ntomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes under a previous unanimous \nconsent order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last November, the American people voted \nto end the President's one-man show in Iraq. I think the Chair \nunderstands that very well, given that he was victorious in November, \nand a lot of the questions surrounded what are we going to do about \nIraq, this terrible failed policy.\n  Today, we have an amazing opportunity, and I thank Senator Reid for \ngiving us that opportunity, to vote to end this war now, and to do it \nin a way that is responsible, to do it in a way that is gradual, to do \nit in a way that makes a lot of sense.\n  The Feingold amendment essentially shifts the mission away from a \ncombat mission to a support mission. It is very clear the President \nwill get the funding he needs for the following things. Our troops will \nbe funded to go after al-Qaida. After all, that was the primary purpose \nwe declared after 9/11, and I voted to go to war to get al-Qaida, and \nto get bin Laden. Then the administration took a U-turn and got us off \ncourse into Iraq.\n  Our military has been superb. They have done everything they have \nbeen asked to do, from searching for those weapons of mass destruction, \nascertaining there were none; and then, apparently, the mission wasn't \ndone. The President said, get Saddam. They got Saddam. Oops, the \nmission still wasn't done. After that, he said, get his family members \nand show them on television and show the people we mean business. But \nthe mission still wasn't done.\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n  Then there were three elections in Iraq, to give the Iraqis a chance \nto choose their own leaders. We train and train and train Iraqi \nsoldiers and police, where there are now about 300,000. If they can't \ndefend and protect their own country, if they do not love the chance to \nhave freedom as much as we love it for them, then I say it is time to \nchange this mission. Keep on going after al-Qaida. Yes, you can keep \ntraining those troops if they need our help in that, and force \nprotection. Those would be the missions. The Feingold amendment gives \nus this chance.\n  The President has derided any attempt Congress has made to end this \nwar. He says, why should politicians get involved with this? Well, let \nme say why I think the Senate should get involved. Because it is our \nconstituents, just as it is the President's constituents, who are dying \nin Iraq. In front of my office door I have these large boards that list \nthe names of the dead, and 21 percent of the dead were either born in \nCalifornia or they were based in California--21 percent. So I will not \nallow this President to tell me I have no right to try to end this war. \nI have every right to try to end this war, and I will stand shoulder to \nshoulder with my colleagues, as I did from day one when 23 of us said \nthis war was a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 1 \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our Nation is grieving over this war. \nEvery day when we wake up and turn on the TV or the radio, we don't \nknow what other horror is befalling our troops. We have a country in \nIraq where 70 percent of the people want us out of there, where a broad \nmajority says it is OK to kill or wound an American soldier, where \nmaybe 50-plus percent of the Iraqi Parliament says we should get out on \na timetable.\n  It is pretty simple. When I was a kid, my mother said, don't go where \nyou are not wanted. Enough is enough. We have given and given and \ngiven, in blood and in treasury. So I proudly stand before the Senate \nurging my colleagues to do the right thing, to vote for responsible \nredeployment, a responsible end to this war, and join me in voting for \nthe Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 4 minutes under a previous consent order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Feingold-Reid \namendment on Iraq. This is a defining moment in our debate on this \nmisguided war. We in Congress have a choice. We can continue the \nadministration's failed policy and guarantee that even more American \ntroops will die in Iraq's bloody civil war. Or we can finally exercise \nour ``power of the purse'' and begin to bring this disastrous war to an \nend by linking the requirement to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq \nby next March to a prohibition on spending.\n  We all must face up to the fact that Congress must use the power of \nthe purse to force an end to the war, and the sooner we do so, the \nbetter.\n  It is wrong for the Congress to continue to defer to Presidential \ndecisions that we know are fatally flawed.\n  The American people know this war is wrong, and it is wrong to \nabdicate our responsibility by allowing this war to drag on longer \nwhile our casualties mount higher and higher.\n  For more than 4 long years, the President's assertion of \nunprecedented power has gone unchecked. This amendment reclaims our \nresponsibility under the Constitution as a co-equal branch of \nGovernment, with specific powers of our own on issues of war and peace.\n  Congress can exercise its authority to redirect or terminate an \nongoing conflict in two ways. It can enact specific limits on the scope \nof the conflict, and it can use the power of the purse to deny funding \nfor all or parts of a conflict.\n  Congress has followed that path in prior wars, and we must follow it \ntoday. During the Vietnam war, Congress repealed the Gulf of Tonkin \nResolution of 1964, which many of us felt had been misused to justify \nthe escalation of America's involvement in Vietnam. Congress also \nprohibited the reintroduction of troops into Cambodia after President \nNixon's escalation of the war. We went on to cap the number of American \ntroops in Vietnam, and we eventually cut off funding for the war when \nthe President left us no alternative.\n  Exasperated by the actions of successive Presidents Johnson and Nixon \non the Vietnam war, Congress enacted the War Powers Act in 1973 over \nPresident Nixon's veto. The act requires Presidents to consult with \nCongress before placing troops in harm's way, seek authorization to \nkeep them there, and continue consultation as the conflict goes on.\n  This congressional assertion of power in matters of war and peace \nresonates loudly today.\n  Opponents of our efforts to bring the Iraq war to an end have \nmischaracterized any use of this congressional power as an abandonment \nof our soldiers on the battlefield. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  No responsible legislator would take any action that endangers our \ntroops. In fact, using congressional authority to force a change of \ncourse in Iraq and begin to bring our troops out of Iraq's civil war is \nthe best way to protect our troops.\n  Requiring a change of course by using the ``power of the purse'' or \ntaking other action will not mean taking equipment and supplies away \nfrom our troops. We will avoid the mistake the President made in \nsending our troops into Iraq without adequate armor and without a plan \nto win the peace. There is no reason for Congress now to shy away from \nexercising the full range of its constitutional powers.\n  President Bush should not be permitted to continue his disastrous \npolicy of sending more and more American troops to die in the quagmire \nof Iraq's civil war.\n  Because the President refuses to bring this war to an end, we in \nCongress must put on the brakes ourselves and stop the madness. We must \nrequire the administration to begin to bring our troops home to the \nhero's welcome they have earned.\n  The failure of our policy is abundantly clear to anyone who honestly \nlooks at the facts.\n  Despite the addition of tens of thousands of American troops, and the \nongoing presence of more than 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq, \npolitical reconciliation remains as difficult as ever to achieve.\n  Our troops continue to be vulnerable targets for the insurgents in \nwhat has been the longest period of high casualty rates since the war \nbegan. Sectarian violence in Baghdad continues. Attacks within the \ninternational zone in Baghdad are increasing. Violence is spreading out \nof Baghdad and increasing elsewhere in Iraq. Iraqis are demonstrating \nin the streets against America's occupation. Legislation pending in the \nIraqi Parliament would require a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. \nforces from Iraq.\n  The Iraqi people want a timetable for the withdrawal of our military. \nThe American people want a timetable. Only the President continues to \nstubbornly refuse to adopt one.\n  It is time for President Bush to listen to the Iraq Study Group, the \nIraqi people, Congress, and the American people, and work with us to \nbring our troops home.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, among the four amendments this morning \nwill be one submitted by me, together with my principal cosponsor, \nSenator Collins. The purpose of this amendment is to require the \nadministration to keep the Congress well informed. The situation in \nIraq changes almost daily. Our losses continue. In my judgment, it is \nthe responsibility of every Member of the Congress to keep well versed \non this situation, keep in mind the perspectives with regard to the \nstrategy as enunciated by the administration, and maintain their own \nindividual opinions about that strategy and how this operation is \ngoing. Daily, each of us must consult with our constituents. \nRegrettably, almost weekly many of us have to speak with families of \nthe loved ones they have lost or those who have been seriously injured.\n  There are several parts to the amendment I put forward. I thank many \nSenators who worked with me--indeed,\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle, together with their professional staffs. The \nfirst part of the amendment goes through extensive findings, \nprincipally acknowledging the extraordinary heroism and bravery of the \nmen and women wearing the uniform of our country, together with our \ncoalition partners and the families who stand behind them. They \nunquestionably have performed in a manner consistent with the finest \ntraditions of the professionalism of the U.S. military.\n  The findings also address the historical progress of the Iraqi \nGovernment in its formation, but also raises questions of the several \nbenchmarks, benchmarks which were selected and composed by the Iraqi \nGovernment, announced by that government, and their commitments to \ntrying to meet those benchmarks.\n  Taken together, I think it is very important that our strategy in \nIraq be put in a position where it reflects in many respects the degree \nof success in meeting these benchmarks and, if these benchmarks are not \nmet, then such changes as our President desires to make from his \nstrategy as announced on January 10 of this year.\n  We, in this amendment, recite as the benchmarks that are most serious \nhis forming a constitutional review committee and then completing the \nconstitutional review; enacting and implementing legislation on \ndebaathification; enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \nequitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people of Iraq \nwithout regard to sect or ethnicity of recipients; and enacting and \nimplementing legislation to ensure that the energy resources of Iraq \nbenefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an \nequitable manner.\n  That is sort of a description of the basic category of these \nbenchmarks. Then we go on to require the President of the United States \nto report on how this sovereign Government of Iraq is or is not \nachieving progress toward accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \nand shall advise the Congress on how that assessment requires or does \nnot require changes to the strategy announced on January 10, 2007.\n  Among the reports required, the President shall submit an initial \nreport in classified and unclassified form to the Congress not later \nthan June 15, 2007.\n  I purposely selected that date because our schedule reflects that \nthis body will go into a recess for much of August. I think it is \nabsolutely imperative every Member have the benefit of the latest \npossible assessment of the performance or nonperformance by the Iraqi \nGovernment of these benchmarks, as well as the situation in Iraq. So \nthe President will do that on July 15, assessing the status of each of \nthe benchmarks.\n  Next, the President, having consulted with the Secretary of State, \nSecretary of Defense, the commander of the multinational forces, \nGeneral Petraeus, and Admiral Fallon, will prepare a report and submit \nto the Congress his findings. If the President's assessment of any of \nthe specific benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the \nPresident shall include in that report a description of such revisions \nto the political--not just the military but the political, the \neconomic, regional, and military components of the strategy as \nannounced by the President on January 10, 2007.\n  In addition, the President shall include in the report the \nadvisability of implementing such aspects of the bipartisan Iraq Study \nGroup report as he deems appropriate. That was a very valuable report. \nI think it has provided a considerable number of guideposts that have \nbeen embraced by Members of this body.\n  Then the President shall submit a second report not later than \nSeptember 15, 2007, following the same procedures and criteria \nenunciated above. The reporting requirement of the Armed Services \nCommittee bill of last year will be waived through September 15 so as \nnot to have duplication. Then testimony before the Congress. Prior to \nthe submission of the President's second report on September 15, 2007, \nand at a time to be agreed upon by the leadership of the Congress and \nthe administration, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the commander of \nmultinational forces, General Petraeus, will be made available to \ntestify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of \nour Congress. There again, we get their independent report followed by \nthat of the President.\n  We also place some limitations on the availability of the nonmilitary \nfunding in this appropriations bill, such that the President can \nrestrict that funding in those instances where he believes, first, \nthere is more than adequate funding in the pipeline already and \ntherefore it doesn't require the additional expenditure of funds; or, \nsecond, the Iraqi Government has substantial cash in their reserve \naccounts that could be applied to the nonmilitary aspects. Further, the \nPresident is given waiver authority with regard to the benchmarks so \nthe flow of these funds is tied in some respects, again, to the \nperformance of the benchmarks.\n  We also put a section in this report requiring the redeployment of \nour forces in such circumstances as the sovereign Iraqi Government, \nhaving taken actions consistent with their Constitution, should call \nupon the United States and other partners of the coalition forces to \nwithdraw certain elements of their troops--respecting, once again, and \nplacing upon them the obligation to fulfill the responsibilities of \nsovereignty.\n  Also, we put in this amendment requirements for independent analysis \nof much of the same material that is being reviewed by the \nadministration. While we have over the years, for example, trained for \nnow 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years, some 325,000 Iraqi armed forces and police, what \nis the ability of that trained group, such as it is, to take up more \nand more of the responsibility in the fighting, and particularly that \nfighting that relates to sectarian violence?\n  For that purpose, we have two parts. The first addresses the \nComptroller General. He is being requested to make an assessment of all \nof the benchmarks as to whether they have been met or not met. Second, \nwe appropriate a sum of money to fund an independent organization and a \nvery senior, well-respected, retired, four-star officer to head up a \nmilitary, professional assessment by the retired community, of the \nIraqi forces. I think that is a pivotal part of this amendment. I just \nhesitate to think why any Member could vote against a provision saying \nthat we need a fresh, new, independent assessment of the capabilities \nor lack of capabilities of the Iraqi security forces. That is in here.\n  Mr. President, I urge colleagues to carefully consider this \namendment.\n  It is for their benefit to keep them informed, both requiring the \nadministration to come forward with timely reports and testimony and, \nsecondly, two independent organizations, one the Comptroller General to \ngive an assessment of benchmarks and, second, that we have an \norganization well known to all of us here, a private sector \norganization to give support to a senior, highly respected uniform \nretired four-star general to make an assessment of the military \ncapabilities of the Iraqi forces.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues. I particularly thank my principal \ncosponsor, the Senator from Maine, for her diligent effort throughout \nthe preparation of this amendment as well as the previous initiatives \nwe have taken on this floor over the past 2 months with respect to the \nPresident's policy, particularly the surge policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I shall be very brief, not only because \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Virginia has done a superb job of \ndescribing the initiative we have brought before the Senate but also \nbecause I have a commitment to testify very shortly before another \ncommittee on yet another important issue. But I do wish to comment \nbriefly on one of the provisions that is included in Senator Warner's \nproposal, a provision I consulted with many of our colleagues on and \nbrought forth to the senior Senator from Virginia and suggested be \nincluded. He agreed and has placed it within his amendment.\n  This provision conditions the release of reconstruction funds to \nprogress on the benchmarks that are included in the Warner-Collins \namendment. These benchmarks include making progress on \ndebaathification, making progress in passing and implementing an oil \nrevenues distribution bill, making\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\nprogress and producing trained and equipped Iraqi security forces, and \noverall for the Iraqi Government to make more progress toward the \npolitical reconciliation that is absolutely essential to quelling the \nsectarian violence that now engulfs Baghdad. It includes, therefore, \nprovisions and benchmarks not only on debaathification but also on \nholding provincial elections, something that would help lead to the \nintegration of more Sunnis into the Government power structures.\n  It is important that there be consequences for the Iraqi Government \nif those benchmarks are not met, and the best way is to condition the \nrelease of billions of dollars of reconstruction assistance--assistance \nfor which the American taxpayers are footing the bill--on whether the \nIraqi leaders are making progress in meeting the benchmarks. If they \nare not making progress in meeting the benchmarks, then I think we \nshould not release the reconstruction funds. This would have definite \nconsequences, and I believe it is appropriate that we link it to \nreconstruction funds.\n  None of us wants to--or very few of us want to cut off the essential \ntraining and equipping funds for Iraqi troops, much less American \ntroops. So I do not support an alternative amendment which will be \noffered today which would simply cut off funds. I don't think that is \nresponsible. That is a disservice to the brave men and women who are \nfighting so hard in Iraq. I want to make sure our troops have \neverything they need--the training, the equipment, and the support to \ncarry out their dangerous mission.\n  I also want to make sure the Iraqi troops have the training and the \nequipment they need, but I share the frustration of the former chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee that we have been training Iraqi \ntroops and equipping them for years, some 300,000 troops, and yet we \nstill find that the Iraqi security forces are not able to take the lead \nin very many operations, and that is very disturbing to me. It is one \nof the reasons I strongly support Senator Warner's proposal for an \noutside review by a distinguished nonpartisan group led by retired GEN \nJim Jones to assess the capabilities and the readiness of the Iraqi \nforces. That is a very important provision as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. We worked together on this provision for some time. It \nhas been 2 months in the making. I supplied it to several colleagues in \nthe House, notably Jim Moran, who is on the Appropriations Committee. \nThey seized it and, verbatim, this provision with regard to \nestablishing an ability to have, independent of the Pentagon, an \nassessment of the Armed Forces and security forces in Iraq is in the \nHouse appropriations bill now going into conference. So I believe it is \nimperative that we, this body, likewise put that provision in our \nSenate bill.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nclarification and that good news about the reception on the House side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nmore.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my support for our operations in Iraq is neither open-\nended nor unconditional. I believe the Warner-Collins amendment takes \nimportant steps toward accountability, and I hope it will have the \nsupport of the majority of Members in this body.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I want to take a few brief moments to \nexplain why I supported the Feingold-Reid-Dodd amendment this morning, \nand why I opposed the other two amendments offered before this body.\n  While I would have preferred a stand-alone vote on the Feingold-Reid-\nDodd bill, as I think we owe the American people and our brave men and \nwomen in uniform unequivocal support for changing our mission in Iraq, \nI am nonetheless still pleased that we at least had a cloture vote on \nthis amendment.\n  As my colleagues know, the language in this amendment was almost \nidentical to the language in the stand-alone Feingold-Reid-Dodd bill, \nwhich I strongly endorsed. This amendment would have mandated that the \nphased redeployment of U.S. combat forces from Iraq begin within 120 \ndays, and set a deadline of March 31, 2008 for the completion of that \nredeployment. It allowed for continued counter-terrorism operations, \nforce protection, and training and equipping of Iraqi security forces. \nReid-Feingold represented the only responsible way to force the \nPresident to change his flawed policy in Iraq.\n  I deeply respect Senator Warner and the leadership that he has \ndemonstrated for many decades in the Senate, but I could not in good \nconscience vote for his amendment. The Warner amendment would have done \nnothing to force a change in mission, it would not have held the Bush \nadministration or the Iraqi Government accountable, and it would not \nhave started the process of redeploying our forces from Iraq. Instead, \nit would have allowed the President to waive any restrictions, just as \nhe has waived the advice from the Baker-Hamilton Commission, and just \nas he has ignored the will of the American and Iraqi people.\n  I had absolutely no objection to the resolved clauses of Senator \nCochran's amendment, which stated that ``It is the sense of the Senate \nthat Congress should send legislation to the President providing \nappropriations for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom in a manner that the President can sign into law by not later \nthan May 28, 2007.'' In fact, Congress already sent President Bush a \nrobust supplemental funding bill and the President chose to veto it. \nMoreover, the Feingold-Reid-Dodd amendment provided funding for these \ncritical missions and was wholly ``in a manner that the President can \nsign it into law by not later than May 28, 2007.''\n  But, in Senator Cochran's amendment, this language was preceded by \ninaccurate statements. These statements claim that ``funds previously \nappropriated to continue military operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom \nand Operation Enduring Freedom are depleted.'' This is simply not true. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates, and the Pentagon confirms, \nthat there is enough funding to last through mid-summer.\n  It is my hope that in the coming days, the Senate will continue to \nseek meaningful ways to bring about a responsible and urgent change in \nthe President's failed policy in Iraq. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to do just that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes in leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we face an awesome vote, a historic \nvote in the Senate. It is a vote about this war in Iraq. It is an issue \nwhich consumes this Senate and this Nation. We have lost 3,400 \nsoldiers, over 30,000 returned home injured, some with serious, \ngrievous disabilities and injuries they will battle for a lifetime. We \nhave spent over $500 billion, and there is no end in sight.\n  This morning, the White House announced that the President has \nfinally found a general who will accept the responsibility for the \nexecution of this war. Why did four generals before him refuse this \nassignment? Because those four generals know, the American people know, \nand this Senate knows that the administration's policy in Iraq has \nfailed.\n  Our soldiers have not failed. They have risen again to the challenge. \nThey have exhibited such courage and bravery. They have shown the kind \nof sacrifice that wins over the hearts of generation after generation \nof American people. But the Iraqis failed to lead their own nation, and \nthe situation in that country is in disarray.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to speak directly, honestly, \ndecisively. This war must end. Our troops must come home. The Iraqis \nmust accept responsibility for their future.\n  The Feingold-Reid amendment, which will be before us today, may not \nbe adopted, but it will be adopted at\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nanother time on another day. At some future moment, after we have \nburied more of our fallen heroes, after we have cared for those \nthousands returning with injuries, after the Iraqis have broken our \nhearts again with their interminable fighting, their interminable civil \nwar, and their lack of leadership in their nation, then we will act. \nBut today is the day when we should act.\n  I respect very much my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner. He is \none of the few on that side of the aisle who have spoken out suggesting \nthat these policies must change. I don't believe his amendment achieves \nall that we need to achieve today. It sets benchmarks but gives the \nPresident the power to waive those benchmarks and the requirements that \ncome with them. Sadly, we know what this President will do. Just as \nwith the sweep of a veto pen he swept away our bipartisan effort to \nstart a timetable to end this war, he will sign a waiver and continue \non for the next 18, 19 months with this war with no end in sight.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 minute off the leader's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his very articulate \nstatement. I so agree with what he said. I want to make it clear to my \ncolleagues, and I want to make sure my colleague agrees, that of all \nthe options which will be before us, all well-intentioned, all worked \non so diligently--some of my colleagues are here who did that--is it \nnot a fact that the only one that will guarantee a change in the status \nquo is the Feingold amendment because all the others really lead right \nback to where we are today because the President is given total leeway \nto decide exactly what to do? Am I correct on that point, that if we \nwant change, you have to vote for the Feingold amendment, if you want \nto end the war?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from the State \nof California--and I thank her for her leadership--there is only one \namendment today which will end this war, there is only one amendment \ntoday which will start to bring these troops home, there is only one \namendment which will make it clear to the Iraqis that this is their \ncountry and their responsibility. The Feingold-Reid amendment is the \namendment which will finally start bringing this war to an end.\n  How many more soldiers do we have to bury? How many more do we have \nto bring into our military and veterans hospitals? How many more \nthousands of innocent Iraqis have to die before we finally accept our \nresponsibility to bring this war to an end? We can do it today. We \nshould do it today. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid \namendment, and I urge all of them to understand the gravity of this \ndecision. This is not about politics. This is about the life and death \nof great heroes in America who continue to step forward and risk their \nlives for this Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the Feingold-\nReid amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a little more than 6 weeks ago, the Senate \npassed a supplemental appropriations bill relative to the war in Iraq. \nIt contained provisions relating to the readiness of U.S. forces, such \nas ensuring U.S. military units are fully mission capable, that they \nare not deployed for combat beyond a year in the case of the Army, 7 \nmonths in the case of the Marines; that they are not redeployed for \ncombat if the unit has been deployed within a year for the Army and 7 \nmonths for the Marines. The vetoed bill provided for a Presidential \nwaiver of those limitations.\n  The vetoed bill also contained a very essential provision regarding \ntroop reductions--first, a troop reduction requirement that would \ncommence on October 1. That is the heart of the bill that was vetoed. \nWe will commence finally to reduce the number of troops in Iraq instead \nof adding to the troops, instead of adding more military, instead of \nlooking to a military solution, finally recognizing that there is no \nmilitary solution, there is only a political solution in Iraq, and that \nit is up to the political leaders in Iraq to reach that conclusion.\n  We must put pressure on them, and the only way I know to put pressure \non the Iraqi leaders is to tell them that the future of their country \nis in their hands, that we cannot save them from themselves, and for us \nto change the course by beginning to reduce the number of troops in a \nnonprecipitous way and to do that beginning in 180 days.\n  What that amendment did on the supplemental was also set a goal for \nthe remainder of the troops who are going to be removed. Except for the \nlimited missions that were set up, it set a goal to do that. It was not \nset in stone as to the precise moment all the troops would have to \nleave, and it avoided using the funding mechanism. We did that on \npurpose. We want to send a message to the troops that troops in Iraq, \nwhatever they are, whatever are left, whatever are going to be removed \nthat have not been removed at the exact moment in the Feingold \namendment--troops are going to be supported.\n  We are going to support these troops. We are not going to use a \nfunding mechanism to cut off funding for our troops. That was the way \nto go. We got 51 votes in the Senate for that approach. It was vetoed \nby the President.\n  Now we have an amendment that is pending. This amendment would \nprovide essentially the same provisions: protecting our troops, funding \nour troops but also initiating the beginning of the reductions that are \nso essential to forcing the Iraqis to step to the plate and resolving \ntheir political differences.\n  This amendment that is pending, however, contains a waiver. The \nwaiver provision in this amendment has caused some concern \nunderstandably. The only purpose for the waiver provision the President \nwas given in this pending amendment was in order to avoid a veto, to \nget the funds there.\n  However, it will not avoid a veto. The security advisor to the \nPresident has told me that, as a matter of fact, the President still \nopposes it, although he has a waiver authority in this amendment. \nBecause of that, it does not serve its purpose of avoiding a veto.\n  Because there is some confusion as to the waiver provision, as to \nwhether there is any intent to weaken what we did when we passed the \nsupplemental, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to withdraw my \namendment. I understand it has been cleared on the other side. I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and that cloture be \nvitiated.\n  Mr. REID. After the Feingold vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the order will \nbe effective after the first cloture vote.\n  Under the previous order, the next 10 minutes is reserved for the \nRepublican leader.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again wish to address the amendment I \nhave put forward together with Senator Collins. I realize there is a \nprovision in here with regard to a waiver, and that relates to the \nPresident's ability to redirect funds that are nonmilitary. But I say \nto my colleagues that while that particular section of this bill was \namended at the last minute, the other sections absolutely remain strong \nand essential to keep this body informed; namely, the two independent \nstudies, one to be performed by retired military with respect to the \nproficiency, capability, professional abilities of the Iraqi security \nforces; and, secondly, the one that requires the General Accounting \nOffice to give an opinion with regard to the compliance or \nnoncompliance of benchmarks.\n  So in this amendment, yes, I still think there is a lot of strength \nand validity to the provisions regarding the restriction of funds to be \nexpended by our Government in terms of the nonmilitary spending. The \nother portions of this bill remain strong and should earn the support \nof all colleagues who wish to be kept advised of this ever-changing \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is time \nremaining for the Republican leader. Is that right?\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader has 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. On my side, how much time do we have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is Senator Cochran going to use some of the \n7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to use whatever time is available to support \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. REID. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. President, what I would ask--\nthe reason I am asking my friend from Mississippi is, we have had a lot \nof confusion here today with amendments being withdrawn and a lot of \npeople wanting to speak.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has been waiting to \nspeak. I would be happy, if it is convenient to the Republicans, to \ngive 3 more minutes to the minority and allow Senator Biden to speak \nfor 3 minutes. Would that be permissible?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is perfectly all right with me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that be the \ncase.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will be able to support \nmy amendment. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. There are certain \nfindings that are made in the amendment. But it all comes down to \nsaying that the Senate should give the President what he has asked for, \nin terms of supplemental appropriations to fund the activities in Iraq \nthat would protect our soldiers, that would put into the field new \nequipment and armaments that would help us reduce the level of \ncasualties, make it less likely that American soldiers are going to die \non the battlefield.\n  We don't need to continue to drag this out. This request has been \nsubmitted to the Senate, to the House, and it still has not been \napproved. People want to add everything to it. We have had a lot of \nsuggestions about amendments that should be put on the supplemental.\n  What this sense of the Senate says, basically, is the Congress should \napprove the funding requested by the President at the earliest possible \ndate. We know that that may take a few days, but it should not take any \nlonger than that. So I am hopeful that Senators, after expressing their \nviews on the war, expressing their views on whatever else they want to \nput in this legislation, keep focused on what the real need is and what \nthe request is; it is supplemental funding to replace funds that have \nbeen exhausted in the regular fiscal year appropriations to add what \nthe military needs.\n  I have a letter from Secretary Gates which specifically says:\n\n       The situation increases the readiness risk of our military \n     with each passing day. Should the Nation require the use of \n     these forces prior to the equipment becoming available, the \n     funding delay negatively impacts our forces in the field \n     by needlessly delaying the accelerated fielding of new \n     force protection capabilities, such as the mine-resistant \n     ambush-protected vehicle, and counter-IED technologies.\n\n  So my hope is the Senate will approve my amendment and let's get on \nwith supporting the President's initiative to bring this war to a \nsuccessful conclusion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a bunch of \namendments. The two amendments on the Democratic side, one having been \nwithdrawn, are designed to do one thing that is straight forward: \nInstead of focusing our military on the much more--on being engaged in \nthis civil war, they are intended to focus on a limited mission, a much \nmore limited mission that is in our national interest that we can \nachieve with far fewer troops: Combatting al-Qaida and like-minded \nterrorist groups and continuing to train Iraqi troops.\n  I am not crazy about the language in the Feingold amendment. But I am \ncrazy about the fact that we have got to keep the pressure on. The fact \nis, with every passing day, the situation in Iraq gets worse, and the \nPresident refuses to change course, continuing to dig us deeper and \ndeeper and deeper in a hole.\n  The most important thing we can do, and I compliment the Democratic \nleaders for this, is keep pressure, keep pressure on the President. \nNow, why pressure on the President? Quite frankly, he is not going to \nchange. The only way, with all due respect to my Republican friends, is \nto put pressure on them so they start voting for the troops and not for \nthe President.\n  The fact is, as a number of my colleagues have mentioned in the news \non the Republican side--I will not name any of them--they basically \ntold the President: Mr. President, you have got until September. Well, \nbetween now and September, a lot more people are going to die in the \nmidst of a civil war that don't have to die in the midst of a civil war \nif we change the mission.\n  So this is all about keeping pressure. So every single day the public \npicks up the paper and sees that we are trying to change the \nPresident's course of action in Iraq. In turn, hopefully, they will \nspeak to their Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives \nand say: Make him change.\n  Because until we get 67 votes, we are not going to be able to change \nhis God-awful war. This war is a disaster. So what my friend, Senator \nFeingold, is doing is making a very valuable contribution. I am going \nto vote for cloture so we can continue to debate this issue and \ncontinue to put pressure on. Starting to get our troops out of Iraq and \ngetting most of them out by early next year is what we have in the \noriginal legislation the President vetoed, which is the preferable way \nto go, in my view.\n  But obviously we do not have the votes to overcome that veto, so we \nare trying to put something else on the table. But as important as \nbeginning to bring our troops home, with a reasonable prospect of \nending their presence in Iraq, it is equally important to have a plan \nfor what we are going to leave behind, so we do not trade a dictator \nfor chaos in a region that will undermine our interests for decades.\n  So we have to have a plan to bring stability to Iraq when we leave, \nand that requires a political solution. In the interests of time, I \nwill not attempt to discuss that, I will do it at a later date. But I \ncompliment my friend from Wisconsin for continuing to keep the pressure \non. This is all about, in my view, getting the 67 votes to be able to \noverride the President's veto and ending this God-awful mess that he \nhas us in and continues to dig us deeper and deeper and deeper and \ndeeper into.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains now a little over 8 \nminutes of the Republican time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the Republican leader wants to take \n1 minute. No? If you would yield that back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to ask unanimous consent to \nyield that back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time being yielded back, there \nremains now 5 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I exceed the 5 minutes, I will use my \nleader time.\n  The Congress and the President are on the eve of a very important \nnegotiation about the administration's failed policy in Iraq. Does \nanyone dispute that it has been a failed policy? Does anyone dispute \nthat it has been a failed policy? I don't think so.\n  But there is one simple question that negotiators will be wrestling \nwith: After more than 4 years of a war in Iraq, costing Americans more \nthan 3,400 lives, tens of thousands wounded, a third of them grievously \nwounded, we have more than 2,000 double amputees in this war, head \ninjuries like we have never seen before, approaching a trillion dollars \nin taxpayers' expenditure for this war.\n  Sadly, there is no end in sight. Isn't it time for the administration \nto change course? Now, Nevada is struck and struck very hard with the \nfact that one of our brave soldiers from Nevada may be a hostage or \nsome say a prisoner of war. This is new experience even in Iraq.\n  The votes we are about to cast this morning will give every Member \nthe\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nopportunity to tell the American people, the White House, and the \nCongressional negotiators where they stand on critical issues.\n  House and Senate Democrats stand with General Petraeus. General \nPetraeus says the war cannot be won militarily. There can only be a \npolitical solution, which my friend from Michigan, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee has been saying for almost 2 years. The \nadministration and the leaders in Iraq have not listened to Carl Levin.\n  We stand united, we Democrats and a couple of stalwart Republicans, \nin our belief that our troops are enmeshed in an intractable civil war, \nthat we are pursuing a failed strategy that is making us less secure, \nnot more secure, and that it is time to begin a responsible, phased \nredeployment.\n  We stand united in our efforts to get the administration to change \ncourse but do so now, immediately. The President's policy is not \nworking, and it is not working for so many reasons.\n  The present path is not sustainable. The facts on the ground are \ncertainly not encouraging. Everyone, today, look at USA Today. The \nattacks are up. The deaths are up, both of Iraqis and Americans; the \ninjuries are up of both Iraqis and Americans.\n  Despite the fourth surge in U.S. forces since the start of the war, \nattacks on our troops have not decreased. The monthly casualty rate \nsince the onset of the surge is close to the highest level we have seen \nsince the start of this war. About three American soldiers are killed \nevery day on average. Since the beginning of the surge, 300 Americans \nhave been killed. I don't know how many have been injured but \nthousands. Meanwhile, the Iraqi Government remains in a dangerous \nstalemate--no oil law; no law on de-Baathification; no constitutional \namendments. This paralysis has further fueled the sectarian violence, \nand our troops are caught in the middle. They protect the Sunnis. Our \ntroops protect the Shia, protect the Kurds. In the process, they are \nall shooting at our troops.\n  The U.S. mission grows further and further disconnected from our \nstrategic national interest. Instead of focusing on training, \ncounterterrorism, and our regional interests, U.S. forces are \npatrolling Baghdad's streets, still kicking down doors, increasingly \nvulnerable to snipers, kidnappers, improvised explosive devices, and \nother acts of terror. American forces have done everything we have \nasked of them, and more. They toppled a dictator and helped pave the \nway for a new government. It is now up to the Iraqi political leaders, \nafter 4 years, to step up to the plate and fight for their own nation. \nAgain, as our leader on the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, \nhas said on many occasions: Take off the training wheels. The Iraqi \nGovernment has to do that.\n  Our troops, their families, and the American people deserve an exit \nstrategy, instead of extending tours from 12 to 15 months, putting \nfurther strain upon our men and women in uniform. It is long past time \nto transition the United States mission in Iraq and begin a \nresponsible, phased redeployment.\n  The Feingold-Reid amendment does just that. It achieves that goal. \nThe amendment calls for the phased redeployment of our troops to begin \nwithin 120 days. It doesn't call for withdrawal--phased redeployment. \nAfter April 1, 2008, the sixth year of the war in Iraq--think about \nthat--it would still permit U.S. forces to remain in Iraq conducting \nforce protection, training, and targeted counterterrorism missions. As \nSenator Biden said: Go after the real bad guys.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my friend, the senior Senator from \nVirginia, former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, but I say \nafter more than 4 years of a failed policy he has watched, as I have, \nhis amendment is very tepid, very weak, a cup of tea that has been \nsitting on the counter for a few weeks. You wouldn't want to drink that \ntea. You wouldn't want to vote for this amendment. If you look in the \ndictionary under ``weak,'' the Warner amendment would be listed right \nunder it. I have the greatest respect for Senator Warner. I know he is \ntrying to stick up for his President. Senator Warner has served this \ncountry honorably for more than 40 years. But the situation in Iraq is \ngrave and deteriorating. It requires actions, certainly not more \nreports, especially those without consequences. I will vote against the \nWarner amendment and I hope everyone votes against it. It is nothing.\n  The Cochran amendment, offered by my friend with whom I have had the \ngood pleasure of serving in Congress for 25 years--he is a fine man and \na real patriot; he has served this country so well for so long--I don't \nnecessarily agree with every word and assertion the Senator included in \nhis amendment, but I do agree with its thrust; namely, the White House \nand the Congress have an obligation to our troops to move quickly and \ncomplete action on the supplemental spending bill. But I do say to my \nfriend from Mississippi: The President has asked for money. But for the \nfirst time in more than 4 years of this war, he has to deal with this \nconstitutional body that was provided to our country by our Founding \nFathers, called the Congress. It is another branch of Government. He \nhas to deal with us. That is why there are negotiations prior to \ngetting the President a conference report.\n  Had I drafted this amendment, I would have asked more of the White \nHouse than simply the Congress write a blank check to this \nadministration. Too many blank checks have been given to this \nPresident, and look what we have as a result. It is important we \ndeliver our troops a strategy that is worthy of their sacrifice. I \nwould also have made improving their readiness a priority. What do \npeople who have the military experience in this body focus on? Senator \nWebb of Virginia, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, they focus on \nreadiness; that is, how are the troops being taken care of, how are \nthey being rotated? Jim Webb, as we know, served gallantly in battle. \nHe knows what it is to send troops into battle without proper \nreadiness. He is concerned about that. We don't have enough about \nreadiness, certainly, in the Cochran amendment.\n  We were going to have another vote on the Levin amendment. Basically, \nas I said to the Presiding Officer late last night, it was the \namendment that went to the President and he vetoed it. The Levin \namendment is the same thing except we gave the President waivers. You \nwould think that would be a step in the right direction. But we have \nheard from all types of administration officials as late as last night: \nWe will veto that. So we will make it easier for them. We are not going \nto go ahead and offer that. We will stand on the merits of what we sent \nto the President before.\n  Regardless of the outcome of today's votes, I want everyone listening \nto know that if my Republican friends choose to stick with a failed \npolicy, congressional Democrats will take this fight up at the first \navailable opportunity. We know we have to get a bill to the President, \na conference report. We are going to do that. But there are other \nmeasures that are going to be moving through this body quite quickly--\ndefense authorization, for example. We are going to continue focusing, \nas Senator Biden said, on the President's failed strategy. Our troops \nand their families deserve no less.\n  Look what is going on now. Is the Commander in Chief fulfilling his \nobligations? We were told with this most recent surge that General \nPetraeus would be the guy who would take care of things over there. But \nhe has told us we can't win militarily. Now today we read in the paper \nthat General Lute is going to be the czar. The czar? What about that? \nWhose job is he taking? Is he taking General Petraeus's job? Is he \ntaking President Bush's job? What is next in the continual march of the \nPresident's failed policy?\n  We must change course. That is why I am going to proudly vote for the \nFeingold-Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we retrieve 4 \nminutes of the time.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to address the very harsh criticism of my \ndistinguished friend and leader.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia. I will then use 2 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my friend, I have worked on this amendment. I \nspent a good deal of time in the office\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nof colleagues on the other side of the aisle yesterday, incorporated \nseveral provisions in this amendment at their request. I say it was a \ngood-faith effort to do my very best to point out the need for this \nSenate and the Congress as a whole to get the most timely flow of \ninformation available to us, both from the President and from two \nindependent groups. I say when you get a man of the stature of General \nJones, who is willing to go out and work with private sector \norganizations to make a professional assessment of the military of \nIraq, that, I say to my friend, the distinguished leader of the \nDemocratic side, is not weak tea. That is a commitment by a very brave, \ncredible American to try to help this institution, the Congress, have a \nbetter understanding about the viability and the professional \ncapabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me be very clear: I in no way suggested \nmy friend from Virginia didn't act in good faith. That is the story of \nhis life. I just say, another study? Look at the one in the newspapers \ntoday. They studied what is going on in Iraq today with the explosive \ndevices--the people getting killed and maimed and injured. How many \nmore studies do we need? The study that has already been completed in \nthe minds of the American people is to change course in this civil war. \nWe have too many people being killed and injured in that war. The \ncourse needs to change. I care a great deal about my friend from \nVirginia, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I have to call \nhis amendment what I think it is. It is my opinion it is weak.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1098\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nevenly divided on the Feingold amendment.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Feingold-Reid amendment would \nfinally bring this disastrous war to a close by safely redeploying our \ntroops from Iraq by March 31, 2008.\n  We can't afford to keep ignoring the rest of the world while we focus \nsolely on Iraq. By redeploying our troops from Iraq, we can create a \nmore effective, integrated strategy to defeat expanding terrorist \nnetworks whether they be in Afghanistan, Somalia, Algeria, Morocco, or \neven here at home.\n  It is time to end a war that is draining our resources, straining our \nmilitary and undermining our national security, and the way to do that \nis by using our power of the purse to safely bring our brave troops out \nof Iraq. That is what the Feingold-Reid amendment does.\n  Over 6 months ago, the American people voted to bring this war to a \nclose. Today, by passing the Feingold-Reid amendment, the Senate can \nfinally do the same thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we feel the matters directed in the \nFeingold amendment have been addressed repeatedly by the Senate, and \nthe Senate has spoken its will and rejected those concepts.\n  I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote against the Feingold \namendment.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Feingold \n     amendment No. 1098 to amendment No. 1097 to H.R. 1495, the \n     Water Resources Development Act.\n         Russell D.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the cloture vote on amendment No. 1134 offered by the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nRepublican leader requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate on a bipartisan basis \noverwhelmingly rejected the notion of a surrender date. We now have an \nopportunity to vote for a proposal by Senator Warner which I will allow \nhim to describe that strikes me to make a lot of sense. I am going to \nallow him to describe the provisions of it, but I would urge a vote for \nthe Warner amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment embraces provisions which \nprovide the ability for the Senate--indeed, the Congress as a whole--to \nbecome better advised with regard to the President's position on the \ncompliance or noncompliance with the benchmarks, as well as an \nindependent group headed by the former commandant of the Marine Corps, \nGeneral Jones, as to the proficiency and the professional ability of \nthe Iraqi security forces.\n  Secondly, another provision allows the GAO to give an independent \nanalysis to the Congress on the Iraqi Government's achievement or \nnonachievement of the benchmarks. This is an amendment to help keep us \ninformed. So when we proceed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. To go on the August recess, we will be better equipped to \ndeal with this question on the public's behalf and to tell our \nconstituents our own individual feelings about this controversial \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset how much I \nrespect the gentleman from Virginia. I thank him for his leadership \ntime and again thank him for all he has given to this county.\n  I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment and I want my \ncolleagues to know why. Within this amendment which establishes \nbenchmarks is a provision giving the President of the United States the \npower to waive. What does it mean? The same pen the President used to \nveto our bipartisan timetable to start bringing the troops home will be \nused to make this proposal a nullity. It will not achieve the goals we \nwant to achieve.\n  Unless and until the Congress convinces this President to change his \npolicy and does it in forceful terms, this war will continue with no \nend in sight.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment that is before us, \ncloture on this amendment, because, frankly, giving the President a \nwaiver is a guarantee nothing will change.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     Warner amendment No. 1134 to H.R. 1495, the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 2007.\n         Mitch McConnell, Judd Gregg, Richard Burr, Mike Crapo, \n           John Cornyn, Lisa Murkowski, Susan M.

There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe cloture vote on amendment No. 1135 offered by the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the President should receive from the Congress acceptable \nlegislation to continue funding the operations--Iraqi Freedom and \nEnduring Freedom--by not later than May 28 of this year. The funds \npreviously appropriated by the Congress for operations in this region \nare depleted, according to a letter and testimony before our committee \nfrom the Secretary of Defense and other military leaders and the \nservice chiefs who have appeared before our committee as well.\n  The President requested supplemental funding over 3 months ago, and \nno supplemental funding has been approved by the Congress. We are \nputting troops at risk. We are keeping the military from deploying \nequipment and armaments that will protect the lives and save lives of \nAmerican troops in this region. I think it is the responsible thing to \ndo, Mr. President, for us to approve this supplemental funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been told by Pentagon officials that \nthere is money there to the end of June. We have been told by the \nCongressional Budget Office that there is money there until July. But \nin spite of all that, we sent the President a bill. He vetoed that \nbill.\n  We recognize the need to get money to the troops. We are going to do \nthat. I stated on the floor yesterday that we will take whatever time \nit takes to complete this funding prior to the recess we have scheduled \nfor Memorial Day, and we are going to do that. We will work with the \nminority to do that.\n  I also suggest that we are all going to vote for cloture on this \namendment, so maybe we don't need to vote on it. If Senators are all \ngoing to vote for it, let's accept it by voice vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, let's vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

On this vote, the yeas are 87, the nays are 9. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no Senators who have expressed \na desire to speak on the amendment. Therefore, given the fact that \ncloture has been invoked, I suggest the Chair put the question on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1135) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wanted to give Senators and staff an \nupdate on where we are with the WRDA bill now that we have voted on \nthese various Iraq resolutions.\n  Where we are now is that our work is almost done on this bill. We are \ndown to the final amendments that are in the managers' package. One of \nour colleagues, Senator Coburn, is looking at about three or four of \nthese amendments that he has some problems with. We are very hopeful we \ncan work with him to resolve those questions because we have many items \nin the managers' package. We think about 10 or 12, or more, actually. \nSo he is looking at four, and we are working with him to resolve them.\n  If we can resolve that, it would be a wonderful thing because we \ncould get done with this bill. Senator DeMint has two amendments which \nwe are looking at on our side, and we think we can work with those \namendments. We think we can reach agreement on those amendments.\n  So here is where we are. This bill is being slowed down because of \nfour particular items in the managers' package that Senator Coburn is \nlooking at right now and we are working with him. If we can resolve \nthose questions, and we can certainly resolve Senator DeMint's \namendments, we will be done with this bill, and we can roll them all \ninto a managers' package, either do them by voice vote or have a \nrecorded vote and then a final passage vote, which, believe me, would \nbe welcome news for the workers and the businesses of our great \ncountry.\n  If we cannot resolve these remaining matters, we are very willing to \nhave votes on those questions and we would like to start that this \nafternoon. We will just work our way through the six votes and see how \nit all comes out, but we are hopeful. We are going to give it another \nhour, hour and a half to talk to colleagues. I didn't want colleagues \nto think that Senator Inhofe and I weren't continuing to focus on this \nbill. We are. We are working our caucuses in an effort to get this \ndone.\n  I am going to relinquish the floor, and we will be back as soon as we \nhave some agreement on these remaining amendments.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member on the floor now, so we will \nhave a chance to collaborate on where we stand, and I yield the floor \nfor my colleague to speak at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have come a long way. I am sorry I \nwasn't here to hear Senator Boxer's remarks, but I am sure I agree with \nthe remarks of the chairman of the committee.\n  We are down now to a manageable number of amendments. We are working \nvery diligently, and I understand there are two Republican amendments \nand four Democratic amendments. The time is here for us to do \neverything we can to try to make this happen. I think almost everyone \nin here, Democrat and Republican, is for this bill. It has been 7 years \nsince we have had this reauthorization bill. It is overdue, so we need \nto have it now.\n  We debated this for 2\\1/2\\ hours yesterday, so I would encourage any \none of the authors of these six amendments to come and work with us and \nget this thing done. It would be a shame if we came this far and didn't \nget it done. So I join my chairman, Senator Boxer, in encouraging \neveryone to work together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Menendez pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n203 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, over the last couple of months, we have \nbeen debating the policy in Iraq, and over the first 4 months of the \n110th Congress, the Senate has spent many days debating this policy. I \nand many other Senators believe we should move in a new direction and \nchange the policy by transitioning the mission to training Iraqi \nforces, fighting terrorists, and protecting our troops and civilian \npersonnel in Iraq.\n  As part of this new policy, we should have a phased redeployment \nstrategy to begin the process of winding down the war to get our brave \ncombat forces home. Our troops have accomplished every mission in Iraq. \nThey have done their job. It is well past time that the President, his \nadministration, and this Congress do our job as they have done their \njob in Iraq.\n  The war has diverted our attention and resources from the broader war \nagainst al-Qaida and its allies which continues unabated 5 years \nfollowing the horrific events of September 11. Despite this \nadministration's exaggerated rhetoric in the months leading up to our \ninvasion, Saddam Hussein's regime\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\ndid not have any direct ties to al-Qaida, and our decision to topple \nhis regime without international support drained resources from our \nongoing efforts in Afghanistan. The Bush administration's inexcusable \nlack of planning for a postwar environment and the stunning \nincompetence in managing the occupation gave birth to a large, mostly \nSunni-based insurgency in Iraq. This insurgency, aided by a steady flow \nof foreign fighters, is now giving birth to a new generation of al-\nQaida terrorists providing ideological inspiration for extremists \naround the world.\n  The Presiding Officer knows, as well as so many others, that contrary \nto the administration's rosy rhetoric in 2002 and 2003, the decision to \ninvade Iraq has served as a major setback in our overall struggle \nagainst Islamic extremism and the terrorism that movement inspires. Dr. \nBruce Hoffman, one of the world's leading experts on terrorism, who \nrecently briefed me, has declared:\n\n       The United States' entanglement in Iraq has consumed the \n     attention and resources of our country's military and \n     intelligence communities at precisely the time that Osama bin \n     Laden and other senior al-Qaida commanders were in their most \n     desperate straits and stood to benefit most from this \n     distraction.\n\n  For that reason, it is essential that we get our Iraq policy on the \nright path by beginning to redeploy our U.S. combat forces, emphasizing \ntraining of Iraqi security forces, protecting our forces, and engaging \nin targeted counterterrorism missions.\n  The war against al-Qaida and its extremist allies continues on \nmultiple fronts around the world. This is a generational battle, so our \nNation must respond accordingly. Vice President Cheney, seeking to \nvalidate the administration's counterterror efforts, declared last \nfall:\n\n       I don't know how much better you can do than no attacks in \n     the last 5 years.\n\n  Every American is grateful that the Vice President's statement \ncontinues to hold true. We must salute those men and women in our Armed \nForces, our intelligence community, and our law enforcement networks, \nfrom State and local police forces to the FBI, who have helped protect \nour Nation against further attacks. To take one example, it was \nskillful surveillance and old-fashioned gumshoe work on the part of the \nCIA and FBI agents, closely cooperating with their British \ncounterparts, which allowed us to stop in its tracks a chilling plot to \nblow up as many as 10 airplanes crossing the Atlantic in August of \n2006.\n  Unfortunately, the absence of terrorist attacks in the United States \ndoes not signify any reduction in the overall threat posed by al-Qaida \nand its allies waging battle on behalf of Islamic extremism. The \ndangers our Nation still face today were brought home by two \ndevelopments in recent days.\n  The Presiding Officer knows this well because of the State he \nrepresents. First, six men were arrested last week for conspiring to \nlaunch an attack on Fort Dix in New Jersey and ``kill as many soldiers \nas possible.'' This homegrown cell of Islamic extremists was broken up \nwhen two of the defendants sought to purchase assault weapons from an \nundercover FBI agent. They had engaged in small arms training at a \nshooting range in the Pocono Mountains in my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  Second, another development. Late last week the U.S. Embassy in \nBerlin issued a general threat warning indicating that a terrorist \nattack against U.S. military or diplomatic facilities in Germany may be \nin the final stages of planning. This plot may be linked to the \nupcoming G8 summit to be held in Germany later this summer.\n  We have all seen the press reports indicating fresh evidence that al-\nQaida is once again establishing training camps in southwest Asia, only \nthis time in Pakistan, not Afghanistan. Although we achieved successes \nin late 2001 and 2002 in cutting off al-Qaida's hierarchy from its foot \nsoldiers around the world and severing operational links inside the \norganization, these gains are slowly disappearing. Instead, we see the \nchain of command within al-Qaida reemerging with fresh evidence of \nplans of potential terrorist strikes in western Europe and perhaps even \nour own homeland.\n\n  Just listen to what the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. \nMcConnell, declared in recent testimony to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       We also have seen that al-Qaida's core elements are \n     resilient. They continue to plot attacks against our homeland \n     and other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     hideout in Pakistan to affiliates throughout the Middle East, \n     northern Africa, and Europe.\n\n  The deadly reach of al-Qaida was reaffirmed with April's coordinated \nexplosions in and around the capital of Algeria, killing 24 and \nwounding more than 200. A group calling itself al-Qaida in Islamic \nNorth Africa claimed responsibility for the blasts, a severe blow to a \nnation that was finally coming out of the ashes of the horrific civil \nwar in the 1990s.\n  Mr. President, we know in order to neutralize this reconstituted and \npossibly more dangerous version of al-Qaida, the U.S. must embark on a \nglobal counterinsurgency campaign which recognizes that military force \nis an essential, but not sufficient, response to this threat. The U.S. \nmust draw on all elements of our national power--military, political, \nand economic--in a coordinated campaign that seeks to deny refuge and \nsanctuary to al-Qaida forces wherever they reside.\n  The Third Way National Security Project recently released an \ninsightful report that calls for a global constriction strategy against \nal-Qaida--an effort to suffocate the al-Qaida movement and pressure its \nphysical resources, its people, and its vehicles of propaganda--all in \na unified effort to shut down al-Qaida's ability to wage war through \nlarge-scale acts of terror. We can accomplish this strategy through \nmultiple methods: doubling the size and increasing the skill sets of \nour Special Forces troops, working with other nations to more \neffectively crack down on terror financing flows, and, finally, getting \nserious on public diplomacy so that we can counter and refute the hate-\nfilled messages from extremists at every turn.\n  Recently, former Senator Gary Hart suggested that we should create a \nfifth military service branch which would unify all Special Forces \nunder one command, an idea worthy of consideration and further study.\n  We also need to send a firm message to Pakistan that the United \nStates cannot tolerate the return of al-Qaida training facilities \nanywhere in the world. If such camps are on sovereign Pakistani \nterritory, then it is the responsibility of the government in Islamabad \nto ensure that those camps are shut down. General Musharraf has been a \npartner of the United States, and his government has played a valued \nrole in some of our most notable counterterrorism successes. But we \ncannot abide any backsliding when it comes to this issue.\n  Al-Qaida is not only reconstituting its networks and operational \ncapabilities, but it is also making gains in the broader battle of \nideas--the clash between modernity and reason and extremism and \njihadism. These are two very different worldviews fiercely competing \nevery day for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world. America will \nwin the war against extremism when we persuade the citizens of Egypt, \nIran, Saudi Arabia, and other nations of the strength of our ideas and \nvalues and offer a path away from militancy and irrational hatred.\n  But we have been going in the wrong direction on this front. We only \nneed to recall the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks when the \nworld united with us in grief and sympathy. Who can forget that grand \nheadline, in France of all places, on September 12, 2001: ``We are all \nAmericans.'' The United States had a historical opportunity to unite \nthe world in a common cause against the forces of terrorism and \nextremism and destroy the al-Qaida network and the twisted beliefs that \nserve as its cornerstone. Instead, by pursuing a black-and-white, our-\nway-or-the-highway approach, this administration helped transform our \nNation's greatest asset--the appeal of the American spirit around the \nworld--into a liability.\n  America today evokes feelings of resentment and distrust, negativity \nand hostility. Instead of building a grand international coalition on \nbehalf of the values that unite us, the White House settled for \ntemporary and weak ``coalitions of the willing'' that have left us far \ntoo isolated.\n  Since 2001, the Pew Global Attitudes Project has tracked on a regular \nbasis\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nhow America is perceived overseas and global attitudes toward the U.S.-\nled war on terrorism. Across the board, we have seen a dramatic decline \nin positive views toward the United States and, even more troubling, \nthe American people. This decline has been especially marked in the \nIslamic world, where Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida enjoy far stronger \nfavorability ratings than our Nation. In both Morocco and Jordan, both \nrelatively moderate Muslim nations, a 2005 poll found that \napproximately half of respondents in both nations believe suicide \nattacks against Americans in Iraq are justifiable. In Indonesia, \npositive views of the United States plunged from 61 percent to 15 \npercent in 1 year alone--from 2002 to 2003. Unfortunately, those \nnumbers have barely edged upward in recent years.\n  Something has gone terribly wrong when a vile terrorist organization \nis in a more positive light than our great Nation. That is, apparently, \nwhat some surveys show across the world. I understand that the United \nStates is the biggest guy on the block and a certain level of \nresentment will always exist. Yet, we cannot succeed in this global \nstruggle against terrorism and extremism if our own ideas and our own \nimage are viewed in such distorted, negative terms. We must recommit \nourselves to a global public diplomacy campaign that conveys our Nation \nas it truly is--a beacon for liberty and hope. Our efforts will succeed \nwhen we inspire those currently sitting on the fence in the Muslim \nworld to reject the false ideals that al-Qaida and its brethren \npromote. In waging an offensive against al-Qaida, our ideas will be as \nimportant as the might of our military forces.\n  While we must wage a strong offensive against al-Qaida and its \nextremist allies, we cannot neglect a strong defense here at home. \nCombating terrorism requires a strong homeland security effort, to \nensure that our Nation can effectively defend and deter against attacks \nthat can kill or injure tens of thousands of Americans in one strike. \nUnfortunately, homeland security has long been an afterthought for this \nadministration, instead used primarily as a rhetorical weapon against \nits political opponents. The Department of Homeland Security's \nineffectual record and poor performance bear witness to this neglect.\n  It is easy to forget that this administration fiercely opposed the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security, instead arguing that a \nsmall office in the White House could adequately do the job. The \nadministration long resisted the full implementation of the\n9/11 Commission recommendations--a serious oversight that the 110th \nCongress has sought to rectify, with both the House and the Senate \npassing comprehensive legislation to help ensure that all of the \ncommission's recommendations are finally put in place. When it came \ntime to replace Tom Ridge as Secretary of Homeland Security, the White \nHouse put forward as its first choice Bernard Kerik--a political hack \nwith a checkered past--only to withdraw the nomination days later after \na series of embarrassing disclosures on his personal background.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has lacked the necessary budgets, \nleadership, and political support required from the White House to do \nits job properly. Although the administration created a brand new \ndepartment to coordinate homeland security policy, overall funding for \nhomeland security programs barely grew after DHS opened its doors in \nearly 2003. The upper echelons of the Department have constituted a \nrevolving door with industry, as senior political appointees spend only \na year or two in their positions before cashing in on their contacts \nand joining lobbying firms and technology firms with interests before \nthe Department. We saw the culmination of this neglect and indifference \nin the Department's shameful response to Hurricane Katrina in the fall \nof 2005.\n  Although I do not sit on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I take a strong interest in these issues, as they \nare vital to my constituents in Pennsylvania. And so I believe there \nare three key areas where this Congress can take further action to help \nensure that our Nation is better prepared to protect itself against a \nfuture attack. First of all, we must ensure that our limited homeland \nsecurity dollars are spent wisely. Although I respect the general \nprinciple that Federal spending must be allocated in a manner fair and \nproportionate for all 50 States represented in this Chamber, we cannot \ntreat homeland security funding as just another Government program. It \nis an undeniable fact, one emphasized by the 9/11 Commission, that some \nStates, some cities, and some targets are at significantly greater risk \nto attack than others. And so we must allocate our homeland security \nfunding on a risk-focused basis.\n  During the Senate's debate on the\n9/11 Commission bill, I was proud to stand with the distinguished \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and others in fighting for an \namendment that would revise our funding formulas to ensure that \nhomeland security dollars flow, first and foremost, to those cities and \nStates with the greatest at-risk targets. Although this effort failed, \nI was pleased to see that we have made progress since the last Congress \nand encourage the House-Senate conference to ensure that risk-based \nfunding provisions be included in the final bill.\n  A second area of strong concern to me is the prospect of terrorists \ntransforming our chemical plants and hazardous material rail shipments \ninto lethal chemical weapons. A Congressional Research Service report \nindicates that there are at least 16 chemical plants in Pennsylvania \nwhere a release of toxic chemicals could cause over 100,000 deaths, and \ntwo plants where such a release could result in over a million deaths. \nThis threat has been brought home in recent weeks as we see insurgents \nin Iraq engineering large explosions of chlorine tankers to spread \nnoxious fumes in populated areas. These attacks are growing in \nsophistication and lethality and I worry that they may provide a \nblueprint for similar attacks in the United States. Therefore, I am \nencouraged that the Department of Homeland Security released its final \nregulations on chemical plant security earlier this month. These \nregulations are a good start, but we need to do much more. In \nparticular, we need to ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Chemical Security Office receives far more than the paltry \n$10 million it was appropriated for the current fiscal year.\n  It is also essential to permit those state and local governments \nwhich wish to adopt even more stringent protective measures to do so. \nThe regulations issued by the Department are somewhat ambiguous on this \npoint, and so both Houses of Congress have endorsed language that \npreserves the right of State and local governments to ``preempt'' \nFederal regulations so long as they are not in direct contradiction. \nThis language would permit the Department of Homeland Security to \nestablish a minimum floor for chemical security regulations, but, \nyielding to the best principles of federalism, allow individual State \nand local governments to go beyond those minimum regulations where \nappropriate.\n  Finally, it is incumbent that our Nation takes steps to once and for \nall ensure that our first responders have reliable access to secure \ninteroperable communications. After 343 firefighters and paramedics \ngave their lives on 9/11, and countless victims died during Hurricane \nKatrina, because emergency personnel were unable to communicate with \neach other, it is unacceptable that we have still failed to establish a \nnationwide interoperable communications system that will allow local, \nState, and Federal first responders to communicate with each other in a \nseamless and uniform fashion. For this reason, I am proud to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona in cosponsoring S. 744, the SAVE \nLIVES Act, a bill ensuring that an additional 30 MHz in the 700 MHz \nspectrum band be dedicated to public safety.\n  The SAVE LIVES Act would require the Federal Communications \nCommission to auction 30 MHz of the spectrum, which is otherwise \nscheduled to be made available in January 2008 for general commercial \npurposes, under a conditional license requiring any winning bidder to \nmeet detailed requirements to operate a national, interoperable public \nsafety broadband network. A commercial provider can use this broadband \nspectrum for commercial purposes, but must make available the\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nspectrum for public safety purposes whenever it is needed.\n  I am proud to be the first cosponsor on this important legislation. I \nstrongly urge the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee to take up this bill immediately, because we don't have time \nto lose. Pursuant to a previous congressional mandate, the FCC must \nauction spectrum in the 700 MHz band by January 28, 2008. Unless this \nbill passes in some form beforehand, all of that spectrum, with a small \nexception, will be auctioned off to commercial providers, with no \nrequirement that any of it be made available to first responders for \npublic safety purposes.\n  Secure, interoperable communications is an issue of particular \ninterest to my constituents in the city of Philadelphia. Currently, \nfirst responders are unable to use their radios in the tunnels of the \ncity's subway and commuter rail system, SEPTA. The city has applied for \nDHS grants in past years to wire the tunnels to facilitate \ncommunications, but those applications have been rejected. I intend to \nwork with the city and other members of the Pennsylvania Congressional \ndelegation to ensure that the fifth largest city in the Nation is \nprepared for any potential emergency in its transit system.\n  There are a number of other strong policy proposals that I urge this \nCongress to consider to further strengthen our Nation's homeland \nsecurity. I do not have the time today to discuss them in further \ndetail, but at a minimum, we should take a serious look at the \nfollowing areas:\n  Ensuring that we inspect the air cargo transported by passenger \nairlines to prevent terrorists from planting a bomb in a plane's \nunderbelly; strengthening our border security with better technology \nand additional Customs and Border Patrol agents; working with the \nprivate sector to develop real incentives for both large corporations \nand small businesses to adopt commensense solutions that mitigate the \nrisks of an attack and thus make them less attractive targets to \nterrorists; undertaking a serious and comprehensive approach to locking \nup sources of nuclear missile material around the world to prevent our \nworst nightmare--an improvised nuclear bomb destroying an American \ncity.\n  All of us remember where we were and what we were doing on September \n11, 2001. The memories of that terrible day will remain with all of us \nso long as we are alive. Our Nation has been blessed that we he not had \nto endure another attack during the intervening 5 years, but we \nrecognize that our friends in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and the \nMiddle East have suffered ghastly attacks that have taken the lives of \ninnocent civilians and spread terror. The war in Iraq is at the center \nof our national discussion today, but we cannot allow it to distract us \nfrom the objectives the America people set out to achieve in the fall \nof 2001: destroying al-Qaida and denying legitimacy to the ideas of \njihadist extremism.\n  It is time to refocus our attention and resources. Al-Qaida may not \nhave mounted another attack against our citizens, but they have tried \nand are once again on the march. We must rededicate ourselves to a \ncomprehensive strategy that seeks to constrict Al-Qaida's bases of \nsupport and undercuts their popular legitimacy in the Muslim world. On \nthe home front, we must ensure that we are adequately prepared to deter \nand defend against likely attacks that seek to exploit our open society \nand sow panic and economic damage.\n  If America truly is engaged in a generational battle against the \nforces of extremism, our Nation must adopt a serious and comprehensive \napproach to counterterrorism, both overseas and at home. We owe the \nvictims of 9/11 and their families no less--indeed, we owe the American \npeople no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask to speak for 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, this is a very difficult time for those of \nus who have long known that the war in Iraq was a strategic error of \nmonumental proportions but who also understand the practical realities \nof disengagement. The majority of this country believes we need to \nreadjust our Iraq policy and get our combat forces off the streets of \nIraq's cities. A majority of our military believes this \nadministration's approach is not working. A majority of the Congress \nbelieves we need a new approach.\n  There are sound, realistic alternatives that could be pursued toward \nthe eventual goal of removing our troops from Iraq, increasing the \npolitical stability of that war-torn region, increasing our capability \nto defeat the forces of international terrorism, and allowing our \ncountry to focus on larger strategic priorities that have now gone \nuntended for years. Unfortunately, few of these alternatives seem to \nmake it to the House or Senate floor in a form that would truly impact \npolicy.\n  With respect to the approaches that have been taken recently, let me \nfirst say I am somewhat cynical about the stack of benchmarks that have \nappeared in recent bills laying down a series of requirements to the \nIraqi Government. The reality is that the Iraqi Government is a weak \ngovernment. Like the Lebanese Government 20 years ago, it has very \nlittle power, and it is surrounded by a multiplicity of armed factions \nwhich have overwhelming power in their own concentrated areas of \nactivity.\n  Too often, the benchmarks that we, in our splendid isolation, decide \nto impose are little more than feel-good measures, giving us the \nillusion that we are doing something meaningful. Just to make them more \nillusory, the language we send over on benchmarks and other policies, \nsuch as unit readiness and length of deployment, are usually couched \nwith waivers, so the President can simply ignore the language, anyway. \nWhat does this do? How can we continue these actions and then claim to \nthe American people that we are really solving the most troubling issue \nof our era? Some of these discussions remind me of what Mark Twain once \nwrote, saying that the Government in Washington is like 2,000 ants \nfloating down the river on a log, each one thinking they are driving \nit.\n  Secondly, let me say that I admire the intentions of the bill my \ncolleague, Senator Feingold, introduced today. However, I could not \nvote for that bill because an arbitrary cutoff date for funding \nmilitary operations in Iraq might actually work against the country's \nbest interests in an environment where we have finally seen some \ndiplomatic efforts from this administration. Recent initiatives from \nSecretary of State Rice, Ambassador Crocker, and Admiral Fallon, the \nnew commander of Central Command, hold out the hope, if not the \npromise, that we might actually start to turn this thing around.\n  Admiral Fallon has publicly stated that we must deal with Iran and \nSyria. Ambassador Crocker, at this moment, is arranging a diplomatic \nexchange with Iran. Secretary of State Rice has cooperated at the \nministerial level in an environment where her Iranian counterpart was \nalso at the table. Importantly, Admiral Fallon mentioned during his \nrecent confirmation hearing that it is not the number of troops in Iraq \nthat is important but the uses to which they are being put.\n  So there is some room for movement here, as long as the movement \noccurs in a timely fashion. An arbitrary cutoff date would, at this \npoint, take away an important negotiating tool. Let us just hope they \nuse the tools we are providing them in an effective manner.\n  There is, however, one issue which demands our immediate attention \nand which should not be delayed. As we look at our options here in \nCongress, I continue to firmly believe we have a duty in an area which \nis not being properly addressed by this administration and which is in \nthe proper purview of the Congress. When the supplemental \nappropriations bill is returned to the President, it should contain \nlanguage prohibiting this administration from deploying Army units for \nlonger than 12 months and from deploying Marine Corps units for longer \nthan 210 days. It should also prohibit sending\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nany military individual overseas unless he or she has been home from a \nprevious tour for at least as long as they had been deployed. In other \nwords, if you have been gone a year, you should come home for a year \nbefore you go back.\n  This administration has gone to the well again and again, extending \nthe length of military tours and shortening the time our soldiers and \nmarines are allowed to be at home before being sent again and again \ninto Iraq and Afghanistan. Absent the gravest national emergency, there \nis no strategy in Iraq or elsewhere that justifies what has been \nhappening with the deployment cycles of the men and women we are \nsending into harm's way. It has reached the point that the good will \nand dedication of our military people are being abused by policymakers \nobsessed with various experimental strategies being conducted at their \nexpense. These people have put their lives literally into the hands of \nour national leadership. There are limits to human endurance, and there \nare limits to what military families can be expected to tolerate in the \nname of the national good. For that reason, I urge our conferees to \ninclude language which will limit this policy in the bill that will be \nreturned to the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in these dangerous times, we face \nterrorist threats around the world. The decisions we make here in the \nSenate must put us in a stronger position to fight and defeat \nterrorists wherever they hide. Just last week, the United States and \nGerman Governments unraveled the reported plot to attack American \ninterests in Germany. This development reminds us that we face dangers \nall around the globe, and we need to be able to dispatch our resources \nwherever and whenever they are needed to keep us safe.\n  Unfortunately, having nearly 150,000 American troops stuck in the \nmiddle of a civil war in Iraq does not strengthen our ability to fight \nterrorists from around the globe. In fact, by forcing our troops to \npolice a civil war and by not giving our troops the equipment and \ntraining they need, the President's current policy is impairing our \nmilitary readiness and our ability to fight and win the broader war on \nterror. It is time to refocus our efforts back on to the broader war on \nterror. Yes, we will still fight and defeat the al-Qaida terrorists who \nare in Iraq. But we recognize that terror networks exist in many other \ncountries, and we have to fight and defeat terrorists in those places \nas well.\n\n  That is why I supported the Feingold-Reid amendment this morning. \nThat amendment recognizes that leaving our troops in the middle of a \ncivil war in Iraq is not the best use of our military. It doesn't make \nus safer at home, it diminishes our ability to fight the broader war on \nterror, and it impairs our military readiness.\n  It is clear the Iraqi civil war cannot be solved militarily. It must \nbe solved politically. Today we are 5 years into this war. Thousands of \nAmerican lives have been lost, and billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars \nhave been spent. Yet the Iraqis have not moved forward with meeting key \nbenchmarks and beginning reconciliation. We have to show the Iraqis \nthat we will not police their civil war indefinitely and that they must \ntake responsibility for their own future. The redeployment language of \nthe Feingold-Reid amendment from this morning makes it very clear to \nthe Iraqis that our commitment is not open-ended and that they must \nmake the necessary compromises to bring peace to their country.\n  In Iraq, our troops have done everything we have asked them to do. \nNow it is time to begin redeploying our troops, rebuilding our \nmilitary, and getting back to fighting the war on terror.\n  As I look at these issues, I see four imperatives: First, we have to \nfight and defeat terrorists; second, we have to recognize the war in \nIraq is impacting our ability to do that; third, we have to rebuild our \nmilitary readiness, which has been seriously compromised by this war in \nIraq. Finally, we have to be there to support our servicemembers, our \nveterans and their families, every step of the way.\n  First of all, we all recognize that we are in a war with terrorists \naround the world and we need to fight and win that war. This is not a \nwar against countries. We are in a war against terrorists wherever they \nreside. President Bush wants us to believe the war in Iraq is the war \non terror. It is not. The war on terror that our country faces is not \nthe same thing as the civil war that is raging in Iraq. What is \nhappening in Iraq is primarily a civil war between factions that have \nbeen in conflict for generations. The Feingold-Reid amendment empowers \nour military to target and destroy any terrorist elements in Iraq, but \nit would not force the majority of American troops to be stuck \nindefinitely in the crossfire of a civil war.\n  As we look at the terrorists our Nation confronts, al-Qaida is the \nmost dangerous, according to the declassified National Intelligence \nEstimate from last year.\n  That NIE report said:\n\n       Al-Qaida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the \n     homeland and U.S. interests abroad by a single terrorist \n     organization.\n\n  The NIE also said the jihadists ``are increasing in both number and \ngeographic dispersion. If this trend continues, threats to U.S. \ninterests at home and abroad will become more diverse, leading to \nincreasing attacks worldwide.''\n  Al-Qaida is the threat. We have to get back to fighting al-Qaida, and \nthat is what the Reid-Feingold amendment would allow.\n  Under that amendment, while most troops would be redeployed, some \nwould remain to conduct targeted operations against al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups. They would provide security for American \ninfrastructure and personnel, and they would be allowed to train and \nequip the Iraqi security forces.\n  This administration's focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger \nwar on terror, and it has left us vulnerable. Our country faces \npossible threats from terrorists around the world, and we need a \nsecurity strategy that ensures that we can fight those threats wherever \nthey are. But, instead, the Bush administration has become increasingly \nfocused on Iraq, which weakens our ability to fight that broader war on \nterror just when we must be strong.\n  Next, let's look at the relationship between the civil war in Iraq \nand our own security. Does having so much of our military tied up in \nIraq's civil war make us safer? Does it help us fight terrorists around \nthe world? The truth is, leaving our troops in Iraq is not making us \nmore secure.\n  A State Department report from 2 weeks ago found:\n\n       International intervention in Iraq has been used by \n     terrorists as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist \n     activity that has contributed to the instability in \n     neighboring countries.\n\n  According to our own State Department, our involvement in Iraq is \nmaking the region less stable, not more stable. The war in Iraq has the \npotential to make it harder for us to respond to other threats around \nthe world. That is because the conflict in Iraq is tying up large parts \nof our military and is degrading our military readiness, which brings \nme to my third point.\n  We must rebuild America's military. We can all be proud that our \ncountry is home to the finest fighting forces in the world. But we must \nalso face the truth. The war in Iraq has impaired our military \nreadiness, and that is not just my opinion, it is the opinion of \nmilitary leaders and experts who say it may take us, now, 5 years to \nrebuild our military.\n  The Iraq war has impaired our readiness by forcing a hard-to-maintain \ntempo on our troops, by destroying our equipment, by reducing the \ncapabilities of our Guard and Reserve, and by limiting the training \nthat our troops receive. Today we are forcing a very tough tempo on our \nservicemembers. They all want to work, and they all want to work hard. \nBut we have to\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nmake sure the demands placed on them are reasonable. The Pentagon has \nextended tours of duty for our troops. It has deployed troops sooner \nthan planned. It has sent troops without all the training and equipment \nthey should receive. It has deployed troops without the downtime at \nhome that our servicemembers and their families deserve.\n  Two Army brigades are on their fourth deployment now to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That tremendous pace with little downtime in between is a \nstrain on our troops. Our military is the best in the world. I believe \nwe need to address those strains on our servicemembers so we can remain \nthe best in the world.\n  The Iraq war is also impairing our readiness by destroying our \nequipment. The Army, for example, is supposed to have five brigades' \nworth of equipment prepositioned overseas, but because of the war in \nIraq, the Army is depleting those reserves. GEN Peter Schoomaker told \nthe Senate just last month:\n\n       It will take us 2 years just to rebuild those stocks.\n\n  Our military is the best in the world. I believe we need to address \nthe strains on equipment so we can remain the best in the world.\n  The Iraq war has especially impacted the readiness of our National \nGuard. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, LTG Stephen Blum, \ntestified that the readiness of National Guard forces is at a historic \nlow. He said:\n\n       Eighty-eight percent of the forces that are back here in \n     the United States are very poorly equipped today in the Army \n     National Guard.\n\n  A national commission looked at the National Guard and Reserve and \nsent its report to Congress last March, a few months ago. The \ncommission said:\n\n       We believe that the current posture and utilization of the \n     National Guard and Reserve as an ``operational reserve'' is \n     not sustainable over time, and if not corrected with \n     significant changes to law and policy, the reserve \n     component's ability to serve our Nation will diminish.\n\n  Our military is the best in the world. I believe we need to address \nthe readiness of our Guard and Reserve so we can remain the best in the \nworld.\n  We also rely on our Guard members when disaster strikes at home. We \nneed their trained personnel and equipment to respond quickly. After \nthe horrible tornadoes that occurred in Kansas just a few weeks ago, \nthe Governor of Kansas said recovery efforts for those two States were \nhampered because there were not enough personnel and equipment. Where \nwere those resources? In Iraq, not here at home.\n  COL Timothy Orr of the U.S. Army National Guard told the Senate that \nhis brigade's homeland security capabilities have been degraded.\n  He testified to us:\n\n       Our ability as a brigade to perform these homeland missions \n     continues to be degraded by continued equipment shortages, \n     substitutions, and the cross-leveling of equipment between \n     the State and the Nation to support our deploying units.\n\n  I have shown now how the Iraq war has impacted the readiness of our \ntroops, of our equipment, and of our National Guard. The pace of \ndeployment to Iraq is also hindering another measure of readiness--the \ntraining that our servicemembers receive.\n  To meet the President's surge, the Pentagon has been sending some \ntroops to Iraq earlier than was planned, and they are keeping other \nunits there in Iraq longer than planned. That means our troops are \ngetting less time at home, less time between deployments, and \nimportantly, less time to train. Commanders are forced to shorten the \ntraining their troops receive so they are focusing now only on specific \ntraining that they need for Iraq, but not for other potential \nconflicts.\n  That makes sense if there is limited training time. We want all that \ntime devoted to their most immediate need. However, many military \nleaders are now warning us that this fast pace diminishes our ability \nto respond to other potential conflicts. Here is how the colonel who \ncommands the First Marine Regiment put it:\n\n       Our greatest challenge is and will remain available \n     training time, and because that time is limited, our training \n     will continue to focus on the specific mission in Iraq. This \n     has, and will continue to, limit our ability to train for \n     other operations.\n\n  Army COL Michael Beech told the Senate in April that he believes our \ntraining strategy is broad enough to support a variety of other events. \nBut he added:\n\n       However, if deployed in support of other emerging \n     contingencies, I would be concerned with the atrophy of some \n     specific tactical skills unique to higher-density conflicts.\n\n  We have military commanders telling us that they are concerned that \nour ability to train for other missions has been limited and certain \ntactical skills have atrophied. We don't know what the future of our \nworld brings. We don't know what types of conflicts we will need to be \nprepared to fight. It is our responsibility, as leaders today, to be \npreparing for whatever the future brings for the next generation. By \nallowing our troops to only now be trained for today's mission, we are \nnot meeting our responsibility for the long-term dangers our country \nmust be prepared to defeat.\n  Our military is the best in the world. I believe we have to address \nthese training shortfalls so we can remain the best in the world.\n  I am also concerned at the billions of dollars that we are spending \nin Iraq, coming at the expense of our ability to be strong at home. I \nam very concerned that the Bush administration has chosen to fund this \nwar in ways that have meant that homeland security priorities at home \nhave not been fully funded. I have worked very hard with my colleagues \nto try to correct that in areas such as port security grants and first \nresponder funding. But it is not easy to overcome years of misplaced \npriorities from this administration.\n  Let me share with you some of the examples from this President's \nlatest budget proposal. President Bush, in his budget proposal to us, \ndramatically cut funding for first responders to pay for the war in \nIraq. His budget cut critical State homeland security grants by $348 \nmillion, or about 60 percent, to pay for the war in Iraq. He reduced \nurban area grants by $185 million--that is a 25-percent reduction--to \npay for the war in Iraq. He cut our local law enforcement terrorism \nprevention grants by $119 million. That is a cut of 33 percent at home \nto pay for the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, we know funds are limited, so we have to be smart. \nPolicing a civil war in Iraq should not come at the expense of our \nsecurity right here at home.\n  Finally, as we fight and win the war on terrorism and we rebuild our \nmilitary, we have to be there every step of the way to support our \nservicemembers, our veterans, and, importantly, their families. We need \nto meet their needs every step of the way from the day they are \nrecruited, while they are being trained, when they are deployed, and, \nimportantly, when they transition back here at home.\n  Today, too many of our servicemembers are falling through the cracks \nand not getting the support they deserve. That is why I have been \nworking on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee to identify those needs, to fund them, and to have the \nappropriate policies so we support those men and women who have so \nstrongly supported us.\n  At the end of the day, our security comes down to people, people \ndoing a job this country has asked them to do. We have to keep our \npromise to them. We face terrorist threats around the world. We must \nand we will defeat them. But to do so, we have to be smart and we have \nto be tough.\n  Unfortunately, the civil war in Iraq is not making us more secure; it \nis making us less secure. We need to refocus our efforts back on the \nwar on terrorism and we need to rebuild our military. I supported the \nFeingold-Reid amendment this morning because it sets a new direction \nfor our involvement in Iraq so we can refocus on the larger security \nchallenges our Nation faces.\n  This is what I am fighting for in the Senate. I know we can do it. We \ncan take care of our men and women in uniform, we can improve security \nright here at home, we can track down and eliminate terrorists around \nthe world. It is a matter of getting our priorities straight.\n  Redeploying our troops from Iraq so we can focus on those other \npriorities is a critical first step in the Senate we have to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the senior Senator from \nWashington State for her statement. She expressed similar concerns at \nthe time of the original vote on the war in Iraq. She courageously \nstood up and spoke to why the mistakes were being made.\n  I have to say, especially seeing the distinguished Presiding Officer \nfrom my own State of Vermont, I think it is safe to say, if the same \nspeech had been given in the State of Vermont, way over across the \ncontinent to our State, it would have been widely and happily received.\n  We have a situation where one time people put on the ribbons to \nsupport the troops, as we all do, we all do, but then when the budget \ncomes, we find, well, we will support everything but those things \nneeded by our troops when they come home--everything that is needed by \nour veterans, everything that is needed by a lot of our troops while \nthey are over there, and this will not change until more people speak \nout as courageously as the Senator from Washington State has.\n  I commend her. She has been very consistent. They are words that this \nVermonter is glad to hear. I am glad she is saying it at a time when \nboth the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, and \nI had a chance to be here. I applaud her for it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Members of the Senate--at least a \ncertain limited number--are intensely involved in an attempt to draft \nan immigration bill that will serve the national interest. I say \n``serve the national interest'' because there are quite a number of \nspecial interests. There are the interests of poor people all over the \nworld who would like to come here, interests of all kinds. But at one \nof our hearings, we had several professors and experts on immigration \nand the economy. They said we ought to ask what is in the national \ninterest and do that. That can also cause us to develop a thought \nprocess that could lead to legislation of which we can be proud.\n  One thing that is not in our national interest is to continue the \ncurrent policy of immigration. It is not working. It has \ncomprehensively failed us. We all know that. We have been at this for \nsome time. We know this system is not working effectively. It has not \nmade us proud. Congress deserves a lot of blame. Often unmentioned is \nthat very considerable blame should fall on Presidents over the last 20 \nyears because I am not aware of a single time any of them have come to \nCongress with a comprehensive request for action that would actually \nfix this broken system. So both Congress and the President deserve \ncriticism.\n  These discussions are ongoing. I admire the Senators who are \nparticipating. I am aware these discussions are going on. People ask \nme: Senator, does that offend you? I say: No, you need some people to \ngather to try to hammer something out and sometimes to make a blocked \nsystem begin to work. There are some excellent Senators participating \nin that activity. But I have to tell my colleagues, I have some \nconcerns. My predictions last week seem to be coming true today; that \nis, a process has been ongoing that could lead to us having an entirely \nnew bill plopped on the floor of the Senate, that nobody has had a \nchance to read on one of the most important issues facing our country.\n  Some say: Oh, it is not so important. We have to get the bill off the \nfloor. The public is going to be mad, so the sooner we can just bring \nthis thing up and vote it out and get it away from here, the less blame \nis going on fall on us.\n  That kind of thinking is afoot here, I am afraid. But it is not good \nthinking. I believe the American people know this is an important \nissue. They believe we should get it right. They want us to get it \nright. They know there are going to have to be some tough choices. I \nknow there are people talking, calling in on the radio and fussing and \nsaying unkind things sometimes that they shouldn't say. We have people \ncalling in with Pollyanna-ish ideas that are not worth two cents. \nPeople sort of judge the debate by maybe what they hear in those \ncircumstances.\n  We need to work up a bill that can be effective, that would actually \nwork. It cannot be done quickly. Fortunately, the efforts have been \nabandoned on the bill that we passed last year, amazingly. It was an \nabsolutely fatally flawed piece of legislation that should never have \nbecome law. I think Members of the Senate, many of them who voted for \nit, had they believed it would become law, probably wouldn't have voted \nfor it. They also didn't know what was in it. It was over 800 pages. \nThey knew the House wasn't going to pass it. That is not responsible \nleadership.\n  This year, we have a new framework. When you have a new framework, \nyou are not able to analyze portions of last year's bill and see how \nthe new framework is going to work. So we are told that they are coming \nclose to reaching agreement. People who I affectionately called ``the \nmasters of the universe,'' those who are out there plotting all this \ncomprehensive immigration reform and putting it together, they are \nmeeting. What will they produce? I don't know. So we are now going to \nhave a cloture vote on Monday. The Democratic leader insisted on that. \nHe moved it off at least until Monday to give this small group a few \nmore days to discuss it, this small group who are on the inside. As a \nresult, we will have a cloture vote on Monday on the old bill, last \nyear's bill.\n  Presumably Tuesday or sometime, this new bill will be plopped down. \nWhat is going to be in it? We don't know. We were told we may get the \nlanguage tomorrow or we are going to try to have the language for you \ntomorrow, Senators, so you can at least begin to read it. We think this \nyear's bill is going to be a thousand pages. That is not a little bitty \nmatter, a thousand pages. As a former Federal prosecutor for 15 years, \nI know that if you don't get every single aspect of the bill right, it \ncan't be made enforceable. If you make errors in the language and the \ndrafting and the appellate process and the enforcement ideas, the whole \nthing can be a joke and not effective. It takes time to do write a bill \nthis size correctly.\n  We are going to have this comprehensive immigration reform bill \nbouncing back up next week. They are going to want to vote on it by \nFriday of next week. I submit that Senators will not be given enough \ntime to really analyze it, much less the American people. If we are to \navoid cynicism, we ought to make sure the American people are engaged \nin the process. Those are large concerns of mine.\n  As I said, they say we may have the language tomorrow. But the best \nwe can ascertain is, it is probably not going to be bill language, \nlanguage we would actually vote on and amend. This is serious. It is \nsome sort of outline or word statement of what the bill provisions are \ngoing to be, not having had it written out so we can examine it \ncarefully before we vote on it.\n  A group of Senators--I was one of them--has written a letter to the \nRepublican leader and to the majority leader, I believe, to say that \nwith an issue as important and complex as immigration reform, it is \ncritical that the process for floor consideration be open to full and \ninformed debate and amendment. Who could dispute that? It goes on to \nsay:\n\n       There are reports that the cloture vote on the motion to \n     proceed will be held on Monday. We would ask you to seek the \n     following assurances from Senator Reid.\n\n  This would be the letter to Senator McConnell asking him to approach \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid, and ask for these assurances: that a \nnew, compromise proposal should be brought to the floor of the Senate \nas a separate, clean bill, not as an amendment to S. 1348, last year's \nbill. Therefore, we can proceed in a clean fashion to amend it and act \non it in the appropriate fashion. No. 2, it was asked that full and\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nfinal bill text must be available online in a searchable format by \nmidnight tonight. They have been talking about having that available in \nthis fashion, but will we get it? I doubt it. All germane Republican \namendments must be allowed to be called up and voted on. That is \ngermane amendments, amendments that go right to the bill, not \namendments unrelated to the bill. We need a CBO score, that is the \nCongressional Budget Office score. We had the CBO finally come through \nwith a score on last year's bill that found that not counting the \nenforcement expenditures, the cost of that bill, as written, would be \n$127 billion. I thank my excellent staff member for her assistance. \nReal money, I submit, it would cost, because the people who would be \nlegalized and given permanent status and put on the road to citizenship \nin last year's bill would have been available for huge amounts of money \nfrom the Government in terms of earned-income tax credit and other \nwelfare programs. So we don't have a score on it.\n  Before we pass a bill, we should look at the CBO score. The CBO has \nmade clear that the real surge in cost to the U.S. Treasury will be in \nthe next 10 years, not in the first 10 years. In fact, the Heritage \nFoundation's Mr. Robert Rector, who was one of the architect of welfare \nreform a number of years ago, has done immense calculations on the cost \nof the bill. He estimates that a substantial percentage of the people \nwho would be legalized under this legislation will have less than a \nhigh school education and that on average would cost the U.S. Treasury \n$30,000 a year or as much as $1 million over a lifetime per household \nheaded by a person without a high school education. He carefully worked \nthose numbers up. Are they accurate? I don't know. But he spent a lot \nof time working on that. The point Mr. Rector and the Heritage \nFoundation have made with crystal clarity is that those wise people in \nthe big suites in Manhattan who think we are going to solve our \nfinancial difficulties with Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security \nby adding large amounts of low-skilled immigration are in a dream world \nbecause it is going to cost us, not help us, financially. He called it \na fiscal disaster. We haven't even seen the language of the new \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill, so we don't know what the CBO \nscore and the cost to the U.S. taxpayers would be.\n  Those are some fairly minimal issues that I believe should be dealt \nwith before we rush into legislation.\n  Let me mention a few quick questions that I have about the new bill. \nThe bill purports to have an enforcement guarantee. That is important. \nThe enforcement provisions contained in Title I and Title II of the new \nbill will be meaningless unless they are funded, meaning that we \nactually put the money up for enforcement, and unless the enforcement \nmeasures are required to be implemented before other parts of the bill \nkick in. That was the ``trigger'' debate we had last year.\n  Senator Isakson from Georgia offered a commonsensical approach that \nwe should not give benefits to individuals until we are sure that the \nimmigration system is not continuing to be broken and not working. It \nwould simply require the borders to be secured before the new \nimmigration programs are implemented. But it was rejected on the floor \nafter debate last year 40 to 55 because the leaders who so-called put \ntogether that bill last year agreed they would vote against any \namendments that had any significant impact on the legislation. So they \nall got together and voted against a commonsensical trigger. We need \nsuch a trigger in this year's legislation.\n  Without an enforcement trigger, we are unable to assure the American \npeople that immigration reform in 2007 will be any different from 1986, \nwhen the promises of future enforcement, made in exchange for the \namnesty given in 1986, never materialized.\n  That is what happened. In 1986, they said there were about 2 million \npeople here illegally. We set up a system to grant them amnesty. We \nchanged some laws to supposedly make the immigration system more lawful \nin the future. When amnesty was handed out, turned out to be 3 million \npeople were here illegally. We had a big percentage of those who \nclaimed amnesty, and who got it--got it on fraudulent claims--when they \nreally were not entitled to it. That is the history of immigration \nreform in 1986--20 years ago. So we need to make sure, this time, when \nlegislation passes, it will actually work. Isn't that what the American \npeople want of us?\n  Another question we need to ask: How much will this bill increase \nlegal immigration? Last year, the bill would have increased the number \nof green cards--that is, permanent resident status--the United States \nwould issue over the next 20 years to 53 million. That would be 34 \nmillion more than the current 18.9 million scheduled to be issued under \ncurrent law. That was last year's bill. It was just about three times \nthe current rate of immigration.\n  Now, I have to tell you, Professor Borjas, at Harvard, has written a \nbook, ``Heaven's Door.'' He is at the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment, himself a Cuban inmigrant as a young man. Professor Borjas \nhas indicated he thinks that 500,000 per year would be the right number \nfor America, economically and otherwise. That would be 10 million over \n20 years, not 53 million over 20 years.\n  When it came out of committee, it was even worse. It would have \nincreased the immigration levels by elevenfold--up to 217 million over \n20 years. It actually could have gone that high under the bill as \nwritten. My staff--Cindy Hayden and her team--ran these numbers, and \nthey were later confirmed by the Heritage Foundation. We had amendments \nthat brought it down to 53 million.\n  So we do not know what the green card increases will be in the bill \nbeing talked about now. It is a critical question. So we need time to \nstudy that issue and make sure the numbers of people coming into our \ncountry are assimilatable, and also do not plummet the wages of \nAmerican workers, particularly middle-class and lower middle-class \nworkers.\n  I am telling you, the numbers indicate that low-skilled workers in \nthe industries where there are large amounts of illegal immigration \nhave not shown wage increases. In fact, in many instances, adjusted for \ninflation, wages have gone down. We had expert testimony on that. From \n2000 to 2005, wages in categories of workers, where immigration is \nheavy, showed a net decrease in income.\n  So that only makes sense. If you bring in large amounts of low-\nskilled labor, you can expect the value of low-skilled labor in the \nUnited States to go down. I do not think the average American believes \nand expects that immigration reform will result in a large increase in \nimmigration. I am pretty sure they think we are working on a \ncomprehensive plan to create a legal system that works, and they \nprobably expect immigration will be reduced, not tripled. So we have to \nlook at that question.\n  Another question would be: Will the temporary program be temporary? \nLast year's bill contained a ``temporary'' worker program that was, in \nreality, a low-skilled permanent migration program for 200,000 workers, \nplus their families, annually. This is the bill that is on the floor \ntoday that we will vote cloture on next week. Workers and their \nfamilies were given 3-year renewable visas. They could bring their \nfamilies into the United States. They could be sponsored by their \nemployer, the first year they are here, for a green card, to become \npermanent residents in the United States. They could continue to renew \nthose temporary worker 3-year visas indefinitely, as long as they were \nworking and did not have a felony conviction. So in last year's bill it \nwas not a temporary worker program. It was a plan to bring in workers \nwho were put on a virtual automatic path to permanent residence and \ncitizenship.\n  What will this new bill contain? We hear different things. One is \nthat it contains a 3-year visa, where workers are allowed to bring in \ntheir families--I am not sure we can look our voters in the eye back \nhome and say we are going to sponsor such a program again this year.\n  Additionally, if we set aside 10,000 green cards a year for these new \n``temporary'' workers to apply for--as I am hearing the bill may do--I \nam sure we cannot claim our intention is to create a temporary plan. So \nI am worried about that.\n  All I would say to my colleagues is, let's be sure we have enough \ntime. There is no reason for us to have to\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nvote a week from this Friday on final passage of a 1,000-page bill that \nwe have never even seen the language of yet. The only bill that is out \nthere is last year's fatally flawed bill. Why can't we have this \nopportunity to review the new bill?\n  I have argued we should move dramatically in the way that Canada \nmoved to create a merit-based system for immigration, based on skills \nand abilities, which countries such as Canada or the United States \nwould deem helpful to their nation.\n  If we have 100 people who want to come to our country, and we cannot \naccept 100, we can only accept 50, why wouldn't we set up a system that \nasks them what skills and attributes they have that might be beneficial \nto our country--which would allow them to most flourish and benefit \nfrom the American experience? Why wouldn't we ask that and give \npreference to those who would come here?\n  I say to my colleague, to show the bankruptcy of any idea that we \ncould have open borders, in the year 2000, we had 11 million people \napply for 50,000 diversity lottery slots. We have an amazing situation, \nif you want to come to America, and you do not qualify in any number of \nways, you can put your name in a pot, and each year we draw out 50,000 \nnames. We had 11 million people in 1 year apply for those slots. So why \nwouldn't a merit-based system work?\n  Today, only 20 percent of the immigrants coming into the United \nStates are admitted based on their skills. Canada went through a long \nperiod of discussion about this issue. They had a national discussion \nover some years, and the Parliament in Canada directed their government \nto establish a point-based system. Canada wanted that point-based \nsystem to ensure that 60 percent of the people who come into Canada \ncome on a merit basis. Canada still takes those for humanitarian \nrelief, Canada still takes other immigrants such as those with family \nconnections, but in Canada that is much more limited than in the United \nStates.\n\n  That was their plan. They are very happy with it. I have met with the \nperson who actually runs that program. They are happy with what they \ndid. They think it is something we should consider. They think we would \nbe happy with it. We are hearing discussions that would be a part of \nthis package. What a great step that would be if we would move in that \ndirection. It is critical to me that more immigrants be selected on a \npoint-based system as part of comprehensive immigration reform. It is \nsomething for which I have advocated for some time now and think we \ncould actually get there. I am hearing some good feedback about it. \nBut, once again, we need to read the language of the new bill.\n  I would point out a couple things. One, what I am hearing is the best \nthey would expect to get to would be 40 percent of the immigrants would \nbe coming into our country based on merit, not 60 percent like Canada. \nAustralia also does that, with 60 percent of their immigrants coming \ninto their country on a merit-based, on a point-based system.\n  I am concerned that we will end up with a system that will not be \neffective to move us to a more merit-based system, which would serve \nour long-term national interests and would ensure the people who do \ncome to America come with every prospect and every ability to flourish \nin our country and to do well, and not only not be a drain on our \nmedical system or our welfare system, but actually be prosperous \ntaxpayers contributing to the health and vitality of our Nation.\n  I think I saw Senator Boxer in the Chamber a few moments ago. I will \nwrap up, if she is available, but I do not see her on the floor at this \nmoment. I will share a couple more thoughts I do think are important.\n  Last year, we did not get a final CBO score until 3 months after the \npassage of the bill. The August 18th CBO score estimated the bill would \ncost $126.9 billion for the first 10 years, and that ``beyond 10 years, \ndefinitely the costs would escalate.''\n  That is a major factor in what we are doing, and we have not even, to \nmy knowledge, asked for a score from CBO, and I do not think we can ask \nfor a score. We cannot ask for a score because we do not have bill \nlanguage to say what is going to happen. We do not even know what is in \nthe bill that will be dropped on us.\n  Another issue that was quite contentious last year, and I believe is \nvery important: Will illegal aliens who worked here under a fictitious \nname and fraudulent Social Security number be able to get Social \nSecurity benefits?\n  Last year's bill would have allowed current illegal aliens to get \nSocial Security benefits for the time they worked illegally in the \nUnited States.\n  In addition to the predictable fraud on the Social Security system \nthat would result from this provision--there would be no way you could \nidentify with certainty who paid with what Social Security number if \nyou are using false numbers--this concept is fundamentally unfair to \nthe millions of Americans who rely on Social Security as their main \nform of retirement income.\n  Our Social Security system is already in peril--$6.8 trillion will \nalready have to be invested by Congress today to have enough money to \npay all of the program's promised benefits between 2017 and 2081. So it \nis not a program that is financially sound.\n  To provide millions an opportunity to make a claim to receive Social \nSecurity benefits when they were illegally in the country--utilizing a \nfraudulent Social Security number, illegally taking employment when \nthey were not entitled to it, perhaps taking a job from an American \nworker--to be rewarded with Social Security benefits, I believe, is not \nrequired.\n  Basic law--having handled a number of cases that dealt with it--is \nthat one cannot benefit or go to court to enforce an unlawful contract. \nIf you are a drug dealer, you cannot sue another drug dealer to enforce \na promise to pay for drugs. You should not be able to have a claim \nagainst the Government based on your fraudulent conduct and then go to \ncourt and file a lawsuit to enforce that claim. That is just a basic \nprinciple of law, so any bill that offers a compassionate solution for \nthe illegal alien population should draw the line at allowing those who \ncome to our country illegally, utilizing false Social Security numbers, \nto receive benefits because it is unjust. And, how could you ever \ncalculate that?\n  I will mention one more thing and will wrap up. What about the \nearned-income tax credit? Will that be available to temporary workers \nor illegal aliens given status under the bill?\n  The earned-income tax credit is a benefit designed to assist low-\nincome Americans. I do not believe it should be provided to foreign \nworkers who we invite to perform labor in our economy, whose own choice \nwas to come and work here.\n  The cost estimate released by CBO last August calculated that last \nyear's bill would have increased outlays for refundable tax credits by \n$24.5 billion in the first 10 years because most of these workers are \non wage scale rates that qualify for the earned-income tax credit. It \nwould be the largest direct spending effect in the entire bill.\n\n  Now, the earned income tax credit was a plan conjured up by President \nNixon a number of years ago and has some legitimate basis. Many \npeople--conservatives--like it, and some don't. But it was designed to \nhelp working Americans make extra money so they could take care of \ntheir families. It costs us $40 billion a year. It is one of the \nbiggest programs we have.\n  I see no reason in policy or equity that says if a person comes to \nAmerica to work at a job at a certain wage rate and they would \ngenerally know what that wage rate is before they came, that they ought \nto be given an earned income tax credit, a credit designed to encourage \nAmerican citizens to work. What kind of sense does that make? So we had \na vote on that last year, and the vote was to continue to give this \nbenefit, even to temporary workers.\n  These are some of the issues I think are important. We are going to \ntreat compassionately the people who are here illegally, try to work \nsomething out that is acceptable to them on any reform; we are going to \ntry to do the things that Americans want to do in terms of generous and \nfair treatment to everybody. But we don't need to go overboard and put \nthings in the bill for political correctness or other reasons that \ndon't make common sense, that threaten our Treasury, that could drive \ndown the wages of American workers,\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nthat could increase the flow of workers into our country to a degree \nthat is much larger than we have seen in the past, and that would not \nmove us effectively to a more merit-based system like our neighbors in \nCanada have adopted.\n  Those are some of my concerns. I value and appreciate the hard work \nof the people who are working to try to make a bill come together, but \nI want people to know that it is a scary thing. I think it was the \nChinese who said, in defining crisis, it is a crossing of danger and \nopportunity. Yes, we do have an opportunity to produce a bill that \ncould be far better than last year's bill--a bill we could all support, \nthat could actually work, that we could be proud of. I actually think \nthat is possible. This year's framework for a bill is certainly a lot \nbetter. I am excited about that. But I have to tell my colleagues from \nwhat we are hearing about the language that is actually going into the \nbill, we could have big print rubric letters that promise this and \npromise that, but when you read the fine print, it is not there.\n  We owe the American people an honest, hard study of any legislation \nwe vote on. If that legislation is not produced until next week, even \nif we get an outline of some kind tomorrow, that is not enough time for \nus to study it.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. I sincerely \nhope that a compromise can be reached, and I hope it is one that will \nserve the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after many hours of work behind the scenes \nand with the help of some extraordinary staff which I will talk about \nlater tonight, we have come to the point where we are going to get this \nimportant legislation, the WRDA bill, completed. We are at that point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1145\n\n  (Purpose: To modify certain provisions relating to water resources \n                         development projects)\n\n  Mr. President, I, along with Senator Inhofe, have a managers' \namendment at the desk which has been cleared by all sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to this package of amendments be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  I further ask that upon adoption of this amendment, no further \namendments be in order; that the substitute, as amended, be agreed to; \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time; that upon passage, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio of 6 to 5; and that \nthe vote on passage occur at 5:15 p.m. today, notwithstanding rule XII, \nparagraph 4, with the above occurring without further intervening \naction or debate, with the time until 5:15 equally divided and \ncontrolled between the chair and the ranking member or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1145) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a wonderful moment for me as the \nchair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I have to say \nI wouldn't be at this point without the amazing work of my ranking \nmember, Senator Inhofe. Everyone knows there are times when we don't \nsee eye to eye on certain issues, mostly around the environment. We get \nthat. But when it comes to making sure the infrastructure of this \nNation is where it should be, there is really no daylight between us.\n  I think it is very important to note that both Senators Landrieu and \nVitter were determined to show us their needs for Louisiana, and both \nSenator Inhofe and I are very pleased we were able to work with both of \nthem. We know we haven't met every single need, but we have taken an \nenormous step in that direction.\n  I mentioned the staff earlier, and I want to mention their names--my \nstaff director, Bettina Poirier, and my deputy staff director, Ken \nKopocis, Jeff Rosato, and Tyler Rushforth. On Senator Inhofe's staff, I \nthank Andrew Wheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Angie Giancarlo, and Let Mon Lee. \nAdditionally, I thank Jo-Ellen Darcy and Paul Wilkins with Senator \nBaucus and Mike Quiello with Senator Isakson.\n  This has been a bipartisan endeavor. This has not been easy. Some \nday, when I write my book on how a bill really becomes a law, I will \nlet everyone know what it really takes to get a bill like this done, a \nbill that is 7 years in the making. We need to get it done. Senator \nInhofe and I are going to get into that conference committee with our \ncolleagues, and we are going to iron out the differences and hopefully \nbe back here with the final product.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I agree with the \nstatement made by the chairman of the committee, Senator Boxer. She is \nright, we have had differences in the past. But I can say this: Working \non infrastructure, whether it is the Transportation reauthorization \nbill or the WRDA bill, we work things out. I think we do it the \nresponsible way. We have criteria. We make sure every project out there \nhas a report and meets the criteria. Sometimes it doesn't end up that \nway in conference. We are going to do our very best to have a bill as \nclose to what we have now, when we get to conference, when we get out \nof conference.\n  Let's keep in mind, it has been 7 years since we have had one of \nthese. While some of the numbers look high to people, if we were to \ndiscipline ourselves, which we should--and I think we will work toward \nthat end from now on and have these every 2 years--then that will be a \nmuch better way to get things done.\n  I guess we are into our time, now, aren't we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to yield whatever time the Senator from \nLouisiana would like to use. I have to say he has been very \ncooperative. I know he has gotten the most he could for Louisiana, and \nthat is our job when we come down here. But he has been very \ncooperative in working things out, and I thank him so much for his \ncooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask the Chair to tell me when 3\\1/2\\ minutes elapses, \nand I will wrap up very quickly thereafter to use a maximum of 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this WRDA bill and in \nstrong support of the managers' amendment which is now finalizing the \nSenate version of the bill.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were devastating events on Louisiana. \nEven before those devastating events, any WRDA bill would be enormously \nimportant to us because we live with water resources all around us \nbecause of our coast, which is a vibrant, working coast. But because of \nthe hurricanes, this WRDA bill is even that much more vital in terms of \nour security and our future. Passing this WRDA bill through the Senate \nand hopefully soon on to the President's desk is an enormous step in \nour recovery.\n  I wish to thank everyone who has been so helpful in that step, \nstarting with our chair, Senator Boxer, and our ranking member, Senator \nInhofe. They have been enormously cooperative and enormously helpful. \nAlso, Senators Isakson and Baucus, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, have been very helpful. Our great staff have also \nbeen enormously helpful in this process.\n  Through this bill, we have been able to meet a number of urgent needs \nof Louisiana following the hurricanes. Corps reform is done the right \nway in this bill, particularly for Louisiana,\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nthrough language which I drafted for a Louisiana Water Resources \nCouncil. It will serve as the exclusive peer-review entity for all four \nprojects in the Louisiana hurricane disaster area, and that is a very \npositive, proactive version of Corps reform for Louisiana projects in \nthis bill.\n  The Louisiana coastal area project, our forward-looking coastal \nrestoration program, is fully authorized in this bill. We lose a \nfootball field of land every 38 minutes in Louisiana, and in the \nhorrible days after the two hurricanes, we lost 217 square miles of \nwetlands. Addressing that is authorized in this bill, and many other \nthings, such as repairing our levees to a true 100-year level of flood \nprotection, fixing the outfall canals in New Orleans, replacing the \nflawed I-walls with T-walls, preventing future flooding on the Inner \nHarbor Navigation Canal, the closure and restoration of the Mississippi \nRiver Gulf Outlet, and authorizing the very important Morganza to the \nGulf Hurricane Protection Project. These are all enormously important. \nThat was largely done in committee.\n\n  Here on the floor, I proposed a number of amendments. I worked with \nmy colleague from Louisiana and others, and we adopted a number of \nother important amendments about MRGO to make sure it is closed once \nand for all; clarifying that 100-year standard; eliminating obstacles \nto the renovation of the Industrial Canal Lock; providing credit to \nLafourche Parish for work on their hurricane protection projects; \nauthorizing the first and second phase of coastal restoration; and \ncreating a real integration team for Corps reform.\n  Last, but not least, we just agreed on a crucial amendment to have an \nexpedited process to consider the next generation of projects to \nprovide our area true category 5 protection. That is absolutely \ncrucial. That has been a top priority of mine, and I just finalized \nthat negotiation here off the Senate floor. So I am very excited, \nbecause it is hot off the press, to announce we will have that \nexpedited process to make sure the next generation of protection gets \nexpedited consideration by the Corps and by the Congress.\n  So thanks to all of the leaders who have been so helpful in this \nprocess.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because there is \na very serious situation facing Great Lakes shipping. In Michigan, and \nthroughout the Great Lakes, there is a significant dredging backlog. \nThe corps estimates a backlog of 16 million cubic yards at commercial \nharbors, which has had very real impacts to Michigan shipping. Several \nfreighters have gotten stuck in Great Lakes channels; ships have had to \ncarry reduced loads, and many shipments have simply ceased altogether. \nThis problem stems in part from the way the corps' budget is prepared \nusing performance metrics such as cargo value, tonnage, and ship miles. \nBeginning in fiscal year 2005, the Office of Management and Budget and \nthe Army corps began implementing new budget guidelines and criteria \nfor funding the operation and maintenance of commercial harbors that \nrelied primarily on the amount of tonnage a harbor handles. Although I \ndo not object to using performance metrics, I am concerned that the \nmetrics currently used do not adequately account for the situation at \nsmaller harbors, many with economies that revolve around the harbor. I \nfiled an amendment yesterday that would help address this very serious \nsituation. The amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Voinovich \nand Stabenow, would direct the corps to use all available data relating \nto economic impacts, and to not solely use the tonnage handled by a \nharbor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Michigan \nin sponsoring this amendment because the Great Lakes shipping \ninfrastructure is in peril. Commercial freighters working in the Great \nLakes cannot carry full loads, making for very inefficient water \ntransport, and leading to very real economic consequences, not only for \nthe Great Lakes region, but also for the Nation. The Great Lakes are \nthe waterways that carry the steel for our cars, the coal for our \nelectricity, and the limestone for the construction industry. Light-\nloading vessels increases the prices of these goods and in turn the \ngoods produced from them. It has been reported that in Toledo, what was \nonce a 150-meter-wide channel is now a 30-meter channel. We need to \ncorrect the way the corps budgets for these Great Lakes harbors--the \nbackbone of our Nation's manufacturing economy--so they are not faced \nwith the very real possibility of having to shut down altogether. This \namendment would require the corps to use all available economic data in \nmaking its budget decisions, something that I think all of us should \nsupport.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with the Senators from Michigan and Ohio that the \ncorps needs to address this dredging backlog. I also agree that the \ncorps should make their budget decisions using all economic data \navailable and not based only on an arbitrary tonnage limit. While the \nbill managers were not able to reach an agreement on an amendment, I \nwill work with the Senators to ensure that Great Lakes dredging issues \nare addressed when the bill is in conference.\n  Mr. INHOFE. As I have said before, we have an infrastructure crisis \nin this country. If we do not provide for adequate water transportation \ninfrastructure, we will force even more traffic to our already-clogged \nhighways. I believe we need to provide proper maintenance of our entire \nsystem, including the Great Lakes, not just switch focus from one \ncomponent to another as they begin to fail.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleagues for their recognition of the \ndredging crisis in the Great Lakes. I also thank Senators Boxer and \nInhofe for their support of another amendment that I filed to this \nbill, which is cosponsored by Senators Voinovich and Stabenow, that \nwould direct the Army corps to expedite the operation and maintenance \nof the Great Lakes navigation system. Although that amendment would be \nhelpful to the overall Great Lakes commercial shipping infrastructure, \nI remain concerned that the corps is using budgeting criteria that \nsimply do not reflect the reality of the Great Lakes shipping system. \nThe Great Lakes should not be compared with ports on our coasts. \nTonnage alone should not be the criteria for making budget allocation \ndecisions. We should not have to fight for our smaller ports and \nharbors each and every year. These ports and harbors are of commercial \nimportance with large economic impacts. The corps' use of an arbitrary \n1 million ton cut-off for prioritizing projects is simply unfair. There \nare about 300 harbors in the Great Lakes that handle less than 1 \nmillion tons of cargo per year. Two-thirds of all shipping in the \nUnited States either starts or finishes at small harbors. About half of \nthe Great Lakes corps-authorized harbors are classified as small ports. \nThe amount of cargo handled should not be the sole factor in \ndetermining priority for funding. A small harbor may in fact have a \nmuch greater economic impact on a community than a larger harbor does. \nFor example, Manistee Harbor on Lake Michigan is classified as a \nsmaller harbor by the corps. It handles less than 1 million tons of \ncargo annually; it handles 940,000 tons. Yet, multiple companies rely \non this harbor, including Morton Salt, and there are 600 jobs that rely \non the freighter traffic at Manistee. For a city with a population of \nabout 6,500 people, this translates into about 10 percent of the \npopulation that is economically dependent on this harbor. And yet the \ncorps would classify this as a lower priority project because it \nhandles less than 1 million tons annually. Is that what you understand \nthe Army corps is doing?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, that is correct. That is what they are doing. A \nharbor handling less than 1 million tons, even if it has a large \neconomic impact on the community, would have a lower budget priority \nspecified by the corps because it only handles 940,000 tons. The \namendment that we have filed would help address this inequity by \nrequiring the corps to use all data regarding economic impacts and not \njust tonnage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have a problem that urgently needs to be addressed. The \ncorps is using a budgeting system that does not reflect the reality of \nthe Great Lakes shipping infrastructure. I receive reports on a regular \nbasis of how this dredging crisis is threatening our economy: The Wirt \nStone Dock in Buena Vista Township, MI, reported a reduction of 25 \npercent in shipped tonnage. Tugboats have been needed to\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nturn boats around because channels have not been dredged, at a cost of \n$15,000 to $20,000 each week. After one freighter ran aground at \nSaginaw, MI, last year, the ship's rudder was torn off, and never \nfound.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree that we have a problem here, and I will work with \nyou in conference to address this situation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree that the corps needs to make sure that its \nfunding allocations take into consideration small harbors with large \neconomic impacts. The corps should not develop a budget that is \nunfairly biased against rural communities, and which will have a \ndetrimental effect on small-town, rural America, causing job losses, \nand increased hardship for businesses. We must work to protect our \nNation's shipping infrastructure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Building and \nConstruction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO has added its name to the \nlong list of supporters of this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Building and Construction Trades Department, American \n           Federation of Labor--Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the twelve international unions \n     of the Building and Construction Trades Department, I \n     respectfully urge you to vote in favor of S. 1248, the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA).\n       After seven long years it is time to end the impasse over \n     the passage of a WRDA bill because our nation cannot afford \n     further delay of this desperately needed legislation. Because \n     of the limited opportunities, in an extremely crowded Senate \n     agenda, the time to act is now.\n       We believe the enactment of a robust WRDA bill will enhance \n     the environment, help grow our economy and help ease our \n     Nation's growing congestion problem. Additionally, this bill \n     has tremendous jobs creation potential that will create or \n     sustain thousands of good paying American construction jobs. \n     Studies have proven that for every $1 billion expended on \n     water resources development activities, approximately 40,000 \n     direct and indirect jobs are created.\n       The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 will finally \n     restore the regular process of meeting the nation's water \n     resource needs as they arise. So, we urge you to vote YES for \n     final passage of S. 1248 and we ask Congress to swiftly \n     conference and enact this legislation so that our nation's \n     acute and unmet water infrastructure needs are addressed as \n     soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Edward C. Sullivan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nWater Resources Development Act. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, on which I serve, has been trying--without success--to pass \na WRDA reauthorization since I began service in the U.S. Senate in the \n107th Congress. But I think this year will be the year.\n  This bill includes several provisions that are very important to \nDelaware. First, this bill preserves the St. Georges Bridge over the \nChesapeake and Delaware, or C, Canal. This 14-mile long canal owned \nand maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, divides Delaware in \nhalf, disrupting the flow of people and commerce in my state in order \nto provide a shortcut for ship traffic to the Port of Baltimore.\n  In return for this imposition to Delaware, the Corps is obligated \nunder Federal law to provide sufficient access across that canal. Yet \nin recent years, in spite of population growth that has stretched the \ncapacity of the current bridges, the Corps has sought to reduce the \nnumber of bridges over the C Canal.\n  Thanks to support from chairman and ranking member of the EPW \ncommittee, this will not happen.\n  A second important provision in this bill is a late entry, but needs \nto be addressed immediately. Two scour holes have developed in the \nIndian River Inlet and Bay. One is an 80-foot hole that has developed \nwithin 100 feet of a bulkhead at the U.S. Coast Guard facility. The \nsecond is a 30-foot hole that has formed along a stone revetment that \nis currently protecting several structures recently constructed by the \nState of Delaware. I express my deep thanks to the committee for \nrecognizing the immediacy of this request and making sure it is \naddressed in this bill.\n  There are other important provisions in this bill. Last year, I was \npleased to support vital Corps reform measures that require independent \npeer review of projects, that improve mitigation practices, and that \nupdate the outdated principles and guidelines of the Corps. These \nreforms will result in stronger, more cost-effective projects that \nbetter support our economy and better protect our people.\n  I am very happy to say that these same provisions are included--word \nfor word--in the measure we are considering today. Again, I thank our \nchairman and ranking member for retaining these important provisions.\n  After the lessons we learned in New Orleans, we need to be vigilant. \nWe must continually reevaluate this program and look for the best way \nto better insure the Corps is designing their projects with long term \nneeds of communities in mind. This is why I cosponsored Senators \nFeingold and Kerry's amendment to require the Corps to take into \naccount the impacts of global warming on water resources projects.\n  Shifting gears, let me note that addressing global climate change is \na major priority that drives much of the work I do. Legislation to set \nemissions reductions may be a little ways off. But in the meantime, we \nshould be taking steps to ensure that the people and communities who \ndepend on Corps projects can rest assured that those projects are built \nto withstand the stresses they are likely to face.\n  There is reason to believe that global climate change may lead to \nmore frequent or intense severe weather events. Coastal communities and \nhabitats, especially along the gulf and Atlantic coasts, likely will be \nstressed by increasing sea level and more intense storms. I think of my \nState of Delaware, much of which sits on the Atlantic coast. Delaware \nis on the front lines. We need to take the threat of global warming \nseriously and prepare ourselves accordingly.\n  Frankly, it doesn't matter whether you believe global warming is a \nman-made problem or that we are in a natural warming cycle. The \nevidence is overwhelming that our planet is getting warmer. Climate \nchange will put added pressures on demands for water resources across \nthe country. For example, diminished snow pack, earlier arrival of \nspring, tendency for more precipitation to fall as rain rather than \nsnow, and increased evaporation will affect seasonal availability of \nwater in much of the West. Our water resource projects should be built \nwith that in mind to make sure that we are building the best possible \nprojects to protect our constituents and ensure our nation's continued \neconomic prosperity. This is absolutely as we prepare to face headon \nwhat is likely to be the greatest challenge of our generation.\n  Another important amendment that I have cosponsored will set \npriorities to address the Corps' backlog of projects. Considering \nrecent appropriations for water resources projects--about $2 billion a \nyear--it would take over 35 years just to finish the projects on the \nbooks.\n  Since Hurricane Katrina ravaged the gulf coast in 2005, we better \nunderstand that the system by which we fund water resource projects is \nbroken.\n  In Delaware, due to limited funds and the large number of requests, \nwe have found it a challenge to get important beach replenishment \nprojects funded, even as homes and infrastructure were threatened.\n  Many in this Chamber will recall that we voted on a prioritization \namendment last Congress when we considered WRDA. That amendment failed \nby a large margin. In fact, I voted against the amendment at that time. \nBut our colleagues from Wisconsin and my friend from Arizona heard our \nconcerns and went back to the drawing board.\n  Last year's amendment would have tasked an interagency committee with \nprioritizing the $58 billion backlog. Some people, including myself, \nfelt this was taking power from the legislative branch and giving it to \nthe executive branch. I also feared that projects in a small state like \nDelaware might not get due consideration.\n  This year, Senators Feingold and McCain redrafted the amendment to \naddress a number of the concerns raised in the debate last year.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  The amendment before us today would establish a Water Resources \nCommission. This Commission would have one shot at prioritizing many of \nthe projects in the backlog. The Commission's work would provide a \nguide to Congress to ensure we are spending our limited funding on the \nmost urgent and meritorious projects. Nothing in this amendment binds \nCongress. It is purely informational.\n  Further, this amendment specifically requires the commission to find \na balance between the water resource needs of all States, regardless of \nsize.\n  In closing, let me add that I am delighted that we have taken up this \nimportant legislation so early in this Congress. Again, I commend our \nleaders on the Environment and Public Works Committee for putting such \na high priority on moving this bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nWRDA's passage.\n  I also urge my colleagues to support the global climate change and \nprioritization amendments. These amendments will strengthen the Army \nCorps and improve our constituents' faith in the projects the Corps \nbuilds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this bill \nis long overdue, and I commend Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for \ntheir efforts to pass this bill.\n  There are numerous projects in this bill that are important to each \nState. I would like to take a few moments and highlight what this bill \nmeans to New Mexico and our environment.\n  To begin with, I would like to point out that the projects in this \nthat are related to New Mexico were included, at my request, in the \nWRDA bill we passed in 2006. So the content in this bill should not be \na surprise to any of us and I hope that we can get this bill passed \nquickly.\n  One of the most critical projects contained in this year's WRDA bill \ninvolves New Mexico's Bosque. I have long envisioned the rehabilitation \nand restoration of the Bosque. In fact, I have introduced legislation \nin this Congress that would do just that. However, this bill will allow \nus to implement this vision that concerns this long neglected treasure \nof the Southwest.\n  The Albuquerque metropolitan area is the largest concentration of \npeople in New Mexico. It is also the home to the irreplaceable riparian \nforest which runs through the heart of the city and surrounding towns \nthat is the Bosque. It is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in \nthe Southwest, and one of the last of its kind in the world.\n  Unfortunately, mismanagement, neglect, and the effects of upstream \ndevelopment have severely degraded the Bosque. As a result, public \naccess is problematical and crucial habitat for scores of species is \nthreatened.\n  Yet the Middle Rio Grande Bosque remains one of the most biologically \ndiverse ecosystems in the Southwest. My goal is to restore the Bosque \nand create a space that is open and attractive to the public. I want to \nensure that this extraordinary corridor of the Southwestern desert is \npreserved for generations to come--not only for generations of humans, \nbut for the diverse plant and animal species that reside in the Bosque \nas well.\n  The rehabilitation of this ecosystem leads to greater protection for \nthreatened and endangered species; it means more migratory birds, \nhealthier habitat for fish, and greater numbers of towering cottonwood \ntrees. This project can increase the quality of life for a city while \nassuring the health and stability of an entire ecosystem. Where trash \nis now strewn, paths and trails will run. Where jetty jacks and \ndiscarded rubble lie, cottonwoods will grow. The dead trees and \nunderbrush that threaten devastating fire will be replaced by healthy \ngroves of trees. School children will be able to study and maybe catch \nsight of a bald eagle. The chance to help build a dynamic public space \nlike this does not come around often, and I would like to see Congress \nembrace that chance on this occasion.\n  Having grown up along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, the Bosque is \nsomething I treasure, and I lament the degradation that has occurred. \nBecause of this, I have been involved in Bosque restoration since 1991, \nand I commend the efforts of groups like the Bosque Coalition for the \nwork they have done, and will continue to do, along the river.\n  Another project that is of great importance to New Mexico is the \nSouthwest Valley Flood Control Project. New Mexico is a desert state \nprone to flash flooding during our monsoon season. In order to protect \nour cities we must take proactive steps to ensure that communities are \nprepared in the event of flooding. The Southwest Valley is one such \narea that is subject to flooding from rainfall runoff. Due to \nunfavorable topography, flood waters pond in low lying developed areas \nand cannot drain by gravity flow to the Rio Grande River. This project \nresolves this problem and calls for the construction of detention \nbasins and a pumping station in Albuquerque for flood control in the \nSouthwest Valley.\n  This legislation also has a significant impact on our environment. \nThe Rio Grande Environmental Management Program authorizes the Corps to \naddress environmental restoration and management on the Rio Grande and \nits tributaries through planning, design and construction of habitat \nrehabilitation and enhancement projects and a long term river data \nacquisition and management program. This simple provision establishes a \ncontinuing authority for addressing environmental restoration and \nmanagement on the Rio Grande and its tributaries within the state of \nNew Mexico. This project consists of two main components. The first \ncomponent consists of planning, design and construction of small \nhabitat rehabilitation and enhancement projects and the second \ncomponent calls for a long-term river data acquisition and management \nprogram. The impacts that this project will have on New Mexico will be \ntremendous.\n  Another program outlined in this year's WRDA bill provides authority \nto the Corps to study, adopt, and construct emergency streambank and \nshoreline protection works for protection of public highways and \nbridges, and other public works, and nonprofit public services such as \nchurches, hospitals, and schools. This program provides authority for \nthe Corps to carry out ecosystem restoration and protection projects if \nthe project will improve environmental quality, is in the public \ninterest, and is cost effective. This is a worthy initiative that will \nbenefit the environment throughout the United States.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to help further enhance and protect our \nenvironment through passage of this legislation. I believe that each \nState will benefit once they receive these long overdue project \nauthorizations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are operating under 20 minutes equally \ndivided, although there is more time than that before the vote. I ask \nunanimous consent that we be able to continue our remarks up to the \ntime of the vote at 5:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I don't see Senator Baucus \nhere. He is the chairman of the subcommittee. He did a great job on \nthis. We worked closely together. They called us the big four, the \nchairman and ranking member and the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee. We all worked tirelessly on this. We are all pleased \nwith the product we have.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time is left on my side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 17 seconds, and there is 4 \nminutes 21 seconds on the other side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would love to hear from Senator Isakson \nbecause he has been a champion in assisting us and working on this. We \nare fortunate to have him as ranking member on the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. About an hour and a \nhalf ago, we negotiated our final agreement to make this deal possible. \nChairman Boxer and Senator Inhofe have been indispensable in making \nthis a reality.\n  This bill, as I said last week when the bill came to the floor, is \nnot a spending bill, it is an investment bill. As Senator Vitter \nrecited, regarding Louisiana, it is a meaningful response to the \ntragedy that took place with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Across the \ncountry, projects that have needed to be done, or need to be focused \non, are being authorized. We are finally doing\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nwhat, for 7 consecutive years, Congress failed to do.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation that has been handled \nin a bipartisan fashion. The chairman has been exceedingly fair to \neveryone. The ranking member has worked diligently, and Senator Baucus, \nmyself and the ranking member and the chairman have stuck to the deals \nwe made, which, in this body, is the most important thing of all. I \nacknowledge both of them and offer my appreciation.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Georgia, I thank the Corps of Engineers \nfor what they do for our State and particularly the language in the \nbill that recognizes the possible bi-State port that will be built in \nSouth Carolina, and the multiregional WRDA language for the \nmetropolitan Atlanta-North Georgia Planning District, which is \nessential.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Yesterday morning, I was absent for vote No. 163 on amendment No. \n1090. For the record, I was having a root canal, which is a bad way to \nmiss a vote. I ask unanimous consent to let the record reflect that had \nI been here, I would have voted no, in accordance with my agreement \nwith the chairman and the ranking member.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me make one comment. Something the \nSenator from Georgia said is very important. This is not a spending \nbill, this is an authorization bill. If we didn't have this bill in the \nprocess, then the appropriators, when the bill would come up, would \nhave all kinds of projects that did not go through a process, where we \nwould know if there is local support and so forth. So the conservative \nposition is to authorize these things and, if there is something \nsomebody doesn't like, go after it when the appropriations come.\n  We have a good bill. I thank the chairman for working with us. I know \nthe Senator from Louisiana wants to be heard, also.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 2 seconds. The other side \nis 1 minute 4 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 8 minutes to my colleague from Louisiana. She has \nbeen such a fighter for her State in all this. There isn't a day that \nhas gone by since the very day of the disaster that struck when she \nhasn't come up and told me: Senator, you need to come and see and you \nneed to help. I am so fortunate I am in a position to help, along with \nSenator Inhofe. This is a bill that is so important for her State.\n  I thank Mary Landrieu for all the contributions she has made. I yield \nto her 8 of the 9 minutes I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Senator Boxer is true to her word as a \nleader of this committee. She came down to Louisiana, along with 4 or 5 \nmembers of her committee, about 2 months ago at my request, to not only \nput her feet on the ground but also to get up in the air in a \nhelicopter, if you will, to see the great wetlands and the outline and \ncontours of the levees that protect not only the city of New Orleans \nbut the parishes of Jefferson, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines, and to fly \nas far as we could to the western part of the State and see the entire \nsouthern part of our State, which, in large measure, depends on what \nthis bill does, when it passes and what is in it because, as I have \nsaid many times, if we were talking about a desert bill, we would not \nbe here. But we are talking about a WRDA bill.\n  It may be inconvenient to other States when this bill doesn't pass, \nbut when WRDA doesn't pass for Louisiana, it is life and death. These \nprojects authorize critical protection from Morganza to the gulf, which \nthe President not too long ago threatened to veto. That is in this \nbill, and I don't believe this bill will be vetoed, but Morganza to the \ngulf is in there because of the work of this committee. They know that \nthat project is critical to a large part of southeast Louisiana. We \nalso have in this bill, at the request of myself and Senator Vitter, \nthe closing of MRGO, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, which has been \npart of the problem of the storm surge coming into St. Bernard to New \nOrleans east and parts of Orleans Parish. That is going to be closed \nbecause of the Senator's commitment and the recognition of the terrible \nenvironmental damage that has been caused to our region. In addition, \nthere are many other projects. We do more than haul cargo and move \ncargo back and forth throughout our country, but we move it around the \nworld. We also, as you know, produce a great deal of energy both on \nshore and offshore, and our energy ports contribute. The dredging, the \nchannelization, the building of levees, closure of MRGO, and the \nexpedited process for hurricane 5 levee protection, at my request, is \nin this bill.\n\n  So I appreciate the work of the chairman and the ranking member. Most \nimportantly, 7 years have passed since a WRDA bill came this close to \npassage. I believe, under Senator Boxer's leadership, with Senator \nInhofe's help, and our colleagues on the House side, that we can pass a \nWRDA bill. For Louisiana, it is the largest number of projects we have \never had. Senator Vitter, my colleague, serves on the committee and \ndeserves a great deal of credit for this work. Before Senator Vitter \ngot to the Senate, our office and Senator Breaux's office worked to \nhelp develop a lot of the foundations of this bill. It has been going \non, as you know, for some time. It is a team effort, and it is a \nvictory for Louisiana. There are things we need to improve as we go \nalong, and we will continue to work on that. This project to secure \nsouth Louisiana is a decades' long project. It is stated that the total \ncost could be from $30 billion to $60 billion. Obviously, we are not \ngoing to get that money in this bill. But the authorizations that are \nin this bill for Louisiana coastal restoration and for individual \nprojects are going to go a long way to lay the foundation, and with the \npassage of the Domenici-Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \nlast year, which this Congress passed by an overwhelming vote, \nLouisiana has now an independent source of revenue to direct to these \nprojects.\n  So again, I thank the chair and the ranking member and commend my \ncolleague who serves on this committee for his excellent work. I am \nhappy I was able to contribute as well to the amendments both on the \nfloor, to the building of this bill over 7 years, and to its ultimate \npassage. There are other things we would have liked to have gotten \ndone. We will continue to work on that through the conference \ncommittee.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right, in 3 minutes 17 seconds, I want to say again \nhow happy I am. I am smiling from ear to ear because this has been an \namazing road. I think it is important to note that when we started out, \nwe had a little surprise from the CBO that both Senator Inhofe and I \nwere surprised about--that our last bill had some open-ended language \nthat we didn't realize. We had to make this fiscally responsible. We \ndid.\n  Senator Inhofe is a man of his word. He said these are criteria I \nwant. We have to make sure these projects have studies; that the local \npeople want them and there will be a local match; that they stand up to \nthe light of day. I agreed with him. Once we were able to agree on \nthose criteria, the rest became easy because we had to tell people no, \nbut we did it not on a whim but on a set of criteria that we agreed to.\n  Our staffs have come to know each other very well while working on \nthis. So between the staff and colleagues coming and telling us what \nthey needed, I think we have a bill that meets everybody's needs.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Landrieu for her comments because I \nthink, as we look at this bill, clearly--and there is a lot of talk \nabout priorities--we get our priorities straight. There are amendments \nwe defeated that said we don't like the priorities. This bill looks at \nLouisiana and says you are our priority. That is important. We did it.\n  I wish to thank the groups and organizations outside the Chamber that \nhelped us by writing letters of support and encouraging our colleagues \nto work with us: The American Society of Civil Engineers; the Audubon \nSociety; the Building and Construction Trades; National Waterways \nConference; the National Association of Manufacturers; the American \nFarm Bureau; the National Construction Alliance, made up\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nof the labor union; the National Union of Operating Engineers and \nCarpenters and Joiners; the Associated General Contractors of America.\n  It is rare that you have a bill that garners the support of so many \nfrom across this great country of ours. But it is about making sure \nthat the WRDA infrastructure in this country is up to the task it \nfaces. We have to be ready for whatever hits us by way of floods, \nhurricanes, disasters. We have to be ready for ecosystem restoration \nand all the rest. I left out the corn growers, who supported us also, \nand they sent us a letter. So from the corn growers to the carpenters, \nthis is a bill everybody wants.\n  I hope my colleagues will come over, and I hope we get a huge vote in \nfavor of this bill and we can go into conference, where we will have \nsix Democrats and five Republicans, and we will sit down with our \ncounterparts and bring a product back that everybody can be pleased \nwith.\n  I think we are about ready for the vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired. The \nminority has 1 minute 4 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With 1 minute left, I think it is very important. There \nare a lot of people who didn't get everything they wanted. Every time \nwe pass an authorization bill, whether it is transportation or a WRDA \nbill, if you don't have a lot of people upset, then you didn't do a \nvery good job. We had to shave a lot of places. This sets us up, and \nthis offers us discipline for the appropriation process when it comes \nalong.\n  I say to my good conservative friends, this is the best way to do it, \nso we know when appropriation bills come up, certain things have been \ndone. This is a major accomplishment. We were able to pass this before, \nlast year. We are hoping now we are going to conference, and we can \ncome back with something we can all support. I believe we will.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The substitute amendment (No. 1065), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom North Carolina (Mrs. Dole) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The Senate insists on its amendment, requests a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair is authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of \n6 to 5.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to say to all of my colleagues \nthat this was a wonderful vote tonight, and I think the country will be \nvery grateful because it has been 7 years since we have had a Water \nResources Development Act. We desperately need to keep up the country's \ninfrastructure with our needs, and this bill is a wonderful step in \nthat direction. We are all set to go to conference with the House. I \nhave already had some conversations with Congressman Oberstar. We are \nlooking forward to getting this back and moving forward.\n  Again, to the staffs on both sides, thank you so much. To colleagues \non the committee, thank you very much. To, of course, the ranking \nmember, Senator Inhofe, I want to say again that without his \npartnership we never could have come to this point. I think every State \nin the Union will be grateful because we worked together across party \nlines to achieve something that is 7 years in the making, something \nthat we really needed--this water resources bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, would my distinguished colleague yield?\n  Mr. President, I would like to say thank you to the distinguished \nchair of the Environment and Public Works Committee for all her hard \nwork. Nobody cares more about water resources than the Great Lakes \nStates. I don't know, we may have a rival in California, but certainly \nthe Great Lakes States. We are very grateful for the ability to work \nwith the Senator to do some very positive things and to have such a \nstrong vote on a bipartisan basis, and we appreciate her leadership.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague very much.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there were ever a Senatorial odd couple, \nit is Boxer-Inhofe. But this odd couple has done some tremendous work \nlegislatively. This bill is long in the making. They have worked \nextremely hard, through some very difficult negotiations.\n  I am sorry Mr. Inhofe is not here, but it is a wonderful piece of \nwork, and they both should be very proud of their accomplishments. We \nare going to get this bill to conference as quickly as we can, and I am \nconfident they will be able to work this out very quickly. This is a \nremarkably good piece of legislation. The public should know even odd \ncouples in the Senate can do great things.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I do wish to say, as \nI mentioned before, not only did the principals work well together, but \nthe staffs did as well. I got to know the staff on the other side of \nthe aisle. I really have enjoyed working with them. They are very fair. \nThey represent their boss very well.\n  One thing about the staff across the aisle here is they have respect \nfor each other. They tell each other the way they feel. It is the only \nway to work around here. You are only as good as your word. We had some \ntough moments here.\n  I also wish to thank the floor staff. I don't want to start naming \nnames, but the floor staff on both sides were so helpful, because for \nme, this is my first major bill I ever managed, so clearly I needed a \nlittle direction. I am very fortunate to have all of this support from \nboth sides of the aisle. I will mention Lula and Dave just because I \nhappen to see them in front of me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nWater Resources Development Act, WRDA, of 2007, which authorizes \nimportant water projects for Michigan, the Great Lakes region, and the \nNation. After waiting nearly 7 years since the last WRDA bill was \npassed, I am hopeful that this bill can make its way\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nthrough conference and be signed into law by the President.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nincluded several of my requests in the bill and accepted one of my \namendments. However, I want to emphasize that this is an authorization \nbill. The appropriations that are needed to make these authorized \nprojects a reality lie down the road, and have not yet been secured. \nThe next critical step in realizing these projects is to work to secure \nfunding for these projects, which I intend to do.\n  Included in the WRDA bill is a provision that I filed as an amendment \nto the bill, which could help address a very serious problem facing the \nGreat Lakes shipping infrastructure. Every year, hundreds of millions \nof tons of goods are transported through the Great Lakes waterways, and \ncommunities throughout the Great Lakes are economically tied to \nwaterborne commerce. Unfortunately, however, the Great Lakes shipping \ninfrastructure is threatened by a significant dredging backlog that has \nbeen exacerbated by historically low water levels. The Army Corps of \nEngineers estimates a backlog of 16 million cubic yards at commercial \nharbors, which has had very real impacts to Michigan shipping. Several \nfreighters have gotten stuck in Great Lakes channels; ships have had to \ncarry reduced loads, and many shipments have simply ceased altogether. \nThe WRDA bill works to correct this situation by directing the \nSecretary of the Army to expedite the operation and maintenance, \nincluding dredging, of navigation projects in the Great Lakes.\n  Dredging to the needed depths is critical. According to the Great \nLakes Maritime Task Force, a large freighter loses the carrying \ncapacity of 8,000 tons of cargo for each 1-inch reduction in the load \ndraft. A capacity of 8,000 tons can carry enough steel to produce 6,000 \nautomobiles, enough coal to provide 3 hours of electricity for greater \nDetroit, or enough limestone to build 24 homes. That means that every \ndollar that can go towards maintaining harbors and navigation channels \ntruly matters.\n  Although the navigation provision in the bill could be helpful to the \noverall Great Lakes shipping infrastructure, I remain concerned that \nthe way the Corps of Engineers budgets for dredging projects is unfair \nto Great Lakes navigation projects, especially smaller harbors. \nBeginning in fiscal year 2005, the Office of Management and Budget and \nthe Army Corps began implementing new budget guidelines and criteria \nfor funding the Operation and Maintenance of commercial harbors that \nrelied primarily on the amount of tonnage a harbor handles. I raised \nthe Great Lakes dredging situation with the bill managers, and they \nhave agreed to work with me to address this problem in the conference \ncommittee.\n  The bill also includes a provision that I have been working on for \nmany years: the improvement of Michigan's water and sewage \ninfrastructure. The bill includes $35 million for a statewide \nenvironmental infrastructure project to correct combined sewer \noverflows, which is a major source of pollution in the Great Lakes and \nother waterbodies in Michigan. Combined sewer overflows carry both \nstormwater and sewage, and these can be discharged into streams, \nrivers, and lakes during periods of heavy rains. The $35 million \nprovision in WRDA authorizes the Army Corps to partner with communities \nthroughout Michigan to improve their sewer infrastructure. These \nimprovements would not only benefit communities, but would also help \nprotect our precious water resources.\n  I am also pleased that the bill also authorizes a number of specific \nprojects in Michigan. Of importance, the bill authorizes $20 million \nfor the environmental restoration of Lake St. Clair. In 2005, the Corps \ncompleted a report outlining the steps needed in order to restore Lake \nSt. Clair. This bill authorizes the Corps to implement the 2005 \nrecommendations. The plan was drafted through a collaborative process \nby the stakeholders in the community, which will promote efficiencies \nand save Federal funds.\n  Section 1005 of the bill, which authorizes small projects for \nnavigation, includes six important projects for Michigan. First, the \nCorps is authorized to reconstruct the harbor at Northwestern Michigan \nCollege in Traverse City, MI. The renovated harbor would support the \noperations of the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, our Nation's only \nfreshwater State maritime academy, and vessels associated with the \nprogram, including the federally owned and operated T/S State of \nMichigan. The project would include dredging, construction of an \neastern arm, reconstruction of the inner harbor area, and general site \nimprovements. Second, section 1005 authorizes the Corps to dredge the \nouter channel and inner harbor of Menominee Harbor. Low lake levels, \nwhich have been prevalent in recent years, and present channel depth \nare threatening shipping vessels' ability to make deliveries and load \nat the commercial and industrial sites on the inner channel. This \nauthorization will help support commercial navigation by authorizing \ndredging and other navigation-related projects to accommodate access to \nwarehousing and commercial operations, which have loading docks on the \ninner river channel. The additional depth would benefit deep-draft \ncommercial vessel traffic, which has increased over the years and is \nexpected to continue to increase. Third, section 1005 authorizes the \nCorps to extend and deepen the Ontonagon Channel. The channel extension \nat Ontonagon Harbor is necessary to allow for better access to \nOntonagon's port facilities. Currently, there is only one vessel that \ncan handle the required volume of material for Ontonagon's industrial \ncommunity that will enter the harbor. Other ships have to back into the \nharbor to reach the dock and are unwilling to do so because of the \nprevailing currents at the mouth of the harbor. This authorization can \nhelp protect the vital shipping infrastructure in Ontonagon. Fourth, \nsection 1005 authorizes the Corps to make repairs and improvements to \nthe Sebewaing River. The north bank of the Sebewaing River has \ndeteriorated over the years, which is resulting in excessive \nsedimentation being washed into the river channel from the Saginaw Bay. \nThis project would authorize the repairs, which would result in less \nfrequent dredging being needed. Fifth, this section authorizes the \nCorps to dredge the Au Sable River in the vicinity of Oscoda. This \ndredging is crucial so that boaters have access to local marinas, \nrestaurants, and other businesses. Without this dredging, boaters could \nbe prevented from accessing the river, which would be devastating for \nthe tourism economy. Lastly, this section authorizes the Clinton River \nproject, a navigation project that would decrease the amount of the \ntime it would take boaters to get to Lake St. Clair.\n\n  Section 1006 authorizes a project that would improve the water \nquality and natural habitat of the Clinton River. The project would \nalso examine a means to ``daylight'' the Clinton River under the city \nof Pontiac. In past years, the river was enclosed in a series of \nconduits under the city. By restoring the surface flow through the \ncity, the river ecology can be restored, and economic development on \nthe resulting waterfront be promoted.\n  Section 2037 authorizes the Corps to repair and rehabilitate the \nHamilton Dam, located in the Flint River on the campus of the \nUniversity of Michigan-Flint. Built in 1920, the dam is rapidly \ndeteriorating and the prospect of dam failure and what that would mean \nto those living downstream continues to be a major concern. Authorizing \nthis project is an important first step in making repairs to the dam.\n  Finally, section 4019 of the bill authorizes the Corps to study storm \ndamage reduction and beach erosion protection projects along Lake Erie \nat Luna Pier, MI. The city of Luna Pier lies on the western end of Lake \nErie in Monroe County, MI. The shoreline dike system and beach sills \nthat were installed at Luna Pier continue to deteriorate because they \nare subjected to Lake Erie's severe storms. This study is a first step \nin making the necessary repairs at Luna Pier to provide adequate storm \ndamage reduction, beach erosion protection, and flood prevention.\n  The Great Lakes are one of world's greatest natural resources, so I \nam very pleased that this bill takes some needed actions to protect and \nrestore them.\n  First, the bill includes an extremely important provision to \nauthorize the Corps of Engineers to complete the dispersal barrier in \nthe Chicago Ship and\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nSanitary Canal. In order to prevent aquatic invasive species, such as \nthe Asian carp, from moving between the Mississippi River watershed and \nthe Great Lakes, this dispersal barrier needs to be completed. \nSpecifically, the Corps will be authorized to convert Barrier I into a \npermanent facility, to complete construction of Barrier II, and to \noperate and maintain both dispersal barriers at full Federal cost. The \nCorps is further authorized to study options for hydrologic separation \nwhile maintaining the movement of cargo and recreational vessels so \nthat we can determine what a long-term solution should be.\n  Second, the bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans \nand Sediment Remediation program and the Great Lakes Tributary Models \nProgram. The Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans and Sediment Remediation \nProgram has allowed the Corps to provide technical support to States \nand Remedial Action Plan committees so that the United States can meet \ninternational obligations. Michigan has several communities that \nrequest this assistance from the Corps every year. Using the Great \nLakes Tributary Models Program, the Corps has developed computer models \nto simulate the erosion, transport and deposition of sediments within a \nwatershed, and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of soil \nconservation and other source control measures on the loadings of \nsediments and sediment contaminants to Great Lakes harbors and \nnavigation channels.\n  Next, this bill brings equity to both the John Glenn Great Lakes \nBasin Program and the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration \nProgram so that in-kind contributions count towards the non-Federal \ncost-share requirements of those programs. Further, the bill clarifies \nthat any reconnaissance studies under the Great Lakes Fishery and \nEcosystem Restoration Program are to be performed at Federal expense. \nThis was the original intent when the program was first authorized in \n2000.\n  Lastly, this bill expands the type of beneficial use of dredge \nmaterial projects eligible for inclusion under this authority. Dredging \nimproves and maintains navigation channels in the Great Lakes and is \nused for other purposes such as waterfront construction, utilities \nplacement, and environmental remediation. It only makes sense to use \nthe dredge spoils for beneficial purposes rather than disposing of it \nin the middle of the lakes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I would like to applaud the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, for her excellent work in swiftly bringing the \nWater Resources Development Act to final passage in the Senate. When \nthe Senator from California became chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee at the beginning of the 110th Congress, she \npledged that this important bill would receive Senate consideration as \nquickly as possible. She kept that pledge, and I encourage all \nsupporters of this bill to acknowledge that commitment.\n  During the 109th Congress, those of us who supported swift enactment \nof the Water Resources Development Act met considerable obstacles to \nthat goal. I called upon Senate leadership to schedule this bill in the \nsummer of 2005. Later, my colleague, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBond, and I worked together on a letter, signed by 40 of our \ncolleagues, calling upon Senate leadership to schedule floor time for \nthis bill. Still later, when we were told that 40 was not enough, that \nwe needed 60 signatures, we came back and got 81. Seven months later, \nthe Senate finally scheduled debate, but the final bill was never \nfinished before the 109th Congress adjourned. It has now been 7 years \nsince the last WRDA bill and it is long overdue.\n  This bill provides approximately $2 billion for upgrades to locks and \ndams along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Illinois is the largest \nshipper of corn and soybeans on these rivers and the 70 year old system \nof locks and dams needs to be upgraded to ensure swifter access to \nexport markets--something, by the way, that competitors like Brazil are \ndoing right now. A significant part of competitive agriculture is about \nreducing transportation costs, so if we are to strengthen our \nagriculture markets, we need to strengthen waterway transportation, and \nthat means upgrading these locks and dams.\n  Despite my longstanding support for WRDA, I was unable to cast a vote \non the bill because I was scheduled to give a speech at the time of the \nvote. However, had I been able to vote, I would have supported the \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I voted in support of the Water \nResources Development Act of 2007. While I have concerns about the $15 \nbillion price tag of the Senate bill and Congress' failure to \nprioritize these new projects and the nearly $60 billion of authorized \nbut unconstructed Corps projects, I strongly support the reform \nprovisions in the underlying bill. These reforms are absolutely \nessential for improving the Nation's water resources planning and \nshould be the baseline of reforms coming out of conference.\n  These important reform provisions include independent peer review of \ncostly or controversial Corps projects; dramatic improvements to the \nCorps' mitigation process; modernizing the Corps' woefully out of date \nplanning guidelines; establishing a new national policy that directs \nthe Corps to avoid impacts to floodplains; and requiring an interagency \nassessment of the nation's vulnerability to flood and related storm \ndamage and recommendations to improve the Nation's various flood \nprevention programs.\n  Senator McCain and I have long championed these reforms, and I thank \nhim and his staff for their continued commitment to this important \nissue. I also appreciate the support from my colleagues--and the \ncosponsorship by Senators McCain, Coburn, Carper, Gregg, Sununu, and \nDeMint--for the prioritization amendment that I offered. Prioritization \nis essential to ensure Congress has the information it needs to assess \nthe relative importance of Corps projects. This is not only our fiscal \nresponsibility, but is important to the country's economic development \nand transportation systems, and our ability to protect citizens and \nproperty from natural disasters.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe, Senator Baucus, \nand Senator Isakson reported a WRDA bill that retained the hard-fought \nreforms from last Congress. Through negotiations and a successful \nindependent review amendment on the floor, we took the first step to \nushering in critical reforms to the Corps of Engineers in more than 20 \nyears. As we look ahead to conference, I particularly appreciate \nChairman Boxer's commitment to retain these reforms in conference. I \nthank Chairman Boxer and Majority Leader Reid for joining me in a \ncolloquy to this effect.\n  ``Corps reform'' has been an ongoing effort over the years. Many of \nmy current and former colleagues, staff, and numerous taxpayer and \nenvironmental groups have played a role and I am grateful for all of \nthose efforts. It is my hope that we can honor these efforts and \nrecognize the importance of instituting significant policy changes by \nenacting a final bill that retains the Senate's strong reforms and \nkeeps the cost to the taxpayer at the current level or less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today our nation mourns the loss of Yolanda \nKing, the eldest daughter of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nCoretta Scott King, and the ``first daughter'' of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  Yolanda King's life moved in the stream of American civil rights \nhistory. Born in segregated Montgomery,\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\nAL, in November of 1955, she came into this world only 3 weeks before \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission issued its ban on racial segregation \nin interstate commerce and 2 weeks before Rosa Parks refused to give up \nher seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery. Yolanda was 7 \nyears old when her father, in his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, \nsaid ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in \na Nation where they will not be judged by the color of the skin but by \nthe content of their character.''\n  In a 2004 statement entitled, ``The Meaning of the Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Holiday,'' Coretta Scott King recalled that ``Dr. King once \nsaid that we all have to decide whether we will walk in the light of \ncreative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. Life's \nmost persistent and nagging question . . . is what are you doing for \nothers?''\n  Yolanda led a life that made her family and her Nation proud. She was \nan actress, an author, and a producer. But she also worked in service \nto others. The world will remember her as an activist for peace, an \nardent supporter of nonviolence, and a torchbearer for Dr. King's dream \nof racial harmony.\n  Through her actions, the King family legacy lives on. Like her \nparents, Yolanda inspired a generation of youths to dedicate their \nlives to service.

Mr. President, today I have sought recognition to \ncomment on legislation to increase the authorized spending level for \nthe ongoing consolidation project at the U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, Pittsburgh Healthcare System.\n  In May 2004, then-VA Secretary Anthony Principi announced the final \nresults of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services, CARES, \nplan, a nationwide effort to identify buildings and functions which do \nnot merit continued operation and to create long-term budget \nefficiencies by getting rid of underutilized facilities while improving \naccess to care. As a result of this process, the Highland Drive VA \nMedical Center, VAMC, in Pittsburgh was targeted for closure, and the \nfacility's functions are to be consolidated within Pittsburgh's \nUniversity Drive VAMC and H.J. Heinz VAMC. However, in order for this \nconsolidation to move forward and for the VA to realize the desired \nsavings, significant construction is necessary at the University Drive \nand Heinz campuses.\n  Initial estimates placed the total cost for construction at these two \nfacilities at $189.2 million. I introduced legislation which authorized \nconstruction at this level and have helped secure $102.5 million in \nappropriations towards this effort--$20 million in fiscal year 2004 and \n$82.5 million in fiscal year 2006. I have pushed for Congress to fully \nfund this project in order to avoid cost overruns and to help the VA \nrealize long-term savings which can be used to better serve our \nNation's veterans.\n  Despite the Pittsburgh project being ahead of schedule and ready for \nadditional funding, I was disappointed to see that the administration \ndid not seek funding for any component of the Pittsburgh project in its \nfiscal year 2007 budget request. On February 28, 2006, Senator Rick \nSantorum and I wrote VA Secretary Jim Nicholson a letter seeking \nclarification on VA's future plans for funding the project. According \nto his May 8, 2006, response, ``Funding for construction of the mental \nhealth and research facilities at the University Drive VAMC and the \nambulatory care center at the Heinz VAMC will be incorporated into VA's \nfiscal year 2008 budget request.'' The response also stated, ``. . . \nclosure of the Highland Drive Division will not be accomplished until \nall construction is completed.'' I will ask that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  However, I was disappointed to learn that the VA's fiscal year 2008 \nBudget request indicates that the estimated total cost to complete \nthese projects has risen dramatically to $248 million. Further, the VA \nhas only requested $40 million for these projects in fiscal year 2008, \nwhich would leave $105.5 million remaining to be appropriated to \ncomplete construction. I believe Congress should fully fund this \nproject now in order to avoid additional cost increases in the future.\n  This bill simply raises the authorization to the level indicated by \nthe VA necessary to complete these construction projects. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this technical legislation, which is intended to \nallow the VA to realize the savings envisioned by the 2004 CARES \nprocess on an expedited basis, making more money available for the care \nof our Nation's veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the February 28, 2006, letter Senator \nSantorum and I wrote to Secretary Nicholson and the Secretary's May 8, \n2006 response be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                          Washington, May 8, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n      U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your letter and \n     continued support of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     Pittsburgh Healthcare System Major Construction Project. I \n     regret the delay in this reply.\n       VA planned to fund the consolidation of the Highland Drive \n     psychiatry, mental health, research, and administrative \n     functions within the University Drive and the H. John Heinz \n     VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Pittsburgh over a 3-year period \n     from 2004 through 2007. Planning for this project began in \n     2003. This preplanning led to $35 million being made \n     available in fiscal year (FY) 2005, one year ahead of the \n     initial schedule.\n       This $35 million plus $20 million appropriated in FY 2004 \n     supported design and construction of the 1,500 car parking \n     garage for the University Drive VAMC; demolition of vacant \n     structures at the Heinz VAMC; and master design services and \n     multiple renovation projects to immediately enhance care. \n     These projects are being completed on time and within budget. \n     In FY 2006, $50 million is being used for the construction of \n     the 98-bed residential living center, administration \n     building, and various infrastructure and support facilities \n     at the Heinz VAMC. These projects are also on time and within \n     budget.\n       Funding for construction of the mental health, and research \n     facilities at the University Drive VAMC and the ambulatory \n     care center at the Heinz VAMC will be incorporated into VA's \n     FY 2008 budget request. The project can still be completed \n     with a marginal delay in schedule. As various buildings are \n     completed, services will be gradually relocated; however, \n     full closure of the Highland Drive Division will not be \n     accomplished until all construction is completed.\n       Your assistance and support have been instrumental in \n     ensuring this project remains on schedule and fully funded. A \n     similar letter has been sent to Senator Rick Santorum, who \n     co-signed your inquiry.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     R. James Nicholson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2006.\n     The Hon. R. James Nicholson,\n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Department of Veterans \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Nicholson: We write today with regard to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 \n     budget, particularly with respect to funding levels to \n     support the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services \n     (CARES) recommendations.\n       As you know, the recent VA CARES process closed the \n     Highland Drive VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania. As a result, that facility's psychiatry, mental \n     health, research, and administrative functions are to be \n     consolidated within the University Drive VAMC and the H. John \n     Heinz VAMC in Pittsburgh. VA officials promised Congress that \n     there would be no termination of services at the Highland \n     Drive facility until construction of the new facilities is \n     completed and the transfer of patients from the Highland \n     Drive VAMC to the University Drive VAMC and the Heinz VAMC is \n     completed.\n       Included in the VA Budget Request for FY 2007 is a request \n     for $457 million for the CARES program, which includes \n     funding for the continuation of specific medical facility \n     projects and the funding of new projects. Notably absent from \n     this request is funding for the continuation of the VA CARES \n     construction project within the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare \n     System. We are concerned that any delay of funding for this \n     crucial initiative will negatively impact the construction\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\n     of the Ambulatory Care Center at the Heinz VAMC and the \n     Behavioral Health Pavilion at the University Drive VAMC.\n       It is our understanding that the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare \n     System is currently progressing on schedule and within its \n     budget. Since the Highland Drive VAMC cannot close until the \n     construction on the other facilities is complete, we ask for \n     your clarification on the VA's future plans for construction \n     project funding for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System.\n       Thank you for your attention to this inquiry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Santorum,\n                                                    Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6186-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR TED STEVENS OF ALASKA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on April 13, 2007, my dear friend and \ncolleague Senator Ted Stevens became the longest serving Republican \nSenator in the history of this body. Today, I would like to pay tribute \nto my friend and his more than 38 years of service to our Nation and \nthe people of Alaska.\n  I have known and worked with Ted for over 34 years. We have served \ntogether on the Appropriations, Budget, and Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committees and many others. Ted and I have been in \nthe Senate together for so long some of the committees on which we \nserved no longer exist. We have collaborated on more pieces of \nlegislation than I can remember and worked to resolve many issues. Most \nrecently, I was thankful for his hard work in the effort to open the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge and increase the strategic security of \nthe country.\n  I am happy to say Ted has made the trip to New Mexico and I to Alaska \nso we could appreciate the needs of each other's home States. I have \nalso had the pleasure of taking several trips with Ted abroad, some \nmore enjoyable than others. One that stands out in my mind is the fact-\nfinding trip we took to North Korea several years ago to better \nunderstand the threat that nation poses to the world. I don't believe \nmany people can say they have traveled there, even fewer can say they \ndid it with Ted Stevens. I am very thankful I can.\n  I think it is safe to say Ted has had a remarkable life and career, \nborn in Indianapolis, he has lived in California, Oregon, and Montana--\nfinally settling in his beloved Alaska. During the Second World War, \nTed left college to join the Army Air Corps and became a decorated \npilot. After the war Ted attended Harvard Law School, became a U.S. \nAttorney, worked in the Department of the Interior, started his own law \nfirm, and was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. For most \nindividuals these accomplishments, all before he came to the Senate, \nwould have marked a full and successful life. However, for Ted it was \njust the beginning and I believe this Nation is lucky it was.\n  After serving with Ted for so many years I know of no one who cares \nmore about the people of Alaska and this Nation or serves either with \nmore dedication and distinction. I would like to personally thank Ted \nfor his friendship and hope to have the honor of serving alongside him \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6186-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONGRESSMAN JIM JONTZ\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I note the \nloss of former Congressman Jim Jontz, who died last month after a 2-\nyear battle against colon cancer. All of us, and especially our \nNation's political discourse, are much the poorer for the loss of Jim's \nenergetic voice for progressive politics and his use of grassroots \norganizing to connect people not only to elective politics, but even \nmore important, to the politics of governing--to the art of making our \ngovernment institutions respond and work for the people they serve.\n  Jim's indefatigable, tireless approach to politics put him in the \nIndiana House of Representatives at age 22. He won that race, against \nthe sitting House majority leader, by two votes, which he claimed to \nhave picked up in a laundromat late in the night just hours before the \nelection. He served in the Indiana House for 10 years, then in the \nIndiana Senate for 2 years.\n  Jim was elected to Congress in 1986 and served in the House of \nRepresentatives from 1987 to 1993. A big part of his successful \ncongressional campaign was his call for more effective Federal action \nresponding to the worst economic crisis in American agriculture since \nthe Great Depression. It was typical of Jim that he saw the pervasive \nramifications of the farm crisis as striking at the heart and character \nof rural America. And he fought to turn that situation around.\n  During his time in Congress, Jim emphasized environmental issues, as \nhe had in the Indiana Legislature, including pushing for protection of \nforests in the Pacific Northwest. As a member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee during debate on the 1990 farm bill, he was out front, in \ntruth ahead of his time, in calling for a greater emphasis on promoting \nand supporting more effective agricultural conservation and \nenvironmental practices.\n  As could be expected, some who were beholden to the conventional \nwisdom sought to portray Jim as attacking the very underpinnings of \nU.S. agriculture. Theirs was the politics of division, of contriving \nthreats and sowing fear, but his approach, as usual, was not to deepen \ndivisions but rather to find common ground.\n  In Jim's proposals, stronger Federal policies to help agricultural \nproducers practice better conservation and stewardship would also \nimprove their prospects for making a living and remaining in \nagriculture, while enhancing the environment and quality of life for \ntheir families and others living in rural communities.\n  Looking back from today's vantage point, much of what Jim was \nproposing for the conservation of our Nation's resources is now widely \naccepted as a fundamental part of our Nation's agricultural policy--\nalthough we still have a long way to go to fulfill the vision Jim did \nso much to instill.\n  For a second-term Congressman working on his first farm bill, Jim \nplayed an unusually significant and effective role in the 1990 farm \nbill. Many of his amendments promoting agricultural conservation and \nsustainable agriculture were adopted in the House bill and ultimately \nin the conference report enacted as the Food, Agriculture, Conservation \nand Trade Act of 1990. He also successfully pushed for initiatives \ninvolving packer concentration, grain quality, food aid, agricultural \nresearch and farm income assistance.\n  After leaving Congress, Jim served for several years as the president \nof Americans for Democratic Action, and in recent years served as ADA's \npresident emeritus. In that capacity, he led ADA's Working Families Win \nproject which focused on heightening the profile of fair trade and \nenvironmental issues among presidential and Congressional candidates. \nTrue to his grassroots organizing origins, Jim employed the Working \nFamilies Win project to activate and motivate local efforts on \noutsourcing, minimum wage and health care issues.\n  Jim's untimely death at age 55 leaves a big hole in the leadership of \nAmerica's progressive politics. We should all take inspiration and \ninstruction from this master in the art of deploying grassroots \norganizing and high-minded politics toward the highest ideals and \naspirations for our great Nation.\n  Along with my colleagues, I extend my deepest sympathy and \ncondolences to Jim's mother, stepfather, sister and three nieces, and \nto the many friends and people he touched in his abundant but too short \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6186-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6186-S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that my service in the Senate \nhas been highlighted by my interest in the budget process.\n  As this year's budget negotiations continue, I would like to draw the \nattention of other Senators to a recent editorial in the Wall Street \nJournal concerning the single largest day of tax collection in U.S. \nhistory. The editorial is entitled ``April Revenue Shower.''\n  I think this editorial raises some very interesting points that are \nparticularly relevant as Congress debates the fiscal year 2008 budget \nresolution. The Wall Street Journal points out that in April alone the \nU.S. Government collected $70 billion in tax receipts above the same \nmonth last year and for the current fiscal year tax receipts are up \n11.3 percent or $153 billion from last year. I am not sure if most\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\npeople are aware of the fact that on April 24, 2007, the United States \ncollected a record setting $48.7 billion in tax receipts. I think these \nnumbers are certainly worth our attention.\n  What I find so interesting about these record-breaking tax revenues \nis the fact they were achieved without raising taxes and without a \nFederal budget in place. Rather, the American economy is the driving \nforce behind these windfalls. I would pose the question that maybe; \njust maybe, we should maintain the status quo instead of entering into \nthe budget resolution that is being proposed.\n  I think Congress should think long and hard about these numbers \nbefore we consider making any change to current budget policy. Because \nof these record tax revenues the budget deficit could be slashed in \nmore than half from this same time last year. The deficit could be \nreduced by $150 billion this year, which equates to approximately 1 \npercent of gross domestic product. I believe our current budget policy \nis paying off and in the next 18 to 24 months the deficit could \ncompletely disappear, if we here in Congress do not veer off course.\n  I am not surprised that we are collecting nearly 30 percent more from \nnonwithheld income. Moreover, I also do not find it surprising that \nindividual income tax receipts are up by almost 17.5 percent. I believe \nthat the tax relief that we instituted in 2001 and 2003 is paying large \ndividends and our economy is benefiting.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will consider these facts and not \nattempt to fix something that is not broken. I am simply saying that \nmaybe we should not be rushed into action.\n  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the \nWall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                          April Revenue Shower\n\n       Here's the ``surge'' you aren't reading about: the \n     continuing flood of tax revenue into the federal Treasury. \n     Tax receipts for April were $70 billion above the same month \n     in 2006, and April 24 marked the single biggest day of tax \n     collections in U.S. history, at $48.7 billion, according to \n     the latest Treasury report.\n       The April comparison is slightly askew because the IRS \n     processed more returns than usual this year. But there's no \n     denying that Americans are sending more money than ever to \n     Washington; revenues for the first seven months of fiscal \n     2007 are up 11.3%, or $153 billion. This Beltway bonanza has \n     helped to slash the projected federal budget deficit by more \n     than half from the same point last year. Across the past \n     three Aprils, federal red ink has sunk by nearly $300 \n     billion. The deficit this year could tumble to $150 billion, \n     or an economically trivial 1% of GDP.\n       This revenue boom certainly casts doubt on the political \n     walls about tax loopholes for the rich. So far this year, the \n     taxes paid on so-called nonwithheld income, which are dollars \n     that don't come from normal wages and salaries, have climbed \n     by nearly 30%. This is income largely derived from capital \n     gains, dividends and other investment sources--i.e., the tax \n     rates that President Bush cut in 2003. Individual income \n     taxes are also up by 17.5%--a handsome fiscal dividend from \n     rising wages and low unemployment.\n       In other good news, the pace of federal spending, which was \n     pedal-to-the-metal in Mr. Bush's first term, has finally \n     decelerated. So far this year federal outlays have climbed by \n     3%, and, save for Medicare and Medicaid, federal expenditures \n     are nearly flat from 2006. Spending will climb again once the \n     Iraq supplemental passes, and revenues can't keep rising at a \n     double digit pace forever.\n       Still, you'd think this dramatic fiscal turnaround would \n     cheer up Capitol Hill. Instead, Congressional Democrats seem \n     to live in a parallel universe--one that they claim is \n     starved for revenues, with a runaway deficit, and is \n     dominated by the rich who pay no taxes at all. The reality is \n     that the wealthy are financing Democratic spending ambitions, \n     and the deficit could easily vanish within a year or two if \n     Congress has the good sense to leave current tax policy in \n     place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6187-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wish today, on National Police Week, to \nhonor this Nation's law enforcement officers. Our law enforcement \nofficers are some of the bravest men and women we will ever come \nacross. They selflessly dedicate their lives to keeping our communities \nsafe and taking dangerous individuals off our streets.\n  Tragically, some of those officers lose their lives while on duty. \nThe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial currently bears the \nnames of more than 17,500 officers who have been killed or died while \non duty. This week, 382 additional names will be added. Two of those \nfallen officers are from my home State of Wisconsin.\n  Jackie Ryden dedicated his life to law enforcement, spending 33 years \nwith the Ellsworth Police Department, the Pierce County Sheriff's \nDepartment, and the Prescott Police Department. He was a well-liked and \nwell-respected member of the police force, as well as his community.\n  On September 2, 2006, Jackie responded to a natural gas explosion and \nthe resulting fire. He helped to evacuate a number of local citizens \nfrom their homes. Shortly after Officer Ryden returned to his patrol \ncar to help direct traffic, he suffered a heart attack and died. \nAccording to those who knew him best, he passed away doing what he \nloved best--serving and protecting his community. Jackie Ryden is \nsurvived by his wife, two children, and three grandchildren.\n  The second officer whom I seek to honor today is Stephen Hahn. \nStephen was a special deputy with the Eau Claire County Sheriff's \nOffice, serving approximately 40 years in law enforcement. Mr. Hahn was \nkilled in a traffic accident while transporting an inmate. A vehicle \nheading in the opposite direction lost control and struck the van being \ndriven by Deputy Hahn. He is survived by his wife and two children.\n  We mourn the loss of these two great, brave men and attempt to honor \nthem by recognizing the sacrifices they made for the benefit of others. \nBoth of their communities, and the State of Wisconsin as a whole, are \nworse off because of the loss of these two public safety officers. I am \npleased, however, that their names are being added to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial, so they can forever be remembered for \ntheir hard work and dedication to improving the lives of those around \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6187-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6187-S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I missed today's votes on Iraq because I \nwas attending the college graduation of my daughter, Elizabeth.\n  But I want to express my unqualified support for the amendment \noffered by my colleagues, Senator Feingold and Senator Reid.\n  This amendment says that our entanglement in another country's civil \nwar has gone on long enough.\n  This amendment says that Congress must stop playing the role of \nspectator and start standing up for our over-taxed and inadequately \nprotected troops.\n  This amendment says we must stand up for their families.\n  This amendment says that we have an obligation to support our men and \nwomen in uniform, not only by funding them, but by bringing them home.\n  The funding for our troops is assured, whether they are deployed in \nIraq or redeployed from Iraq.\n  This amendment calls for their redeployment.\n  Those who claim this amendment would cut off funding for our troops \nare actually saying that the President, if required to redeploy our \ntroops, would instead cut off their funding.\n  I may not see eye to eye with our President, but I don't believe him \ncapable of that.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n  The Feingold-Reid amendment says ``enough is enough.''\n  A majority of Americans want our troops to come home.

It is not swayed by inflammatory rhetoric \nor false accusations.\n  In the case of Iraq, patriotism does not mean blindly following the \ncurrent path, it means carving out the right one.\n  Bringing our troops home is an act of patriotism. The Feingold-Reid \namendment is an act of patriotism, and I fully support its intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6188-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNIZING JANET TURCOTTE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize Janet \nTurcotte, of Bowie, MD, for her courageous efforts to raise awareness \nof colon cancer and promote screening. Janet was first diagnosed with \nStage IV colorectal cancer 4 years ago at age 53, and she is currently \nbattling her third recurrence of the disease. I met Janet in March when \nshe came to my office on behalf of C3, the Colorectal Cancer Coalition. \nC3 is a national organization whose mission is to eliminate suffering \nand death due to colorectal cancer. Janet has joined the coalition in \nits push for ``more research to improve screening, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of colorectal cancer; for policy decisions that make the most \neffective colorectal cancer prevention and treatment available for all; \nand for increased awareness that colorectal cancer is preventable, \ntreatable, and beatable.''\n  Last year, Janet Turcotte brought her fight against colorectal cancer \nto a new venue, the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. The \nPreakness is the second and shortest leg of horse racing's prestigious \nTriple Crown, being preceded by the Kentucky Derby and followed by the \nBelmont Stakes. The race was inaugurated in 1873 for 3 year-old \nthoroughbreds, and its l32nd running will be held this coming Saturday, \nMay 19 in Baltimore, MD. Janet has embroidered the saddlecloths for \nthoroughbreds at the annual race for over 2 decades. Last May, she \nadded the colorectal cancer ``Blue Star of Hope'' to the saddlecloths \nof the 11 contenders. Pimlico Race Course will again support Janet's \nefforts to fight colorectal cancer this coming weekend. More than 17 \nmillion people will view this weekend's race and her efforts will make \na true difference in raising awareness. Of the millions of viewers, \nit's estimated that nearly 1 million of them are at risk for developing \nthe disease. Janet, along with race course officials, hopes that this \nsymbol will encourage early screening and detection of colorectal \ncancer.\n  Janet's message is an urgent and important one. In 2006 alone, \naccording to the American Cancer Society, more than 150,000 new cases \nwere diagnosed and more than 50,000 Americans died from colon cancer. \nIn my own State of Maryland, nearly 1,000 people lost their lives to \nthis disease last year. What many people are not as aware of is that \ncolon, cancer is preventable with appropriate screening, highly \ndetectable, and curable if found early.\n  This past April, I introduced the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act of \n2007 along with my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Graham. This bill would help eliminate the barriers that \ncurrently exist under Medicare for colorectal cancer screening and \nincrease the number of seniors who receive this potentially lifesaving \nbenefit. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nif everyone age 50 and older were screened regularly, as many as 60 \npercent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented. When \ncolorectal cancer is found early and treated, the 5-year survival rate \nis greater than 90 percent. With the number of lives at stake, the \nefforts of Janet Turcotte and other brave survivors deserve special \nrecognition. As Janet has said, ``As the thoroughbreds carry this \nsymbol in the race to the finish line, I can only hope that through \nawareness and prevention, we too can win the race against colorectal \ncancer.'' I wish Janet Turcotte all the best on Saturday and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in commending her for this important \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6188-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CIVIC EDUCATION IN IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \ndedicated efforts of the students at Orofino High School who came to \nWashington to represent Idaho in the finals of the annual We the \nPeople: The Citizen and the Constitution Program.\n  The national finals include a hearing which gives the students the \nopportunity to apply their specialized learning in history, social \nstudies, government, and civics during ``testimony'' before a panel of \njudges. As they use their newly gained knowledge of the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights to examine, counter, and defend issues facing \nAmerica today, students come to appreciate the timeless nature of this \ngreat document. This experience gives young people the opportunity to \napply civic values to real-life challenges and serves them in whatever \nthey choose to do after they graduate from high school.\n  Orofino High School was excellently represented by Jennifer Cluck, \nJustin Haag, Gary Hardin, George Korbel, Nathan LeBaron, Ryan Lundgren, \nMadison Morrow, Eric Petersen, Jessica Robbeloth, Ashley Roshitsh, \nCapri Savage, Kelsey Stemrich, and Bret Zender.\n  Cindy Wilson, the teacher who prepared these exceptional students, \ndeserves recognition for her tremendous efforts. Also worthy of special \nrecognition is Peter Kavouras, the State coordinator, who is among \nthose responsible for implementing the We the People Program in my \nState.\n  Idahoans can be proud of the growth of civic virtue in their young \npeople. As they look beyond themselves to the realm of the public good, \nIdaho and America will benefit as these individuals develop into \nresponsible, intelligent citizens who practice discernment in judgment \nin matters of concern to our State and Nation. In the future, these \nstudent citizens will be more inclined to exhibit leadership faithful \nto the ideals upon which our country was built and consonant with the \nnotions of liberty, freedom, justice, and rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6188-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CANNON AIR FORCE BASE, NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the \nimportance of Cannon Air Force Base, NM.\n  Cannon Air Force Base's primary mission is an F-16 fighter wing able \nto perform day or night operations. However, the base is currently \nundergoing an exciting transition to be an Air Force special operations \nbase. I am excited about this mission and the work that will be done in \neastern New Mexico, but with every new mission, we must also remember \nprior missions.\n  Today I want to commemorate the last mission of the 27th Fighter \nWing's 523rd Fighter Squadron, which was flown on May 10, 2007, as the \n523rd is being deactivated in preparation for Cannon's new mission.\n  The 523rd Fighter Squadron has a unique history that dates back to \nwell before their time in New Mexico. It was established on February 1, \n1940, as a bombardment squadron with B-18s. The squadron arrived at \nCannon in 1959. One of its missions from Cannon came after September \n11, 2001, when the 523rd flew 24-hour-per-day operations in defense of \nour Nation.\n  This fighter squadron will not be the last to leave Cannon Air Force \nBase, as other departures are expected in this summer and fall as well \nas next spring. However, the 523rd Fighter Squadron has long been a \nvital part of our Nation's defense as well as Cannon's 27th Fighter \nWing, and I am proud of all of the men and women who have served in the \n523rd.\n  Today I want to honor them, as well as all of the men and women who \nhave served at Cannon Air Force Base. I am proud New Mexico has been \nhome to so many outstanding individuals, and I look forward to working \nwith more such soldiers as Cannon Air Force Base transitions to an Air \nForce special operations base in October.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6188-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6188-S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF PHIL B. CURLS, SR.\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the life of Phil Curls, a much-loved member of the \nKansas City community. With his passing, Phil has left a legacy of \npublic service that will always be cherished, but Kansas City will not \nbe the same without him.\n  During his life, Phil was an integral member of the Kansas City \ncommunity and was considered by many to be a local patriarch. Phil \nalways cared deeply about others, whether it was his family, a \npolitical cause, or mentoring young leaders through Freedom, Inc.\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\n  Phil was a graduate of DeLaSalle High School and earned a bachelor's \ndegree in business administration from Rockhurst College. He served 11 \nyears in the Missouri House and 16 years in the State Senate before \nretiring in 1998.\n  I had the distinct honor of serving with Phil in the Missouri General \nAssembly, where his tenure was marked by excellence and community \ninvolvement and where I learned important lessons about public \nleadership from him. Phil was always regarded highly by everyone he \ninteracted with, including his contemporaries as well as older and \nyounger politicians. Through his public service, Phil helped to shape \nthe course that the city and State has taken.\n  Phil was deeply involved in Freedom, Inc., making sure the community \nhe loved had the political power necessary to bring about positive \nchange. In addition to Freedom, Inc., Phil was involved in so many \norganizations and had so many achievements and awards that it would be \nvery difficult to list them all. I can, however, state with total \ncertainty that Phil left a permanent mark on Kansas City and will be \nfondly remembered and dearly missed.\n  With Phil's passing, we have lost a prolific public servant and a \npassionate individual. I will miss him as a close friend. Phil is \nsurvived by his wife of 43 years, Councilwoman Melba Curls; daughter \nMonica; sons Phil II, Michael, Quincy and Louis; four grandchildren; \nand a large extended family.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring the life and \nlegacy of Phil B.

Mr. President, from April 28-30, 2007, more \nthan 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, DC to \ntake part in the National Finals of the We the People: The Citizen and \nthe Constitution competition. Administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department \nof Education by Act of Congress, and is an innovative national \neducational program developed to educate young people about the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights.\n  Sixteen outstanding students from West Anchorage High School of \nAnchorage, AK, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won \ntheir statewide competition and earned the chance to come to \nWashington, DC, and compete at the national level. I am proud to \nannounce that these talented young people won the Region One: Western \nStates Award at this prestigious national event. The regional awards \nare presented to one class from each of the five geographic regions \nthat has the highest cumulative score during the first 2 days of \ncompetition.\n  While in Washington, the students participated in a 3-day academic \ncompetition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they \n``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they \nevaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues.\n  The We the People competition is a rigorous program and students \nenter prepared to answer tough questions, some of which Americans have \nbeen debating since the Constitution was ratified. For example, \nparticipants in this year's competition were asked to evaluate the \nfollowing constitutional principles: States rights--Evaluate the \nproposal in the Virginia Plan to give Congress the power to strike down \nstate laws that it considered to be in violation of the national \nconstitution or of the national interest; The rights of the \nindividual--Evaluate the anti-Federalist argument that a bill of rights \nis as necessary to defend an individual against the majority in a \nrepublic as against the king in a monarchy; equal protection--How, if \nat all, is the concept of equal protection of the laws related to the \nnatural rights philosophy and the idea of a social contract? America's \nrole as an example to other countries--Which aspects of American \nconstitutional democracy have been the most influential in other \ncountries?\n  I am so proud to recognize the outstanding students from West \nAnchorage High School, this year's We the People Region One winners:\n  Kristin Baylon, Justin Birchell, Kathryn Braden, Chloe Cotton, Taylor \nEvenson, Emmaus Finau, Colby Gerik, Matthew Legacki, Elyse Lindsay, \nPatrick Marcil, Sara Perman, Molly Quinn, Leyna Rynearson, Henrik \nStrand, Chandra Suriano, and Brianna Thompson.\n  I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Pamela Orme, who is \nresponsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the \nNational Finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Maida Buckley, \nthe state coordinator, and Todd Heuston, the district coordinator, who \nare among those responsible for implementing the We the People program \nin Alaska.\n  I congratulate these students on their exceptional achievement at the \nWe the People National Finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6189-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING ISADORE ERWIN MILLSTONE\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing Isadore Erwin ``I.E.'' Millstone of Saint Louis, MO. It is \nan honor to celebrate I.E.'s centennial birthday and to pay tribute to \nall that he has accomplished in his 100 years. Through his business and \nphilanthropic interests, Mr. Millstone has helped shape the course of \nthe city of Saint Louis over the past century.\n  Born on January 6, 1907, in North Saint Louis, I.E. graduated from \nSoldan High School in 1923. He then continued his education at \nWashington University in St. Louis, studying architecture and \nengineering, and graduating in 1927.\n  During his life, I.E. has been an integral member and patriarch of \nthe Saint Louis community. He is a life member of the United Hebrew \nCongregation in Saint Louis, where he earned money as a child checking \nhats and coats, and served as global president of the World Federation \nof YMHA's and Jewish Community Centers Association.\n  Following the Great Depression, I.E. formed Millstone Construction \nCompany with his wife and became involved in the creation of many \nlandmarks throughout the Saint Louis area--due in part to his \nrevolutionary use of reinforced concrete. These projects include the \nold Busch Stadium, Highway 40, and the Jewish Community center in Creve \nCoeur. As the city is being redeveloped, both the old Busch Stadium and \nHighway 40 are being transformed to serve a new generation, but the \noriginal structures are forever a part of the city's history.\n  A giant among men, I.E. demonstrates a passion that does not lie \nsolely in building Saint Louis from a physical standpoint. As a \ndedicated philanthropist, I.E. has supported many causes, including \nfunding a program to support nearly 60 scholarships at Washington \nUniversity in St. Louis. His dedication to helping others, however, is \nnot limited to the Saint Louis area. Following World War II, I.E. \njoined a small group of builders to help the new State of Israel \nconstruct emergency housing for thousands of immigrants, many of whom \nwere Holocaust survivors.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring I.E. \nMillstone for 100 years of dedicated service to Saint Louis and to the \nworld. I am proud to recognize this extraordinary Missourian and wish \nhim many more healthy and happy years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6189-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6189-S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING LYMAN MORSE BOATBUILDING\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize for the \nweek of May 13 an outstanding small business from my home State of \nMaine that has not only succeeded in manufacturing a product of great \nquality, but has also made its facilities environmentally friendly and \nenergy efficient. Lyman Morse Boatbuilding of Thomaston, ME has \nproduced boats for over 100 years. Noted for their expert craftsmanship \nand storied history, Lyman Morse has a proven track record of quality \nand success. In their great spirit of innovation, Lyman Morse will be \nunveiling, on May 26, a ``green''--or energy efficient--boat-building \nfacility, and I want to take this opportunity to commend them for this \nfabulous attempt at conservation.\n  Lyman Morse's new ``green'' building is a temperature-controlled \nfacility\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nthat is designed for the construction and service of large yachts. \nCompleted in less than a year, the building is 140 feet long, 160 feet \nwide, and stands 55 feet high. What is particularly remarkable is that \nheat generated on the building's roof from the sun can be absorbed and \nused as energy for the building--a truly impressive feat in efficiency. \nWhile the new ``green'' building will be Lyman Morse's largest, it will \nalso be their most energy efficient, proving that conservation does not \nhave to hamper effectiveness.\n  To construct its new facility, I would like to point out that Lyman \nMorse took advantage of a tax deduction for energy efficient commercial \nbuildings Congress enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and \nextended in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Congress should \nheed the example of Lyman Morse, because by incorporating ``green'' \nbuilding practices, we can reduce energy consumption, increase \nprofitability--and create more jobs.\n  While Lyman Morse Boatbuilding follows in the historic tradition of \nNew England boat building, particularly that of Midcoast Maine, I am so \npleased that it has decided to take advantage of modern technology to \nbe environmentally responsible. In fact, Lyman Morse has been a \nterrific corporate citizen for many years. I want to point out that in \nJanuary 2006, the State of Maine declared Lyman Morse Boatbuilding a \nMaine Clean Boatyard and Marina. A program designed to help preserve \nand improve natural resources while reducing pollution, the Maine Clean \nBoatyard and Marinas Program is a partnership of industry, state and \nfederal agencies, and environmental organizations dedicated to \npromoting best management practices in boatyards and marinas. \nParticipants must exceed Federal and State environmental compliance \nstandards to achieve designation. It is their commitment to \nenvironmental safety and energy efficiency, combined with their \nimpressive and trustworthy labor, that makes Lyman Morse a truly \nspecial Maine business and worthy of this recognition.\n  I wish Lyman Morse all the best for the grand opening of their \nbuilding. It is always inspiring to see examples of good stewards of \nthe environment in Maine, a state that has always appreciated the \nimportance of nature in our everyday lives. Their willingness to \nprotect the one environment that we have is a beautiful example to all \nof us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6190-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6190-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6190-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 634.

BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1408. A bill improve quality in health care by providing \nincentives for adoption of modern information technology; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the evidence showing the ability of \nhealth IT to reduce costs and improve quality of care is simply \noverwhelming.\n  That is why Senator Olympia Snowe and I are reintroducing our Health-\nTech legislation to accelerate the adoption of health information \ntechnology.\n  Businesses across the country are struggling to remain competitive in \na global market with skyrocketing health care costs.\n  The use of electronic medical records could save more than $80 \nbillion annually, reducing costs for businesses and taxpayers alike. We \nshould be putting these systems in place immediately!\n  And, despite the best doctors, nurses, hospitals, and other health \ncare providers in the world, some patients just are not getting the \ncare they need.\n  Often times that is because our health care providers do not have the \ninformation they need about their patients, when they need it and where \nthey need it.\n  And, our health care system are not current1y set up to prevent \nerrors; the most common medical errors include medication errors and \nthe extra costs of treating drug-related injuries amount to at least \n$3.5 billion a year.\n  As compelling as the cost savings is the promise health IT holds for \nimproving the quality of our health care system.\n  Getting health IT into the hands of our doctors, hospitals, nursing \nhomes and community clinics will mean patients get the care they need, \nat the right time, and in the best setting.\n  The value of health IT--saving lives and saving money--is well-known.\n  So why is it not being used more widely?\n  Health care providers are struggling to keep up with their daily \nneeds; a major barrier to widespread use of IT is the initial \ninvestment cost.\n  The costs of implementing health IT can be staggering.\n  For example, the cost of an integrated electronic health record \nsystem for a three- to six-member physician practice is estimated to be \n$70,000-$100,000.\n  And, the savings from using health IT go primarily to the patients, \nemployers, and insurers, not the providers.\n  If a patient needs one less x-ray because a hospital can pull up the \nx-ray performed by a radiologist in a different setting, that is one \nless co-payment for the patient, and one less bill to the patient's \nemployer or insurer, or to the Medicare program.\n  It only makes sense for the Federal Government to invest some seed \nmoney.\n  Every day we delay providing Federal dollars, we delay getting health \ninformation technology systems in place, and businesses, taxpayers and \npatients pay in both dollars and lives.\n  The bill that Senator Snowe and I are reintroducing today would \naddress just that: It would put IT systems in the hands of providers by \nestablishing a 5-year, $4 billion grant program for health care \nproviders and by providing tax incentives and adjusting Medicare \npayments for providers who use these systems.\n  The bill will be referred to the Finance Committee; Senator Snowe and \nI are both members of the committee and will work to include our \nlegislation in any appropriate package the committee considers.\n  We have made an important change to our bill this Congress.\n  A patient's right to health information privacy is paramount, and is \nessential to the health care provider-patient relationship.\n  Therefore we have added a requirement that health IT systems funded \nby our legislation ensure the privacy and security of personal medical \ninformation, and that patients be informed if there is a breach in the \nprivacy of their medical record.\n  We need to get this done. Widespread use of health information \ntechnology can revolutionize our health care system. Getting systems \ninto the hands of providers is the first step.\n  Our legislation has the support of many consumer, provider, labor and \nbusiness groups including: AFL-CIO, Altarum, American Academy of \nPediatrics, American College of Cardiology, American College of \nEmergency Physicians, American College of Physicians, American Health \nCare Association, American Heart Association, American Society of \nHealth-System Pharmacists, Ascension Health, Automation Alley, \nBlueCross/BlueShield of Michigan, DaimlerChrysler, Detroit Medical \nCenter, e-Health Initiative, Families USA, Federation of American \nHospitals, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, Greenway \nMedical Technologies, Healthcare Information and Management Systems \nSociety (HIMSS), HR Policy Association, IBM, Marquette General Health \nSystem, McLaren Health Care Corporation, Michigan Health and Hospital \nAssociation, Michigan State Medical Society, National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, National Association of Community Health Centers, \nNational Business Coalition on Health, National Business Group on \nHealth, National Partnership for Women and Families, National Rural \nHealth Association, Oracle, Saint John Health, Saint Joseph Mercy \nHealth System--Ann Arbor, Michigan; Saint Joseph Mercy Oakland--\nPontiac, Michigan; Saint Mary's Health Care--Grand Rapids, Michigan and \nTrinity Health.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Stabenow of \nMichigan, in introducing the Health Information Technology Act of 2007, \nwhich will serve to improve the quality of health care through \nimplementation of information technology, IT, in hospitals, health \ncenters and physician practices throughout the country. Our legislation \nis necessary because as a nation we face two stark problems.\n  The first of these is a serious patient-safety problem. Indeed if \nmost Americans were told today that 98,000 lives were lost needlessly \nlast year and a cure was available they would undoubtedly call for \naction. Yet the Institute of Medicine, IOM, has reported that medical \nerrors inflict that toll every\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nyear, and we have the technology at our disposal to dramatically reduce \nthose deaths.\n  The good news is that solutions exist. We have the technological \nability to dramatically reduce medical errors and thus save lives. Many \nof us have heard about how drug interactions can be avoided by software \nsystems which check a patient's prescriptions for hazards. Yet there \nare so many other applications which can improve health. For example, \nby reviewing and analyzing information, a health provider can help a \npatient better manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart \ndisease, and avoid adverse outcomes.\n  Our second major problem is the escalating cost of health care. Our \nhealth spending now comprises 16 percent of GNP, and the price of \ncoverage has grown so high that the number of Americans without health \ninsurance reached nearly 47 million last year. Those trends are \nthreatening our economic competitiveness in the world and each \nAmerican's health security as well. The answer is not to simply expand \ncoverage, because on our current trajectory, escalating costs would \nsimply erode our ability to provide care. It is clear that some \nfundamental changes must be made in health care.\n  One of those changes must be the application of modern data \ntechnology to save lives and reduce costs. Indeed consider the savings \nwhen a physician can locate information efficiently. Tests do not have \nto be repeated and data is not delayed. In fact, a patient may obtain \nfaster, higher quality care when, for example, multiple practitioners \ncan review diagnostic test results right at their desktops. In an age \nwhere millions of Americans share family pictures over the internet in \nseconds, is it not long past time that a physician should be able to \nretrieve an x-ray just as easily?\n  The President certainly recognizes the disparity in technology in \nhealth versus other parts of our economy. He has declared a goal for \nevery American to have an electronic medical record within ten years. I \nconcur, we need this and more. In fact, once that record is in place we \ncan do so many things better. From preventing drug interactions, to \nmanaging chronic diseases, to simply helping providers operate more \nefficiently. Most of us have been told at one time or another, ``we're \nwaiting to get the test results mailed,'' or ``we're still waiting for \nyour chart.'' Health care is one of the last bastions of such \ninefficiency. Indeed it is often easier to track the service history on \none's automobile than to see your own health history.\n  The bad news is that the cost of new systems and a lack of standards \nhave prevented us from reaping the benefits of new technologies. The \nPresident has made technology implementation a priority, and there is \nno doubt that a lack of standards has played a role in slowing IT \nadoption by many health care providers. One must know that a system \npurchased will be compatible with others, and that, no matter what may \nhappen in the future to a vendor, the huge investment one makes in \nbuilding an electronic medical records would not be lost. In other \nwords, your system must be able to communicate with other systems, and \nyour investment in building electronic medical records must be \npreserved. So when a patient moves, their electronic ``chart'' should \nbe able to move right along with them, and their continuity of care \nshouldn't be interrupted.\n\n  Yet standards alone aren't enough. Today many providers are \nstruggling to make these investments, and for those which serve \nbeneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP, it can be exceedingly \ndifficult. Our physicians, for example, have seen recent Medicare \npayment updates which have not even kept pace with inflation . . . and \nat the same time some expect that they will make a major investment in \nhealth IT.\n  The failure of that logic is clear because we know where the benefits \nare realized. The benefits to patients are evident, in fewer delays, in \nbetter outcome, lives saved. Health IT reduces costs as well, but \nprimarily to those who pay for services, not to providers. Indeed it \nhas been estimated that 89 percent of cost savings accrue to those who \npay for services. It should be obvious then that the Federal Government \nwould invest in health IT to reduce its expenditures on Medicare, \nMedicaid and SCHIP.\n  That is precisely what this legislation would do. Because as we look \nto the many studies and reports on health IT, one thing is clear. The \nannual cost savings actually exceeds the price of implementation. With \nthat kind of return, it is indisputable that the Federal Government \nmust employ health IT to see not only the savings in lives, but also \nbetter management of health care spending.\n  This legislation does that by providing grants to spur adoption among \nphysicians, hospitals, long term care facilities, and both federally \nqualified health centers and community mental health centers. These \ngrants are targeted to help provide the health IT resources providers \nneed to serve our Federal beneficiaries. In fact, the size of an \nallowable grant for each provider is keyed to the proportion of the \npatient care which they deliver to Federal beneficiaries. So we will \nhelp these providers deliver better care to those on Medicare, Medicaid \nand SCHIP . . . while working to see costs reduced in those programs. \nThat is simple common sense.\n  The legislation supports reasonable expenditures for a variety of \nexpenses required to implement health care information technology. \nThese include such components as computer hardware and software, plus \ninstallation and training costs. In addition, when installed we require \nthat every system must meet the HHS Secretary's interoperability \nstandards.\n  Our new legislation even provides an alternative to those for-profit \nproviders who do not wish to apply for a grant. Under this bill, such \nproviders will be able to expense the cost of a qualified system.\n  I again want to stress the first goal of this legislation: to help \nbuild a safer medical-delivery system. The great successes of our \nhealth care system are largely due to our highly committed and talented \nhealth care professionals. The problem we are addressing today is not \ntheirs, but is an endemic weakness of the system they depend upon. \nHowever, to utilize the solution, the Federal Government must step \nforward and provide the leadership necessary to make system changes a \nreality.\n  When the Medicare and Medicaid Programs began, we could only have \ndreamed about computerized clinical information systems. Now, today, we \nhave this technology at our disposal, and I strongly believe that we \ncannot afford to delay implementation. In fact, as we face challenges \nin the financing of health entitlements, this is exactly the sort of \ninitiative which will enable us to achieve the fundamental improvements \nto make these benefits more fiscally secure.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe may soon achieve the goals of improving patient safety and reducing \nour escalating health care costs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1411. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish within the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency an office to measure and report on \ngreenhouse gas emissions of Federal agencies; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Federal \nGovernment Greenhouse Gas Registry Act. This bill will create an \ninventory of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Federal \nGovernment. This includes the Government's buildings, automotive fleets \nand other sources of emissions. Understanding the ``footprint'' of the \nFederal Government's emission is essential to reducing those emissions.\n  The Federal Government is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse \ngases in the world. In particular, the largest owner or renter of \nbuildings and owns the single largest fleet of cars in the United \nStates. The buildings and the transportation sectors account for nearly \ntwo-thirds of all of the greenhouse gases in the country. The Federal \nGovernment must lead by example by reducing its own emissions.\n  Understanding the extent of an entity's emissions, through the \ndevelopment of a registry, is important to ultimately reducing \nemissions. The private sector already understands this. It has found \nthat tracking and monitoring corporate emissions creates an\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\nopportunity to easily reduce emissions by seeing where energy is \ninefficiently used. According to a recent report by the Pew Center on \nGlobal Climate Change, ``the first step in developing a climate \nstrategy is to analyze a company's GHG emissions profile . . .''\n  My bill uses the GHG protocol, a rigorous standard developed by \nexperts and used by companies, States and trading regimes around the \nworld, including Johnson & Johnson, the California Climate Action \nRegistry and the EU's emission trading schemes. Utilizing such a well \nknown and frequently used standard is important because it allows for \ncomparison and benchmarking with other large emitters.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has also recognized the \nimportance of measuring greenhouse gas emissions. According to a GAO \nreport from April 2007--``Energy Audits Are Key to Strategy for \nReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions''--conducting emissions assessments \nwould ``. . . include information on cost-effectiveness and potential \nfor reducing emissions.''\n  In closing, the Federal Government has an obligation to lead by \nexample and this bill is a critical first step in reducing its \nemissions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Development Act \nof 2002 to support beginning farmers and ranchers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Grassley, \nBrown, and Baucus, I am introducing legislation that will expand \nopportunities for our next generation of farmers and ranchers. Over the \nnext two decades, an estimated 400 million acres of agricultural land \nwill be transferred to new owners. Today, farmers over the age of 65 \noutnumber those below the age of 35 by a margin of nearly two to one. \nThe future structure, health and vitality of our Nation's food and \nagriculture system depend on sound public policies that provide the \nnext generation of farmers and ranchers the help they need to \nsuccessfully enter farming and ranching.\n  The next generation of farmers and ranchers need access to training \nand mentoring which will help them obtain the critical management and \nmarketing skills vital to their success. The Beginning Farmer and \nRancher Program, created in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002, is the first USDA program other than credit financing to focus \nspecifically on beginning farmers and ranchers. The Beginning Farmer \nand Rancher Opportunity Act of 2007 would reauthorize this program and \nprovide $25 million a year in mandatory funding. We also propose to \nmake beginning farmer issues, such as land transition, farm transfer \nand succession, and entry into farming priority research areas within \nthe Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.\n  Beginning farmers and ranchers who are unable to obtain credit from \ncommercial sources are eligible for Farm Service Agency direct farm \nownership and operating loans up to an amount of $200,000 for each type \nof loan. This limit has not been adjusted in nearly\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\ntwo decades despite the rising cost of land, equipment and energy, and \nthus it is no longer sufficient. We propose to increase direct farm \nownership and operating loan limits from $200,000 to $300,000 to \nreflect economic realities. The authorization of appropriations for \ndirect loans is adjusted in the bill to reflect the new loan limits. It \nis important to increase direct loan authorization levels and \nappropriations, along with adjusting the direct farm ownership and \noperating loan limits or the net result may well be larger loans to \nfewer borrowers out of a constant pool of loan funds.\n  We propose several adjustments to the beginning farmer and rancher \ndown payment loan program. This loan combines the financial resources \nof the beginning farmer, the Farm Service Agency and commercial or \nprivate lenders. Throughout the 1990s this program was very successful, \nbut in recent years it has not been widely used due to low interest \nrates on traditional direct farm ownership loans. The interest rates on \nthe down payment loan and direct farm ownership loan have been \ncomparable so qualified borrowers have chosen to use the traditional \nFSA direct farm ownership loan for which no down payment is required.\n  The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2007 would adjust \nthe current interest rate of 4 percent for beginning farmer and rancher \ndown payment loans to a floating rate of 4 percent below the regular \nFSA direct farm ownership interest rates, or 1 percent, whichever is \ngreater. It would also reduce the beginning farmer's down payment from \n10 percent to 5 percent of the total price of land and increase the FSA \nportion of the loan to 45 percent from 40 percent. A commercial lender \nor private seller would still be required to supply the remaining \nportion of the partnership loan.\n  These changes, along with a few others, would make the program more \nattractive for beginning farmers and ranchers. Creating more attractive \nincentives in this beginning farmer and rancher down payment loan \nprogram should result in limited Federal dollars supporting more \nqualified borrowers since the government's portion of financing a farm \npurchase is only 45 percent as opposed to the traditional direct farm \nownership loan where the government finances 100 percent of the loan.\n  The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2007 creates a \nnew beginning farmer and rancher individual development account pilot \nprogram. This program is designed to help beginning farmers and \nranchers with limited resources establish savings. Eligible program \nparticipants agree to save money which is matched by federal and local \nmoney. The savings may be used by a participant for capital \nexpenditures for farm and ranch operation, including the purchase of \nland, buildings, equipment and livestock. This program will help \nparticipating beginning farmers and ranchers save and invest in assets \nthat will increase their long-term equity and likelihood of success.\n  The challenges beginning farmers and ranchers face are immense. The \ncost of land and equipment, obtaining credit, turning a profit and \nbuilding equity in a highly uncertain business are just a few of the \nchallenges. The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2007 \nwill help address the big challenge facing America's next generation of \nfarmers and ranchers. This bill is a comprehensive initiative which \nprovides farmers and ranchers critical help they need to enter and \nsucceed in farming and ranching, to be good stewards of the land, to be \ninnovative and entrepreneurial and to respond to rapidly changing \nmarkets and economic realities. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation and help enact it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1414. A bill to amend the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress Authorization Act to require State academic assessments of \nstudent achievement in United States history and civics, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Alexander \nthis year in introducing the American History and Civics Achievement \nAct. The bill is part of a continuing effort to renew the national \ncommitment to teaching history and civics in the Nation's public \nschools. It lays the foundation for more effective ways of teaching \nchildren about the Nation's past and the importance of civic \nresponsibility. It contains no new requirements for schools, but it \ndoes offer a more frequent and effective analysis of how America's \nstudents are learning these important subjects.\n  The NAEP U.S. History and Civics results released today, for example, \nshow that 86 percent of America's high school seniors cannot explain \nwhy this country was involved in the Korean war.\n  Nearly all eighth graders struggle to explain how the fall of the \nBerlin Wall affected our foreign policy.\n  Nearly 75 percent of eighth graders cannot explain the historical \npurpose of the Declaration of Independence.\n  We can't allow this trend to continue. While some progress has been \nmade in improving student achievement in these subjects, too many \nstudents are still unable to grasp their importance.\n  Our economy and our future security rely on good schools that help \nstudents develop specific skills, such as reading and math. But the \nstrength of our democracy and our standing in the world also depend on \nensuring that children have a basic understanding of the Nation's past \nand what it takes to engage in our democracy. An appreciation of the \ndefining events in our Nation's history can be a catalyst for civic \ninvolvement.\n  Instilling such appreciation, and teaching the values of justice, \nequality, and civic responsibility should be an important mission of \nour public schools. Thanks to the hard work of large numbers of history \nand civics teachers in classrooms throughout America, we are making \nprogress. Research conducted in history classrooms shows that children \nare using primary sources and documents more often to explore history, \nand are being assigned historical and biographical readings by their \nteachers more frequently.\n  But much more remains to be done to improve students' understanding \nof both of these subjects, and see to it that they are not left behind \nin their classrooms.\n  Good standards matter. They are the foundation for teaching and \nlearning in every school. With the right resources, time, and \nattention, it is possible to develop creative and effective history and \ncivics standards in every State.\n  Meeting high standards in reading and math is important, but it \nshould not come at the expense of scaling back teaching in other core \nsubjects such as history and civics. Integrating reading and math with \nother subjects often gives children a better way to master literacy and \nnumber skills, even while studying history, geography, and government.\n  That type of innovation deserves special attention in our schools. \nMaking it happen requires a focus on good standards and student \nachievement, which we're proposing today. But it also requires added \ninvestments in teacher preparation and teacher mentoring, so that \nteachers are well prepared to use interdisciplinary methods in their \nlesson plans.\n  Our bill today takes several important steps to strengthen the \nteaching of American history and civics, and raise the standing of \nthese subjects in school curriculums. Through changes in the National \nAssessment for Educational Progress, schools will be better able to \nachieve success on this important issue.\n  First, we propose a more frequent national assessment of children in \nAmerican history under the NAEP--every 4 years. NAEP is the gold \nstandard for measuring progress by students and reporting to the Nation \non that progress. It makes sense to measure the knowledge and skills of \nchildren on the NAEP more frequently than every 5 or 6 years, to obtain \na more timely picture of student progress and better address gaps in \nlearning.\n  The bill also proposes to strengthen state standards in American \nhistory and civics, through a new State-level pilot assessment of these \nsubjects under NAEP. The assessment would be conducted on an \nexperimental basis in 10 States in grades 8 and 12. The National \nAssessment Governing Board will ensure that States with model\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\nstandards, as well as those whose standards are still under \ndevelopment, will participate in this assessment.\n  Moving NAEP to the State level does not carry any high stakes for \nschools. But it will provide an additional benchmark for States to \ndevelop and improve their standards. It is our hope that States will \nalso be encouraged to undertake improvements in their history curricula \nand in their teaching of civics, and ensure that both subjects are a \nbeneficiary and not a victim of school reform.\n  America's past encompasses great leaders with great ideas that \ncontributed to our heritage and to the principles of freedom, equality, \njustice, and opportunity for all. Today's students will be better \ncitizens in the future if they learn more about that history and about \nthe skills needed to participate in our democracy. The American History \nand Civics Achievement Act is an important effort to reach that goal, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1415. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Social \nSecurity Act to improve screening and treatment of cancers, provide for \nsurvivorship services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, to introduce the Cancer \nScreening, Treatment an Survivorship Act of 2007.\n  Last summer, Lance Armstrong came to Iowa to testify at a field \nhearing on cancer research. He is a national hero for winning the Tour \nde France 7 years in a row. But he has become a national treasure as \nAmerica's No. 1 advocate for cancer research, detection, and treatment. \nI deeply appreciate his advocacy and tireless efforts to fight this \ndisease. Lance is one of the millions of people across America who has \nbeen touched by cancer.\n  The bill I am introducing today is personal with me. I have lost 4 of \nmy 5 siblings to cancer. And, with better detection and screenings, \nperhaps my siblings would have had a better outcome.\n  I believe passionately in doing our best to prevent cancer, by \nencouraging appropriate lifestyle choices. But I am equally passionate \nabout the need to do a better job of detecting cancer as early as \npossible, so we have a better chance of beating it.\n  And that is the aim of the Cancer Screening, Treatment, and \nSurvivorship Act of 2007. We have simple goals: To detect cancer \nearlier. To reduce cancer mortality rates. To improve the quality of \nlife for those diagnosed with cancer. And, yes, to save health care \ndollars.\n  As I said, my hope is that the bill we are introducing today will \ntake us to the next level and begin addressing survivorship and people \nthat are living with this chronic disease. Together, we can work to \nimprove the quality of life for those diagnosed with cancer and save \nlives. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nlegislation is passed and signed into law.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Harkin of Iowa, to introduce the Cancer Screening, Treatment \nand Survivorship Act of 2007. This legislation will help us to realize \na long-held vision--to see cancer conquered within our lifetimes.\n  Today nearly half of all Americans can expect to suffer from an \ninvasive form of cancer. So it is indisputable that cancer research, \nscreening, and treatment should continue to be a high public health \npriority. Many have called for an elimination of cancer death and \nsuffering by 2015, and I supported that ambitious goal along with 91 of \nmy Senate colleagues. Yet it is concrete action which is required if we \nare to make progress towards that objective.\n  Indeed, we have already seen remarkable progress in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of cancer. Today, for example, more women are surviving \nbreast cancer. Early diagnosis and modern treatments are saving lives. \nWe have even seen that drug treatment can substantially reduce the \nrecurrence of breast cancer.\n  And it is the strides which we have made in scientific discovery is \nfueling those advances. Senator Harkin and I both worked to support the \ndoubling of NIH funding--and the landmark work to map the human \ngenome--and today we sit poised to make the progress of which \ngenerations have dreamed.\n  Yet, no matter what we learn, no matter what cures are developed--\nwithout access to screening and treatment, no cure is possible. And if \none does not even know that the need for cure exists, no action can be \ntaken. So cancer is one of a number of areas where we see stark \ndisparities in health.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Harkin to introduce this \nlegislation. As co-chairs of the Senate Prevention Coalition, we \nrecognize that if we are to fundamentally improve both the quality and \nthe cost of health care, we cannot continue to use a band-aid approach. \nIndeed to address illness late is only to increase the risk that \nindividuals will not survive, and that we will provide only the most \nexpensive tertiary care.\n  So we need a new approach--a new mind set. Part of that is \nprevention, but not just prevention of the disease, but also avoidance \nof the negative consequences of disease.\n  In no case is this so clear as with cancer. Because we know that \nearly detection is so crucial to successful treatment, and this \nlegislation recognizes that.\n  Under our legislation we will see cancer screening extended to those \nwho today, too often are without such care. This act would provide \ngrants to states to employ screening programs to detect cancer early--\nwhen it is most treatable. Under our legislation, the HHS Secretary \nwill examine those diagnostics which meet the standards of the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force and select those with highest promise in \norder to see that we can reduce the toll of cancer.\n  Those receiving grants will see that the public's awareness of \nscreenings improves, that health professionals receive additional \ntraining in cancer detection and control, and that as new and better \ndiagnostics are developed, Americans will have access to those advances \nwithout regard to their inability to pay. That is the first step in \nreducing the toll of cancer.\n  Those who do receive a positive diagnosis as a result of this act \nwill obtain treatment referrals, and states will have the option to \nprovide treatment to those individuals without access to care under \nMedicaid. States which elect to do so would receive an enhanced Federal \nmatch to provide the very treatment which we know not only saves lives, \nbut reduces costs as well.\n  I know that some will argue that we cannot afford to add additional \ncoverage to Medicaid. Yet to that I must answer that without coverage, \nmany will simply see their disease progress, and ultimately end up \nMedicaid-eligible--but at a point when therapy is so much less \neffective. The cost of such deferral of care in both lives and health \nexpenditures is enormous. So I hope that many states will elect to \ncover treatment, just as many already have for those women screened \nunder the Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening program today.\n  This is a milestone moment, because today we begin to move forward in \nhow we address cancer--giving the HHS Secretary the authority to work \nin cooperation with the states to see that we work to see every \nAmerican has access to screening and treatment for cancer.\n  The step we are taking forward today is the product of so much work \nthrough the years. And this week, as cancer advocates--including Lance \nArmstrong and representatives of his foundation--press for action to \nachieve our vision of ending cancer in our lifetime, I am heartened by \nthe promise before us.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe may soon achieve the vision of our long war on cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/16/senate-section/article/S6198-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6198-S6201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 203--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S \nREPUBLIC OF CHINA TO USE ITS UNIQUE INFLUENCE AND ECONOMIC LEVERAGE TO \n              STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Casey, Mr. Lieberman,\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\nMs. Mikulski, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 203\n\n       Whereas since the conflict in Darfur, Sudan began in 2003, \n     hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more \n     than 2,500,000 displaced as a result of the ongoing and \n     escalating violence;\n       Whereas on July 23, 2004, Congress declared, ``the \n     atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide'' and on \n     September 23, 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate that, ``genocide has occurred and may still be \n     occurring in Darfur,'' and ``the Government of Sudan and the \n     Janjaweed bear responsibility'';\n       Whereas on October 13, 2006, the President signed the \n     Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (Public Law 109-344), \n     which identifies the Government of Sudan as complicit with \n     the forces committing genocide in the Darfur region and urges \n     the President to, ``take all necessary and appropriate steps \n     to deny the Government of Sudan access to oil revenues'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush declared in a speech \n     delivered on April 18, 2007, at the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum that no one ``can doubt that genocide is the \n     only word for what is happening in Darfur-and that we have a \n     moral obligation to stop it'';\n       Whereas the presence of approximately 7,000 African Union \n     peacekeepers has not deterred the violence and the increasing \n     attacks by the Government-sponsored Janjaweed militia and \n     rebel groups.\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to refuse to \n     allow implementation of the full-scale peacekeeping mission \n     authorized under United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706;\n       Whereas former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan \n     subsequently negotiated a compromise agreement with the \n     Government of Sudan for a hybrid United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping mission to be implemented in three phases;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has long-standing economic and military ties with Sudan and \n     continues to strengthen these ties in spite of the on-going \n     genocide in Darfur, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (1) China reportedly purchases as much as 70 percent of \n     Sudan's oil;\n       (2) China currently has at least $3,000,000,000 invested in \n     the Sudanese energy sector, for a total of $10,000,000,000 \n     since the 1990s;\n       (3) Sudan's Joint Chief of Staff, Haj Ahmed El Gaili, \n     recently visited Beijing for discussions with Chinese Defense \n     Minister Cao Gang Chuan and other military officials as part \n     of an eight-day tour of China; Cao pledged closer military \n     relations with Sudan, saying that China was ``willing to \n     further develop cooperation between the two militaries in \n     every sphere'';\n       (4) China has reportedly cancelled approximately $100 \n     million in debt owed by the Sudanese Government; and\n       (5) China is building infrastructure in Sudan and provided \n     funds for a presidential palace in Sudan at a reported cost \n     of approximately $20,000,000;\n       Whereas given its economic interests throughout the region, \n     China has a unique ability to positively influence the \n     Government of Sudan to abandon its genocidal policies and to \n     accept United Nations peacekeepers to join a hybrid United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas the President's Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew S. \n     Natsios, further said in testimony on April 11, 2007, that \n     ``China's substantial economic investment in Sudan gives it \n     considerable potential leverage, and we have made clear to \n     Beijing that the international community will expect China to \n     be part of the solution'';\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has previously influenced the Government of Sudan to take \n     steps toward reducing violence and conflict by--\n       (1) abstaining from, and choosing not to obstruct, several \n     important votes in the United Nations Security Council on \n     resolutions related to Sudan, including Resolution 1556, \n     which demanded Sudan disarm militias in Darfur, and \n     Resolution 1706, which called for the deployment of \n     additional United Nations peacekeepers, including up to \n     17,300 military personnel and up to 3,300 civilian police;\n       (2) helping to facilitate the Addis Ababa framework reached \n     on November 16, 2006, which provides for a joint United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping force;\n       (3) sending high-level delegations, including Chinese \n     President Hu Jintao, to Sudan, and encouraging President \n     Bashir to show flexibility and allow the joint United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping force to be deployed;\n       (4) making frequent public statements that the Government \n     of Sudan must carry out agreements made within the Addis \n     Ababa framework of November 2006 to admit United Nations \n     peacekeepers to join the United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping force in Darfur;\n       (5) pledging to provide military engineers to support \n     African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur; and\n       (6) announcing on May 10, 2007, the appointment of a senior \n     diplomat as China's special representative on African affairs \n     who is to focus specific attention on the Darfur issue.\n       Whereas due to its vast population, its rapidly growing \n     global economy, its large research and development \n     investments and military spending, its seat as a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council and on the \n     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, China is an emerging power \n     that is increasingly perceived as a leader with significant \n     international reach and responsibility;\n       Whereas in November 2006, China hosted its third Forum on \n     China-Africa Cooperation with more than 40 heads of state in \n     attendance and which focused heavily on trade relations and \n     investment on the African continent as it is expected to \n     double by 2010;\n       Whereas China is preparing to host the Olympic Summer Games \n     of 2008, the most honorable, venerated, and prestigious \n     international sporting event;\n       Whereas China should be held accountable to act \n     consistently with the Olympic standard of preserving human \n     dignity in Darfur, Sudan and around the world; and\n       Whereas China has been reluctant to use its full influence \n     to improve the human rights situation in Darfur: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the close relationship between China and \n     Sudan and strongly urges the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to use its full influence to--\n       (A) urge the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, to allow a \n     robust peacekeeping force as described in United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1706;\n       (B) call for Sudanese compliance with United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, and the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement, all of which demand that the Government of \n     Sudan disarm militias operating in Darfur;\n       (C) call on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the \n     2004 N'Djamena ceasefire agreement and the recently-agreed \n     United Nations communique which commits the Sudanese \n     Government to improve conditions for humanitarian \n     organizations and ensure they have unfettered access to the \n     populations they serve;\n       (D) emphasize that there can be no military solution to the \n     conflict in Darfur and that the formation and implementation \n     of a legitimate peace agreement between all parties will \n     contribute toward the welfare and stability of the entire \n     nation and broader region;\n       (E) urge all rebel groups to unify and assist all parties \n     to come to the negotiating table in good faith;\n       (F) urge the Government of southern Sudan to play a more \n     active role in pressing for legitimate peace talks and take \n     immediate steps to support and assist in the revitalization \n     of such talks along one single coordinated track;\n       (G) engage collaboratively in high-level diplomacy and \n     multilateral efforts toward a renewed peace process; and\n       (H) join the international community in imposing economic \n     and other consequences on the Government of Sudan if that \n     Government continues to carry out or support attacks on \n     innocent civilians and frustrate diplomatic efforts; and\n       (2) recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is to \n     bring together nations and people from all over the world in \n     peace, is incompatible with any actions, directly or \n     indirectly, supporting acts of genocide.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as I rise today to talk about the \ngenocide in Darfur, I ask myself: How long will we wait until we invoke \nreal sanctions on the Sudan? How long will we wait until a hybrid \nAfrican Union/United Nations peacekeeping force is in place? And how \nmany more reports must we read about how the African Union troops are \noverstretched, underfunded, and ill-equipped before the international \ncommunity provides them with the support they need to be effective?\n  How many more people from Darfur must be driven from their homes and \nforced to give up their livelihoods before the world says enough is \nenough? How many more hundreds of thousands of people must die before \nwe do everything--everything--in our power to stop the atrocities? When \nwill we give real meaning to our commitment to the phrase ``never \nagain?''\n  After 4 years, hundreds of thousands of Darfurians killed, more than \n2.5 million people displaced, and some 80,000 people in Darfur who have \nspilled into refugee camps this year alone, it is time that we act more \nstrategically and effectively to stop the genocide in Darfur.\n  Despite our efforts thus far, it is clear that we have seen no real \nchange for the people of Darfur who continue to be attacked and killed. \nIt is time to stop wringing our hands. We must take a hard look at our \ncurrent policy and ask ourselves: Why, after years of international \nengagement, has the genocide not stopped in Darfur, and what can we do \ndifferently now?\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\n  The simple answer is: We must deal with Darfur's economic lifeline, \nChina. Right now, China has unique ties, influence, and leverage over \nthe Sudanese Government. Here we see the Chinese Prime Minister meeting \nwith the Sudanese President in Beijing, the capital of China.\n  China has unique ties, influence, and leverage over the Sudanese \nGovernment. Because of China's close economic relationship with \nKhartoum, Sudan is able to expand its infrastructure, increase its \ndefense budget, and profit from its oil exports. It is time to diminish \nthe strength of this lifeline.\n  Over the last decade we have watched China and Sudan forge a strong \neconomic partnership. We have here, as I said, a picture of the Chinese \nPremiere meeting with the Sudanese President last November. China \ncurrently has at least $3 billion invested in the Sudanese energy \nsector for a total of $10 billion since the 1990s.\n  China reportedly buys as much as 70 percent of Sudan's oil. They \nrecently canceled over $100 million in Sudanese debt, and they are \nbuilding vast infrastructure and new government offices for Sudan.\n  China has even committed to providing funds so that Khartoum can \nbuild a new $20 million Presidential palace. A Presidential palace.\n  The fact is, with China as their friend, the impact of international \naction against the Sudanese Government has been diluted, and the \ngenocide has continued. Because of China's investment and attention, \nSudan has reportedly been able to double--double--its defense budget. \nIn fact, according to the Heritage Foundation, Sudan is spending \nbetween 60 percent to 80 percent of its oil revenue, its national \ntreasure, on what? On weapons.\n  A report by Amnesty International released last week concluded that \nthese weapons come from--guess where--China, which has continued its \narms sales to the Sudanese Government despite the March 2005 arms \nembargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.\n  Simply put, Chinese investment fuels the atrocities taking place in \nDarfur. It is time that China uses its power and influence over \nKhartoum to do more than fill its own pocketbook. China is an emerging \npower on the world stage, and it is time they act accordingly with this \nresponsibility.\n  Because of their close economic ties with the Sudan, China is in the \nposition to significantly influence Khartoum, and it must use its clout \nto convince President Bashir to allow a hybrid African Union/United \nNations peacekeeping force into Darfur.\n  This is one of the most pressing actions to help stop the genocide in \nDarfur. Last year, Chinese President Hu mentioned the peacekeeping with \nSudan's President when the two met in Khartoum. But talk is cheap. It \nis time for real action.\n  As John Prendergast, the senior adviser to the International Crisis \nGroup, said a few weeks ago in testimony before Congress, ``Barking \nwithout biting is the diplomatic equivalent of giving comfort to the \nenemy.''\n  Now is the time to bite. Now is the time for China to use the full \nweight of its economic influence to change Khartoum's policies. Now, I \nknow China has taken some positive steps in the past to address the \ncrisis in Darfur. They helped facilitate the Addis Ababa framework in \nNovember of 2006; they have pledged to provide military engineers \nto support African Union peacekeepers in Darfur; and they have \nappointed a special Africa envoy to focus on Darfur.\n\n  While we are certainly happy to see those positive measures, I am \nstill concerned that China will continue its habit of taking small \nsteps each time the international community turns up the heat but will \nnot take major steps that will affect Darfur in the long run.\n  The simple fact is, China needs to do more to be actively involved in \nthe solution. Next year, we will see China take center stage when it \nhosts the 2008 Olympic games. Frankly, I find it shocking that China is \ngoing to host an Olympics under the theme ``One World and One Dream'' \nwhile they help fuel the economy of a nation that has allowed genocide \nto ravage its country for some 4 years.\n  This is certainly not the ``One World One Dream'' we share. That is \nwhy today I am introducing a bipartisan resolution with Senator \nBrownback, Senator Feingold, and others, a version of which is also \nbeing introduced in the House, to let China know that as much as it \ncherishes its Olympic moment, the country should be held accountable to \nact consistently with the Olympic standard of preserving human dignity \naround the world, including in Darfur.\n  The resolution recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is \nto bring nations and people from all over the world in peace, is \nincompatible with any actions to support acts of genocide. This \nlegislation specifically calls on China to use its full influence to \nurge the President of Sudan to allow a robust peacekeeping force into \nDarfur; to comply with past United Nations Security Council resolutions \nand the Darfur Peace Agreement, which demand that the Government of the \nSudan disarm militias in Darfur; and to improve the conditions for \nhumanitarian organizations.\n  It also calls on all parties involved in the conflict to adhere to \nthe 2004 ceasefire agreement and to work toward a legitimate peace \ndeal.\n  This resolution I am submitting is only a first step. It is an \ninvitation to the Chinese Government to take more of an initiative to \nset President Bashir on a straight path and allow a hybrid African \nUnion/United Nations force into the country. I hope China takes this \nopportunity to act now, and that they understand Congress will be \nwatching very closely to see what they actually do.\n  Our message for today is clear. We need to see real progress from \nChina on this issue. We need to see it now. Along with stronger \nmeasures by the Chinese Government, the United States must continue in \nits efforts to end the genocide in Darfur.\n  After threatening more punitive measures for months, the \nadministration must stop talking about what they define as plan B, \nwhich is more significant sanctions, and start enacting plan B. If we \nwere stuck in the refugee camps in Darfur in the Sudan, being attacked \nby the jinjaweit, with our children slaughtered, seeing women raped, \nwho among us would be content with those who counsel patience and \ndelay?\n  Plan B's tightening sanctions against Sudan, targeting individuals \nresponsible for the atrocious acts, and negotiating a new United \nNation's Security Council resolution is the right thing to do now.\n  Finally, the fact is, the situation in Darfur is a timebomb that \ncould explode at any moment. The humanitarian crisis has become ever \nmore perilous. As we speak today, the number of dead and displaced \npersons continues to grow, and women and young girls continue to be \nraped. The refugee crisis continues to worsen. This year alone, at \nleast 80,000 people in Darfur have spilled into refugee camps. The \natrocities against these innocent refugees are no longer contained \nwithin Sudan, as refugees spill across borders into eastern Chad and \nthe Central African Republic. The lives of these millions of displaced \npersons hang in a delicate balance between life and death. The world's \nlargest humanitarian effort has been keeping that balance from tipping \ncompletely toward death.\n  The new United Nations Humanitarian chief, John Holmes, has warned \nthat if the situation does not get better or if there are more serious \nincidents involving humanitarian workers, some organizations could \nstart to withdraw and the humanitarian operation could start to \nunravel. I am deeply concerned we could soon begin to witness a \ncatastrophic collapse of the humanitarian aid effort. Several \ninternational aid agencies, including the British group Oxfam, Save the \nChildren Spain, and the United States-based Mercy Corps, reported in \nApril that they were temporarily suspending their work in Darfur \nbecause of attacks. They reported attacks on their operations had \nincreased over the past 3 weeks. Soon only a small number of aid \nworkers may be left in this region, which could result in unimaginable \ndestruction and death. Who would be there to protect these innocent \nvictims? The overstretched and inadequately funded African Union \nMission in Sudan?\n  Recently, chairperson of the African Union Commission said that if \nthe current trend continues, the peacekeeping operation in Darfur will \nbe in serious jeopardy. In reality, the African Union Mission may \nalready be in deep jeopardy. According to a Washington Post article \npublished last Sunday:\n\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\n\n       The African Union's first major peacekeeping mission--once \n     considered the last line of defense for Darfur civilians--has \n     been crippled by funding and equipment shortages, government \n     harassment and an upsurge in armed attacks by rebel forces \n     that last month left seven African troops dead.\n       The setbacks have sapped morale among peacekeepers, many of \n     whom have not been paid for months. It has also compelled the \n     force--which numbered 7,000 troops at its peak--to scale back \n     its patrols and has diminished its capacity to protect \n     civilians, aid workers and its own peacekeepers.\n\n  Simply put, the African Union force alone cannot end the violence in \nDarfur.\n  That is why it is imperative that the international community, with \nthe explicit help of the Chinese Government, convince Sudan to allow a \nhybrid African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force into Darfur. \nUnfortunately, Khartoum continues to be complicit in allowing the \ndestruction to continue. A recent United Nations report, described in \nthe New York Times, detailed how the Government of Sudan is flying arms \nand heavy military equipment into Darfur in clear violation of Security \nCouncil resolutions. Even more egregious, the report describes how the \nSudanese Government is painting their military planes white to disguise \nthem as United Nations or African Union aircraft. President Bashir has \ntoyed with the international community for long enough. Time and time \nagain he has balked at agreements and promises. Time and time again he \nhas manipulated the international community with last-minute agreements \nthat he reneges on only a minute later. It is time for the games to \nend.\n  Because in this respect, silence in the face of genocide is \ncomplicity, we must continue to speak out. ``Never again'' is an empty \npromise if we do not take action to stop the murder of innocent people \nwhen we know it is happening. Once again, we find ourselves in a \nposition to make that choice. We must choose to exhaust all options \nuntil our collective voices are heard and murder ends.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 205, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 205) designating June 2007 as \n     ``National Internet Safety Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduced a resolution \ndesignating June 2007 as National Internet Safety Month.\n  The Internet has become one of the most significant advances in the \ntwentieth century and, as a result, it affects people's lives in a \npositive manner each day. However, this technology presents dangers \nthat need to be brought to the attention of all Americans. Consider the \npervasiveness of Internet access by children and the rapid increase in \nInternet crime and predatory behavior. Never before have powerful \neducational solutions--such as Internet safety curricula for grades \nkindergarten through 12--been more critical and readily at hand.\n  Mr. President, i-SAFE America is one nonprofit organization that has \nworked tirelessly to educate our youth and our community on these \nimportant issues. Formed in 1998, i-SAFE America educates youth in all \n50 states, Washington, DC, and Department of Defense schools worldwide \nto ensure that they have a safe experience online.\n  It is imperative that all Americans learn about the Internet safety \nstrategies which will help keep their children safe from victimization. \nConsider the facts: In the United States, about 35 million school-aged \nchildren have Internet access. Eighty percent of middle and high school \nstudents are online for at least one hour per week.\n  An alarming statistic is that 61 percent of middle and high school \nyouths admit to using the Internet unsafely or inappropriately. \nFurthermore, at least 20 percent of these students have met face-to-\nface with someone they first met online and 23 percent of these \nstudents know of someone who has been bullied online.\n  Now is the time for America to focus its attention on supporting \nInternet safety, especially bearing in mind that children will soon be \non summer vacation and will spend more time online.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
