Mr. President, this Saturday, Jeff Alberici from Auburn, \nNY, delivered the Democratic weekly radio address. Jeff and his wife \naren't rich; they aren't poor. They are squarely in the middle. They \nare middle class.\n  Jeff is a middle school teacher. He teaches American history. His \nwife is a teacher's assistant. Jeff said that if they didn't have to \ntransport their three children to school and sports practice, they \nwould probably ride bikes back and forth to work to save gas.\n  Jeff said when his wife returned to work last year, after staying \nhome with their children, they thought the second income would give \nthem a chance to pay off their debt and start saving for college. But \nthat hasn't happened. Instead of getting ahead, the Alberici family's \nsecond income is covering the cost of food, and especially gasoline.\n  Jeff summed up things by saying that they will be fine. They are not \nin danger of losing their home, and they both have good steady jobs. \nThey are not at risk. But instead of ordering pizza for an occasional \ndinner with the kids, now they have to eat grilled cheese on those \noccasions. And in the long term, they are not sure how they will be \nable to afford to send their children to college because they have \nbasically not saved anything up to this date.\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\n  Families in every State, region, and corner of our country are facing \nthe same challenges as the Albericis. Jeff and others like him were \nraised to believe that doing important work, such as being a \nschoolteacher, wouldn't make you rich but it would provide enough to \nlive comfortably and raise a family. The middle-class dream--that \nAmerican dream--is vanishing before our eyes.\n  Today, oil is trading near record levels again. It is up around $140 \na barrel. Gasoline now averages $4.08 a gallon nationally, and in \nNevada it is $4.24 a gallon. This morning, we learned that utility \ncompanies across the country are raising rates another 29 percent on \ntop of the 30-percent increases American consumers have already endured \nover the past 5 years.\n  On President Bush's watch, American families are earning less today \nthan they did 8 years ago--and that is the truth--yet paying more than \never for everyday necessities, such as gasoline, heat for the home, and \nof course groceries. And they are paying more than ever for long-term \nneeds, such as the goal of health care, college, and retirement. \nAmerican families can't survive this squeeze indefinitely.\n  Right now, many are able to keep their heads above water by saving \nless, and sometimes not saving, and finding other ways to tighten their \nbelts. Like the Albericis, they are eating more grilled cheese and \nputting less of their paychecks into savings.\n  Most Americans are too busy figuring out how to pay the bills and \nmake ends meet to pay close attention to what is going on here in \nCongress. But if working families see one thing from Congress, it is \nthis: Democrats get it. That is what Jeff said in his radio address. We \nknow what is happening in America, and we are fighting every single day \nto make things better.\n  Republicans? They talk about our country's problems, but when the \ntime comes to stand up and take action, they are nowhere to be found. \nRepublicans talk about high gas prices, alternative energy, the housing \ncrisis, and job loss, but each time there has been a proposed solution \nto those challenges, Republicans have said no.\n  Our Republican colleagues fill endless pages of the Congressional \nRecord with speeches about the affordability crisis in America that a \nRepublican President created and the Republican nominee, John McCain, \nhopes to continue, but the American people need more than empty words.\n  Republicans can choose to keep standing on the sidelines, or keep \nsticking with the status quo, which they have done now for the entire \nyear and a half we have been in the majority. They have that right. But \nDemocrats will keep fighting to make the American dream affordable \nagain for the Albericis of Auburn, NY, and the millions of American \nfamilies like them who deserve better. Today we will give Republicans \nanother opportunity to do the right thing by voting for cloture on the \nenergy tax extenders bill. This legislation would lower taxes for \nbusinesses, entrepreneurs, and families. The deduction for State and \nlocal sales taxes helps level the playing field and provides tax relief \nto residents in States with no income tax. The tuition deduction helps \nfamilies afford the skyrocketing cost of college. The teachers' \ndeduction provides a small but important bit of help and appreciation \nto educators for out-of-pocket classroom expenses.\n  This legislation would also extend tax benefits for businesses, \nparticularly those engaged in research and development for clean \nrenewable energy, tax credits, Mr. President, for clean renewable \nenergy. Today we are going to use 21 million barrels of oil. That is \nnot necessary. We could change that. We need to allow the great \nbusiness minds of America to invest in renewable energy--the Sun, the \nwind, geothermal. That is what this vote at 5:30 today is all about.\n\n  Republicans have opposed this legislation in the past because it is \npaid for and will not increase the national debt. How do we pay for \nthese tax cuts for businesses and families? By closing a loophole that \nallows superwealthy hedge fund managers to avoid paying tax on their \nearnings.\n  This is unique, that the Republicans would oppose this. The hedge \nfund operators even know it is unfair and they support us on this. Why \nanyone opposes legislation on these grounds is beyond the ability of \nthe American people to comprehend. Why Republicans would oppose tax \nrelief for businesses and families in order to protect a tax loophole \nfor multimillionaires seems preposterous. And keep in mind, even the \nhedge fund operators, I repeat, believe it would be fair to do what we \nseek.\n  Republicans have the right to side with hedge fund multimillionaires \nover small businesses and families. They have already done so by \nblocking the tax extenders bill twice this year. Now they have a third \nchance to reverse course and support this legislation. Maybe this week \nenough Republicans will see the suffering in their States and break \nwith the President and Republican Senate leaders to do the right thing. \nMaybe this is the time enough Republicans will say enough is enough.\n  I know our Republican colleagues see the terrible economic burden the \nAmerican people are carrying. The only question is, will they let it \ncontinue or join us in doing something about it? For all the \nRepublicans sitting on the fence, and there are some seeing how bad \nthings have gotten but still not ready to stand up to the Republican \nParty, I ask: If not now, when? Democrats stand ready to legislate. \nJoin us and we can begin repairing the damage and restoring the \nAmerican Dream.\n  I acknowledge that on the Medicare fix we tried to do last week, we \ngot nine Republicans who supported us. Had we had Senator Kennedy \nback--and he soon will be back, and a few other Senators--we would have \nbeen able to have 60 votes. So I am glad to see that my friends on the \nother side, even though not enough, are coming forward and voting with \nus. We hope there will be more of that in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as Washington, and all of America, \ncontinue to pay tribute to Tim Russert, I wish to add a few more words \nabout a man who impacted everybody in this body in one way or another \nover the years.\n  I have been a fairly regular guest on ``Meet the Press'' over the \nyears, so I got to know Tim Russert primarily as a tough interviewer, \nbut I also came to appreciate and admire his extraordinary people \nskills, which were as good as those of any politician here in \nWashington.\n  I remember him saying once that his son Luke was a big fan of Tubby \nSmith, the old UK Wildcats basketball coach. I think Luke even went to \nTubby's basketball camp one summer. Well, anytime I or anybody else on \nthe staff got on the phone with Tim, he would also start off with ``Go \nCats.'' It is just one example of the great mind he had for small \npersonal details and how he employed that skill in a totally \nunpretentious way.\n  He also knew I was a Louisville Cardinal basketball fan, and he \ninvariably would turn the subject to Rick Patino and his considerable \nskills, and that is a way in which he kind of related to everybody.\n  Bill Kristol was getting at the same thing in his column this \nmorning, in which he related a story that has been around this town for \na while. The story goes that when Pat Moynihan was trying to convince \nTim to come down to the Capitol to be his Chief of Staff, Tim didn't \nwant to come because Moynihan's office was all Ph.Ds and intellectuals. \nHe didn't think he would fit in. Moynihan said:\n\n       Tim, the things they know you can learn. But the things you \n     know they can never learn.\n\n  So as Tim Russert rose to the height of his profession, it became \nclear Pat Moynihan was right on target.\n  I found it particularly moving to see Luke paying tribute to his \nfather on television this morning. As Tim often said, being a good \nfather was the job he put the most stock in, and it appears he has done \na superb job in that respect as well.\n\n\n                           Tax Extenders Bill\n\n  Today the Senate will vote on whether to proceed to the House-passed \ntax\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nextenders bill. Republicans support the provisions being extended in \nthis legislation. That is why I, along with several of my colleagues, \nintroduced an even stronger version of the House bill, one that \ncontains even longer extensions of the expired provisions, provides AMT \nrelief excluded from the House bill, and does both in a form that would \navoid a veto; that is, of course, without raising taxes.\n  The tax provisions in question are an enormous help to millions of \nAmericans, and a long-term extension would provide the added comfort of \npredictability into the family budget and the small business balance \nsheet in the midst of a difficult economic time.\n  Republicans have been firm on this point, which is why I read with \nsome amusement a letter which was sent to me on Friday by my friend the \nmajority leader, extolling the virtues of the House bill. As I said, \nRepublicans truly agree that the expired provisions certainly merit \nextension. This is not a State secret. Our point of departure, the \nprinciple we have insisted on, is this: Short-term tax extensions \nshould not be the occasion for permanent tax increases. If a new tax \npolicy is being created, that is one thing. But if current taxes are \nsimply being extended, those extensions should not be accompanied by \nnew tax increases. To do so would be to transform the annual ritual of \nextending current tax law into a stealth exercise in increasing the \nsize of Government.\n  Unfortunately, the House Democratic leadership seems to have dug in, \nsaying it will not pass an extenders bill without tax hikes. This \nbrings us to an impasse for no good reason. First of all, it strikes me \nas odd that the House Democratic leadership would single out these \nparticular tax extenders for a fight on offsets. They didn't need \noffsets on the stimulus bill earlier this year. AMT relief will \napparently not require offsets this year. House leaders have signaled \nthat a new GI benefits expansion would not require offsets. And just \nlast week, the House passed an unemployment insurance expansion bill \nthat did not have offsets.\n  It is entirely possible that the Democratic leadership is open to \ncompromise. Recall that during last year's AMT debate, House leaders \nalso insisted on offsets. On December 18, just last year, House \nDemocrats were saying they would not consider AMT relief unless it \nincluded tax hikes elsewhere. Then the following day, September 19, \nthey passed an AMT bill without tax hikes by a vote of 352 to 64. After \nall the press releases and letters had been issued, our friends on the \nother side sat down with Republicans and did something we should do a \nlot more of around here: they negotiated.\n  So notwithstanding the letter I received on Friday from my good \nfriend, the majority leader, I am hopeful we can do the same thing on \nthis tax extenders bill--sit down together and come up with a solution \nthat is acceptable to both sides and which actually has a chance of \nbeing signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my thoughts and prayers \nto the people and communities throughout the Midwest who were hurt by \nlast week's massive floods.\n  It appears that the floodwaters have begun to recede. But the long, \nhard process of cleaning up and rebuilding lies ahead.\n  In particular, I offer sympathy and support to my colleagues Tom \nHarkin and Charles Grassley, the Senators from Iowa, whose governor has \ndeclared 83 of the State's 99 counties to be disaster areas.\n  Worst hit was the city of Cedar Rapids, IA.\n  Over 9 square miles--or 1,300 blocks--were flooded in the city and \n25,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Preliminary \nestimates indicate over $700 million in damage. This is in Cedar Rapids \nalone.\n  In Cedar Rapids, it is being called not the flood of the century--but \nthe flood of the half-millennium--an event that should occur only once \nin 500 years.\n  In fact, rescue workers from Minnesota have been deployed to Iowa to \nhelp the victims of the flooding there.\n  While the residents and businesses of Cedar Rapids were hit the \nhardest, they were hardly alone. Heavy rainfall last week submerged \nmuch of the Midwest--Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and my own \nState of Minnesota.\n  Throughout the Midwest, corn and soybean fields turned into lakes. \nCity streets turned into canals. It's like Waterworld. There is water \nnearly everywhere. And where there isn't water, there is mud. Lots of \nmud.\n  In terms of physical devastation, some are calling these floods ``the \nKatrina of the Midwest.''\n  Among the areas suffering flood damage was the southeastern corner of \nmy state of Minnesota. Three major rivers in the area--the Root, the \nCedar and the Zumbro--all flooded.\n  Four Minnesota counties were declared State disaster areas--Freeborn, \nMower, Fillmore and Houston counties.\n  This includes areas that have already suffered extensive flood damage \nin the past year--both with the devastating floods in August last year \nas well as floods earlier this spring.\n  As you can see from this aerial photograph of Austin, MN, taken last \nweek, flood, water poured across big sections of the city, flooding not \njust streets, but highways and freeway ramps.\n  This weekend, I spoke with the mayors of Austin, Rochester and \nLanesboro. Later in the week, I plan to visit the area and meet with \nlocal leaders and residents. After the floods last August, I traveled \nto the area several times to survey the damage and work with local and \nState leaders to obtain Federal aid and assistance. My family and I \neven spent a weekend in the area.\n  I know these communities are strong--just as you will see with the \nState of Iowa, which State has been hit even harder, and they will make \nit through this latest disaster.\n  Last week's flooding resulted in the death of one Minnesota man, Dale \nWangen, of rural Albert Lea. He was driving home in the dark, rainy \nnight and suddenly his car plunged into the rushing flood waters \nbecause the road was washed away.\n  Emergency responders found him only because another car came along \nand also plunged into the water. That driver was able to get out. But \nhe told rescuers that his car had crashed on top of another car.\n  Austin, MN, is home to Hormel Foods, a Fortune 500 company. They had \nto close their corporate offices because of the flood.\n  Here is a second photograph of Austin, also taken last week. You can \nsee that it was not just a few wet basements. Some neighborhoods were \nflooded practically up to the treetops and had to be evacuated.\n  Fortunately, Austin was spared even worse damage because--ever since \na major flood 30 years ago--they have been implementing a comprehensive \nflood mitigation plan, including the purchase of more than 250 homes in \nflood-prone areas.\n  Nonetheless, the three worst floods in Austin's history have all \noccurred since the year 2000--with the worst in 2004.\n  As one resident of Austin put it: ``It seems like we're getting a \n`hundred-year flood' every 3 or 4 years.''\n  While the most attention is given to cities and towns damaged by the \nfloods, the countryside has not been spared, either.\n  Houston County, at the far southeastern tip of Minnesota, is a rural \narea with a total population of just\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n20,000. Preliminary estimates indicate that Houston County alone has \nsuffered close to $7 million in infrastructure damage and $15 million \nin crop damage.\n  Heavy spring rains had already delayed the planting of crops. Now, \nthere are acres and acres of young corn and soybean plants that are \nunder water. The work that Senator Harkin has done as Chair of the \nAgriculture Committee is making sure that we give permanent disaster \nrelief is so important. These floods are one example.\n  We will not know the full extent of the damage until the harvest this \nfall. But the end result could be billions of dollars in crop losses.\n  At a time like this, local communities should not be expected to fend \nfor themselves. The Federal Government has an essential role to support \ncommunities as they recover and rebuild.\n  In these circumstances, the Federal Emergency Management Agency--\nFEMA--must be a lifeline to help these communities both survive and \ncome back.\n  FEMA is the primary coordinator of all Federal responses to this \nnational tragedy, from first making sure that people are safe and \nsecure, to then making sure that those people are made whole again, to \nfinally making sure that their infrastructure is rebuilt and made \nstronger, so that such disasters do not happen again. We saw this in \nflooding last year in Southeastern Minnesota, where whole communities \nwere washed out. We went through these three steps so those communities \nare beginning to thrive again.\n  The Small Business Administration plays a key role in recovery \nactivities, providing vital assistance to local businesses that have \nsuffered economic losses.\n  While we did not need it, the floods provide justification for the \nfirst-ever permanent program of disaster assistance for farmers, which \nwe just passed as part of our farm bill.\n  In my state of Minnesota, it has been a tough 2 years when it comes \nto disasters.\n  Last spring, we had the Ham Lake fire that burned 76,000 acres in \nnorthern Minnesota.\n  On August 1 last year, we had the collapse of the Interstate 35W \nbridge in the heart of our Twin Cities metropolitan area, killing 13 \npeople and injuring over one hundred.\n  Later in August, we had the devastating floods in southeastern \nMinnesota that cost six lives and caused tens of millions of dollars in \ndamage.\n  Less than a month ago, on the Sunday evening before Memorial Day, the \nsmall community of Hugo was hit by a fierce tornado. It killed a 2-\nyear-old boy, Nathaniel Prindle, and seriously injured his 4-year-old \nsister, Annika. Fifty homes were completely destroyed and another 250 \nwere damaged.\n  But there is one special thing we have seen with each one of these \ndisasters. It is the sight of people joining together to help and care \nfor others in need. Even with all the devastation, disasters like these \nstill bring out the very best in the human spirit. Not just neighbors \nhelping neighbors, but strangers helping strangers.\n  Disasters can take away lives; they can destroy homes; and they can \nwipe away roads and bridges. But, in America, we won't let them take \naway our spirit of community.\n  With the appropriate State and Federal support, I am confident that \nthe flood-damaged communities of the Midwest will thrive once again. \nWith leaders like Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, I am confident \nIowa will thrive once again.\n  I think about the epic flood that occurred 11 years ago on the Red \nRiver bordering Minnesota and North Dakota.\n  The waters inundated downtown Grand Forks in North Dakota and East \nGrand Forks in Minnesota--60,000 people had to evacuate; 900 lost their \nhomes; and 11 downtown buildings were destroyed.\n  But with the hard work of Senators Dorgan and Conrad and officials \nthroughout North Dakota and Minnesota, it is amazing to visit those \ncommunities today and see how they have rebuilt and moved forward.\n  I hear that officials from Grand Forks have already reached out and \ntalked with their counterparts in Cedar Rapids, IA--giving them advice \non everything from legal issues to how to rebuild.\n  That, too, is the spirit of America. We know we will be able get \nthrough this disaster because we know we will work together and provide \nsupport to one another.\n  I see Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley are coming to the Senate \nfloor. Again, we pledge from the State of Minnesota to do everything we \ncan to help them. Their damage was so much more extensive than ours. \nBut we know with fine leaders like these, they will help their State \nget through this. I know we are sending emergency workers from \nMinnesota at this very minute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to be here with Senator \nHarkin. But I am not proud to be here because of the situation that we \ndescribed to you, which is the flooding in our State of Iowa. I am \ngoing to show some pictures. Senator Harkin has some pictures. I am not \ngoing to refer specifically to the pictures during my remarks, but I \nthink you can see from the New York Times, downtown Cedar Rapids, IA--\nCity Hall here on an island between the rivers, kind of in the citadel \nof Cedar Rapids, and water has never been that high before. This is \ntruly a 100-year flood.\n  Then we have another picture here of Cedar Rapids. It happens to be \non the very same street on which Senator Harkin has his office. My \noffice in Cedar Rapids was in the Federal Building. The Federal \nBuilding is just across, right there. So it is shut down, obviously. I \njust want to make some remarks about the situation in Iowa and then \nturn the floor over to Senator Harkin.\n  We come to the floor to share with our colleagues and the American \npeople the stories of more natural disasters to hit Iowa. In my case, \nless than 2 weeks ago I came to this very spot to honor the victims and \nto hail the heroes from a deadly tornado that ripped through my home \ncounty, Butler County, IA. In a little more than a week, Mother Nature \nhas ripped open a healing wound.\n  As many people can see on television, Iowans are seeing record floods \nthroughout the central and eastern part of our State. I can tell you \nthat television hardly does justice to this historic devastation. Iowa \nbraced for a repeat of 1993, but it didn't happen. Instead, Iowans are \nfacing head on a 500-year flood; more than 38,000 people have been \nevacuated from communities across eastern and central Iowa.\n  Rivers have overtaken several communities, and I cannot name all of \nthe communities, but I think of Mason City, Waverly, New Hartford, \nWaterloo, and Cedar Falls. And then Mother Nature took her toll on \nCedar Rapids, downstream from Waterloo and Cedar Falls, and hit \nCoralville and eventually Iowa City. In fact, that is two separate \nrivers doing this damaging situation. Des Moines and Columbus Junction \nand Vinton have seen the full power of the raging river as well. \nUnfortunately, there are more communities that have already seen the \nforce of these waters and many more being hit downstream.\n  Like 2 weeks ago when tornadoes hit Butler County, Iowa has been the \nrecipient of an outpouring of support from around the country. Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Chertoff in western Iowa with Governor Culver and \nFEMA Administrator Paulison were both in our State to tour the rising \nwaters, and Administrator Paulison did that with Governor Culver, \nSenator Harkin, and this Senator. It is my understanding that later on \nthis week, President Bush will come to Iowa. And when it is all said \nand done, there are no better friends to these communities than their \nown local emergency management people, the local police and the local \nfire and the Iowa National Guard members. These people have been on the \nfront line. They are analyzing each movement of water, watching \nbridges, water treatment plants, and ensuring the safety of every \ncommunity member.\n  Most importantly, though, are those who are working together just to \nhelp a neighbor or a friend. Citizens by the thousands are filling \nsandbags, prisoners from local jails are helping with sandbagging \nefforts, and volunteers for the Salvation Army and the Red Cross\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nand most of the local churches--all of the local churches, I am sure--\nare seen throughout the flooded areas offering food, water, and \nshelter.\n  Senator Harkin and I toured several communities Friday, as I \nindicated, with Administrator Paulison, the Small Business \nAdministration, and Governor Culver, who is on the job every minute of \nthe day. We did that on Friday. Of course, Governor Culver is doing it \nevery day. On Saturday, Senator Harkin and I surveyed other areas. On \nFriday, we happened to visit Des Moines, Waterloo, Cedar Rapids, Iowa \nCity, back to Des Moines. Looking down, you could hardly see a dry \npiece of land between any of those cities. Houses, businesses, and \ncrops alike are all underwater. When I say crops are underwater, I have \nto say that in some areas, whole fields, but there is not a field we \nflew over that did not have some ponding and some loss of a part of it \nat least. So crops are definitely hurt. Then on Saturday, Senator \nHarkin and I went to Mason City, Charles City, Nashua, and Waverly, and \nthen I had an opportunity to go to my downtown of New Hartford, where \nall but 2 or 3 homes out of 250 had water in them. It is devastating. \nThere is hurt everywhere. There is devastation that I never dreamt of. \nI suppose if we could remember 15 years back, Des Moines, yes, maybe. I \nought to say that I never dreamt of it. I guess I never dreamt from \nthat time that it would happen again to the extent it did in 1993.\n  We were encouraged as we traveled by the sandbaggers and their \nendless amount of resiliency to get the job done. But in the next \nmoment, we felt the hurt of those staying in shelters who had lost \neverything. As you talked to them, they obviously showed sorrow through \ntheir tears and, of course, the effort of maybe a life of work gone \ndown the drain. Yet, through it all, Iowans are coming together and \npulling through as only Iowans can as the water begins to recede in \npart of the area we entered. But do not forget that in the days to \ncome, downstream, as you move toward the Mississippi River, other \npeople are going to go through what we saw. But as the water begins to \nrecede, people are attempting to get back into their homes. It is \nobviously frustrating. It is obviously discouraging. Besides the home \nitself, probably meaning a lot more to other people are pictures of \nloved ones, ruined heirlooms handed down from grandparents that you see \nfloating even on the second floor.\n  Just as we did in 1993, and more recently, the people of Parkersburg, \nNew Hartford, Hazelton, and Dunkerton have moved forward and begun to \nrebuild. So will the people of the rest of the State of Iowa go forward \nto rebuild. It is going to take time. It is going to be weeks in some \ncases. In some cases, it is going to be years to rebuild and get back \nto where people were.\n  I am confident that we will get through this. Senator Harkin and I \nare here to help, as well as the Congressmen in the other body. We are \nmeeting regularly to discuss what we can do at the Federal level. Our \nstaffs are meeting and talking several times daily to coordinate work. \nI am confident that when it is over, we will see the resiliency of \nIowans come through, and we will all look to each other and our rebuilt \ncommunities and say, as we said: It was sad at the time, but we can do \nit. I think we will say it has been a job well done.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would be remiss if I did \nnot pay deep respect to the four Boy Scouts who lost their lives and \nalso to those who heroically and bravely helped others hurt during \nanother act of Mother Nature in western Iowa on Thursday.\n  Funeral services are being held today for 14-year-old Aaron Eilerts \nof Eagle Grove, who was killed by a tornado at Little Sioux Scout \nRanch. The other three were from Nebraska and I believe from Omaha. But \nwhether you are from Omaha or Iowa, being a Boy Scout leader and having \nthis tornado happen and losing the life of a future leader of America \nis a sadness, whether you are from Nebraska or Iowa. Boy Scouts are \noften called upon to serve as leaders of our Nation in all walks of \nlife. We lost four promising leaders far too prematurely and painfully, \nadding to the already existing hurt many in Iowa are feeling.\n  Before I yield the floor, I thank Senator Harkin for being able to \nwork closely with him, being able to travel together and see this \nsituation. I wish we did not have to be working together on this \nproject because it is sad but one that makes you proud of Iowans as \nwell. We will continue to work together to see our way through it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my senior colleague \nSenator Grassley for his many kindnesses and for working and \ncoordinating this as we did the other day. Our staffs are working very \nclosely together to do everything we can to ensure that the recovery we \nhave to do now is swift and thorough and that we do everything we can \nto assist the many volunteers in Iowa who have come forward to help.\n  We toured a lot together late last week. I am sure we will be doing \nmore this week to make sure that we are up to speed, that we know what \nis happening, that we have a firm grip on the different agencies that \nhave to come to Iowa for this tremendous cleanup effort.\n  I wanted to join with my colleague Senator Grassley in giving a \nlittle bit of a report on the events unfolding in my State of Iowa. \nSenator Grassley has covered them, but I might add of couple of things.\n  As he said, last week we toured a number of cities: Waterloo and \nCedar Falls and Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, Des Moines, Mason City, \nCharles City, Nashua, Waverly--all places hard hit by this flood. I \nneed not tell Senators--I know you have all watched it unfold on \ntelevision, on CNN and everything else--as to the devastation in our \nState. Every newspaper is covering it on the front pages, whether it is \nthe New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune or \nAtlanta or wherever you are.\n  Iowa is experiencing flooding of almost Biblical proportions. Nine \nrivers are at flood stage, 83 of our 99 counties have been declared \ndisaster areas by Governor Culver, and 54 roads and highways have been \nclosed. Interstate 80, the major east-west thoroughfare of our Nation, \nis closed and has been since--well, I think since Friday, either \nThursday or Friday. In Iowa, Interstate 80 is closed. Interstate 380, \nnorth-south, is closed, not to mention a lot of our smaller roads and \nhighways in Iowa, making it very difficult for people to even get \naround.\n  As Senator Grassley said, last Friday we were accompanied by FEMA \nAdministrator Paulison and Governor Culver, OMB Director Nussle, a \nformer Iowan. Mr. Paulison said the flooding was some of the worst to \nhit the United States since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the gulf \ncoast. I would simply add that the cresting Cedar River raging through \ndowntown Cedar Rapids is as bad as what Americans saw in Katrina in New \nOrleans in 2005.\n  You have to witness it with your own eyes to appreciate the breadth \nand the intensity of this devastation. It is very humbling when you \nmeet with so many people who have been so affected by this, lost their \nhomes, several lives lost. Thank God we kept it to a minimum--but \nlosing all of their homes, things they have built all their life. Do \nyou know what is really sad? Homes can be repaired. You can rebuild a \nhouse, you can do things again. It is so many of the personal effects \npeople lost. Because they had to leave in such a hurry because of the \nrising waters, they were not able to take a lot of their personal \neffects: mementos, pictures, albums, birth certificates--all kinds of \nthings like these that are the summation of your life, in many cases, \ngone, and those are irreplaceable. It is shocking, the devastation. \nTens of thousands have been displaced, 25,000 people in Cedar Rapids \nalone.\n  This again, as Senator Grassley pointed to one chart, is another view \nof the Cedar River here, Alliant Energy here. I will show you another \npicture shortly. The downtown area is over here. This is city hall. As \nyou can see, it is totally inundated. Of course, power is off and \neverything. This is sort of the downtown area.\n  Then I think that I have one here--yes. This is a picture I took \nmyself. I took this with a digital camera flying over it on Friday. \nThat was city hall you saw in the previous picture. But you get some \nidea of the devastation of downtown. For example, the picture Senator \nGrassley showed is right\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\ndown here. My Senate office is in this building here; of course, \ntotally inaccessible, everything is shut down. So you can begin to get \nan idea of the magnitude of it.\n  Right over here is the Quaker Oats plant. I am sorry, I cut it off. \nThis is the Quaker Oats plant. This is the largest grain milling \nfacility in the world, and it is shut down, underwater.\n  Now you begin to see some of the other neighborhoods here and how \nthey are impacted also. I wanted to see how many blocks it was. This is \na typical part of Cedar Rapids that is flooded. You can see what a \nblock would be like. You know, I cannot even tell the streets here, but \nI assume this would be a street, this would be a street, and this would \nbe a street, so that would be a block. So you have about--maybe you \nhave six or eight blocks here. There are 400 blocks like this that are \nunderwater in Cedar Rapids--400. I did not have a camera big enough, \ndid not have a lens big enough to cover it all, but 400 city blocks are \ninundated like that.\n  In Iowa City, much of the University of Iowa has been inundated. \nStudents, faculty, staff--we were there watching them sandbag. Students \nwere working, moving books from the library, artwork from the \nuniversity's gallery.\n\n  Also, it is not just our largest cities. We talk about Cedar Rapids, \nWaterloo, Des Moines, and Iowa City, but there are other smaller towns \nand communities we visited. Senator Grassley and I were in Charles City \nand Waverly. Each have more than 500 homes inundated with floodwaters. \nWe were told on Saturday one in every four residents of Waverly--one in \nevery four residents--is affected by this situation, and their houses \nare flooded.\n  We went through the downtown area of Waverly on Saturday--not a \nbusiness was open. Now, thankfully, the waters have receded because it \nis up north and the water is headed south. The waters have receded, but \nthey do not have power yet. They have all the mud and the dirt and the \ndebris to clean up.\n  Elkader had 60 homes and 30 businesses destroyed when the Turkey \nRiver went over the levee. The Anamosa sewage treatment plant failed at \ntwo different points because the levee broke. The list goes on and on.\n  I had to duck out for a minute when my colleague was talking, but \nSenator Grassley's hometown of New Hartford--you feel so sorry for \nthem. They were hit by this tornado a couple weeks ago, and a couple \npeople lost their lives. It did not hit the town squarely, but it \nnicked it and took some houses out on the north side of town. But then \nNew Hartford got flooded, and they had to evacuate the town because of \nthe flood.\n  If you fly over Iowa--and, of course, being chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee and being associated with agriculture all my \nlife, I wanted to look and see--and you look over the countryside of \nIowa, I do not know that I saw one field that was not affected with \nponding and water. Because the corn had only come up maybe a couple of \ninches, the water has covered it and it is dead. It is gone.\n  So we do not know the extent of this damage, but the Iowa Farm Bureau \nestimates that as much as 16 percent of Iowa's 25 million acres are \ncurrently under water. Now, I have to tell you, just from my own \neyeball, looking at it while flying over it over 2 days, I think it is \nhigher than that.\n  Again I say, we see nature at its worst, but we see people at their \nbest. With the sheer number of volunteers filling sandbags and helping \nout in other ways, thousands have participated. We were in Iowa City, \nand they were sandbagging up the library. You had little kids--9-, 10-\nyear-old kids, maybe some younger--holding these plastic funnels so \nthey could get the right amount of sand into the sandbags. Then they \nhad these lines set up with students and everything.\n  I saw the same thing in Des Moines: sandbaggers sandbagging 24 hours \na day. More people showed up than they could actually use to work.\n  There is no doubt, I am told by the mayor of Cedar Falls, Mayor \nCrews, that the effort of volunteers at Cedar Falls--that is right \nacross the river from Waterloo--that the thousands of sandbags--tens of \nthousands--that were filled and reinforced the levee saved the downtown \narea of Cedar Falls.\n  So everywhere Senator Grassley and I went last week, we witnessed \nIowans giving their all to help their neighbors. I would be remiss if I \ndid not mention the Iowa National Guard. Thank God for the Iowa \nNational Guard. I am glad they are here. They have been deployed a lot \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, but it is nice to know they are home now. They \nwere there to help. Over 2,500 members were mobilized. General Dardis, \nthe head of our Iowa National Guard, has done a superb job.\n  Everywhere you go you see these National Guard people out there \nworking. They are working, they are organizing, they are taking \nleadership positions. They are doing everything from filling sandbags \nto working the levees, helping people out of their homes, doing a \nmagnificent job.\n  Again, I see these National Guard kids out there. I don't know when \nthey ever sleep. It is like 24 hours a day they just keep going.\n  Well, I guess if there is any good news, it is that in Iowa City the \nwater crested yesterday. But, again, when I talk about ``over flood \nstage,'' usually when you talk about something being over flood stage, \nyou are talking about it being a few inches over. Get this: In Cedar \nRapids the old record was 20 feet set in 1929. On Friday, the river \ncrested at 32 feet--almost 12 feet higher than any time ever. We never \nhad this level of flooding. This level of flooding has never happened \nin Cedar Rapids.\n  Across eastern Iowa, flooding rivers have washed out railroad lines. \nMississippi barge traffic has come to a halt. It closed major roadways. \nAs I said, Interstate 80 is still closed.\n  Thousands of Iowa businesses, large and small, have been impacted. \nJohn Deere had to evacuate two of its plants in Waterloo. I mentioned \nthe Quaker Oats plant, as shown here on the map, in Cedar Rapids. It is \nthe largest grain processing plant in the world. It was flooded and \nleft idle.\n  In Cedar Rapids, 400 city blocks are submerged, as shown right there \non the map. That is valued at close to $750 million. Early estimates of \ndamage to Iowa's agricultural economy, I can tell you right now, will \nexceed over $1 billion. That is just agriculture.\n  Well, Iowans are a resilient and resourceful people. But, as with the \ngulf coast in the wake of Katrina, we are going to need generous \nFederal assistance to help us get back on our feet. The destruction is \nso vast that it is simply beyond the capacity of local governments and \nthe Iowa State government to handle it by themselves.\n  Now, keep in mind, when we talk about the big cities, there are so \nmany small towns and communities out there that have been hit hard that \nneed help and jobs that need to be rebuilt. It is not just Iowa. We \nhave Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Kansas, and \nMinnesota. They have all been hard hit by flooding and tornadoes.\n  I believe the hardest hit States will need to have the local matching \nfunds for FEMA assistance, which is normally 25 percent, they are going \nto have to be reduced as much as possible. I hope we can work with the \nadministrator and with President Bush to get that down as much as \npossible.\n  The Iowa delegation--on a bipartisan, bicameral basis--is preparing a \nletter right now asking the President for this relief. There is no \nconceivable way that a State with the devastation on the scale that \nSenator Grassley and I witnessed this weekend can come up with a 25-\npercent match in order to trigger the customary FEMA assistance.\n  Now, beyond that, we are going to need to move quickly in addressing \nweaknesses in our flood control systems and some other mitigation needs \nso businesses and homes can be safely repaired.\n  The full 15 percent in FEMA disaster mitigation assistance, as \nauthorized back in 1993, should be provided. It may very well make more \nsense for the State to buy homes that have been flooded so we can avoid \nhaving them flooded again in the future, with those repairs again paid \nfor with Federal flood insurance and other Federal assistance. Such \nhomes can be purchased and then permanently converted to parkland or \nother uses that will not need very costly repairs after future floods.\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\n  I might add, we had devastating floods in Iowa in 1993. We did some \nof this mitigation. Because some of those homes were removed--in fact, \nI think there is one town where basically the whole town was moved to \nhigher ground. And guess what. They did not get flooded this time. A \nlot of times it makes good sense to do that.\n  We are going to need flexible community development block grant \nfunding for infrastructure repair and home assistance. Economic \nDevelopment Administration funds for infrastructure will be needed for \nbusinesses and jobs. Corps of Engineers funding will be needed for the \nrepair and improvement of levees. We will also need Department of \nAgriculture support for a whole variety of agricultural things--from \nrepairing conservation structures to meeting new soil conservation \nproblems and cleaning up debris. Every culvert going under these roads, \nall over the State of Iowa, has been plugged up with some kind of \ndebris. Bridges--all this stuff--need to be taken out and taken out in \na hurry. So we are going to need the help of the Department of \nAgriculture on that.\n\n  So it will be several weeks, at least, before we can have an accurate \nmeasure of the total economic losses and physical destruction. Probably \nmore time than that for areas south of the water. The water is all \nmoving south, so I hate to say this, but I think northern Missouri is \nabout to get hit pretty hard. And as to the absolute southeast of Iowa, \nwe have not seen it hit the absolute southeast of Iowa yet.\n  So, again, we are going to have to get a pretty good handle on this, \nbut this is a national disaster. It requires a national response.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure Senator Grassley and I will have more to \nreport in the days ahead. But our thoughts and prayers are with the \ngood people of Iowa and neighboring States who are still struggling \nwith floodwaters or still picking up the pieces from devastating \ntornadoes.\n  Again, I want to join with Senator Grassley in thanking so many \nchurch groups in Iowa. We saw them. Every place we went, we saw church \ngroups getting together. Protestant, Catholic, evangelical--no matter \nwho--they were all getting together and setting up response teams, \ndoing an outstanding job. It was so wonderful to see these people come \ntogether and organize in that fashion.\n  Then, of course, in Cedar Rapids, some of the churches are \nunderwater. I may not have one here on this map, but I had a picture \nearlier. I had some pictures of churches that were underwater too. But \nthe church groups, religious groups in Iowa, have been wonderful.\n  On a really somber and sad note, I would, again, express my \ncondolences to the families of the Boy Scouts who were killed at Little \nSioux--a terrible tragedy--and to the families where some of the kids \nwere hurt pretty badly. Some of them are still in critical condition.\n  So we are praying for their recovery, their full recovery. But you \nlisten to the stories that came out of that Boy Scout camp, and you see \nwhat a good thing Boy Scouts is and the leadership they provided and \nhow they pulled together and helped one another. There is a lot of \nstrong leadership in these Boy Scouts.\n  So we hope their families will take some condolence in the fact that \nthese kids responded in a great leadership fashion. These young kids \nresponded as adults after that tornado hit that Boy Scout camp.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I deeply appreciate the many expressions of \nconcern and caring expressed by our Senate colleagues. I have gotten a \nlot of phone calls and messages, and I thank all my colleagues for \ntheir expressions of concern and caring.\n  We will get through it. Obviously, we will get through it. I think \nIowa will be a stronger State. We will have some tough times. I have no \ndoubt about it. A lot of people out there do not have much money. A lot \nof times it is the lowest income people along the rivers and stuff \nbecause, well, the spacing--that is where the cheapest land is, isn't \nit? That is where the lowest cost houses are, for the most part. I am \nnot saying all, but for the most part. I have seen some pretty \nbeautiful homes inundated by water too, I might add, but a lot of these \npeople are low-income people. They are elderly. They have nowhere to \nturn. As a caring nation, we have to help them put their lives together \nagain.\n  So we will be on this every day. I am pleased to hear that President \nBush--I just found this out a few minutes ago--will be coming to Iowa \non Thursday. That will be good. I hope he can see this firsthand and \nthen help us with getting those FEMA matching funds down as much as \npossible.\n  With that, again, I will be reporting more in the days ahead. But we \nare starting the clean-up process now from the most devastating flood I \nhave ever seen in all my years in the State of Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5645-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5645-S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MIDWEST FLOODING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Father's Day weekend I celebrated by \nbuying a dehumidifier. I live in the Midwest, and we have had a lot of \nrain, but I am lucky because my problems with a damp basement are \nminor--very minor--in comparison to what people all across the Midwest \nare facing. We have seen this before. I was hoping and praying we \nwouldn't see it again for a long time, but our colleagues from Iowa and \nMinnesota and others have spoken on the floor about the devastation \nthat is a result of massive flooding in the Midwest and Wisconsin as \nwell.\n  Tens of thousands of our neighbors in the Midwest have suffered \nstaggering losses and need help and our Government needs to be there, \nas promised. In my State of Illinois, the same floods that have \ndevastated our northern neighbors are now heading our way. We are in a \nrace against time and nature.\n  By Wednesday of this week, at least in the Quincy area of the \nMississippi River, we expect the Mississippi River to reach its crest. \nIt is the mightiest river in North America. It is a beautiful river and \na big part of America's history but, boy, when the rains start falling \nand all those rivers start feeding into it, the Mississippi can become \nalmost uncontrollable.\n  There are fears that the flooding along the Mississippi in Illinois \ncould reach historic levels that we experienced during the great flood \nof 1993. I know all about that one. That was a flood on my watch. I was \na Congressman in central Illinois, with a big swath of Illinois and the \nMississippi River in my district.\n  It was one of the most costly and devastating natural disasters ever \nto hit our country. It didn't come with the intensity and immediacy of \na Hurricane Katrina and certainly didn't cause the long-term \ndevastation they felt in Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  Floods in our part of the world are a gradual, building thing that \nseem like they will never go away. More than 50 people died in 1993. \nThousands were forced to evacuate their homes, as hundreds of levees \nfailed up and down the Mississippi River. The economic damage exceeded \n$15 billion.\n  The experts told us after that flood that it was a 500-year flood \nevent. So we thought we would be able to brag about that for the rest \nof our lives, and generations to come will point back to 1993. Well, \nhere we are 15 years later, and we seem to be on the verge of another \nsimilar disaster.\n  Many times, weather-related disasters, such as Katrina, give us no \nwarning. They strike in a matter of minutes, hours or days if we are \nlucky. This is different. We have seen this crisis coming for quite a \nwhile.\n  Illinoisans are working hard and fast to try to prepare for the worst \nand to minimize the damage.\n  Last Friday, when the Senate adjourned, I went back to my home State \nand drove over to Quincy on the Central Illinois Expressway and met \nwith Mayor John Spring and then went down to Grafton, IL, and met with \nMayor Richard Mosby. Senator Obama was in Quincy on Saturday.\n  In those cities and towns up and down the Mississippi River, people \nare\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nfilling sandbags as fast as they can do it. They are fortifying \nexisting levees and creating levees to protect businesses and homes and \nvaluable infrastructure.\n  I commend all the residents, volunteers, emergency workers, and the \nmore than 400 members of the Illinois National Guard, who are working \nto brace our State for these floodwaters. Many people are working \naround the clock.\n  That is one of the nice things about this great Nation. I take \nspecial pride in the Midwest, which is where my roots are. When an \nemergency such as this arises, I have watched how people rally around \nand try to help.\n  Again, I was with Mayor Spring in Quincy on Friday. People were \nliterally spending their entire day filling sandbags. It is hard work; \nmany times it is back-breaking work, repetitive. But the spirit in that \nmeeting place was as good as anyplace I have ever been. They all felt \nthey were pulling together for their neighbors, their community, their \ncity, and for their State. They felt a special kinship.\n  It is not unusual, of course, to see the great efforts of the Red \nCross. They are always there trying to help people along, providing a \nsandwich and a bottle of water to the folks who need it when they are \nworking. Also, other volunteers, including folks at a age where they \ncould not pitch in and fill a sandbag, but they were making sandwiches \nand cookies to bring to the volunteers. It is that kind of a community \noutpouring that means so much.\n  The official Government agencies were sure there doing their part, \nincluding FEMA and our Illinois counterpart, coordinating the disaster \nresponse, along with the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Over the weekend, two levees in our State--in the towns of Carman and \nKeithsburg--failed. Hundreds of residents in those towns have left \ntheir homes. Another levee broke last week in the town of \nLawrenceville, on the east side of the State, and residents are \nstranded there without drinkable water.\n  Floodwaters are starting to seep into other towns along the river. \nHeavy rains are still falling north of us, pushing the river higher by \nthe day.\n  Our Governor has already declared 15 counties in Illinois State \ndisaster areas.\n  At the urging of Senator Obama and myself, Governor Blagojevich wrote \nto President Bush and asked him to declare a number of Mississippi \nRiver counties Federal disaster areas. Quincy is preparing for the \nworst. The river is expected to crest at 32 feet. One of the main \nconcerns there is the water intake plants that provide water for the \nregion. If it goes down, it may take months to restore it. That will be \na hardship on a lot of people we hope to avoid.\n  I was with GEN Bill Enyart, head of the Illinois National Guard, \nFriday night. I said: Bill, I hope that as a special project the \nIllinois National Guard will join with Mayor John Spring to try to \nprotect that waterworks. It is important. Bill answered the call \nimmediately and called Mayor John Spring and sent 100 members of the \nAir Force National Guard there to start sandbagging around the water \ntreatment plant, trying to save it before the river crests on \nWednesday. All those volunteers and emergency workers--even State \nprisoners released from the local prisons and correction camps--are \nworking side by side to fill sandbags.\n  I also wish to say a word about State Senator John Sullivan in that \narea. He rolled up his sleeves immediately and went to work. I was with \nhim Friday. He is roaming up and down the river trying to make sure he \ngives a helping hand where needed. He calls State and Federal agencies \nto see where they can be of assistance. He is a terrific public \nservant, and I was glad to be with him at that time.\n  Senator Obama came to Quincy over the weekend and looked at the \nsituation and pitched in as well, filling sandbags, and he was able to \nsee how our State is being affected.\n  The volunteers worked through Father's Day. The celebration with \nfamily was short-lived. They tried to do their best to tame the mighty \nMississippi River. These volunteers are demonstrating amazing spirit. A \nflood is a devastating prospect to face and envision. But these folks \nhave responded with resolve and determination. I am proud of them, and \nI am so proud to represent them. Their work may save homes, businesses, \nand lives. Every sandbag that is filled may make it much easier for \ncommunities to get back on their feet when the floodwaters recede.\n  State and local leaders in Illinois are also working around the clock \nto prepare for the worst. We know, from looking at neighboring States, \nthat the severity of this flood will be more than the people of \nIllinois alone can absorb.\n  The magnitude of this disaster will require action from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I have stood in Congress for over 20 years, and every time some \nsection of our Nation has been victimized by a disaster, I have always \nfelt that is when we come together as an American family, when we draw \non our national treasure and the efforts of American workers across the \ncountry to come to the rescue of our neighbors in trouble. Well, now it \nis time for the Midwest to ask for that help.\n  I know this Congress and President will be forthcoming. They have \ndone a good job so far. We have to make certain we give them all the \ntools they need to move quickly back home to prepare for the worst, to \ntry to avoid tragedies that can be avoided, and then to clean up \nafterwards and get on with their lives.\n  Senator Obama and I will work with the Illinois congressional \ndelegation to ensure that the communities and the people affected do \nnot face this disaster alone. America and this Congress and Senate will \nstand with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5646-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a couple of hours we are going to be \nvoting again on cloture and we will be making a choice between two \ndifferent points of view. We did this 2 weeks ago, a week ago last \nThursday, and the result was that cloture was not invoked on the House-\npassed so-called tax extenders package, and I think the same result \nwill end up being the case this evening.\n  It is essentially a choice between the Democratic leadership trying \nto do this in a partisan way by simply bringing up the House bill and \ntrying to push that through, or getting together, as we have done in \nthe past, in a bipartisan way, to ensure that the tax provisions we all \nsupport and we all want extended into law are done in a way that does \nnot require that taxes be increased in some other part of the Tax Code.\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n  Republicans do not believe it makes sense to keep existing tax policy \nright where it is by having to raise taxes in another part of our \neconomy, sometimes on the very same people who are paying the tax we \nare extending. Extending current tax policy is not a tax cut. Extending \ncurrent tax policy is just that, it is maintaining the status quo, and \nwe don't believe we should have some rule, in effect, that says when we \ncontinue exactly what we have in tax rates, somehow or other we have to \nraise other taxes in order to pay for that. That doesn't make any \nsense.\n  It is basically the difference between two philosophies. The \nRepublican philosophy starts with the proposition that money belongs to \nthe people--we the people--and we send a certain amount of that back to \nWashington and to our States to help run a government that we all \nunderstand we need to pay for. But originally the money belongs to the \npeople. And the question is, How much can the people afford to give up? \nIn times of economic downturn, such as we are facing today, it is not \nwise policy to take a lot of money from the private sector. In fact, we \nmade a decision, the President and the Congress, to actually give back \nsome of that money to the taxpayers. It was the tax rebate, the so-\ncalled stimulus package. Some people have already received their $300 \nor $600 checks. The idea is when we have an economic situation such as \nwe do today, you don't take more money from the people. If anything, \nyou try to help them keep what they have.\n  There are those on the other side, however, the Democratic side, who \nhave a different view. They start with the premise that the Federal \nGovernment and how much money it has and how much money presumably it \nneeds--and if the Federal Government needs more money because Congress \nis spending more money--then where else are we going to get it? Well, \nwe have to take it from the people. If the Federal Government has a tax \nrate or a tax policy, such as a research and development tax credit \nthat expired last year and we want to continue to provide that for this \nyear, these people believe we need to tax the private sector. We need \nto tax taxpayers more money in order to, in effect, make up for the \nextension of that research and development tax credit.\n  Now, we don't think you have to make up for anything. You are keeping \nit exactly where it is today. You are not cutting taxes, you are \nkeeping taxes right where they are. The other side says, no, we have a \nrule called pay-go, and it means even if we keep taxes exactly where \nthey are today, we have to raise taxes to, in effect, pay for that. It \nis a nonsense policy. It hurts the private sector, it hurts businesses, \nit hurts American families, and it is the last thing you want to do in \na time of economic downturn. That is why we have two different \nphilosophies here. Our philosophy tonight says vote no on this cloture \npetition, because at the end of the day we all understand we are going \nto extend the current tax policy, we are going to extend the research \nand development tax credit and all of the other similar policies, but \nwe don't have to raise taxes to do that. So we are not going to do \nthat. There is an easy way and a hard way, in other words, to get this \ndone.\n  There are some other things wrong with the House bill. Even if that \nwere the basic debate, there are some other reasons why we wouldn't \nwant to take up the bill that is coming to us from the House in the \nfirst place. For one thing, it doesn't do something very important, and \nthat is to extend the relief from the alternative minimum tax, or the \nso-called AMT. This was a tax originally designed to hit millionaires \nand it ended up, in effect, hitting everybody else.\n  In fact, this year there are something like 23 million people--23 \nmillion filers--who would be affected by the alternative minimum tax if \nwe did not once again relieve them from that liability. So each year we \npass a bill that says you don't have to worry about paying the AMT this \nyear. Actually, last year it was 23 million and this year it is 25 \nmillion more taxpayers who will face an unwelcome tax increase, \naveraging about $2,000 of tax liability. That, again, is absolutely the \nwrong policy in a time of economic downturn. Frankly, it is the wrong \npolicy anytime.\n  There is another thing wrong with the House bill. It includes a $45 \nbillion tax increase on certain businesses. We want people to be able \nto do business overseas as well as here in the United States. It is \ngood for us when we have businesses competing abroad. About $45 billion \nof new tax increases will be piled on those businesses with two \nparticular provisions of the House bill, in effect amounting to double \ntaxation of the people working for those businesses when they are \nworking abroad.\n  Without getting into the details of that, we all understand what \nthose two provisions are. They deal with deferred compensation from \ncertain employers who would be treated less favorably than other \nemployers in the United States, and delaying the implementation of some \nnew tax rules that would allow worldwide interest for foreign tax \ncredit purposes.\n  Again, given the fact that we are in an economic downturn right now, \nwhy would we want to raise taxes, particularly on those industries we \nare encouraging to do business abroad to help bring more revenues into \nthe United States? Again, these two provisions would make the United \nStates less competitive, not more competitive.\n  Incidentally, the administration has indicated it would veto the bill \nif these tax increases are in there. Obviously, we want to get these \ntax extenders done, and therefore don't need the delay of a \nPresidential veto, Congress sustaining the veto, and having to start \nall over again.\n  Another thing wrong with the House tax package is it only extended \nthe expiring provisions, such as the research and experimentation tax \ncredit, for 1 year, notwithstanding that we prefer that be done for 2 \nyears--for the year in which they have already expired and for next \nyear as well.\n  It also included some new tax earmarks. What are some of these tax \nearmarks? One is it requires that projects financed with the so-called \nnew clean renewable energy bonds be subject to the prevailing wages \nrequirement of the Davis-Bacon Act. What this, in effect, says is if \nyou have a Federal project here, you are going to have to pay a much \nhigher wage rate to the people doing the work. The net result of the \nconstruction project is it is far more expensive than it would be if \nyou could simply bid it out under normal bidding processes.\n  Many reputable studies have estimated that Davis-Bacon inflates \nFederal construction costs by anywhere from 5 percent to 39 percent. I \nhave seen that right in my own home State of Arizona. Rather than \npaying the Davis-Bacon wage rate for a small Federal facility in \nsouthern Arizona, they decided to use existing mobile homes--which was \ntotally inadequate, but at least it saved money from having to do the \nDavis-Bacon construction add-ons. So if we are going to create an \nincentive to build more renewable energy production, I am not sure why \nat the very time you would want to intentionally increase the project's \ncosts by subjecting it to Davis-Bacon.\n  Another problem with the bill--a new tax earmark, in effect--is it \ncreates a new standard deduction for property taxes, but it is \nessentially an indirect transfer because it does not prohibit local \ngovernments from raising their taxes, entirely offsetting any benefit \nto local taxpayers. In other words, it says you can offset certain \nState taxes. It doesn't prevent the States from increasing those taxes, \nso that in effect all of the taxpayers around the country are \nsubsidizing the State that raised its taxes. The CBO suggests that, in \ngeneral, the deduction for State and local taxes is a subsidy to \nwealthier communities. It deters States from financing local services \nwith nondeductible things like user fees that are much more efficient.\n  Another thing the House bill does, another one of its tax earmarks, \nis to include an unprecedented tax earmark for New York. Tax credits \nare, by design, intended for individuals and businesses that actually \npay taxes, not cities that do not pay taxes. But in this bill, there is \nan explicit tax credit for the city of New York, which does not pay \ntaxes. How does it work? What they propose to do is give a tax credit \nof $2 billion to build a new rail line from Lower Manhattan, even \nthough New York has no Federal income tax liability. What they would do \nin effect\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nis relieve the State from its payroll tax liability. All employers have \nto pay a payroll tax. What this would do is, when the city of New York \npays payroll taxes for people on its payroll, the Federal Government \nwould pay back the city. That is a very bad precedent, and it should \nnot be included in this legislation.\n  But my favorite of all--we have not done enough for trial lawyers. It \nseems we need to help the poor, struggling trial lawyers, whose faces \nwe have seen frequently, recently, in publications such as the Wall \nStreet Journal, because they have been indicted and are going off to \njail. But we need to help these trial lawyers because it seems it costs \nthem a lot of money when they prosecute these class actions, on which \nthey make hundreds of millions of dollars. They have to hire witnesses. \nThey have to put out other money as expenses. That used to be a \nviolation of ethics. When I went to law school, it was called champerty \nand maintenance. You couldn't do it. It was unethical for lawyers to \npay the upfront expenses of these lawsuits because lawyers were \nexplicitly not deemed to be businesses but, rather, professions. I do \nnot know when the law profession failed to be a profession, but \napparently it has because now the trial lawyers want a usual and \nordinary business expense deduction for the expenses of these \ncontingent-fee lawsuits. It is $1.6 billion. I don't think the American \ntaxpayers need to be subsidizing trial lawyers to the extent of $1.6 \nbillion, but it is in this bill, and it is another reason we should not \nagree to take up this bill--that is to say we should deny cloture on \nthis bill.\n  There is a perfectly good alternative here; that is, bipartisan \nnegotiation that would do similar to what we did last year, to provide \nthe expiring tax relief here another year or two of extension, to \nextend the alternative minimum tax, to do these things without raising \ntaxes either on the same taxpayers or on other taxpayers. We could \nprovide tax relief for members of the military and veterans, incentives \nfor charitable giving, a deduction for higher education expenditures \nand teacher classroom expenses, do the subpart F active financing and \nlook-through exceptions. These are provisions that are very important \nfor American businesses to be competitive.\n  All these things are in the Republican alternative. I believe that \nbecause they represent good tax policy, they would be agreed to on a \nbipartisan basis. Certainly, the chairman of the Finance Committee has \nbeen supportive of, I think, all of these provisions as well. It would \nalso extend and improve the expiring energy tax incentives for \nalternative energy production and solar power that Senators Cantwell \nand Ensign added to the housing bill. It would do all of these things \nwithout raising taxes.\n  These are provisions that I suggest we could negotiate as soon as \ncloture is rejected on this bill.\n  Let me conclude by making the point that delaying further is costly \nto taxpayers. Enacting the bill solely last year prevented more than 13 \nmillion taxpayers from being able to file their returns and delayed \ntheir refunds for several weeks into the filing session. We need to get \non with this. We need to get to the bipartisan discussions. We can \nnegotiate a bill, and we can get it passed in a matter of days if we do \nthat.\n  Businesses need to be able to tell those with whom they do business, \ntheir stockholders and the people they get money from, whether they can \ntake advantage of these important tax benefits such as the R tax \ncredit. The fact that this tax credit has already expired should be \nenough to convince us that we need to do this as soon as possible. This \nhelps keep American businesses competitive. It is one of the key things \nwe can do. For example, France has a 50-percent R tax credit, and \nChina offers a 150-percent deduction for R expenditures. Clearly, the \nUnited States needs to get back in this game.\n  As I said before, we need to provide the AMT relief. The bickering \nbetween the two Houses on this is doing nothing but hurting American \ntaxpayers. I think we should recognize right now it is not going to be \nsubjected to pay-go. There are not going to be new taxes raised in \norder to provide relief from the AMT. I think everybody knows that.\n  We might as well get to the job of negotiating a bill and getting it \ndone. We have already voted three times in support of this policy, once \nat the end of last year--that vote was 88 to 5. Last month, we extended \nthe energy tax extenders, 88 to 8. And last week in the cloture vote \nthat I indicated, that failed 50 to 46. I think it is clear we can get \nto the end of this. Everybody agrees we need to do so. It is just a \nquestion of how and a question of time. We can do it the easy way. We \ncan do it the hard way. We can either get it done now or we can take a \nlot of time. I think most of us and most of our taxpaying constituents \nagree it would be better if we can get it done now, if we can do it the \neasy way, and they can begin planning for their futures.\n  I urge all our colleagues at our 5:30 vote to vote no again. We took \nthis vote before. The vote should not be any different. Once that is \ndone, we can get down to the bipartisan negotiations that will actually \nresult in legislation that we can pass and the President can sign and \nthat will be to the advantage of American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was on one of the Sunday weekend shows \nand was joined by one of my colleagues on the Republican side. The \ndiscussion on that program was about oil and gas prices and energy \ndevelopment. My colleague on the Republican side quite predictably \nsaid: Well, the problem is the Democrats do not want to produce any \nmore oil. They stand in the way of producing oil.\n  It is such a canard. I wanted to come to the floor to talk about that \na bit and also to talk about the fact that we are going to vote at 5:30 \ntoday on energy tax credits for renewables. Then we will see who in \nthis Chamber does want to produce some energy, because we have had \nchances before, and the Republican side of the aisle, the minority \nside, has blocked our ability to produce.\n  I want to talk a little bit about that. I know they tend to think \nthat unless you are sinking a hole in the ground someplace and sucking \noil out someplace on the planet, you are not producing. Well, I happen \nto believe there are plenty of places to begin producing additional oil \nin this country. But drilling alone is not going to solve our problem. \nThere are other things we must do that represent change that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle simply cannot embrace; that \nis, being aggressive on renewable forms of energy, wind energy, solar \nenergy, biomass, and biofuels. It goes on and on. They do not consider \nthat additional production, I guess.\n  Let me talk first about this issue of the alternative and renewable \nforms of energy. In 1916 this country put in place robust, permanent \ntax incentives to say to people: If you go looking for oil and gas, \ngood for you, we want you to do it. We are going to give you some big \ntax breaks. That was put in place almost a century ago.\n  Here is what this country has done for renewable energy. In 1992 they \nput in place a production tax credit, a short-term, fairly shallow tax \nincentive if you want to produce renewable energy. It has been extended \nfive times\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nsince 1992, short term. It has been allowed to expire three times. So \nwe have had the stutter-stop, stutter-start approach to dealing with \nthe production tax credit for renewable energy.\n  This chart shows what happens every single time it has not been \nextended. The investment falls off the shelf. Last year, last June, we \nhad a bill on the floor of the Senate that said, let us extend this for \na long period.\n  I have a bill I introduced that said, I think the Congress and this \ncountry should say here is where we are headed. For 10 years we have \nbeen so dependent on the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the \nVenezuelans, and others for oil. Sixty percent of our oil comes from \noff our shores. We need to be less dependent, and one way to do that is \nto produce renewable energy right here at home.\n  So last June we put a bill on the floor of the Senate that said, for \n5 years you can count on the production tax credit to pursue incentives \nfor wind and solar and all of those kinds of renewable energies that \nare available to us. Here is the tax incentive for you for the next \nhalf of a decade.\n  Guess what. Thirty-four Republicans voted against it and killed it. \nThey did not want to do that. Now they are talking about how much they \nwant to produce energy. Well, let me talk about this production of \nenergy. I happen to think, one voice here, we ought to produce in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico.\n  If you take a look at where the oil is, the hood ornament for their \ndiscussion is always ``ANWR,'' one of the most pristine areas in \nAmerica, set aside in legislation signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. The \nother side always says, well, ANWR, we have got to produce in ANWR.\n  Even John McCain votes against producing in ANWR. John McCain said, I \ndo not think you ought to produce in the Everglades, in the Grand \nCanyon, I do not think you ought to drill in ANWR. So enough about \nthat.\n  If you take a look at where the oil is, on the outer continental \nshelf in the Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast, off of Alaska, by far \nthe most significant reserves of oil are in the Gulf of Mexico, both \nthe western gulf and the eastern gulf.\n  The area off of Florida in the eastern gulf ought to be open, in my \njudgment. But even more interesting are the Cuban waters just south of \nFlorida. Many countries have leases to drill off Cuba's coast, \nincluding Spain, Canada, India. China is actually drilling onshore in \nCuba, but we expect China to be wanting to drill offshore also. Our oil \ncompanies want to drill there. There is estimated to be half a million \nbarrels a day production off Cuba. But we cannot produce there. Our \ncompanies cannot go in because we have this embargo with respect to \nCuba, and the Bush administration is insistent on tightening the \nembargo rather than loosening the embargo. So there are half a million \nbarrels a day of production there that our companies cannot go get.\n  Now, my colleagues introduced a piece of legislation on the \nRepublican side for additional production, but it does not include \nproducing in the eastern Gulf or off of Cuba. They do not want to \nproduce there. So are they for production? Is that what they are \ntalking about, or is this a big sham? We know they do not want to \nproduce sustainable amounts of renewable energy because they have voted \nagainst it. They say they are voting against it because the bill \nincreases taxes.\n  Let me tell you what it increases. It says to big hedge fund managers \nthat they should invest in renewable energy because the government is \ngoing to invest in them over the long-term. By the way, the person who \nruns hedge funds and made the most income last year made $3.7 billion. \nIf you are wondering, that is going home to say: Honey, I had a pretty \ngood month, I made $308 million this month. That is making enough so \nthat 4 minutes of work equals the average working man's salary for an \nentire year.\n  By the way, they get to pay a 15-percent income tax rate, which I \nthink is an outrage. But even more than that, they have a game in which \nthey defer a portion of their income tax by moving it offshore.\n  This legislation shuts that down and thereby raises the money to pay \nfor some of our investment in renewable energy. The other side is upset \nabout that. We are shutting down a tax scam for the wealthiest \nindividuals. It is pretty unbelievable. I don't want to hear any more \nnoise, deep sounds from the chest masquerading as thoughtful symbols \nfrom the brain, about production. The fact is, I believe in production. \nThat is one part of addressing the issue. One part of it is producing \noil. But a much more important part is renewable energy because we need \nto change the way we have been doing things.\n  We are so unbelievably dependent on Saudi oil and oil coming from \ntroubled parts of the world. It makes no sense. We have an enormous \nappetite for oil. We sink little straws in this planet every single day \nand suck oil out. We suck out 85 million barrels a day, and we use one-\nfourth of it in a little place called the United States. Sixty percent \nof what we use comes from off our shores, much of it from troubled \nparts of the world, and almost 70 percent of that we use in vehicles.\n  We need to do a lot of things here, and we need to do a lot of things \nright to make us less dependent on foreign sources of oil. We need to \nmake our vehicles more efficient, to conserve energy in every single \nway, to make all of our appliances more efficient. There is so much we \nhave to do right, including produce more renewable energy.\n  We will have a chance in an hour and 15 minutes to vote once again on \nfunding renewable energy. Most of my colleagues voted against it just \ndays ago. I hope they have had some kind of epiphany recently and will \ndecide that was the wrong vote and today they will cast the right vote.\n  Let me talk for a moment about what people are doing today as they \ndrive up to the gas pump with their vehicles. They are driving their \ncar up to the pump trying to figure out: How much can I afford? I have \nto stop at the grocery store on the way home. Or: I just bought \nmedicine. How much can I afford to put in the gas tank?\n  They put whatever they can in that tank. And by the way, the OPEC \nnations smile all the way to the bank as they deposit our money. The \nbig oil companies smile all the way to the bank as they deposit the \nrest of our money. But there is no justification for the current price \nof gas and oil. None. This market system is broken. It doesn't work.\n  There are three things that are making oil more expensive: No. 1, we \nhave OPEC which is a cartel. That would be illegal in our country. But \na bunch of oil ministers get together in a closed room and make \njudgments as a cartel. No. 2, we have big oil companies--much bigger \nbecause they were all given the green light to merge in recent years. \nThey all now have two names--ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips. They are \nbigger and stronger.\n  Finally, what I want to talk about is the issue of the futures \nmarket, which is the third piece that is simply broken. The futures \nmarket is an unbelievable carnival of speculation. It is supposed to be \nan orderly market by which people can hedge who are involved in the oil \nbusiness. Now we have hedge funds, investment banks. We have all kinds \nof speculators, who will never be interested in ever taking delivery of \noil, engaged in the futures market and driving up the price of oil and \ngas in a way that makes it at least 20 to 30 percent higher priced than \na normal supply-demand market would justify.\n  In every month but one since January of this year, our crude oil \nstocks have increased. Let me say that again. In every month but one \nsince January of this year, our inventory of crude oil stocks has \nincreased. So supply is increasing.\n  On the other hand, people are driving slightly less, and there is a \ndecrease in demand. So since January, you have both an increase in \nsupply and a decrease in demand. What has happened to the price of oil \nand gas? It has gone up like a Roman candle. That means the market is \nbroken.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what I think is happening in this \nmarket. Let me put up a picture of NYMEX. This is where they trade some \nof these oil commodity stocks. Some of it is what I call dark money, \ntraded on exchanges that are not regulated or over the counter and \ncan't be seen. This is the way it looks.\n  Let me quote Clarence Cazalot, CEO of Marathon Oil. He said last \nyear:\n\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\n\n       $100 oil is not justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  Stephen Simon, senior vice president of Exxon said:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-$55 a barrel.\n\n  Right now oil is flirting with $140 a barrel.\n  Let me say, when Exxon is going to the bank with our money to make a \ndeposit, they have to be happy. But they are not using that money to \ninvest in new production. In 2007, they used $31 billion of profit to \nbuy back their stock and only $15 billion to invest in new drilling. \nThey used twice as much money to buy back their stock in the stock \nmarket as they did to explore for new oil.\n  From the New Jersey Star Ledger:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of Exxon Mobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years it now adds 20 to 30 percent or more \n     to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  A man named Fidel Gheit, who testified before the Energy Committee, \nhas worked for 30 years with Oppenheimer Company. He is the senior \nenergy person at Oppenheimer. He says:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall . . . \n     It's open 24/7.\n\n  Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. This is like a highway with \nno cops and no speed limit and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n  With that backdrop, here is what has happened to the amount of \nspeculation in the commodities market. It has gone up, up, and up just \nexactly like the price of oil and gas.\n  The question is, should the Congress do nothing about this or should \nthe Congress do something? If the answer is the Congress should do \nsomething, then what? My belief is we have a responsibility to do \nsomething. Many of my colleagues believe it as well. There is nothing \nwrong with speculation. Markets often work with speculators. But when \nspeculation becomes excessive, there is something wrong because the \nmarket then doesn't work.\n  Will Rogers described this sort of thing 80 years ago. He described \npeople buying things they will never get from people who never had it \nand making money on both sides of the transaction. I guess that is all \nright if the speculation is not doing something that damages the \nAmerican economy or injures most American consumers. But these are not \nfree markets. There is no free market. I hear all these folks talking \nabout: You have a free market. What you really need is more production. \nSink a few wells here and there.\n  But they are not even genuine about that, as I just described to you. \nThey are not very interested in sinking wells off the coast of Florida, \nfor example. Let me show that chart again. I know why, when the \nminority party put up their proposal, they didn't want to sink wells in \nthe Eastern Gulf of Mexico, which offers a significant opportunity. One \nof their Members, one of their Senators, is concerned about drilling \noff of Florida, so they leave that off their list. I know why they \ndon't want to suggest that we should be able to drill for oil off of \nCuba. Spain has a lease to drill off of Cuba. Canada also has a lease. \nIndia has a lease to drill off of Cuba. I know why the minority isn't \npushing to allow American companies to drill off of Cuba. President \nGeorge W. Bush is the one who says we can't do that. So they don't want \nto talk about subjects that are uncomfortable. They just want to bleat \nabout the issue of ``production'' from their standpoint.\n  Production means a number of things. Production means, yes, producing \nsome more oil. The largest assessment in history of the lower 48 States \nof recoverable oil was made 2 months ago by the U.S. Geological Survey \nat my request. They studied what is called the Bakken shale in Montana \nand North Dakota. There is dramatic new drilling and a lot of \nadditional production there right now. They concluded that 3.6 to 4.3 \nbillion barrels of recoverable oil, using today's technology, exists. I \nsupport drilling in the Bakken. We are drilling. We have some 70 to 80 \ndrilling rigs active in the Bakken shale right now. But we are going to \nvote at 5:30 on another question of production. Then I want to see who \ncomes to the floor to talk about production in the future.\n  Do they really want to produce enough renewable energy to help us \nreduce our dependence on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq and \nVenezuela? I hope so.\n  We have to get over this notion that the only kind of production that \nmatters is sinking a well someplace. We could produce, and have been \nproducing, billions of gallons of fuel for vehicles in farm fields. We \nare now up very close to 9 billion gallons, and we are headed much \nhigher than that. We also can produce substantial electricity from \nwind, except that when we try to do anything other than increase the \nproduction tax credit by 12 months, the other side objects. Again, \nwhether it is a production tax credit for wind or solar energy or other \nrenewable energy sources, this Congress and this country ought to not \njust talk about 12 months. We ought to say: Here is where America is \nheaded. We understand this is a serious problem. We believe we are \ngoing to produce substantial amounts of renewable energy. Other \ncountries have done it.\n  Brazil is an example. We are going to do this in a way that allows \nall of us to understand we must be less dependent on foreign sources of \noil.\n  We can do that. We went to the Moon in 9 years. Do you think we can't \nfind a way to be less dependent on foreign oil? I believe we can. But \nwe can't do it, if at 5:30 today the minority still objects to having \nhedge fund managers who make billions pay their fair share of taxes and \nobjects to what we would use that money to pay for, and that is \nextending the renewable energy tax credits so that we become less \ndependent on foreign oil and produce more energy from renewable forms \nof energy. That is just a fact.\n  At 5:30 today we will have plenty of opportunity to see who really \nsupports additional production. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we might \nbe joined by the minority and see if we can't put this country on a \ntrack to produce much more energy from renewable sources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                              Trade Policy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the goal of trade policy is to lift up \nworkers at home and abroad. Americans support trade, plenty of it, but \ntrade that allows small businesses and manufacturers to thrive. Wrong-\nheaded trade pacts following the failed NAFTA model have too often \nbetrayed middle-class families from Lima to Zaynesville, from New York \nto California, and destroyed communities in rural and urban areas. In \nmy State, more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since \n2001. Many of them, most of them, have gone overseas. Across the \ncountry, more than 3 million manufacturing jobs since President Bush \ntook the oath of office have been eliminated. Trade policy hurts \ncommunities such as Ashtebula and Middletown, Toledo and Findlay, and \nMansfield and Tiffin. That is why voters in Ohio have sent a message \nloudly and clearly demanding a new direction, a very different \ndirection for our Nation's trade policy.\n  Over the last 8 years, we have had, at best, a fractured approach to \ntrade. In the last 2 years, since voters elected candidates who support \nsmart, fair trade--not this orthodox free trade which clearly has not \nworked--Congress has reasserted itself in trade policymaking with \nsome--I underscore ``some''--improvements to proposed deals with Peru, \nPanama, Colombia, and South Korea. We have also chosen on behalf of \nworkers not to grant President Bush a renewal of fast track, of trade \npromotion authority so the President can continue his failed trade \npolicy.\n  The American public said no in 2006. This Congress--the Senate and \nacross the building in the House--said no to this continued failed \ntrade policy. Yet these improvements we have made have not rebuilt a \nconsensus on good trade policy. We have opposed bad trade policy. We \nneed to build a consensus on a different direction.\n  Now more than ever Americans reject the current model. It is time to \nlearn from our mistakes, to make plans to fix them in future \nagreements. The Trade Reform, Accountability, Development, and \nEmployment Act--the TRADE Act--which Senator Dorgan, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Casey, Senator Whitehouse, and I introduced this month--is a \nstep toward that change.\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\n  This legislation serves as a template for how to craft a trade \nagreement that works for workers, for business owners, for our \nneighborhoods, for our communities, and for our country.\n  This legislation mandates a Government Accountability Office review \nof existing trade agreements and will require the President to submit \nrenegotiation plans for those agreements before negotiating any new \nagreements--basically a timeout before we pass more of these NAFTA-\nstyle, NAFTA-modeled trade agreements.\n  The TRADE Act will create a committee comprised of House and Senate \nleaders who will review the President's plan for renegotiation. The \nbill spells out standards for future trade agreements and will protect \ndeveloping nations from exploitation by drug companies, energy \ncompanies, and financial institutions.\n  The TRADE Act also sets out criteria for a new negotiating process--\none that would do away with the fundamentally flawed fast-track trade \npromotion process and return power to Congress, which is what our \nConstitution says, when considering our Nation's trade pacts.\n  No more charging the President, if you will, with negotiating these \ntrade agreements behind closed doors, with lobbyists for financial \ninterests and banks and insurance companies and oil companies and \npharmaceutical companies standing outside the door, passing notes to \nthese trade negotiators.\n  We take for granted our clean air, safe food, and safe drinking \nwater. But these blessings are not by chance. They result from rules \nand laws about wages, about health, about the environment. Flawed trade \npolicy, as we now know, accelerates the importation of toxic toys, \ncontaminated toothpaste, and poisonous pet food--ingredients that kill \npeople in drugs such as heparin.\n  It does not have to be this way. We have a choice. We can continue a \nrace to the bottom in wages, worker safety, and environmental and \nhealth standards. We know what that race to the bottom means. It means \nlost manufacturing jobs. It means the stagnation of wages. It means \nimporting toxic toys from China. It means importing the ingredients \nthat come to us in heparin and other drugs that have literally killed \nAmericans. Or we can use trade agreements to lift up standards abroad \nand in this country--not threaten workers and consumers.\n  We can continue down the path of the failed NAFTA model or we can \nnegotiate trade agreements that result in the creation of manufacturing \njobs, increased wages, and a reduction of the trade deficit by \nproviding fair and transparent market access.\n  We can use our trade laws as a chit in negotiations or we can \npreserve the ability of the United States to enforce domestic trade \nlaws to address the negative impacts of currency manipulation, \nfinancial instability, and high debt burdens on U.S. trade \nrelationships.\n  We can continue to use trade deals to lock in--to lock in--\nprotections for Wall Street, the drug companies, and the oil companies \nor we can create a predictable structure for international trade \nwithout providing corporations with overreaching privileges and rights \nof private enforcement that undermine our laws.\n  Middle-class families, American manufacturers, farmers, and community \nleaders across this country know we need a very different direction in \ntrade. The TRADE Act is supported by more than a dozen labor unions, \nboth the AFL-CIO and Change to Win. It is supported by the Sierra Club, \nthe National Farmers Union, and the National Family Farm Coalition.\n  We know a different direction in trade policy in this country is \nsupported by a coalition of religious leaders, human rights activists, \nadvocates for children and families, environmental groups, family farm \ngroups, and labor groups.\n  I am going to ask my leadership and my caucus to work with me on this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with my allies on the other side \nof the aisle to work with me in restoring our trade policy--fair trade, \nsmart trade, a very different direction for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5651-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5651-S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President. I must say I am puzzled why a Republican \nminority voted last week to prevent the Senate from even proceeding to \nthe consideration of a bill--H.R. 6049, the Energy Independence and Tax \nRelief Act of 2008--designed to bring down sky-high oil and gasoline \nprices, promote clean and renewable energy, create good jobs here in \nAmerica, and put our Nation on a path to energy security. I am equally \npuzzled at the opposition to the provisions being paid for by closing a \ntax loophole on offshore income made by hedge fund managers. The \nAmerican people need our help and we have a bill that would provide \nmuch needed relief to American families and yet we can't even get \nenough votes to legislate on the bill.\n  The price of crude oil on the spot market is approaching $140 per \nbarrel, nearly double the price of 1 year ago. When President Bush took \noffice, a gallon of regular gas cost $1.46 and a gallon of diesel fuel \ncost $1.53. Today, those prices are at all-time highs, with regular gas \ncosting $4.02 per gallon and diesel fuel costing $4.77 per gallon. A \nnew poll indicates that 60 percent of Americans are reducing spending \non other priorities because of rising gas prices. One-half of all \nhouseholds with incomes below $20,000 say they face severe hardships \nbecause of soaring gas prices. Clearly, the status quo is intolerable, \nbut the minority won't even let the Senate consider bills to address \nthese problems, much less pass them. As I said, I find that puzzling. \nGenerally speaking, the legislative process works best when we are \nactually legislating.\n  Last week, the Senate fell 10 votes short of invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 6049. I am pleased to see that we are going \nto try again to invoke cloture; I hope we prevail this time. In \naddition to promoting our Nation's energy security, this bill provides \ncritical tax relief for families and businesses, which is why I am a \ncosponsor of substitute amendment Senator Baucus hopes to offer to this \nbill if we can get to it.\n  The Energy Independence and Tax Relief Act of 2008 provides \napproximately $18 billion in tax incentives for investment in renewable \nenergy, energy efficiency and conservation, carbon capture and \nsequestration demonstration projects. One provision of the bill \nspecifically authorizes $2 billion for new clean renewable energy \nbonds. These bonds are essential in helping finance facilities that \ngenerate electricity from alternative resources like: wind, small \nirrigation, geothermal, hydropower, and landfill gas or trash \ncombustion facilities.\n  The bill also provides tax credits for renewable energy production, \nsolar energy and fuel cell investment and tax credits for energy-\nefficient commercial buildings. Buildings account for over one-third of \nAmerica's consumption, 49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 \npercent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 10 percent of particulate \nemissions, all of which damage urban air quality. They also produce 38 \npercent of the country's carbon dioxide emissions--the chief pollutant \nblamed for climate change. By changing the way buildings operate, we \ncan change our ``carbon footprint'' on the Earth.\n  In addition to helping companies explore the use of alternative fuels \nand energy saving products, we must also act individually. Recognizing \nthis, Senator Baucus's legislation also provides incentives for \nindividual taxpayers. The bill incorporates tax credits for energy \nefficient appliances in homes and energy efficient improvements to \nexisting and new homes. If just 1 in 10 homes used ENERGY STAR-\nqualified appliances, a joint program between the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, the effect would \nbe like planting 1.7 million new acres of trees. Additionally, by \nmaking homes more energy efficient, we generate less air pollution and \nreduce high energy bills. Most of the energy used in our homes often \ncomes from the burning of fossil fuels at powerplants, which \ncontributes to acid rain and smog. By improving your home, whether by \nthe appliances you choose or energy efficient remodeling, you take an \nimportant step forward in protecting the environment.\n  The bottom line is that we have to conserve oil by using it more \nefficiently, and we have to find domestic alternatives to oil. The \nbenefit of doing that, in addition to bolstering national\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nsecurity and our economy, is that using less oil and gas reduces the \ngreenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global climate \nchange. This is why renewable energy incentives are essential.\n  In addition to many energy provisions that will help put America on \ntrack to energy independence, the bill also incorporates about $27 \nbillion in several vital tax extensions for American families and \nbusinesses. In order for our country to remain a leader we must \ncontinue to be competitive. This is why the research and development \ntax credit is essential. As a long time supporter of the R tax \ncredit, I am glad to see its inclusion into this legislation. This \ncredit allows for companies to plan long term projects which translate \ninto new technologies and new jobs. In 2005, 856 Maryland firms \nreported R activity to the IRS. My goal is to increase that number. I \nwant more businesses--not only in Maryland, but across the country--\nparticipating in research and development for our Nation.\n  The bill also extends tax provisions for tuition expenses, out-of-\npocket expenses for teachers, deductions for State and local sales \ntaxes, and real property tax relief for nonitemizers. It also expands \nthe child tax credit to help more than 13 million children and their \nfamilies. Specifically, the bill extends the above-the-line deduction \nup to $250 for education expenses for all elementary and secondary \nteachers. It also provides aid for the rising costs of tuition. By \nproviding an above-the-line deduction of $2,000 or $4,000, depending on \nincome, for qualified higher education expenses, we help alleviate the \nburden of rising education costs for American families. The bill also \nexpands the child tax credit to help more than 13 million children and \ntheir families. The bill also extends the option for taxpayers to take \nan itemized deduction for State and local general sales taxes, and \nprovides a 1-year deduction of $350 for property taxes for nonitemizing \ntaxpayers.\n  Senator Baucus has also included a very important provision that \nplaces a 1-year ``patch'' on the alternative minimum tax, AMT. This \nprovision translates into helping millions of Americans across the \ncountry and specifically hundreds of thousands of Marylanders. The bill \nincreases the exemption amounts to $46,200 for individuals and $69,950 \nfor married couples. It also allows personal credits to be used against \nthe AMT. This provision is essential, otherwise American families will \nfall victim to a tax that we never intended them to have to pay.\n  This bill will provide good jobs here at home, put us on a path \ntoward sustainable energy security, and combat global climate change. I \nhope we will be allowed to consider this measure. The American people \nsent us here to do a job: to legislate. If we can't even get to this \nbill, we are not doing our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as some of us who are not in this building \nknow, there is a raging storm outside. But it is all over the Eastern \npart of the country. I got a call from one Senator stuck at a small \nairport in northern New York. We have calls from all over the country \nthat airplanes are messed up. La Guardia is not going to have anything \ngoing until 11 o'clock. When things back up there, it affects the whole \ncountry. So we would wind up probably with 20 Senators missing the vote \nat 5:30.\n  So I have spoken to the Republican leader. We both think for the \nsafety of Members, if nothing else--which there is plenty else--but for \nthe safety of Members, so they can kind of calm down and not try to do \nthings they should not do at this last hour or so--I ask unanimous \nconsent that the previously scheduled vote on cloture, which was \nscheduled at 5:30 p.m., today, be delayed to occur at 2:15 p.m. \nTuesday, June 17.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, summer will not officially begin \nuntil June 21, but already the summer heat and thunderstorms are upon \nus. Lawns are lush and green, calling for the mower at least every week \nto maintain their carefully manicured appearance. Gardens are bursting \nwith blooms that hold the promise of juicy red tomatoes, crisp green \npeppers, and a never-ending supply of zucchini. Along rural roadsides, \ngreat rafts of daylilies growing are beginning to bloom in waves of \nfirecracker orange starbursts above the dense green foliage.\n  Despite the lawn and garden chores that beg for attention, one day \nthis weekend was reserved for pleasure. Sunday, June 15, was Father's \nDay. Across the Nation, ties disappeared from store shelves, golf \nparaphernalia was snapped up, funny cards were bought, and restaurant \nreservations were made. On Sunday, many fathers were encouraged to take \na break, to enjoy a brunch buffet, and to open some of the classic \nfather's day gifts--those ties, golf tees, or cologne. This week, men \nacross the Nation will sport brightly hued new ties and exotic scents \nthat wordlessly label them as proud fathers.\n  Fatherhood is a wonderful experience but also a nerve-wracking one. \nIt is full of high points, from passing on new skills and old interests \nto a new generation, to witnessing the achievements of our offspring as \nthey achieve success on their own. The sight of large father's hands \ntenderly cradling a tiny morsel of newborn humanity is enough to melt \nthe hardest heart. But it is also a frightening responsibility, knowing \nthat one's every word and action, for better or for worse, is being \nabsorbed into the creation of a new character. Fathers who praise their \nchild's hard work and perseverance in the face of setbacks, or who \ndemonstrate the high value they place on being a good sport, build \nstrong, resilient children who learn to work well with others \nthroughout their lives. Fathers who lose their tempers at Little League \ncoaches teach their children by example a lesson in rudeness and \nincivility that likely is very different than the manners that they \npreach. Clarence Budington Kelland put it best when he said, ``He \ndidn't tell my how to live; he lived, and let me watch him do it.''\n  Fathers typically spend fewer hours in the company of their children \nthan do their mothers. Therefore, each hour spent together is precious, \na fact that can be difficult to remember when fathers come home from \nwork tired, and that lawn still needs to be mowed or those bills need \nto be paid. But in the years to come, as children grow, it is the time \nspent playing catch, or building a doghouse, or even watching a \nfootball game together, that both father and child will remember and \ncherish--not that the lawn was properly edged and raked.\n  I know that the times spent with my Dad that I remember most fondly \nwere just those few quiet minutes that we spent together most days, \nwhen I would meet Dad walking home from work. He would share with me a \nlittle cake that he had saved from his lunch, and we would talk and \nwalk together.\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nNo matter how tired he was, he was interested in how my day had gone \nand what I had learned in school. Like many kids, I worked hard at \nschool and at my other activities, from my daily chores to playing my \nfiddle, to earn the reward of his smile and his words of praise. That \nability to inspire a child is the greatest power, and the greatest \nresponsibility, of fatherhood.\n  The creation of Father's Day is widely credited to Mrs. Sonora Dodd, \nwho, inspired by the idea of Mother's Day, chose to honor the father \nwho raised her and her siblings after their mother died. Her father, \nWilliam Smart, must have been a great father, to have sparked such a \ntribute from his daughter. As we honor the contributions to our \nfamilies made by our fathers, we must also thank Sonora Dodd for her \ndevotion and dedication to her father and all fathers. Mr. Smart did \nnot know the German writer Jean Paul Richter 1762-1825, but he proved \nthe truth behind Richter's observation that ``The words that a father \nspeaks to his children in the privacy of home are not heard by the \nworld, but, as in whispering galleries, they are heard clearly at the \nend and by posterity.''\n  Mr. President, I close with a poem by an anonymous author, titled ``A \nLittle Chap Who Follows Me.'' My Dad knew the truth of this poem, and I \nlearned the truth of it after my own daughters were born, as all \nfathers do. On Father's Day, as fathers are being honored, it reminds \nus of the qualities of a father that are most worth honoring.\n\n                      A Little Chap Who Follows Me\n\n     A careful man I want to be;\n     A little fellow follows me.\n     I do not dare to go astray\n     For fear he'll go the selfsame way.\n\n     I cannot once escape his eyes,\n     Whate'er he sees me do, he tries.\n     Like me he says he's going to be;\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     He thinks that I'm so very fine,\n     Believes in every word of mine.\n     The base in me he must not see;\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     I must remember as I go\n     Through summer's sun and winter's snow,\n     I'm building for the years to be;\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5653-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n Mr. BYRD. Madam President, in the early history of our Nation, \nmany flags flew over the land that became the United States of America. \nThe British Union Jack, the Spanish flag, the French flag, the Dutch \nflag, and others identified territory and colonies under the control of \nthose nations. Then, as the colonies and various fighting forces \norganized themselves to take up the call of the new nation-to-be, many \nnew flags began to fly. Some had pine trees, some had rattlesnakes, and \nothers were simpler designs or slogans, but all sought to establish a \nseparate and many times defiant new identity for the new nation and its \npeople.\n  In the course of conducting the war, the Continental Congress had \nmany important and pressing decisions to make. Among them was the \nchoice of a flag under which the armies and colonies could unite, a \nfitting symbol for the new nation. Accordingly, on June 14, 1777, the \nContinental Congress adopted a resolution establishing a national flag \nfor the United States. Following a still familiar pattern, a special \ncommittee had first been appointed to develop the design for the new \nflag, and the resolution implemented the committee's recommendation.\n  The resolution itself was quite simple, and stated only that `` the \nflag of the United States shall be of thirteen stripes of alternate red \nand white, with a union of thirteen stars of white upon a blue field, \nrepresenting a new constellation.'' The 13 stripes and stars were \nsymbolic of the 13 colonies that had fought for and won the liberty to \nestablish the new nation, of course, but no formal symbolism was \nassigned to the color choices, which were the same as those found on \nthe British Union Jack. Since 1777, however, many poets and speakers \nhave embued the colors with symbolism, as did Joseph Rodman Drake, in \nhis poem, ``The American Flag'':\n\n     When Freedom, from her mountain height,\n     Unfurled her standard to the air,\n     She tore the azure robe of night,\n     And set the stars of glory there!\n     She mingled with its gorgeous dyes\n     The milky baldric of the skies,\n     And striped its pure, celestial white\n     With streakings of the morning light;\n     Then, from his mansion in the sun,\n     She called her eagle-bearer down,\n     And gave into his mighty hand\n     The symbol of her chosen land!\n\n  Over the years, the flag grew and changed as the United States grew, \nadding stripes as well as stars before it was recognized that the \nexpansion of the States was greater than the flag's pattern could bear. \nWhen Francis Scott Key wrote ``The Star Spangled Banner'' after \nwatching the battle of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812, the flag he \nwrote about had 15 stars and 15 stripes. By 1816, the United States \nconsisted of 19 States, with more to come. So, once again, Congress \nestablished a special committee, this one directed by New York's Peter \nWendover, to study the problem of the flag's design.\n  Early in 1818, the congressional committee presented a report. The \nreport recommended a solution proposed by Chester Reid, a naval captain \nand hero of the war of 1812. His suggestion was that the 13-stripe flag \nhonored the original 13 colonies, and that new States could be honored \nby the simple addition of stars, to reflect the growth of the new \nconstellation.\n  On April 4, 1818, President James Monroe signed into law the Flag Act \nof 1818. Like the original Flag Resolution of 1777, the Flag Act of \n1818 was short, consisting of two sections. The first section noted \nthat, as of July 1819, ``the flag of the United States be thirteen \nhorizontal stripes, alternate red and white; that the union have twenty \nstars, white in blue field.'' The second section provided the process \nfor adding stars to the flag upon the entry of each new State to the \nUnion. This elegant solution provided the flag that we hold so dear \ntoday.\n  Our flag, the Stars and Stripes, or ``Old Glory,'' still serves to \nunite our Nation today. It is a symbol of our Nation that is instantly \nrecognizable around the world. It is both commonplace, seen daily in \nfront of post offices, government buildings and schools, and yet \nhallowed, placed with solemn care over the coffin of a veteran or \nflying at half mast to mark a tragedy. It can also be a symbol of \npatriotic pride, carried proudly by Olympic athletes as it will be in \nBeijing this August, or streaming in the wind behind a mighty warship. \nAnd who can forget the sudden, spontaneous, outbreak of U.S. flags that \nerupted across the Nation in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy? That act \ncaptured the essence of our Nation and our flag--a nation defiant, \nstrong, and united in the face of adversity.\n  On Saturday, many Americans braved the scorching heat and the violent \nweather and floods that have caused so much misery in recent days, and \nobserved Flag Day by displaying the flag at their home or their \nworkplace.\n  Mr. President, I close with one of my favorite poems about the flag. \nIt is titled ``Hats Off!'' by Henry Holcomb Bennett.\n\n                               Hats Off!\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by.\n\n     Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n     Fought to make and to save the State:\n     Weary marches and sinking ships;\n     Cheers of victory on dying lips;\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase;\n     Equal justice, right and law,\n     Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Sign of a nation, great and strong\n     To ward her people from foreign wrong:\n     Pride and glory and honor, all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5653-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5653-S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARREST OF BAHA'I LEADERS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

These actions do not befit the \nrich heritage of Iranian civilization, and I call upon the leadership \nof the Islamic Republic of Iran to release the seven Baha'i leaders \npromptly and unconditionally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5654-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL GALE S.

She also completed a master's of business administration from \nBoston University, a master's in healthcare administration from Baylor \nUniversity, and a master's in national security and strategy from the \nNational Defense University. Major General Pollock also attended the \nU.S. Army Nurse Anesthesia Program and is a certified registered nurse \nanesthetist, CRNA, and a fellow in The American College of Healthcare \nExecutives.\n  Major General Pollock's military education includes Senior Service \nCollege at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces; the U.S. Air \nForce War College; the Interagency Institute for Federal Health Care \nExecutives, the Military Health System CAPSTONE Program, the Principles \nof Advanced Nurse Administrators, and the NATO staff officer course.\n  Major General Pollock became the Deputy Surgeon General for Force \nManagement December 11, 2007. She also served as Chief, Army Nurse \nCorps and Commander, U.S. Army Medical Command/Acting Surgeon General.\n  Major General Pollock's past military assignments include special \nassistant to the Surgeon General for Information Management and Health \nPolicy; commander, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; \ncommander, U.S. Army Medical Activity, Fort Drum, NY; staff officer, \nStrategic Initiatives Command Group for the Army Surgeon General; \nDepartment of Defense health care advisor to the Congressional \nCommission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, \nhealth fitness advisor at the National Defense University; senior \npolicy analyst in Health Affairs, DOD; and chief anesthesia nursing \nservice at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC.\n  Throughout her career Major General Pollock has served with valor and \nprofoundly impacted the entire Army Medical Department.

I extend my deepest \nappreciation to Major General Pollock on behalf of a grateful nation \nfor her more than 32 years of dedicated military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5654-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                125TH ANNIVERSARY OF ETHAN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the city of Ethan, South Dakota. After \n125 years, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on \nits past and future, and I congratulate the people of Ethan for all \nthat they have accomplished.\n  The city of Ethan was founded in 1883 as a railroad town named after \nEthan Allen of historical fame. Jerome Miles was the primary landowner \nof Ethan Territory. The first school was built in 1885, followed by the \nfirst Catholic and Methodist churches which were both built in 1887.\n  Today, Ethan is a growing and developing small town community located \nin Davison County. Ethan has a population of 312 and is home to \nnumerous colorful characters, including many descendents of the \noriginal founders. Ethan features several local businesses, including \ngrain elevators, hotels, banks, restaurants, doctor's offices, \nchurches, a public school, and a beautiful park. Ethan Coop Lumber just \ncelebrated their 100 year anniversary in 2007, and Ethan Public School \nhas been declared a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Ethan will be commemorating its anniversary with a celebration on the \nweekend of June 13-15. The town plans to hold the Miss Ethan Pageant, a \nstreet dance, a parade, and hot air balloon rides. The events of the \nweekend promise to provide great opportunities to celebrate such a \nhistoric milestone.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Ethan continues to be a vibrant \ncommunity.

Madam President, today I recognize the community \nof Corona, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. \nCorona is a rural community located in Roberts County, and will be \ncelebrating its quasquicentennial the weekend of June 20-22 with a \nstreet dance, a 5k walk/run, hot air balloon rides, a parade, and \nfireworks.\n  In 1881, a town site called Prior was plotted approximately 1\\1/2\\ \nmiles north of the future site of Corona, named for its owner, C. H. \nPrior. Prior was the original stopping point for the postal service \nuntil moving to the present location of Corona in 1883, which provided \ncloser access to the railroad.\n  The early business district of Corona was comprised of a doctor, a \nnewspaper, two banks, four grocery stores, a butcher shop, a post \noffice, four grain elevators, a general store, a hardware store, a \ncreamery, and two lumber yards. Main Street was marked with hitching \nposts, gasoline lights, and wooden sidewalks that were notorious for \ntheir hazardous conditions when wet.\n  Today, Corona still boasts several businesses including a cafe, a \npost office, a grain elevator, and most importantly, the Corona \nLearning Center. Three industrial enterprises are also based in the \narea: Mark's Custom Woodworking, Ammann Honey Farm, and Dakota Machine \nWorks. Despite the hardworking nature of Corona's inhabitants, they \nstill manage to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with one of the longest \nparades in the State, whether rain, snow, or shine.\n  Most South Dakotans call small towns like Corona home. South Dakota's \nsmall communities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the \nfuture of our State. It is especially because of our small communities, \nand the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I \nam proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like Corona and its citizens \nare no different and truly know what it means to be a South Dakotan. \nEven 125 years after its founding, Corona continues to be a vibrant \naddition to our wonderful State, and I once again congratulate them on \nthis achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5654-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5654-5", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are panted at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5654-6", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5654-S5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:13 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nfollowing bill, with an amendment, in which it requests the concurrence \nof the Senate:\n\n       S. 2146.

A bill to encourage the entry of felony warrants into the \nNCIC database by States and provide additional resources for \nextradition; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fugitive \nInformation Networked Database Act of 2008, or the FIND Act. This bill \nprovides resources to law enforcement to ensure the entry of felony \nwarrants into the national FBI database and to assist in tracking down \nand extraditing fugitives. It helps ensure that fugitives who flee \ntheir States will be located, apprehended, and brought to justice. It \nprotects our communities by taking dangerous criminals off the streets.\n  According to a recent series of articles in the St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, anywhere from 1.9 million to 2.7 million felony fugitives are \non the run from law enforcement. When State and local law enforcement \nissue a warrant for a fugitive's arrest, they are expected to enter it \ninto the FBI's National Crime Information Center database as well as \ninto their own State and local databases. The national database is \naccessible to all State and local law enforcement agencies, which use \nthe national database to track fugitives around the country.\n  The national database is only as good as the information that States \nenter into it, however. Too often, State and local law enforcement \nagencies enter warrants into the State and local databases, but not \ninto the national database. It is estimated that more than a third of \nall felony warrants have not been entered into the national database. \nThat means anywhere from 800,000 to 1.6 million wanted felons can \nescape justice and remain at large in our communities simply by \ncrossing State lines.\n  Unless a warrant is entered into the national database, a sheriff or \npolice officer who stops a fugitive has no way of knowing that he is \nwanted in another jurisdiction--sometimes for a violent crime. Many \nfugitives go on to commit additional crimes in other States. Some know \nthat if they can flee across State lines, there's a good chance they \ncan--in some cases--get away with murder. This is inexcusable.\n  I have heard a range of reasons why State and local law enforcement \nhave not been entering felony warrants into the national database. \nSome reasons are valid. For instance, if law enforcement is using a \nperson suspected of a felony as an informant, it's understandable that \nthey would not want to enter the informant's name into the database.\n\n  Many jurisdictions don't enter warrants into the national database, \nhowever, simply because they don't have the time and resources to \nupdate and validate warrant entries, which is a resource- and time-\nintensive process.\n  Fortunately, the burden of warrant entry and validation can be \nalleviated. By developing new databases, or by upgrading existing ones, \nto ensure compatibility and interoperability with the national \ndatabase, State and local law enforcement can facilitate information \nsharing and seamless warrant entry into databases at all levels of \ngovernment. With additional resources to hire personnel for the \nvalidation process, State and local law enforcement can enter felony \nwarrants into the national database without worrying about not having \nthe resources to validate them.\n  The FIND Act addresses the problem of warrant backlogs by providing \nState and local law enforcement with the resources necessary to develop \nand upgrade their systems, and hire additional personnel to perform the \nvalidation process. Specifically, it authorizes $25 million for fiscal \nyears 2009 and 2010 for grants to States to develop new systems or \nupgrade existing systems so that they are interoperable with the NCIC \ndatabase.\n  Another reason law enforcement doesn't enter felony warrants into the \nnational database is concern that the State will not have the resources \nto extradite the fugitive if he is found outside the State's borders. \nHelping State and local agencies enter their felony warrants into the \nnational database is therefore only half the battle. We also need to \nensure that when a dangerous fugitive is caught, the jurisdiction in \nwhich he is wanted can work with the U.S. Marshals Service to extradite \nhim to face justice.\n  While I was drafting this bill, I spoke to one sheriff who \napprehended an individual wanted for rape in another State. The sheriff \nnotified that State that he had their criminal in custody, but when the \nState said they didn't have the resources to extradite him, the sheriff \nhad no choice but to free the rapist into his community.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n  When we in Congress do not provide law enforcement with the basic \nresources they need to extradite dangerous criminals like this, we fail \nin our most basic duty to those we represent--the duty to protect them \nfrom violent crime.\n  The U.S. Marshals Service is on the front lines of fugitive \napprehension and extradition. We authorized funds several years ago for \nthe development of Regional Fugitive Task Forces that combine the \nresources and expertise of State and local law enforcement and the U.S. \nMarshals Service. These task forces have been very successful and could \ndo much more to track down and extradite fugitives if they had the \nproper resources.\n  My bill authorizes an additional $20 million in fiscal year 2009 to \nfund existing and develop new regional task forces, and it provides $10 \nmillion for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. It also authorizes $3 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 to assist in the \nextradition of fugitives through the Justice Prisoner and Alien \nTransport System.\n  The FIND Act provides essential resources to locate, capture, and \nbring to justice dangerous fugitives. It takes commonsense steps to \nprotect our communities from rapists, murderers, and other violent \ncriminals who have fled across State lines. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas family \nare Mexican nationals living in the San Jose area of California.\n  The story of the Rojas family is compelling and I believe they merit \nCongress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Rojas and his wife Ms. Gonzalez originally came to the United \nStates in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In \n1995, they left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered on \nvisitor's visas. The family has since expanded to include a son, Alexis \nRojas now age 15 and a daughter Tania Rojas now age 14.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement, a strong work ethic and \nvolunteerism. They have been paying taxes since their arrival in 1990. \nThe family has been described by their friends and colleagues as a \n``model American family.'' I would like to tell you some more about \neach member of the Rojas family.\n  Mr. Rojas is a hard-working individual who has been employed by \nValley Crest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the \npast 14 years. Currently, Mr. Rojas works on commercial landscaping \nprojects. He is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.\n  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time \nand talents to provide modern green landscaping and a recreational \njungle gym to Sherman Oaks Community Charter School, where his two \nyoungest children attend school.\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\n  Ms. Gonzalez, in addition to raising her three children, has been \nvery active in the local community. She has worked to help other \nimmigrants assimilate to American life by working as a translator and a \ntutor for immigrant children at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School \nand the Y.M.C.A. Kids after-school program.\n  She has also coached soccer teams, and has recently directed a Second \nHarvest food drive for the school. Ms. Gonzalez also devotes many hours \nof her time to the organization People Acting in Community Together \nPACT, where she works to prevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San \nJose neighborhoods and schools.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the impact their deportation would \nhave on their three children. Two of the children, Alexis Rojas age 15 \nand Tania Rojas age 14, are U.S. citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has lived \nin the United States since he was a toddler. For these children, this \ncountry is the only country they really know.\n  Jorge Rojas, Jr. is currently working at Jamba Juice. He graduated \nfrom Del Mar High School in 2007 and has been accepted to San Jose City \nCollege. However, his dreams and aspirations have been placed on hold \nbecause he remains subject to deportation.\n  Alexis and Tania Rojas are students at Sherman Oaks Community Charter \nSchool. They are described by their teachers as ``fantastic, wonderful \nand gifted'' students. In fact, the principal at Sherman Oaks has \ndescribed all three of the children as ``honest, hard-working academic \nhonor students'' and has commended all of them for their on-campus \nleadership.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear. I have received 30 letters from the \ncommunity in support of this family. Enactment of the legislation I \nhave introduced today will enable the Rojas family to continue to make \nsignificant contributions to their community as well as the United \nStates.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Diane Feinstein,\n     Post Street,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are the Rojas Family: Jorge \n     Rojas, Sr., 43 years old, supervisor, Valley Crest Landscape \n     Co.; Oliva Rojas, 40 years old, tutor, Sherman Oaks Charter \n     School; Jorge Rojas 19 years old, son; Alexis Rojas, 15 years \n     old, son; and Tania Rojas, 14 years old, daughter.\n       The reason for this letter is to ask for your help on our \n     immigration status.\n       We came to the U.S.A. in 1990, there were three in the \n     family at that time: my wife Oliva, my son Jorge, he was l-\n     year and 5 months old, and myself. Years later Alexis and \n     Tania were born in California.\n       After a long immigration process we were denied to stay in \n     the U.S.A. and now we are facing a voluntary departure \n     schedule on or before April 18, 2008, in the meantime we are \n     asking to extend our departure until the kids finish the \n     school year that ends on June 13, 2008.\n       Our main goal is to stay in the U.S.A. as legal residents, \n     my kids were born here and grew up here, even my son Jorge \n     was too young to remember were he was born, this is all that \n     they have ever known. What I want the most now is that my \n     kids keep going with their hopes and dreams and be able to \n     stay in school and someday be great citizens in this Great \n     Country.\n       After several changes in immigration laws, we started a \n     legal process trying to get a legal residence in this \n     country. One day we knew thru other people that someone in \n     the Los Angeles area could help us out to get a legal \n     residence, wrongly we started a political asylum process, \n     that later will be an application for cancellation of \n     removal, we were misled, we were told that its only a way to \n     get a hearing with an immigration judge and because we were \n     in the U.S.A. for more than 10 years and we have 2 citizen \n     kids will be a lot easier, afterwards we found out that this \n     person was not a lawyer and he was a notary, whom only submit \n     political asylum applications and then turn everything to a \n     lawyers that represent us in the hearings. A lot of trips to \n     L.A. but one day received a call telling me that me case was \n     move out to San Francisco and the next hearing will be there.\n       At the first hearing in San Francisco the Judge instructed \n     me to get a lawyer that represent us in the upcoming process. \n     We hire a lawyer with immigration speciality, a real lawyer, \n     it was on March 2003. He represent us I think the best way \n     that he could, after almost 3 years on April 2006, we were \n     denied to stay and granted with voluntary departure within 60 \n     days, this happen on April 2006.\n       Still we had another chance; appeal to the Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit, so in May 2006, we hired another \n     lawyer with better knowledge in appeals. Our efforts to stay \n     legally here never give up.\n       On February 24, 2008 we received a decision from the Board \n     of Immigration Appeals saying that we have to leave the \n     country voluntary in the remaining 32 days after the final \n     decision that will be made on March 17, 2008.\n       Now our last hope is if you can help us.\n       We are a very close family that always been working and \n     doing voluntary jobs and time to the community where for 14 \n     years we belong participating not only with our kids, we were \n     among parents and teacher helping.\n       My wife Oliva has been a soccer coach and she is involved \n     in the community association named ``PACT'' (Parents Acting \n     in Community Together), helping too in the distribution of \n     food with ``The Second Harvest Food Program''. Myself I was a \n     soccer coach too and involved in a lot of jobs done to the \n     Sherman Oaks Charter School, were my three kids attended.\n       My kids now are emotionally affected because they can not \n     understand all that is happening to us and of course to them, \n     for me is really hard to explain them.\n       Even so we all know the decision that had been made, we \n     keep on going everything; work, school and time together as a \n     family. We have our hopes and faith in something or somebody \n     that is going to help us to stay in The U.S.A.\n       I am pretty sure that with your help my whole family will \n     keep this faith, hopes and dreams going and we will be part \n     of this great country.\n       I want to say ahead that myself and my family are deeply \n     grateful for you time and for whatever you can do for us.\n       Thank you so much.\n                                                      Jorge Rojas.\n     Update on this letter\n                                                   March 19, 2008.\n       On March 17, 2008 we were granted by de I.C.E. Office with \n     60 days more until my kids can finish the school year, now \n     our voluntary departure is schedule on or before June 18, \n     2008. That gives us more comfort and time; hoping that you \n     can help us.\n       Thanks again for your time and help.\n     Jorge Rojas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: In late February, staff from my \n     office met with Jorge\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\n     Rojas and his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Rojas in regards to their \n     immigration case and that of their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. \n     After exhausting all appeals to the decision of the \n     Immigration Judge, the family was scheduled to depart the \n     United States under an order of voluntary departure to Mexico \n     on April 18, 2008.\n       My office supported their request to get an extension of \n     the voluntary departure order until June 18, 2008 so that the \n     two younger United States citizen children could finish the \n     school year. As of this moment the family is still scheduled \n     to leave the United States on June 18th. At the time of the \n     first meeting, my office also referred the Rojas family to \n     their U.S. Senators offices to inquire about the possibility \n     of a private bill being introduced.\n       Since February, my office has received many calls from \n     individuals supportive of the Rojas family and concerned \n     about their impending departure. My office was also contacted \n     by People Acting in Community Together (PACT), members of the \n     Santa Clara Interfaith Council, Santa Clara County Office of \n     Human Relations, YMCA, and Sherman Oaks Community Charter \n     School.\n       In addition, on March 9, 2008, the Rojas family \n     participated in a community forum organized by First \n     Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto. The Rojas family \n     participated on a panel which included a San Francisco \n     Immigration Judge, the Director of the Santa Clara County \n     Office of Human Relations, and one of my staff members. The \n     event was co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Palo \n     Alto, the Santa Clara Council of Churches, Multifaith Voices \n     for Peace and Justice, and El Buen Pastor, Iglesia Episcopal \n     Church (Redwood City). The organizers have verified that \n     there were a total of 115 attendees at the event, many of \n     whom still inquire about the Rojas family and their \n     situation.\n       It is apparent that the Rojas family is a hard-working, \n     beloved family that has contributed much to their community \n     through their volunteer work. My office has been as \n     supportive as possible of this family and of their efforts to \n     exhaust all possible avenues to remain legally in the United \n     States.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Zoe Lofgren,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       ValleyCrest\n\n\n                                        Landscape Maintenance,\n\n                                      San Jose, CA, 12 March 2008.\n     Re Jorge G. Rojas.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Jorge G. Rojas has been working for \n     our company ValleyCrest Landscape Maintenance since 1994.\n       Not only is he a valuable member of our team but has been \n     instrumental in energizing the water conservation and \n     sustainability issues as they relate to the LEED efforts in \n     the Bay Area for commercial landscaping.\n       Jorge Rojas is a technician in Urban Construction. He \n     obtained his degree from Conalet Technical School in \n     Guadalajara.\n       Jorge's skills in that area will be a great loss not only \n     to the company, but to the state of sustainability and green \n     programs in Silicon Valley.\n       Commercial clients are seeking LEED certification for their \n     existing buildings and industry talent in this arena is \n     critical.\n       We at ValleyCrest urge our to consider drafting a private \n     bill to secure permanent residency for him and his direct \n     family.\n       Jorge is also seeking an extension from the Immigration \n     office to allow his American resident children to complete \n     their graduation.\n       We would appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Nada Duna,\n     Regional Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Sherman Oaks Community\n\n\n                                               Charter School,\n\n                                     San Jose, CA, March 13, 2008.\n       To Whom It May Concern: I write this letter in support of \n     the Oliva Gonzales Rojas and her family. Many years ago she \n     and her husband, Jorge, left Mexico to come to the United \n     States. At that time their oldest son was two years old. They \n     have lived in the United States in California for the last \n     eight en years.\n       During that time they have consistently demonstrated their \n     commitment to this country, appreciating the opportunities \n     the United States has afforded them. In addition to their \n     oldest son, they have two other children--a son and daughter, \n     citizens of the United States. These children have \n     demonstrated strong academic skills, and they have shown \n     positive and consistent leadership. They understand the \n     importance of service to community.\n       Yesterday, Alexis, their son volunteered at Sherman Oaks, \n     organizing our book room and hanging posters on the wall. He \n     has received excellent modeling from his parents who have \n     donated many hours of service to our school. They have \n     demonstrated discipline and excellence in their work. Olivia \n     works at Sherman Oaks as yard duty and as a tutor. Jorge, the \n     father, has developed a highly successful landscaping design \n     business, which caters to large-scale corporations and \n     business parks.\n       Oliva and Jorge are decent people, who came to America to \n     live the American dream. For eighteen years they have worked \n     hard, rearing their children, teaching them the values of \n     perseverance, diligence, and sacrifice to achieve and to \n     thrive. Pillars of the community, the family is universally \n     loved and respected by all at Sherman Oaks School. It was \n     Jorge, who planted trees and fixed the irrigation system to \n     maintain the lush fields that are a mecca to our children and \n     their families. Oliva serves as the liaison for our school to \n     the neighborhood. She tutors their children, organizes \n     support for families in need, and integrates new immigrants \n     into the school. Oliva and Jorge are good people, model \n     citizens, and contributors to society.\n       With great respect, I plead with you to consider the merit \n     of this case. Specifically, I request that the family may \n     stay, at least until the end of June, so that their children \n     can complete this school year. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Nancy Atkinson,\n     Principal.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  People Acting in\n\n\n                                           Community Together,\n\n                                     San Jose, CA, March 17, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Post Street,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for Oliva Rojas and her family and to ask for your \n     assistance in postponing--and we hope canceling--their order \n     of removal from the DOHS.\n       Oliva was an active PACT volunteer leader for several years \n     in the early 2000s and has continued to support our \n     organization since then. PACT is a multi-ethnic, inter-faith \n     grassroots organization that empowers every day people to \n     create a more just community.\n       For more than 20 years, PACT has helped ordinary people win \n     extraordinary victories for our community, not by speaking \n     for them, but by teaching them how to speak, act, and engage \n     in the public arena for themselves. Thousands of PACT-\n     trained, volunteer community leaders have worked together \n     across ethnic, religious and socio-economic lines to create \n     innovative and effective public policies that have improved \n     the lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout Santa \n     Clara County. For example, PACT co-founded Santa Clara \n     County's innovative Children's Health Initiative, which \n     provides access to health insurance to all low-income \n     children in the County and has served as a model for similar \n     programs in twenty-three other California counties plus many \n     other states, as well.\n       Oliva was active with the PACT parent group at her child's \n     charter school. She put in many hours every week to help \n     improve the school for the benefit of all the children. She \n     was also a leader in the effort to fight crime, gangs, and \n     drug dealing in the neighborhood around the school, and \n     helped organize large meetings with this purpose.\n       I've been working for more than 15 years to involve \n     everyday people in the public life of their communities. \n     While most people feel disconnected and apathetic, Oliva is \n     full of hope and exudes inspiration about her community. Even \n     though she is new to this country, she embodies the values we \n     hold dear, as individuals and as a society: committed to her \n     family, hard working, involved in the community, participant \n     in the democratic process.\n       Our community needs Oliva and her family. We need so many \n     more people like her. We would be a much weaker community \n     without her.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n                                                      Matt Hammer,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Sherman Oaks\n\n\n                                     Community Charter School,\n\n                                     San Jose, CA, March 10, 2008.\n     Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Honorable Senator Feinstein: I am writing in behalf of the \n     Jorge and Oliva Rojas Family and their eminent ``removal'' \n     from the United States. I have had the good fortune to have \n     known the Rojas family since 1999, when Tania Rojas was in my \n     Kindergarten class. We did home visits that year, and I was \n     immediately impressed with the close family ties and \n     structure within the Rojas household. Tania was a fantastic \n     student and we had a great year. Her mother, Oliva, was a \n     ready volunteer for anything that she could help out with at \n     school, and was always an integral part of our school \n     community. Two years later, I had Alexis in my fourth grade \n     class. Another wonderful, intelligent, GATE (Gifted and \n     Talented) student. That year, he talked about being an \n     astronaut some day. And, of course, Oliva continued to do \n     anything and everything to help out. Always with a positive \n     ``can-do'' attitude and sense of humor.\n       Oliva started out volunteering, but because she is so \n     capable, she was soon hired by our school to do almost \n     everything! As a charter school, we have had more flexibility \n     in hiring than some schools. In the past, Oliva has helped \n     out as a substitute, an art teacher, yard duty, tutor, and \n     parent liaison. Students love and respect her. She is someone \n     who is always willing to help out where needed. She has been \n     a lifesaver to me, as a teacher, many times. Whether it's \n     making copies for me at the last minute, or helping out with \n     our 4th grade overnight at Sanborn Park when my partner \n     teacher got sick, or helping me design and build our altar \n     for Day of the Dead--Oliva is always there. Her\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n     background design for the 4th grade Opera every year, is \n     always spectacular. She helps students with homework. She \n     helps our Kindergartners in our ``mid day block''. Our \n     structure is very different from traditional schools, and \n     Oliva is someone who helps make it work. She helps make \n     everything work at our school. I can't even imagine what our \n     school will be like without her here. Her own 3 children, \n     Jorge, Alexis and Tania are no longer students at our school, \n     but truly, all the students at Sherman Oaks are Oliva's kids.\n       Oliva soon started working in the YMCA's after school and \n     summer school program, where, once again, she was loved by \n     all who worked with her. I believe she has worked with them \n     for over 4 years. I am attaching this year's YMCA brochure, \n     which, ironically, came to my house just this week. On page 7 \n     is a picture of smiling staff members. Center front, is Oliva \n     Rojas.\n       Every October, the Rojas family participates with my \n     husband with his theater group, Familia Aztlan, in their \n     multicultural event celebrating Day of the Dead in San Jose. \n     Both Jorge Sr, and Jr, along with Tania and Alexis, \n     participate in the parade, wielding large, life sized, \n     skeleton puppets. Oliva puts her creativity to use, painting \n     the faces of children and adults alike.\n       Oliva's removal from this country in mid April will put an \n     extreme hardship on all the students and teachers at Sherman \n     Oaks Community Charter School in San Jose for this school \n     year. As a teacher at this school for 10 years, I can \n     truthfully say that Oliva Rojas' position at our school \n     touches every single student. I can't imagine how we would \n     explain to our students why she was all of a sudden gone--mid \n     year. What could we say to explain it to them? And they will \n     ask.\n       I respectfully ask for your intervention, in whatever way \n     you can, to get an extension of at least until June for the \n     removal of the Rojas Family. Ideally, this family merits full \n     time, legal status in this country based on their many civic \n     and artistic contributions, stable family, and work ethic. \n     But, if this is not possible, at least, for the sake of the \n     students, families, and faculty of Sherman Oaks Community \n     Charter School, please intervene for an extension until June, \n     2008.\n       It is truly this country's loss if/when the Rojas Family is \n     ``removed.''\n           Respectfully and hopefully,\n                                                     Barbara Lynn,\n     4th Grade Teacher.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      San Jose, CA, March 5, 2008.\n       Senator Feinstein, I am writing to you because of my \n     concern for a co-worker and friend, Oliva Rojas. Although she \n     and her family have been trying to legally stay in the United \n     States for many years, her appeals have run out and she and \n     her family will be leaving on a volunteer departure on April \n     18th.\n       I am Oliva's supervisor at Sherman Oaks Elementary School \n     in San Jose in the Campbell Elementary School District, a \n     bilingual, dual-immersion school. Oliva reports to me \n     everyday for 2 hours and works with grades K-6 with a \n     specialty in Kindergarten. (She works other hours for a \n     different supervisor.)\n       I can't think of a time when I have been so disappointed in \n     our government. This is a family that is a vital part of our \n     community and Oliva is a valued co-worker. Because she is \n     smart, trusted, responsible and nurturing, Oliva has been \n     given many duties that go beyond her job description. (At one \n     time, we were a charter school and Oliva was even able to \n     substitute teach in classrooms and did a fabulous job.) \n     Oliva's family has always been the first to step up and take \n     action if something needed to be done at our school to \n     improve the grounds or atmosphere. They would be the first to \n     volunteer to help at the many gatherings we would have. Oliva \n     and her family are some of the most involved, unselfish \n     people I have ever met.\n       If Oliva leaves on April 18th, it would be a hardship to \n     not only me and her fellow coworkers, but to each and every \n     child she works with on a daily basis. We depend on her to be \n     there because she handles the children in a very special \n     loving way. Nobody could replace her. I have tried to fill \n     her position with other employees at times when she is sick \n     or at immigration hearings and it has not worked out. We need \n     Oliva to be with us throughout this school year and beyond.\n       I would like you to take a look at her case and help her \n     and her family out in this matter. Please do whatever you can \n     do to keep the family here in the United States.\n           Thank you,\n     Lynda Zolezzi.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     San Jose, CA, March 11, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     One Post Street,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We ask you to please urge ICE to \n     allow Jorge Rojas, Sr., Oliva Rojas (his wife) and Jorge \n     Rojas, Jr. (their 19 year old son) to remain in this country \n     at least till the end of this school year, June 13, so that \n     their U.S. citizen children, Alexis and Tania, may finish \n     school. In fact, I would hope that the whole Rojas family \n     could stay legally for the rest of their lives.\n       The Rojas family has been a fixture of our community in San \n     Jose for at least 16 years. We raised our sons, their Jorge \n     Jr. and our Sam, together from 2nd grade on (both are now 19 \n     and 20 years old respectively), spending many hours together. \n     We were active together in People Acting Together (PACT) \n     successfully pushing for health insurance for all children in \n     Santa Clara Co. in 2000. Oliva is well-know to all children \n     at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School (Campbell Union \n     School District) due to her early volunteer work at the \n     school, then her paid position as an aide, and then as a YMCA \n     worker running after school programs.\n       Jorge Rojas, Sr. has been an active parent leader in the \n     Sherman Oaks Community Charter School neighborhood in west \n     center San Jose. It was Jorge, as a trained landscaping \n     professional, who enlisted other parents to reseed and \n     regrade parts of the school playground and to repair the \n     irrigation system when the school district had no funds to do \n     so. It was Jorge who led the work to plant trees from Our \n     City Forest in front of the school to reduce heat and glare. \n     It was Jorge who volunteered his weekend operating the \n     equipment and then doing the hand digging necessary to \n     install a French drainage system (6 feet deep) into holes cut \n     in the concrete to ensure proper drainage.\n       It was both Jorge and Oliva who for years volunteered to \n     coach soccer teams for neighborhood children after school. As \n     bilingual parents, Jorge and Oliva have been key to bridging \n     the cu1tural/language gap between neighbors in our \n     multicultural neighborhood and school community. If this \n     family leaves, they will leave a big hole in our community \n     which has come to depend on them for leadership, translation, \n     advice, hard work, and friendship. They will also leave a big \n     hole in the hearts of many of us who count them as close \n     friends.\n       It is tragic that a whole community would suffer such a \n     loss due to a legal error made by an untrained, irresponsible \n     ``notario'' years ago. This family has spent thousands and \n     thousands of dollars in an effort to overcome the error of \n     that notario and to legalize their status.\n       We ask for your assistance on behalf of the Rojas Family \n     and our community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                 Susan Price-Jang and Victor Jang.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB. (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 3140. A bill to provide that 4 of the 21 weeks of parental leave \nmade available to a Federal employee shall be paid leave, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the bipartisan \nFederal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. I introduce this \nbill with Senators Warner, Clinton, Kerry, Schumer, Mikulski, Sanders, \nand Durbin.\n  This bill has a simple and yet important requirement: that Federal \nemployees be granted 4 weeks of paid paternity and maternity leave.\n  The Federal Government is the country's largest employer, with more \nthan 2.7 million employees. My state of Virginia is home to more than \n100,000 Federal employees. As the Nation's largest employer, the \nFederal Government should be the leader in workplace policy. The \nFederal Government should provide benefits that are equal to what we \ncall best practices in the private sector.\n  Furthermore, according to the Office of Personnel Management, more \nthan half of the Federal Government's employees will become eligible \nfor retirement within the next 10 years. The Federal workforce is aging \nfaster than the private workforce. The benefits desired by younger \nworkers are offered by private sector employers, but not by the Federal \nGovernment. Although the Federal Government cannot compete with private \nsector salaries, we should be offering comparable benefits.\n  The current parental leave law for Federal employees is in need of an \nupdate. The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act provides that, of \nthe 12 weeks of unpaid leave guaranteed by the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, federal employees will be allowed to substitute 4 weeks of paid \nleave, as well as any accrued annual or sick leave for the birth or \nadoption of a child.\n  This requirement mirrors a recent provision put forward by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in the National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich would allow 21 days of paid paternity leave for our military \npersonnel.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is also an issue of fairness \nfor the working family. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that more than \n70 percent of women with children over the age of 1 are in the \nworkforce and that both parents work in most families.\n  Additionally, according to the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies, in today's highly competitive jobs environment, there is \nlittle workforce flexibility to help working\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nwomen and men care for their families and still succeed at their jobs. \nThis is particularly true for those Americans whose economic security \nis most at risk.\n  It is important to note the parental leave practices of non-Federal \nemployers. Research by the Joint Economic Committee has found that \nFortune 100 firms offer paid leave typically lasting 6 to 8 weeks. \nAdditionally, most of America's economic rivals provide paid parental \nleave, as do many other nations. The European Union requires that \nmember countries offer 14 weeks of paid leave and most offer more than \nthe required amount.\n  By contrast, our Nation's current laws force healthy, long-term \nfederal employees to save up their sick days and vacation time so they \ncan use this paid time off to care for their newborn or newly adopted \nchild. Asking employees to cobble together accrued leave makes it \ndifficult for relatively new employees or those who experience health \nproblems to save up enough time for parental leave. We owe our civil \nservants a more thoughtful, worker-friendly policy.\n  I note that the House of Representatives recently reported a similar \nbill out of the appropriate House committee by a strong bipartisan \nvote. I hope the Senate begins similar action on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this pro-family, pro-Federal worker \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5663-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 595--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2008 AS ``GOSPEL MUSIC \n    HERITAGE MONTH'' AND HONORING GOSPEL MUSIC FOR ITS VALUABLE AND \n     LONGSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CULTURE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Leahy) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 595\n\n       Whereas gospel music is a beloved art form unique to the \n     United States, spanning decades, generations, and races;\n       Whereas gospel music is one of the cornerstones of the \n     musical tradition of the United States and has grown beyond \n     its roots to achieve pop-culture and historical relevance;\n       Whereas gospel music has spread beyond its geographic \n     origins to touch audiences around the world;\n       Whereas the history of gospel music can be traced to \n     multiple and diverse influences and foundations, including \n     African-American spirituals that blended diverse elements \n     from African music and melodic influences from Irish folk \n     songs and hymns, and gospel music ultimately borrowed from \n     uniquely American musical styles including ragtime, jazz, and \n     blues;\n       Whereas that tradition of diversity remains today, as the \n     influence of gospel music can be found infused in all forms \n     of secular music, including rock and roll, country, soul, \n     rhythm and blues, and countless other styles;\n       Whereas the legacy of gospel music includes some of the \n     most memorable voices and musical pioneers in the history of \n     the United States, such as Thomas Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, \n     James Vaughan, Roberta Martin, Virgil Stamps, Diana \n     Washington, Stamps Quartet, The Highway QCs, The Statesmen, \n     The Soul Stirrers, Point of Grace, Smokie Norful, Terry \n     Woods, James Cleveland, Billy Ray Hearns, Rex Humbard, Joe \n     Ligon and The Mighty Clouds of Joy, Kirk Franklin, V. Michael \n     McKay, Theola Booker, Yolanda Adams, Edwin and Walter \n     Hawkins, Sandi Patty, The Winans, Kathy Taylor, and Brenda \n     Waters, Carl Preacher, and Shirley Joiner of B, C & S;\n       Whereas many of the biggest names in music emerged from the \n     gospel music tradition or have recorded gospel music, \n     including Sam Cooke, Al Green, Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye, \n     Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Little Richard, Ray \n     Charles, Buddy Holly, Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, Mariah \n     Carey, Bob Dylan, Randy Travis, and Glenn Campbell;\n       Whereas, regardless of their musical styles, those artists \n     and so many more have turned to gospel music as the source \n     and inspiration for their music, which has blurred the \n     boundaries between secular and gospel music;\n       Whereas, beyond its contribution to the musical tradition \n     of the United States, gospel music has provided a cultural \n     and musical backdrop across all of mainstream media, from hit \n     television series to major Hollywood motion pictures, \n     including ``American Idol'', ``Heroes'', ``Dancing with the \n     Stars'', ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'', ``Sister Act'', \n     ``The Preacher's Wife'', ``Evan Almighty'', and more; and\n       Whereas gospel music has a huge audience around the country \n     and around the world, a testament to the universal appeal of \n     a historical American art form that both inspires and \n     entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, and geographic \n     boundaries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2008 as ``Gospel Music Heritage \n     Month''; and\n       (2) recognizes the great contributions to the culture of \n     the United States derived from the rich heritage of gospel \n     music and gospel music artists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5663-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4982.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3403) to promote and enhance public safety by \n     facilitating the rapid deployment of IP-enabled 911 and E-911 \n     services, encourage the Nation's transition to a national IP-\n     enabled emergency network, and improve 911 and E-911 access \n     to those with disabilities.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nsubstitute to H.R. 3403, the New and Emerging Technologies 911 \nImprovement Act of 2008. The Senate companion, S. 428, was passed by \nunanimous consent on February 26, 2008. This bill would provide 911 \nservice for Voice over Internet Protocol, VoIP, subscribers.\n  I can think of few government initiatives that have been as \nsuccessful as 911. Since its creation nearly 30 years ago, 911 has \nbecome a lifeline for people in trouble. I think it is safe to say that \njust about every American today knows that 911 is the easiest and most \neffective means to contact emergency services.\n  As technology has advanced, so has 911 service. Today, many places in \nthe Nation have E911. In these areas, when you call for help, your \nphone number and location are automatically transmitted to emergency \npersonnel. If your call is disconnected, you are disoriented, or do not \nknow your location, this information can make all the difference in \nsecuring your safety.\n  But the E911 system was built for wireline service. So as technology \nadvanced and wireless phones grew in popularity, we worked to apply \nE911 principles to wireless service. With the advent of VoIP, we are \nchallenged again to ensure that our 911 policies are up to date.\n  I believe that the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act \nof 2008 does an excellent job of improving 911 service and adapting it \nto the latest telecommunications technology, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Senator Bill Nelson, the sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Stevens, and I have worked with our colleagues in the House to \ndevelop this substitute. Once the Senate passes H.R. 3403, as amended, \nwe expect the House to act expeditiously so that this bill can become \nlaw, allowing our 911 system to continue to save lives and ensuring \nindividuals can always call for help regardless of the underlying \ntechnology they use.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that an Inouye-Stevens \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill as \namended be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4982), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill read a third \ntime.\n  The bill (H.R. 3403), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5665-5", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5665-S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WATER AND SEWER AUTHORITY INDEPENDENCE \n                            PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Michael \n     McKay, Theola Booker, Yolanda Adams, Edwin and Walter \n     Hawkins, Sandi Patty, The Winans, Kathy Taylor, and Brenda \n     Waters, Carl Preacher, and Shirley Joiner of B, C & S;\n       Whereas many of the biggest names in music emerged from the \n     gospel music tradition or have recorded gospel music, \n     including Sam Cooke, Al Green, Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye, \n     Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Little Richard, Ray \n     Charles, Buddy Holly, Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, Mariah \n     Carey, Bob Dylan, Randy Travis, and Glenn Campbell;\n       Whereas, regardless of their musical styles, those artists \n     and so many more have turned to gospel music as the source \n     and inspiration for their music, which has blurred the \n     boundaries between secular and gospel music;\n       Whereas, beyond its contribution to the musical tradition \n     of the United States, gospel music has provided a cultural \n     and musical backdrop across all of mainstream media, from hit \n     television series to major Hollywood motion pictures, \n     including ``American Idol'', ``Heroes'', ``Dancing with the \n     Stars'', ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'', ``Sister Act'', \n     ``The Preacher's Wife'', ``Evan Almighty'', and more; and\n       Whereas gospel music has a huge audience around the country \n     and around the world, a testament to the universal appeal of \n     a historical American art form that both inspires and \n     entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, and geographic \n     boundaries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2008 as ``Gospel Music Heritage \n     Month''; and\n       (2) recognizes the great contributions to the culture of \n     the United States derived from the rich heritage of gospel \n     music and gospel music artists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5666-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ROBERT MONDAVI\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Res. 84) honoring the \n     memory of Robert Mondavi.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi, a much-loved and admired man of \n     many talents, passed away on May 16, 2008, at the age of 94;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi will be fondly and most famously \n     remembered for his work in producing and promoting California \n     wines on an international scale;\n       Whereas Robert Gerald Mondavi was born to Italian immigrant \n     parents, Cesare and Rosa, on June 18, 1913, in Virginia, \n     Minnesota, and his family later moved to Lodi, California, \n     where he attended Lodi High School;\n       Whereas, after graduating from Stanford University in 1937 \n     with a degree in economics and business administration, \n     Robert Mondavi joined his father and younger brother Peter in \n     running the Charles Krug Winery in the Napa Valley of \n     California;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi left Krug Winery in 1965 to \n     establish his own winery in the Napa Valley, and, in 1966, \n     motivated by his vision that California could produce world-\n     class wines, he founded the first major winery built in Napa \n     Valley since Prohibition: the Robert Mondavi Winery;\n       Whereas, in the late 1960s, the release of the Robert \n     Mondavi Winery's Cabernet Sauvignon opened the eyes of the \n     world to the potential of the Napa Valley region;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi introduced new and innovative \n     techniques of wine production, such as the use of stainless \n     steel tanks to produce wines like his now-legendary Fume \n     Blanc;\n       Whereas, as a tireless advocate for California wine and \n     food, and the Napa Valley, Robert Mondavi was convinced that \n     California wines could compete with established European \n     brands, and his confidence in the potential of Napa Valley \n     wines was confirmed in 1976 when California wines defeated \n     some well-known French vintages at the historic Paris Wine \n     Tasting, or ``Judgment of Paris'', wine competition;\n       Whereas, in the late 1970s, Robert Mondavi created the \n     first French-American wine venture when he joined with Baron \n     Philippe de Rothschild in creating the Opus One Winery in \n     Oakville, which produced its first vintage in 1979;\n       Whereas the success of the Robert Mondavi Winery, and the \n     many international ventures Robert Mondavi pursued, allowed \n     him to donate generously to various charitable causes, \n     including the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food \n     Science and Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the \n     Performing Arts, both affiliated with the University of \n     California, Davis, and the establishment of the American \n     Center for Wine, Food and the Arts;\n       Whereas those who knew Robert Mondavi recognized him as a \n     uniquely passionate and brilliant man who took pride in \n     promoting causes that he held close to his heart;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi's work as an ambassador for wine \n     will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he \n     touched; and\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi will be deeply missed in the Napa \n     Valley, in California, and throughout the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress honors the life of Robert Mondavi, \n     a true pioneer and a patriarch of the California wine \n     industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/16/senate-section/article/S5666-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
