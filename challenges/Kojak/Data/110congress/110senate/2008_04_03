Mr. President, the Senate is evenly divided: 51 Democrats, \n49 Republicans. Is the bill that is going to be the subject matter of \nthe housing debate perfect? It is not perfect. But with the Senate as \nevenly divided as it is, we have to work on a compromise basis. We are \nnot going to get everything we want. The Republicans are not going to \nget everything they want.\n  I was interested to see people in the press today telling us how they \ncould have done a much better job on this work Senators Dodd and Shelby \nhave done. I am satisfied with what we have. Is it everything I want? \nOf course not. If I were a dictator, I would come up with a different \nbill. But I am not. The Senate is such that everyone's rights are \nprotected. When you have a body that is so evenly divided, with the \nprocedures we have in the Senate, there has to be compromise.\n  I admire and congratulate Senators Dodd and Shelby for working this \nout to the point where we are. I have complimented them on a number of \noccasions. The last time I did it was last night, indicating what good \nwork they have done.\n  But, also, to get this bill where it is now, we needed cooperation \nfrom other people: for example, those who run the Finance Committee--\nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley. There are some tax measures in \nthis housing bill, and they had to sign off on that. They did that. \nTheir staffs worked hand in hand with the Banking Committee staff, and \nwe have their product.\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n  I look forward to a good debate on this legislation. There will be \namendments offered to take provisions out of the bill. There will be \namendments offered to put provisions in the bill. That is the way it \nshould be. I would hope that people would be willing to have relatively \nlimited time. We wish to move forward on this bill as quickly as we \ncan.\n  At this stage, I have had a number of conversations with the \nRepublican leader as to what we hope can be accomplished in this bill. \nI think at this time it is far too early to talk about timelines and \nwhen, in fact, we are going to get it done. We do know there is an \nemergency out there and we need to do it as quickly as we can. I \napplaud the bipartisan work, as I have indicated. I think we need to \ncontinue this effort of bipartisanship. I think it is critical to do \nthis, to complete this action on this important legislation, and in an \nexpedited manner.\n  I have not had the chance privately to ask the Republican leader--and \nI normally do not do this--but I will violate my own rules today and \nask the Republican leader if he could agree to a unanimous consent to \nprovide for housing-related amendments only.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say my expectation is that the \namendments that will be offered to the bill will be housing-related, \nbut I am not in a position at the beginning of the bill to enter into \nsuch a consent agreement. I think there is a widespread feeling on both \nsides of the aisle that we need to get an accomplishment here, that we \nneed to do it on a bipartisan basis. But I am not in a position other \nthan to say to my good friend that is my expectation. I am not in a \nposition to agree to such a consent here at the outset of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an extremely important hearing that \nis going to start at 10 o'clock or thereabouts, being conducted by the \ntwo managers of this bill. The assistant leader, Senator Durbin, has \nagreed to manage this bill until these two good men can complete enough \nof their work at the hearing to come back and manage the bill. Senator \nDurbin is experienced, and he will handle things extremely well, as \nwell as anyone could do that. I appreciate his stepping in. He had his \nown schedule, and he set that aside to work on this bill. I appreciate \nthat very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2368-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Of course, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus were deeply involved in that with \nregard to the tax portion of the bipartisan bill we have before us. I \nthink this is a good start to the debate.\n  I also say to my good friend, the majority leader, I think this is a \ngood example of how we can work together and accomplish something on an \nimportant issue for the country. We know now we will have amendments on \nboth sides because that is the way the Senate operates. It is my hope \nwe can get to the end of the trail here in the very near future and \nhave a bipartisan bill we can all feel proud of.\n  I want to begin the debate by again thanking Senator Shelby and \nSenator Dodd for getting us to this point.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  I call up that amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 4387.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, begin by thanking the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell. We would not be where we are at this moment without their \nleadership. So any discussion of where we are on this matter begins \nwith them and their staffs for helping us organize the effort over the \nlast number of hours, beginning earlier this week, as we returned from \nthe 2-week Easter break, to try to fashion together a proposal, at \nleast on matters with which there was common agreement.\n  As the leader has pointed out, there are many matters here with which \nthere is significant disagreement. They are not part of the pending \nsubstitute. Senator Shelby and I and our respective staffs, along with \nmany others--certainly the Finance Committee, because there are \nportions of this that are exclusively the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee--have worked over the last 2 days to find those issues upon \nwhich there was common agreement, or at least levels of spending on \nwhich there was common agreement, to move forward on as the \ncenterpiece, with the full understanding our colleagues will offer \nvarious other ideas either to increase amounts of money or to add \nadditional provisions to this bill.\n  What is important here is we are finally working on this issue. As I \npointed out earlier this week, we have close to 8,000 foreclosures a \nday occurring in this country, not to mention, of course, the residual \neffects spreading across the economy of our Nation--the contagion \neffect affecting students loans, car loans, people who are current in \ntheir mortgage but are watching the value of their house decline \nbecause their neighbor's house is in foreclosure, watching home sales \ndrop. This is in the midst of an economy that is stumbling along, to \nput it mildly, with a fiscal situation in dire straits. The dollar has \nbeen weakened. Inflation is rising. Unemployment rates are increasing. \nConsumer confidence is at a low point, the lowest it has been in years.\n\n  So it has been critical, in my view, aside from the specifics which \nyou will hear about over the coming days, that we do everything \npossible to remind the American people that in this body Democrats and \nRepublicans can come together to try to take intelligent steps to move \nagainst the flow of the economy heading in the wrong direction.\n  This proposal we bring to you as a substitute this morning on behalf \nof myself and Senator Shelby, along with the leadership, is that first \nmajor step. Is it the end game? Absolutely not. Are there ideas I would \nlove to have had included in this bill? Absolutely. Are there matters \nhere the Senator from Alabama would like to have included or excluded? \nAbsolutely. But we realized we were not going to be able to do that in \nthis discussion over the last 2\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\ndays, that we needed at least to come up with a core group of issues \naround which there was general agreement, and then from that move \nforward. That is the good news.\n  A month ago, we had a cloture motion on going to a housing debate. It \nwas defeated. You could not even get to a debate on this housing \ncrisis. That now is behind us. There are matters that occurred over the \nlast several weeks that I think probably had a lot of influence on what \nhas caused us to come here this morning. The Bear Stearns, JPMorgan \nsituation, which we will be hearing about later this morning in the \nBanking Committee, was certainly one. I suspect the other major event \nwas the fact that we went home for a couple weeks.\n  There is nothing like going home and to get a message. Members went \nback home--Democrats and Republicans--and they heard from their \nconstituents. They watched what happened on Wall Street in New York \nwhen all of a sudden there was an arrangement, which I think was the \nright one, probably, with some minor differences, that saved a major \ncollapse in our financial institutions.\n  But they asked the very legitimate question: If it was good enough \nfor people to get together to solve a problem on Wall Street, what \nabout the problem on Main Street? What are you doing here to see to it \nthat I can stay in my home, that our neighborhood is not going to \ncollapse--that our taxes and properties and neighborhoods are not going \nto further deteriorate? So I suspect more than anything else going home \nmade a big difference, and we are here this morning to then talk about \nwhat we can do.\n  Two days ago, the majority leader and the Republican leader asked \nSenator Shelby and myself to put together a consensus package to move \nthis process forward, and I am pleased to say we have complied with the \nwishes of the two leaders in crafting a compromise proposal that we \nbelieve merits the full support of this body.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for \ntheir leadership and support in this effort.\n  We worked very intensely through Tuesday night until yesterday \nevening to put together this package that is before us. This effort \nbuilt on the considerable time that we have spent in the Banking \nCommittee over the past 15 months, I might add, in hearings, meetings, \nand briefings, on the causes of and remedies to the current economic \ncrisis. Senator Shelby and I said yesterday that at times of crisis \nsuch as this, inaction is not an option. With more than 7,000 Americans \ngoing into foreclosure every single day, true leaders cannot simply \nturn passively away. Our agreement takes important action to address \nsymptoms of this crisis in a constructive and sensible manner.\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, who did very good and important work in the Finance \nCommittee over this same period of time, the fruits of which are also \nreflected in the package that is now before us in the substitute. This \npackage includes a number of important provisions:\n  Foreclosure mitigation fund--$4 billion for towns and cities to \nacquire foreclosed and abandoned properties, renovate them, and put \nthem in the hands of qualified home buyers or turn them into rental \nhousing as the local markets dictate. That is important because when \nyou have a foreclosed property in the neighborhood, every other \nproperty in that neighborhood declines in value immediately. So trying \nto do something about foreclosed properties to put them back on the \nmarket and get them back with people living in them, either by purchase \nor rental, which will also benefit the neighbors in that community, not \nto mention property taxes, services, and the like--it is a major \nprovision, one which I am glad is included.\n  Foreclosure prevention counseling--$100 million of additional funding \nin fiscal year 2008 to bring borrowers and lenders to the table to work \nout terms that will prevent foreclosures. This brings the budget for \nforeclosure prevention counseling to $280 million for this fiscal year. \nThat is up from $42 million last year. Now, would we have liked to have \ndone more? Absolutely, we would have liked to have done more. Senator \nSchumer and Senator Murray wanted $200 million. My colleague from \nAlabama will tell you there was not a lot of appetite for this proposal \nhere, to put it mildly, so we compromised between $200 million and \nvirtually zero and got it to $100 million. I am told by the nonprofits \nthat there are adequate funds here now in the calendar year to assist \nin the counseling effort, which can make a huge difference.\n  FHA modernization. The bill also includes the FHA modernization \nlegislation which passed this body 93 to 1 last fall, with some \nimprovements. For example, we increased the FHA loan limits from the \ncurrent $362,000 to as high as $550,000. This will make FHA more \navailable and usable to people who live in higher cost States. It would \nalso strengthen the solvency of the FHA fund. FHA can help an awful lot \nof people seeking safe, solid, affordable, fixed-rate mortgages. We \nthink it is a very important component to our comprehensive strategy.\n  Better disclosure. Senator Jack Reed has included a provision in the \nlegislation that improves disclosure. It updates penalties for lenders \nwho fail to make disclosures. These kinds of disclosures might have \nhelped prevent some abusive lending if they had been in place in years \npast. I would point out that I think another Senator also had \ndisclosure provisions in this bill, and this is a compromise between \nSenator Reid and a Republican Senator who was also interested in \ndisclosure language.\n  Tax provisions. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley worked out a \npackage of tax provisions as well. I will mention them briefly and let \nthem describe the provisions more fully themselves. They include a home \nbuyer tax credit to incentivize the purchase of foreclosed properties, \nthe Isakson-Stabenow-Cardin proposal. No. 2 is a property tax deduction \nto help people offset rising mortgage payments. We will provide a \nmodest tax cut to middle-income families of $100 to $250 who don't \nalready itemize their deductions. Senator Bayh and Senator Baucus \noffered that idea. Mortgage revenue bonds to help communities raise \nresources to invest in affordable mortgages and rental housing--it goes \nright to the heart of the problem we are talking about. Net operating \nloss carryback will help businesses ride out the current downturn.\n  This package is a good start. I wish to thank as well Senator Kerry, \nSenator Akaka, and Senator Norm Coleman for talking about veterans and \nmaking sure those serving our country in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere are not going to have their properties foreclosed in the \nmidst of all of this.\n  There are other provisions as well that I am not going into here, but \nneedless to say, again, these are items upon which we could agree, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, to serve as the core of the coming debate. \nOur action today does not preclude, as I have said, further legislative \naction by the Senate. In fact, I am committed to going forward and \ndoing more. In fact, I will hold a hearing next week on the home \npreservation idea that a number of Democrats and Republicans are \nattracted to. Senator Shelby, to his credit--I appreciate his \nwillingness to be a part of that debate and discussion during the \ncoming days. There was a reluctance, and I would have loved to have \nincluded that in this package. There is resistance to that idea at this \njuncture, but I am still determined to do everything I can in the \ncoming days to have that included as well, to see to it that we really \nget a floor and a bottom on this issue as quickly as we can.\n  My colleague from Alabama is here. We are both going to be going over \nto chair a hearing, so I want to give him some time to discuss this.\n  Let me thank Senator Reid and Senator Durbin for their efforts. They \nwill be offering ideas as well to improve and strengthen this \nlegislation. Some of these ideas we will welcome, others we will \noppose.\n  Senator Shelby and I will consult with each other in that process to \ndetermine how to go forward, but we want to stick with this core idea \nif we can. Other ideas that come to the table we will certainly \nconsider and may, in fact, be added to the package, but I think we want \nto try to keep this core package whole and together if we can, rather \nthan having it unravel.\n  So with that, I thank the majority leader, the Republican leader, and \nI\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\nthank my colleague from Alabama. He and I work closely together. Last \nyear, we did 35 hearings and 17 bills in the Banking Committee, half of \nwhich became the law of the land, and some others are still pending \nhere. Our committee is a good committee with good working members who \ncare about these issues, and we are determined to make a difference.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this morning I am pleased to join my \nfriend and colleague, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \nSenator Dodd, in supporting the pending amendment.\n  When a crisis such as the one we are now facing arises, I believe the \nAmerican people expect us to provide effective and timely solutions. \nChairman Dodd and I have worked together to develop a package of \ntargeted measures intended to help stabilize and strengthen the housing \nand the financial markets. We chose not to pursue partisan goals here. \nInstead, we are focusing our efforts on achieving the best possible \nresults in a bipartisan fashion. I commend the chairman for his \nwillingness to work with me in this manner.\n  The amendment before us provides immediate help to the marketplace by \nreforming the Federal Housing Administration, allowing it to provide \ngreater liquidity and thereby enhancing the options available to \nAmerica's homeowners. It also provides additional funding for \nforeclosure prevention counseling, which will hopefully help many \nhomeowners stay current on their mortgages and be able to remain in \ntheir homes.\n  In order to prevent this situation from repeating itself, the \namendment increases the disclosures--this is very important--\ndisclosures made to consumers when they obtain mortgages and close \ntheir loans. I believe that giving consumers; that is, buyers, more \ninformation and greater ability to understand the choices they are \nmaking will help them avoid the pitfalls and bad decisions many \nunderinformed consumers made in the recent past.\n  To better protect our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, the amendment \nextends additional consumer protections and provides those returning \nfrom combat a chance to get back on their feet before they face \nforeclosure. That is the least we can do.\n  In an effort to provide communities with the ability to clean up the \ndamage caused by the foreclosures that have already occurred, we have \nincluded funding to allow States and communities to buy and repair \nforeclosed residences. Attached to this funding is a requirement that \nany profits from the sale of properties must be used to buy and repair \nadditional properties, similar to a revolving fund. I believe that \nreuse of this funding in this manner will maximize the impact of these \ndollars and minimize the possibility that funds will be wasted or \nprofits inappropriately pocketed, as has been the case in the past.\n  The amendment before us also contains a number of tax-related \nprovisions prepared in a bipartisan fashion by the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley.\n  I believe this is a focused and targeted piece of legislation that \nwill address in an appropriate manner a number of the difficulties we \nare now facing in the housing market. There is no doubt that we are \nexperiencing serious economic stress in communities across the Nation. \nAs I said in the beginning of my remarks, the American people expect us \nhere in the Senate to provide effective and timely solutions. But I \nwould caution my colleagues here that while we are in agreement on the \nmeasures contained in this bill, there is a line that I believe we \nshould not cross. That line is represented by a taxpayer-funded bailout \nof investors or homeowners who freely and willingly entered into \nmortgages that they knew or should have known they could not afford. \nNor should we be using taxpayer dollars to bail out financial \ninstitutions that also contributed to this problem. Chairman Dodd and I \nwill shortly be attending a Banking Committee hearing in the Senate \nwhere we will be examining that very question in relation to the Bear \nStearns situation.\n  While there are a large and growing number of homes entering \nforeclosure, I believe we must remember that the vast majority of \nhomeowners are living within their means and are making their mortgage \npayments. While some would argue that we have a responsibility to aid \nthose who find themselves underwater on their mortgages or unable to \nafford their increasing payments, I would argue, on the contrary, that \nwe also have a responsibility to those who have made prudent financial \ndecisions and those who may be looking to enter the housing market for \nthe first time. There is a large group of Americans who see falling \nhome prices not only as an opportunity to buy for the first time but \nalso as an opportunity to move up. We must not forget them in our zeal \nto do something here.\n  Recently, I received a letter from an individual stationed in Japan. \nI think he very effectively makes the case for the other side of the \nhousing market, and I would like to share this with my Senate \ncolleagues. I will read it into the Record:\n\n       Dear Sir: While I'm not a resident of your State of \n     Alabama, I would like to share my opinion with you on a very \n     important issue. My wife and I are very concerned with the \n     direction government policy seems to be taking on the debate \n     over the ``housing crisis.'' I am an employee of \n     the Department of Defense and I am serving overseas in \n     Japan. Before we came here, we lived in Washington, DC, an \n     area with a very high cost of living. From the very first \n     paycheck I received we have been saving every month for an \n     eventual down payment on a home. We could not afford to \n     purchase a home in DC or anywhere near DC and were \n     unwilling to take on an alternative mortgage with 100 \n     percent financing. As such, we rented.\n       When my tour is up in Japan we will probably be going back \n     to Washington and we hope to buy a home. We have worked hard, \n     saved hard, and will be putting down a 20 percent down \n     payment on the home with a 30 year fixed mortgage. An \n     important factor in our being able to purchase a home is how \n     much the market has softened. House prices are dropping \n     because the market was incredibly inflated.\n       Yes, people are losing their homes to foreclosure, but more \n     often than not they shouldn't have been in those homes in the \n     first place. I have very little sympathy for someone who took \n     out two risky mortgages to cover 100 percent of the cost of a \n     home that they could not afford.\n\n  And the letter goes on:\n\n       In fact, I would consider it an absolute slap in the face \n     to see my tax dollars being spent on people to allow them to \n     stay in the home they can't afford when I have been saving \n     for years to get into the home that I hope I can afford.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       I recognize that much of the debate centers around \n     predatory lending practices, and people being duped into a \n     mortgage they didn't fully understand. I feel for those \n     people. I really do. But there must come a point when people \n     take responsibility for their actions. If you didn't read \n     your mortgage before you signed, you made a big mistake, and \n     now are going to pay for it. It is not the Federal \n     Government's job to save people from the natural consequences \n     of their actions.\n\n  The letter reads on:\n\n       As you look for a solution to the current situation please \n     consider the position many of us are in. We work hard, we \n     save, and we buy a home we can afford. Do you really want to \n     punish us by using our tax dollars in a bailout for those who \n     got in over their heads? Do you want to reward poor fiscal \n     discipline and encourage people once again to bite off more \n     than they can chew knowing that Uncle Sam is going to come to \n     the rescue? I believe that people like me are very much in \n     the majority in this Nation. But the media attention isn't \n     going to focus on us. It doesn't make for good TV. They are \n     going to focus on the family that is losing their home \n     because of ``corporate greed.'' No mention will be made of \n     the family that simply wanted more than they can afford and \n     now has to pay the price.\n       Please be an advocate not only for fiscal discipline and \n     responsibility in the government, but in each and every \n     American as an individual.\n\n  I think that is a good letter. I believe these are wise words, and I \nbelieve they are words that I hope we can keep in mind to encourage my \ncolleagues as we work through this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4388\n\n(Purpose: To address the treatment of primary mortgages in bankruptcy, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 4388.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to make a brief opening \nstatement because I know the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, would \nlike to take the floor and has to go to a committee meeting. I am going \nto stay here to manage this bill while Senators Dodd and Shelby are off \nto a Banking Committee hearing with the head of the Federal Reserve, \nMr. Bernanke.\n  The rules of the Senate are written so that virtually any Senator can \nstop the train. It is a strange way to do business around here, but it \nis the way we have done it historically. The so-called filibuster is \nwhere a Senator can take to the floor and say: Stop. I don't want this \nto go forward. Literally, that interrupts the proceedings of the Senate \nuntil that Senator yields the floor or is persuaded by an agreement to \ncooperate with the progress that is needed.\n\n  This bill is critically important for America. It is relating to our \nhousing crisis--and it is a crisis. We proposed, on the Democratic \nside, a housing stimulus bill that had five or six component parts and \nthat I thought was a good, fair, and important piece of legislation. It \nincluded a provision that may have been one of the major provisions of \nthat bill I had authored related to the Bankruptcy Code. It turns out \nthis was the most controversial part of the Democratic housing stimulus \npackage. It drew more fire than anything else. There were other \nprovisions even the President objected to, but it seemed like most of \nthe opposition was directed at my amendment, which I will describe.\n  There came a time this week, though, where we were going to return to \nthe bill with the controversy associated with it--this Democratic \nstimulus package--where an opportunity presented itself. Senator Shelby \nfrom Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, \napproached Senator Dodd, the chairman, and suggested we try to work \nthis out. In fact, that effort was undertaken with the blessing and \napproval of both Harry Reid, the majority leader, and Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader. A lot of hard work went into the \ncompromise. The staff, as usual, had to burn the midnight oil to get \nthis bill ready--not just the Banking Committee but also the Finance \nCommittee. The end result is the substitute amendment that is pending \nbefore the Senate at this moment.\n  I will tell you, as I walked through this substitute amendment, this \ncompromise, this effort, I found there was a glaring omission--my \namendment was gone. The bankruptcy amendment I offered on the original \nbill had been stripped from it. I wasn't surprised. There was a genuine \neffort and undertaking to find common ground between Republicans and \nDemocrats. Clearly, there was opposition to my proposal. I had an \noption at that point, as a Senator--and every Senator has this option--\nto stop the train, to hold things up, and say that is the end of the \nstory. I have seen it done, where some Senators have made a career by \nbeing obstinate, saying nothing will happen until I get my way. \nSometimes they prevail but not always. The net result is an elongated \nSenate process and a lot of wasted time.\n  Those who follow the Senate proceedings on C-SPAN may be familiar \nwith the so-called quorum call, which basically means nothing happens \nbut for a clerk who, every 5 or 10 minutes, reads a name to remind \npeople we still have a pulse in the Senate. But that is a delay, it is \na lack of effort, and it is a waste of time. So I made the decision not \nto use my right as a Senator to stop this bill. I thought that would \nhave been selfish, self-centered and, honestly, didn't serve the \npurpose we are all trying to serve. All I asked in return was to be \nable to offer this amendment. All I ask my colleagues, in return, is to \ngive me a vote. I don't know if I can prevail. It has substantial \nopposition. I wish to give my point of view, state my case for the \namendment, and I welcome those who are opposed to do the same.\n  In fact, I am prepared to do something that is rarely done on the \nfloor of the Senate today. I am prepared to stand here and debate my \namendment. I welcome those who oppose it, and I would debate it on the \nmerits of what I have to offer. You don't see that much anymore in this \ngreat deliberative body. People give their speeches and leave. I will \nstick around and I will be prepared to debate the merits of it and then \nI will accept the decision of the Senate as to whether this amendment \nshould be included in the package.\n  All I ask is that, in good faith, those who oppose the amendment give \nus a timely debate and a vote. Let's not drag this out forever. There \nare Members on both sides of the aisle who would like to offer their \namendments. I wish to say, at the outset, I will not be unreasonable in \nthe debate time I ask for. I hope we can reach an agreement where we \ncan actually have a complete debate and vote on this amendment by 12:15 \ntoday. I am prepared to do that. As I said, whatever the decision of \nthe Senate, I accept it. Let's move forward.\n  When I ran for the Senate--I left the House of Representatives--I did \nit because I respected this institution. I knew so many fine people who \nserved here, and I looked forward to the possibility that on the floor \nof the Senate we could engage and debate on the issues of our time, and \nthose following debate in the gallery or through C-SPAN would hear both \nsides of the debate and form their own opinions and feel like we were \ndoing our job. Let's do that on this amendment.\n  On the bankruptcy amendment I have offered with Senator Reid, let's \nhave that kind of debate.\n  I am going to yield now to the Senator from Oklahoma at this point \nand ask unanimous consent to reclaim the floor after he completes his \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, would he state publicly \nthe time he thinks he might need?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. It is my understanding we had up to 30 minutes. It \nis not my intention to take that much time, but there might be someone \nelse on our side who will want some of the time, in which case I will \nyield to them. So it could take that long.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then, I ask unanimous consent that when 30 minutes has \nexpired, or if the Senator has not used all that, I be allowed to \nreclaim the floor and describe the amendment I have laid at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                  Victory in Iraq and the Middle East\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ncooperation. As I said, if we have any other Members of our side who \nwish to come down and talk about this, there was that length of time \nset aside. So I reserve that time for anybody else who wants to speak. \nIf anybody is listening and they wish to use some of this 30 minutes, \nthey are welcome to do it.\n  I returned 2 days ago from Iraq. It is my 18th trip in the area, in \nthe theater. Sometimes it was Afghanistan and other areas, but it was \nin that zone there. I wished to take this opportunity to kind of show \nwhere we are today, how we got here, and where we are going to go. Some \ngood things are happening over there. A lot of people don't believe it, \nand some people don't want to believe it.\n  The first thing I wish to do is try to give an indication as to where \nwe started and how this whole thing started. We keep hearing quotes \nfrom people--and misquotes--such as General Cody. He is very certain \nthe Army--even though it is stressed--the soldiers themselves are in a \nposition to continue as they have been. But there is a problem. I think \nthe world needs to know how we got into this problem in the first \nplace.\n  It began in the 1990s during the Clinton administration. I have a \nchart. When I make this statement, people tend not to believe it is \ntrue. At that time, we downgraded the military, during those 8 years in \nthe 1990s, by approximately $412 billion. If you look at\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\nwhere we were during the beginning of the Clinton administration, that \nwould be this black line on the chart. If you merely put into this \nchart the inflation rate and kept the funding of the military at a \nconstant level, it would be this black line. However, the red line down \nhere was the Clinton budget. The budget came in--if you added up all 8 \nyears--at $412 billion below what the static budget would have been \nwith inflation added.\n  I say that, and it sounds a little bit like something people are \nhearing for the first time. Yet it should not be the first time. I know \nthere wasn't one month that went by in the 1990s that I didn't come \ndown to the Senate floor and say this euphoric attitude that the Cold \nWar is over and we don't need a military anymore is something that is \ngoing to come back to haunt us. Well, it has come back to haunt us. \nThis is the problem we have. It is very much like during the Carter \nadministration in the 1970s, when President Ronald Reagan inherited a \nhollow force when he took office. It was.\n  When you are decreasing the funding of the military over 8 years, you \nare dropping behind in your modernization program, and it means your \nforce strength will be dropped, and it was a downgrading of about 40 \npercent.\n  One of the things that concerned me at that time was there is this \nfeeling among the American people that we have the best of everything; \nthat when our kids go into combat, they are armed and equipped with the \nvery best equipment that is out there. Unfortunately, that is not true. \nIt should be true. I think the American people would demand--if they \nknew we were having these problems--that we would give our kids the \nvery best of everything.\n  I have always been very appreciative of GEN John Jumper, who, in \n1998, might been the Vice Chief of the Air Force. He stood up and said \nRussia was making a strike vehicle--he was referring to the SU-25 and \nSU-30 vehicles--and selling them all over the world to countries such \nas China, or potential adversaries, which are better than our best \nstrike vehicles, the F-15 and the F-16. In some areas, they were \nbetter. He talked about the stealth capabilities of what the Russians \nwere making as opposed to what we had. At that time, there was one sale \nof around 240 of these vehicles to the Chinese. So they had equipment \nthat was better than ours.\n  Another example is the NLOS cannon. This is the best thing we have. \nThe Paladin is World War II technology. With the Paladin, after every \nshot of this cannon, you have to swab the breach. You saw pictures of \nthis in prior wars. But this isn't acceptable because there are five \ncountries making a better one than we are making, including South \nAfrica.\n  So what we have been attempting to do, after this period of time was \nover, was to start upgrading, modernizing, and increasing the force \nstrength and capability of our American military. Nonetheless, it is \nvery significant that people realize that when this administration took \nover, and 9/11 came about, this was the condition of our military. It \nshould not have been that way. The terrorist movement was active \nthrough the 1990s and during the Clinton administration.\n  In February of 1993, there was a car bomb planted in the underground \nparking garage below the World Trade Center. We knew that, and that was \nprior to 9/11. In June of 1996, Khobar Towers, we remember, were bombed \nby Hezbollah, with intelligence pointing to support by al-Qaida. The \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in 1998, were blown up, and that was \ndone by the terrorists. We all remember what happened in Yemen, when a \nsmall craft went into the USS Cole and killed a number of Americans. \nThat was another terrorist attack.\n  So this terrorism was going on all during the time we were downsizing \nour military. The next thing we find out is we are in a position where \nwe have a down-sized military, and 9/11 comes along and 3,000 Americans \nare killed by terrorists, and we found out other terrorist attacks were \nplanned at that time. That is when this all started.\n  I have to say--because right now I am missing a hearing, which I will \ngo to when my remarks are finished--in talking about this stressed \nsituation of our Army, people need to understand how we got into this \nsituation. After my 18th trip over there, and every time in talking to \nthe young people over there, yes, they are stressed and their families \nare stressed and, yes, they have had more deployments, and they should \nbe 12 months instead of 15 months but they understand this has to be \ndone. We cannot compromise our victory. So we went in after 9/11 for \nthree reasons.\n  First, we went in to liberate Iraq from a tyrannical leader. I \nremember so well in 1991, after the first Iraq war, I had an occasion \nto be on the first freedom flight. It was 1991. There were nine of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans. We were the first ones, in fact, to go to \nKuwait City, but the Iraqis did not even know at that time the war was \nover. They were burning oilfields. The day would turn into night \nbecause of the smoke. That was the environment we were in at that time.\n  We had a person of nobility in Kuwait who had a palace by the Persian \nGulf who was with us. He had a 7-year-old daughter. They went with us. \nAlexander Haig, Tony Cuello was one of the party who went over. At that \ntime, he was, I believe, the Democratic whip of the House of \nRepresentatives. So it was a mixture of people. This man of nobility \nand his daughter wanted to see what their house looked like, if it was \ntorn up during the first gulf war. When we got there, we found out that \nSaddam Hussein had used it for a headquarters. I took the little girl \nup to her bedroom--she wanted to see her little animals--only to find \nthey had used her bedroom for a torture chamber, and there were body \nparts just scattered around in different areas. When we saw this, we \nrealized what an animal this man we were dealing with was.\n  After 1991, we went back several different times, only to find that \nSaddam Hussein went after everybody who he suspected had been opposed \nto him during that first war, and he took care of them in different \nways. He tortured thousands of people to death. You have to have gone \nover there, as I did, and looked into the graves and seen people who \nhad been buried alive. His sons would raid weddings that were taking \nplace. They would rape the bride, and then they would bury her alive. \nPeople who were going to be tortured to death by Saddam Hussein were \nbegging to be dropped into the vats of acid head first so they would \ndie quicker, or into the grinders, or the limbs that were cut off.\n  We really cannot draw a distinction between al-Qaida and Saddam \nHussein in terms of the fact they are terrorists and they have no \nregard for human life. We just recently found an al-Qaida torture \nmanual. The very things Saddam Hussein was doing in torturing people, \nthey are doing now. Take a look at this chart. They are using flames on \nthe throat; cutting the feet open so if they live, they will never be \nable to walk again; hanging by the arms while they had electrodes going \nin; drills used on their hands; and, of course, chopping off their \nlimbs. This is a manual teaching them how to do it. We watched this and \nsaw this was happening. I would think any reasonable person would say \nthat alone would have been enough to go in to stop that reign of \ntyranny that was taking place at that time. But there are other reasons \ntoo.\n  The second reason is there were training camps located in Iraq in \nplaces such as Sargot, Ramadi, Samarra, and one of them was in Salmon \nPac. Salmon Pac is a community in Iraq where they have a fuselage of a \n707 on the ground, and they were teaching people how to hijack \nairplanes. We will never know whether the perpetrators of 9/11 were \ntrained in Salmon Pac. We don't know that. We never will know. \nNonetheless, those are four training camps in Iraq. They are all closed \nnow. They are not training anymore. That alone is certainly itself \nenough reason to have gone in there.\n  The third reason is to help the Iraqi people create a free and \ndemocratic country. People say: Why do we care about the Iraqis? We \nhave problems at home. Why are we spending all this money? Why do we \ncare about what kind of democracy they have? And they thought it was \nimpossible to start one, anyway. One reason is, if they do not do it, \nit is going to be a problem area for terrorists in the Middle East \nuntil they are fighting on our soil. The troops who are over there know \nthis.\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n  I just got back. I talked with many troops. In fact, now we have the \nOklahoma 45th over there, and we visited with most of them. They \nunderstand why they are there.\n  What would happen? There were a lot of surrender resolutions, a lot \nof cut-and-run resolutions that got a lot of attention in this body. I \ncan remember when moveon.org had the big ad campaign portraying David \nPetraeus, one of our great American heroes, as ``General Betray Us.'' \nIt was unconscionable. There were resolutions to disavow what he said. \nThere were 25 Members of this Senate body who opposed those \nresolutions.\n  When the terrorists see this, they are hoping and praying that we, \nthe Americans, are going to leave Iraq. On August 28, 2007, Ahmadinejad \nmade a statement. He was referring to these resolutions that are going \nto draw our people out of Iraq. He said:\n\n       Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill that gap. . . .\n\n  We are talking about Ahmadinejad. That is why the Iraqis are getting \nso cooperative with us. They don't want that vacuum filled.\n  I was talking the other day with BG Jimmy Cash. He is retired. He is \nthe former command director inside the Cheyenne Mountain complex in the \nlate 1980s. He said: I watched Iran and Iraq shoot missiles every day, \nall day long for months. They killed hundreds of thousands of their own \npeople. They were fighting for control of the Middle East.\n  Which reminds me, when all these people are talking about weapons of \nmass destruction, we knew they had weapons of mass destruction then. We \nknew they were killing hundreds of thousands of their own people in the \nnorth, the Kurds, and they were using weapons of mass destruction to \nsend chemical warheads up there that have the effect of burning people \nto death from the inside out, the most painful thing--women, babies, \neverybody, thousands and thousands of them.\n  Anyway, if he were to fill that vacuum, we do not know how long it \nwill take for America to be a target on our soil.\n  If we look at what is working, one of the things I noticed on the \nmany trips I have taken over there--about a year ago, a little more \nthan 13 months ago, the surge began. That was General Petraeus. What \ndid he say? GEN David Petraeus said we have to go in there with a surge \ncapability in certain areas. He was concerned about some of the areas \naround the triangle. As we went in there and positioned ourselves, we \nfound that he was right in his analysis as to where we needed to have \nmore troops stationed--in Fallujah and Ramadi. Remember, just about 2 \nyears ago, they declared that Ramadi would become the terrorist capital \nof the world. Now Ramadi is under total security, not by the United \nStates but by the Iraqi security forces. So we have watched what has \nhappened since that time.\n  One of the reasons the surge has worked so successfully is that we \nhave had the religious leaders realizing that if we leave, Iran will \ncome in and fill the vacuum, and they cannot have that happen. So the \nreligious leaders, the imams, the clerics started giving positive \nmessages about the United States of America.\n  A year ago, we had our defense intelligence attending the weekly \nmeetings of the mosques. I think they meet every Friday. At that time, \n85 percent of the messages that were given in the mosques by the \nclerics and the imams were anti-American messages. As of April of last \nyear, almost a year ago, there had been virtually none. They are all \nnow positive messages. What does that mean? It means that the Iraqi \ncitizens have now--just like, Mr. President, anyplace in your State of \nArkansas or elsewhere in our communities, we have Neighborhood Watch \nprograms. Now they have them. They have their own citizens going in \nwith bait cans, drawing circles around the undetonated IEDs so our \ntroops will not be killed. We watched in Anbar all the incidents. They \nhave been down from 40 a day to 10 a day. We have seen economic growth, \nthe markets open and crowded. The large project in the Sunni Triangle \nis now back on track. They are going to have the capability to help \ntheir people now.\n  The Iraqi Army is starting to perform really well. This surprises a \nlot of people because they don't think the Iraqi security forces have \nthe capability of being the type of soldiers they are today. We saw \nthis the other day. In fact, I was over there the other day in Bucca in \nBasra when they went in and took care of the problems so we didn't have \nto do it. This is what we are seeing.\n  If you have any question that it is true, all you have to do is look \nat some of the people who never really wanted to be friends of the Bush \nadministration who were opposed to the liberation of Iraq. One such \nperson was Katie Couric. This shocked everybody when she was \ninterviewed. That was in September 2007 by Bob Schieffer. This was live \non TV. She had made a trip, after she had been criticizing the war, \ncriticizing the Bush administration, criticizing the whole liberation \neffort. She went over and came back and said:\n\n       Well, I was surprised, you know, after I went to Eastern \n     Baghdad. I was taken to the Allawi market--\n\n  I have been there also--\n\n     which was near Haifa Street which was the scene of that very \n     bloody gun battle back in January, and you know this market \n     seemed to be thriving and there were a lot of people out and \n     about. A lot of family-owned businesses and vegetables stalls \n     and so you do see signs of life that seem to be normal . . . \n     the situation is improving.\n\n  That is not me talking, that is Katie Couric, whom we least expected \nthat from.\n  We see these things happening. I always make a point when I visit \nwith people in the markets, if I see someone carrying a little baby, I \nwill go in there intentionally without any kind of armament, with an \ninterpreter. The interpreter will tell us just what they are saying. \nAnd people with young kids love the Americans.\n  I have to say this too. We are going to see, and have seen already, a \nlot of accusations that we in the United States, in our Department of \nDefense, CIA, and the rest of agencies, are guilty of all kinds of \ntorture. It is true that back in Abu Ghraib, when it first happened, \nthere were some people there who did the wrong thing. I think there \nwere 11 of them altogether. They were doing some things that were \nperhaps not the kinds of things we would endorse. That was taken care \nof by the U.S. Army. They took care of it. But that came out, and \npeople started talking about what the Americans were doing. Yet look \nwhat is in their manual, the types of inhumane torture.\n  I went to Bucca. Bucca is where we have the most detainees in Iraq. I \nwas wanting to find out for sure by going around and interviewing \ndetainees. I interviewed, I would say, about 40 or 50 of them. I picked \nthem out myself. I took an interpreter. Each one said: We never were \ntortured when we were captured. We have been detained. We will be going \nback to where we came from. They have become real supporters of the \nUnited States. They were treated right. They were treated humanely. \nThey are teaching them to read. They are teaching them to study their \nKoran. They are teaching them carpentry and other trades because one of \nthe biggest problems they have--it is easy to recruit people when there \nis total unemployment. The unemployment rate is so high. They have to \nfeed their families some way. Now we have trained them, and they are \nable to go back and get jobs and take care of their families without \nhaving to do it through the military.\n  I just say to you, Mr. President, since this whole situation began--\nand I happened to be in Fallujah during each of the two elections that \ntook place, and I watched the Iraqi security forces go down to vote \nwhen they knew they were risking their lives. They voted the day before \nso they could offer security. I watched those people risking their \nlives--remember the purple finger--knowing their lives were at risk \nwhen they voted. This is the democracy they have been looking for. \nDemocracy has been working. I came back this last time thinking the \nsurge has been progressing so well; if we just keep it up, really good \nthings are happening over there.\n  Considering we started with a downgrading of some $412 million in our \nmilitary, then 9/11 came and we were forced into a war as a result of \nthat, we have done so well.\n  Mr. President, I was a part of the draft many years ago, and I was a \nbeliever for quite a number of years,\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\nuntil the first gulf war, that we should have mandatory service because \nI know what a great thing it did for my life. But when you go over \ntoday and you see an all-volunteer force and see what they are capable \nof doing and what they have done, you come back so proud that they \nstarted out down here with very little to work with, and they have been \nable to sustain it.\n  Are they overworked right now? Are they deployed too often and too \nlong--15 months? Yes, they are. It looks as though we are going to be \nable to drop that down to 12 months. But the troops themselves say: \nWhatever it takes, we are going to do this. They know the alternative. \nThe alternative is the war will be waged on American soil. We don't \nwant that to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania before we claim the floor to describe my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the two documents I have in front of me, one of which is a \ndescription of the life of one of our fallen soldiers, as well as a \nnews article from the Citizens' Voice newspaper dated December 23, \n2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First Lieutenant Michael J. Cleary, of Dallas, born April \n     4, 1981 was killed in action by hostile forces on December \n     20, near Samarra, Iraq. Lt. Cleary had just completed a \n     demolitions mission when an ambush occurred. Mike was Platoon \n     Leader of the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team in E Company, \n     1st of the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry \n     Division.\n       Mike graduated from Dallas Senior High in June 1999. While \n     at Dallas, he was a four-year letterman in both soccer and \n     tennis, and captain of both teams his senior year. He was \n     named to all star teams in both sports. He was selected to \n     attend the National Youth Leadership Forum on law in his \n     junior year and was involved in many school activities \n     including National Honor Society. He received the Dr. Pepper \n     Soccer MVP Scholarship and the History Scholarship at \n     graduation and was offered academic scholarships at Ursinus \n     College, Gettysburg, Dickinson, and Lafayette. He chose \n     Hamilton College in Clinton, NY.\n       While at Hamilton, Mike participated in varsity soccer and \n     lettered in varsity tennis. He joined Sigma Phi Fraternity \n     and became the chapter president. He gave up intercollegiate \n     sports and participated in all fraternity intramural sports, \n     winning the Hamilton Golf Intramural Championship. He wanted \n     to enlist in Special Forces immediately after the attacks of \n     September 11, but chose to follow the advice of his mother \n     and stayed in school until completing his studies. He \n     graduated in May 2003 with honors from the Economics Program.\n       In his senior year, he applied to, was tested for, and was \n     accepted into the Marine Flight Officer Program. He was \n     notified that his class would be deferred to January and \n     enlisted in the U.S. Army. He went to Basic Training three \n     weeks after college graduation, earned his Airborne Wings and \n     Sapper Tab, and graduated from the SAS Antiterrorist Course. \n     He was a player-coach of the Ft. Leonard Wood soccer team, \n     which won the Post Commander's Cup. His last soccer \n     competition was as player-coach of 1st/15th Infantry Soccer \n     Team that played a Thanksgiving Day game with the Republic of \n     Georgia Army Team.\n       Mike's military decorations include the Combat Action \n     Badge, Bronze Star Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Air \n     Force Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Good \n     Conduct Medal, and three campaign medals. He was awarded the \n     Overseas Military Service and Active Duty Army Ribbons, as \n     well as Meritorious and Valorous Unit Citations.\n       Mike is survived by his parents, Marianne and Jack Cleary, \n     Dallas; sisters, Erin Flanagan, her husband James and their \n     three children, Bedford, N.H.; Shannon Cleary, Maui, HI; \n     Kelly Cleary and Fred Tangeman, DeLand, FL; brother, Patrick \n     Cleary, Dallas; his loving fiancee, Erin Kavanagh, Dallas, \n     and his maternal grandfather Joseph Nemeth of Waverly, N.Y.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From citizensvoice.com, Dec. 23, 2005]\n\n                    A Family Mourns a Fallen Soldier\n\n                         (By Robert Kalinowski)\n\n       Dallas.--It was at her bridal shower Sunday when Erin \n     Kavanagh had one of her last conversations with fiance, 1st \n     Lt. Michael Cleary.\n       ``Mike called during the shower and said, `Have fun doing \n     whatever girls do at bridal showers. I love you,' '' Kavanagh \n     recalled, her voice soft and crackling with a cup of water \n     she was sipping in hand.\n       A grand wedding was set for mid-February. Cleary was \n     ``packing up'' in Iraq, scheduled to complete his yearlong \n     tour in 10 days. The couple was to move into an apartment \n     near his Georgia Army base Jan. 4, she said.\n       ``I kind of thought we were free and clear,'' Kavanagh said \n     Thursday with Cleary's dad, Jack, by her side just two days \n     after Cleary was killed in action.\n       The two spoke at length about the heroic 24-year-old Army \n     officer from the office of Jack Cleary's Dallas-based \n     business, Cleary Forest Products.\n       Cleary and another soldier from his unit, Spc. Richard \n     Junior D. Naputi, 24, of Guam, died Tuesday in Taji, Iraq, \n     when an improvised explosive device detonated near their \n     Humvee during combat operations, the Department of Defense \n     reported Thursday. They were assigned to the 1st Battalion \n     15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, \n     Fort Benning, Ga.\n       Kavanagh sporadically cried while slowly flipping though a \n     thick stack of pictures of Cleary.\n       There were photos of him fishing and hunting. Some were of \n     him with family and some with fellow soldiers in Iraq. She \n     cracked a small laugh at one of him chopping down a Christmas \n     tree last year.\n       The 25-year-old then paused when she came across one of the \n     couple and their parents, immediately recalling the date it \n     was taken: May 19, 2005.\n       That was the day her lifelong friend and then-boyfriend \n     asked her to be his wife.\n       It was the last full day they spent together. The next day, \n     Cleary shipped off to finish his tour after a two-week leave \n     at home, she said.\n       Behind Kavanagh was a laptop computer, on which she had \n     just checked her e-mail. The subject line of one of Cleary's \n     final messages to her, sent Dec. 17, read: ``So good to hear \n     your voice today, Love.''\n       After Kavanagh's bridal shower--attended by 50 people at \n     Apple Tree Terrace, Newberry Estates, Dallas, where the \n     wedding reception was to be--she traveled to Virginia, where \n     she was living.\n       She was packing her belongings for the move to an apartment \n     at Cleary's military base in Georgia, where they planned to \n     live until Cleary's enlistment was complete in December 2006.\n       It was there on Tuesday night when she learned the \n     devastating news her soon-to-be husband had been killed.\n       Her mother, brother and close friend drove the 250 miles to \n     tell her face-to-face, she said.\n       Kavanagh struggled but couldn't describe her initial \n     reaction Thursday before a family member walked into the \n     office, approached her crying and offered condolences. The \n     two sustained a lengthy embrace as they whispered to each \n     other and sobbed.\n       Several minutes later, Kavanagh discussed how she's coping \n     with the tragedy.\n       ``I've just been with family. I'll have to take it one day \n     at a time,'' she said.\n       ``And, I have a new family, right Jack?'' she innocently \n     asked Cleary's father, who said yes without delay.\n       Cleary tried to, and usually did, call every other day, \n     Kavanagh and Jack Cleary said.\n       He last called each of them Monday, they said.\n       Toward the end, he focused on talking about a Dodge Ram \n     pickup truck he bought and was waiting for him and where he \n     and Kavanagh should go on their honeymoon, they said.\n       The honeymoon location was still being finalized.\n       ``Erin said she didn't care (where they were going), but he \n     said, 'Dad, I think that means she really does,' '' Jack \n     Cleary recalled.\n       Cleary and Kavanagh began dating on Nov. 25, 2004, which \n     was Kavanagh's 24th birthday, while Cleary was home before \n     deploying to Iraq.\n       The two knew each other since they were children and \n     graduated together from Dallas High School in 1999. After \n     high school, Cleary decided to follow in his dad's footsteps \n     to Hamilton College in New York state.\n       Pursuing an economics degree, Cleary was in his junior year \n     when he first considered the military. He was troubled by the \n     Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, his dad said.\n       ``He came home for Thanksgiving in November and told us he \n     all but signed the final papers to join the Army special \n     forces,'' said Jack Cleary, a decorated Army veteran of the \n     Vietnam War.\n       His parents convinced him to finish college first. While \n     doing so, he applied for the Marine Corps officer flight \n     school. When told his entry would be delayed, he ``said `I'm \n     not waiting''' and decided to enlist in the regular Army.\n       After completing basic training, Cleary was quickly \n     promoted several ranks and entered the Army's Officer \n     Candidate School. He was commissioned first lieutenant in \n     December 2003 and trained extensively for his eventual \n     deployment to Iraq, where he was a platoon leader and \n     champion for his soldiers, his dad said.\n       ``He loved the guys he was with. They were doing their \n     job,'' Jack Cleary said.\n       The military has offered Cleary's family a full honors \n     burial in Arlington National Cemetery.\n       Jack Cleary said the family is honored by the request, but \n     will likely decline.\n       ``Our feeling is home,'' he said with a pause. ``We want \n     Mike home.''\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                    First Lieutenant Michael Cleary\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about a young \nman from my home region of northeastern Pennsylvania who lost his life \nin the war in Iraq, 1LT Michael J. Cleary of Dallas, PA. He was born \nApril 4, 1981, and we are thinking of him today for so many reasons, \nnot the least of which is a birthday tomorrow. I want to provide \nsomewhat of a biographical sketch, and then talk a little bit about his \nlife.\n  Michael Cleary was a graduate of Dallas High School in Luzerne \nCounty, PA, in June of 1999. He was captain of two teams there, both \nsoccer and tennis. He was an active member of so many organizations, \nincluding a proud member of the National Honor Society. He had \nopportunities at several colleges, but he chose Hamilton College in the \nState of New York. While at Hamilton, he participated in varsity soccer \nand received letters in varsity tennis. He was the chapter president of \nthe Sigma Phi fraternity. And despite all of his college and academic \ninterests, he also had a feeling in his heart for his country, and he \nwanted to serve. He wanted to enlist in special forces immediately \nafter the attacks of September 11 but chose to follow the advice of his \nmother--which for all of us is the right thing to do--and she urged him \nto stay in school and to complete his studies.\n  He did that, and he graduated in May of 2003 with honors from the \neconomics program. Ultimately, his dream was fulfilled when he joined \nthe military. Unfortunately, he lost his life in December of 2005. His \nmilitary decorations include the following: the Combat Action Badge, \nthe Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, the Air \nForce Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Good Conduct \nMedal, and three campaign medals.\n  It is hard to describe in a short amount of time, even in a writeup \nin the newspaper, as local papers did at that time, but probably the \nbest way to encapsulate what Michael Cleary's life has meant to this \ncountry is to remember the words of Abraham Lincoln when he talked \nabout the sacrifice of our soldiers. When he spoke about the battle of \nGettysburg, he spoke of those who gave the last full measure of \ndevotion to their country. We now can say that about so many of our \nyoung men and women who fought in Iraq, and one of them was Michael \nCleary. He indeed gave the last full measure of devotion to the country \nhe loved.\n  He didn't have to do it. He had a great career ahead of him because \nof his academic achievements and because of his leadership qualities. \nHe could have pursued another path, but he chose to give back. He chose \nto sacrifice for his country, knowing full well that he could be asked \nby God to give the last full measure of devotion, and he did.\n  We are thinking of his family today for so many reasons, not the \nleast of which is that First Lieutenant Cleary was the fourth \ngeneration of that family to serve his country. His father, Jack \nCleary, was a decorated Army veteran from the Vietnam war, and then two \ngenerations before that. So this is a family who has sacrificed in \ngeneration after generation, and we are thinking of them today. \nTomorrow, they should have been able to celebrate Michael's birthday, \nwhich would have been his 27th birthday, but they cannot. They are \nstrong people. They understand the sacrifice he made, and we are \nthinking about them this morning and tomorrow and on so many other \ndays.\n  I think sometimes it is very difficult for us to fully comprehend--\nthose of us who have not had a close family member lost in combat--what \nthis means to a family, what it means to a community such as \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, in Luzerne County, even years later now. It \nis difficult because in so many parts of our State, as is true of the \nwhole country, when we lose one soldier, especially in a small town, in \na smaller community, the impact is devastating. And not only the \ninitial impact of that, but months and years later.\n  I think it is important we don't just look back and remember and pay \ntribute to the day they died and to the sacrifice they made, as \nimportant as that is, but we should be remembering, as well, their \nlife, their life of achievement and triumph, and their life of service \nbecause when these families look back on these young people, they are \nnot just going to remember their service in the military. Family \nmembers know our fighting men and women weren't born into divisions and \nplatoons. They weren't born with a uniform on; they were born into \nfamilies--families of mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and \naunts and uncles and cousins and friends and so many others we all know \nare part of all of our families. So I think it is important to remember \nthese young men and women, to the extent that we can, on their birthday \nor some other significant moment in their life.\n  Finally, let me say this: The news article I cited from December of \n2005 talked about the plans Michael Cleary had to be married to Erin \nKavanagh. I will not review the whole article, but suffice it to say \nthat it is a powerful story of what one soldier's hopes and dreams \nwere--to serve his country but to come home and then start a new life \nand to be married. So we are remembering her as well today and \nremembering they graduated together from Dallas High School in that \nyear of 1999.\n  We are grateful this day in so many ways, but it is difficult to \nfully explain how grateful we are for his life of service and \nsacrifice, his life of courage and commitment, and his life which was \nfocused on the future, his own future but also the future of our \ncountry. So tomorrow, as his family celebrates his birthday, we are \nremembering Michael J. Cleary at this time, and we wish for him and for \nhis family all of God's blessings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is an amendment \nto the housing bill, which I offered earlier and on which I have asked \nthe Republican side to consider a unanimous consent request so that we \ncan debate and vote on it still this morning. I hope they will consider \nthat in a timely manner. I am prepared to offer an equal amount of time \nto both sides of the aisle on the substance of this amendment and then \naccept a vote at 12:15.\n  We have proffered this unanimous consent request, and I hope, in the \ninterest of time and fairness, that the Republican minority will accede \nto this request, or if they wish to modify it, let us know as quickly \nas possible.\n  Here is what this amendment is all about. We have 2 million people \nabout to lose their homes. These are people who bought a home with a \nsubprime mortgage. A subprime mortgage usually meant some exotic brew \nof terms for a mortgage which didn't exist traditionally or \nhistorically. It might be an adjusted rate mortgage where you pay a low \ninterest rate on the front end and then, after 1 year, 3 years, or 5 \nyears that interest rate would go up. There were even mortgages offered \nthat were interest only, so that people were paying low monthly \npayments of interest but not retiring the debt on the house. The \nprincipal debt remained the same. The theory was that as long as the \nvalue of real estate was going up in America, you couldn't go wrong. No \nmatter what deal you signed up for to get into a house, if the house \nwas going to appreciate in value, don't worry about it.\n  There were also people who took that mortgage on their home and \nconsolidated a lot of other debts they had on cars and other things, \nhome improvements, and put it all in that mortgage so that they had a \nmortgage debt that was actually greater than the current value of the \nhome.\n  These so-called subprime mortgages were being written right and left. \nIn the old days, going back to when I first bought a home, there used \nto be pretty close scrutiny of your credit record. They used to require \n10 percent of the value of the home as a downpayment, or 5 percent. You \nhad to pay points; in other words, thousands of dollars at the closing. \nIt was pretty tough in those days.\n  Well, the whole climate of home lending changed with the subprime \nmortgages. More and more people moved into homes. The values of homes \nwere mushrooming, and it looked as though we were just riding the crest \nof a wave. Well, guess what happened. The wave crested and started to \nfall. And when it fell with the subprime mortgages, a lot of people \nwere hurt. The\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\nso-called adjustment of the mortgage took place and an affordable \nmonthly payment became unaffordable. All of a sudden, the low interest \nrate blossomed into a much larger interest rate. Or perhaps a family \nstumbled--somebody lost a job, a divorce, a serious illness in the \nfamily--and with that stumble, they missed a few payments.\n  Well, now, add this up into a nation of 300 million people, and we \nend up with 2 million folks who face the prospect of losing their \nhomes. Now, a lot of people say, well, isn't it a darned shame. But why \ndid they sign up for those crazy things to start with? They should have \nused better judgment. They should accept their medicine at this point \nand maybe they will be a little smarter the next time around.\n  If it were that easy, we could write it off as the moral hazard of \nmaking a bad decision, of irresponsible borrowing. But it turns out to \nbe more significant. Two million people losing their home in a nation \nof 300 million doesn't sound like much, but 2 million people losing \ntheir home will affect the value of homes around them.\n  What is the value of my home in Springfield, IL? Well, if you ask an \nappraiser or realtor, they will say: I don't know, but I will tell you \nwhat I will do. I will look at other homes in the neighborhood that \nhave gone for sale--comparable sales, comparable values. So they look \nup and down the block and around the block, in the neighborhood, and \nlook at what homes are selling for, comparing them to my home, and they \ncome up with a valuation on my home.\n  Well, if down the block and around the corner a home was foreclosed \nupon--in other words, the people were forced out of the home, there was \na forced sale of the home, and it was sold for less than fair market \nvalue--that value will be calculated into the appraisal of my home. The \nexperts tell us that 2 million people losing their homes in America \nwill drag down the value of 44 million homes. It is a ripple effect.\n  As the value of homes declines, more people face the reality that the \nmortgage principal, the amount they owe on the mortgage, is greater \nthan the value of their home. The shorthand term they use is, you are \n``underwater.'' Your mortgage value, your mortgage principal is greater \nthan the value of your home, so you can't borrow against the value of \nyour home anymore. You are already in debt over the value of your home. \nThat is the third ripple.\n\n  Then there is the fourth, the mentality of buyers across America. \nThis is the one that troubles me the most. For over 70 percent of \npeople in America, if you ask them are they going to buy a home, and \nthey say no, when you say: Can't you get a mortgage, they say: Yes, we \ncan get a mortgage. Why won't you buy a home? They say: I don't think \nit is a good investment.\n  Seventy percent of people in America today say buying a home, real \nestate, is not a good investment. Why? They are afraid the $500,000 \nhome today will be worth $450,000 next year--not a smart deal.\n  As long as this mentality is out there, the housing industry is flat. \nThat doesn't hurt just your realtors and your developers, it hurts \nhomebuilders, skilled craftsmen, people who supply homes--from those \nwho are gardeners and do the landscaping, to furniture--you name it. \nAll of these related industries are slowing down into this recession \nwhich Mr. Bernanke finally conceded yesterday may be on the horizon. \nThat is why addressing this home crisis is important--not just for 2 \nmillion people who had the mortgages, but if we do not deal with those \n2 million people losing their homes, it is going to have a dampening \neffect on our entire economy. It is going to hurt all of us.\n  A recession is a period of time in which businesses fail, jobs are \nlost, consumer confidence is low, the economy slows down. It happens in \na free market economy. But you do not want it to go on too long because \nit can have a long-term negative impact.\n  What we are trying to do today is to pass a bill to breathe some life \nback into the housing industry and housing market in America. The bill \nis good, and it has a lot of good provisions. I am happy to support it. \nI think there are things in this bill which will be of value to us as a \nnation. I think virtually every one of them has some impact, some \npositive impact. But there is not a single one of them that will have \nthe positive impact of the amendment I offer. Here is what the \namendment says.\n  Currently--now--if you find you cannot pay your bills and you still \nhave a job, you can go into chapter 13 in bankruptcy. You go to the \nbankruptcy court and say: I am in a mess. I am in over my head. I have \nmore debt than I can take care of. Will the bankruptcy court work with \nmy creditors so I can have an arrangement to pay off my debts? I would \nhave to change the terms of some of the debts, but at the end of the \nday I will get out of this mess.\n  The bankruptcy court takes a look at it and decides whether it is \ngoing to work. You may be dreaming. You may not even have a chance. \nYour creditors may not want to cooperate. So this chapter 13 is just an \neffort to try to help people get out of this mess.\n  We think about 600,000 people facing mortgage foreclosure will take \nthis option and go to bankruptcy court. If they go into the bankruptcy \ncourt and try to work out their debts and keep their homes, they have a \nproblem. Under current bankruptcy law, you cannot modify the terms of \nthe mortgage on your home. In other words, at the end of the day, you \nare still stuck with that same subprime mortgage that may have toppled \nyou in the first place. The reason I offer this amendment and the \nreason I want to change that one provision is because it is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  If I walk into a bankruptcy court and I own a farm and I say I cannot \nmake my farm payments, my mortgage on my farm, the bankruptcy court has \nthe legal authority to change the mortgage terms on my farm or on my \nranch or on my vacation condo--I don't own one--or on the big boat I \njust bought and on which I can't make the payments. The bankruptcy \ncourt can change every single one of those, but it cannot change or \nmodify the mortgage on your home. Why? Of all of the things in the \nworld they can change, why not that?\n  It turns out that by tradition it has never happened. So I bring the \namendment and propose the court be given that authority.\n  The group that is opposed to this, screaming bloody murder, is none \nother than the mortgage bankers, the same people who brought us the \nsubprime mortgage mess. They do not want to see the terms of their \nsubprime mortgages changed in court. And they say: If you change them, \ninterest rates will go up.\n  What I did, working with that industry, is say: I will apply this to \na narrow group of people, the most limited group I can find that still \nhas some impact on this issue, and I will narrow the discretion of the \nbankruptcy court. So listen to where this amendment takes us.\n  First, you have to qualify to go into court. We changed the law \nsometime a few years ago. To qualify to go into bankruptcy court you \nhave to have a certain income; you have to go through certain processes \nand disclosures--even credit counseling. All that is required before \nyou can walk into the court.\n  Second, this only applies to your home. I don't want a person walking \nin saying: I bought 100 acres down in southern California and I need \nhelp--no way. Just your home.\n  Third, it only applies to existing mortgages as of the date of the \nenactment of this bill. A mortgage you enter into after the day this \nbill is enacted would not apply.\n  Fourth, the court can only reduce the principal on the mortgage--the \namount that you owe--no lower than the fair market value of the home. \nYou protect the lender. If you go through foreclosure and have an \nauction, it can sell for a lot less than fair market value. So fair \nmarket value is the bottom line.\n  Fifth, the interest rate the bankruptcy court can impose can be no \nlower than the prime rate plus a premium for risk.\n  Sixth, the term of the mortgage can be no more than 30 years.\n  And then, seventh--and we did this saying to the banking industry: \nWhat more can you ask? If in the next 5 years you sell that home and it \nhas appreciated in value, any increase in value over the fair market \nvalue as of the date of the bankruptcy goes to the lender, not to the \nowner. What more can we do to protect these bankers--fair market value \non one end, any appreciation in value on the other end. And they still \noppose it.\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will take a look at this. The \ncredit unions support this because they don't get into the crazy loan \nbusiness that some of these mortgages did. A group that includes the \nAARP, groups all across America, consumer groups, they understand this \nis only reasonable. The New York Times has editorialized in favor of \nit. I think this is an approach which will help a number of people. It \nis narrow and focused. It is limited in its scope, and it is really \ndirected toward giving people another chance to stay in their homes. \nThey still have to pay the mortgage. They don't get off the hook, but \nthey can stay in their homes.\n\n  Stabilizing the housing market, stabilizing your neighborhood and my \nneighborhood, breathing some life back into this housing industry, that \nis the way to turn this recession around. This amendment I offer on the \nBankruptcy Code will help more people than all of the provisions \ncombined in the rest of this housing act. This reaches a lot of people. \nHundreds of thousands could qualify. I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to please consider this amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this point I see two of my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor, Senator Smith of Oregon and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and \nI would like to yield to them for whatever periods they would like to \nspeak and then reclaim the floor on my amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me make a unanimous consent request that when the \ntwo Senators have completed their remarks I be recognized again on my \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant leader \nfor his comments and his leadership in this area. As he may recall, we \nwere together at a meeting at the White House a month and a half, 2 \nmonths ago now with the President, with Secretary Paulson, Vice \nPresident Cheney, and a small group of Senators there to talk about the \nstimulus package. As I know he may recall, I raised at that time the \nhousing crisis, saying to the President that the entire cause of \neverything that was bringing us there to discuss the stimulus was in \nfact the subprime crisis and that no stimulus package should be passed \nthat didn't in effect stem the tide of foreclosures and address the \nuncertainties in the marketplace and the lack of confidence. So I know \nhe joins me in expressing regret that not withstanding the nodding \nheads and comments of affirmation, absolutely nothing happened. Nothing \nhappened.\n  Sadly, it is not until the Federal Government puts up $400 billion to \nbail out Bear Stearns and other investment banks that you really get \nsome kind of response from the Federal Government. I am not complaining \nthat they should not have done what they did with respect to Bear \nStearns and other investment banks because the implications of their \nfailure could have had a profound impact, spilling down into our \neconomy. But when the pain is trickling up to a Bear Stearns, and \nfinally the administration notices--that very same pain has been felt \nfor over a year now by people being foreclosed on in the economy--it \nreally is an underscoring of the degree to which an administration is \nout of touch with the real concerns and realities in the life of the \nAmerican people.\n  We need to show that commitment, here and now, in passing this \nforeclosure act to deal with the problem nationally. We need to do it \nnow. It is long overdue. As many as 8,000 foreclosures are occurring \ndaily. Some of these loans we know were absolutely predatory; almost, I \nbelieve, criminal. People knowingly went out, knowingly made loans to \npeople they knew were not capable, ultimately, of meeting the adjusted \nrate mortgages, but because of the benefit to them and the immediate \ntake in terms of the points they would make and the commissions and \nreturns on those transactions, they went ahead and did it. Frankly, \nsome of those came from the very same people who have just been bailed \nout by the Federal Government.\n  I commend our majority leader for his efforts to bring this to the \nSenate floor now and his efforts, together with Senator Dodd, to try to \nwork through this particular legislation. Let me share with my \ncolleagues, last weekend--things have gotten so bad in Boston that \nMayor Tom Merino recently opened a war room where city officials are \nworking together on a day-by-day basis to fight the wave of \nforeclosures that we have seen in recent days.\n  A few months ago I was in the city of Brockton in Massachusetts and \nmet with the mayor. He said: You have to take a moment and come \nupstairs and meet with me with these folks who are here, and impromptu \nwe went upstairs and there was a group of people from the community who \ncame together in desperation to try to figure out how they were going \nto deal with the foreclosures in Brockton. This mayor had already \nprocessed some 400 foreclosures in Brockton, and he was staring at an \nadditional 800 or so that were going to come at them.\n  What happens to a community already struggling to get their economy \nback on track when they face that kind of wave of foreclosures is, \nstreet by street, house by house, as they get boarded up and people \nleave the homes, the rest of the property values start to go down--the \nlocal gas station, the local 7-Eleven, the pharmacy--everybody begins \nto feel the impact.\n  But most important, from the mayor's point of view and from the \nGovernment's point of view, they begin to see a decline in revenues. \nThe only place mayors can go in any kind of wholesale fashion to deal \nwith a decline of revenues is to cut fire, police, and schools.\n  There are plenty of communities in America where we have already seen \nthose kinds of reductions, all of which run completely counter to how \nwe build a community and to what we are trying to do in order to \nrestore economic strength in the country.\n  Just this last weekend I attended, with Mayor Menino, at a high \nschool in Roxbury, in Massachusetts, in Boston, a homeowner foreclosure \nprevention workshop. I was literally stunned at the numbers of people \nwho had come into this high school on a Sunday afternoon, bringing all \ntheir financial records because they had been unable to get hold of a \nreal human being to talk to in order to try to work out a reasonable \nagreement for what they could pay and be able to stay in their homes.\n  Rather than face one of those endless phone calls where you press 2 \nto talk to somebody who will tell you to press 4 who will give you an \nautomated response to press 7 or whatever it is--we have the lenders \nthere. We brought the various lenders there and people were able to go \nthrough a screening process and then go back to a room, sit down with \nthe lenders, tell them their predicament, and actually negotiate a \nrefinancing.\n  I met people that afternoon who were smiling, who said to me: Thank \nyou for getting us together. Now I can stay in my home.\n  That is all it takes, that kind of effort. I talked to one woman who, \ntogether with her husband, is paying $5,000 a month for their home, for \ntheir mortgage. They have two mortgages now. They are both working, \nboth of them are working.\n  But I asked her what her rate was. What are you paying for a rate? \nShe said: Well, I am paying 7.25 percent on one, and I am paying 9.25 \npercent on the other. Nobody, with the current discount rates in \nAmerica, is paying those kinds of rates. It is absurd.\n  I also had the woman next to that particular one who was waiting in \nline, who, when she heard the 7.25 and 9.25 said: That is nothing. I am \npaying 13.25 percent on mine. So if we were to renegotiate, according \nto a fair standard of what the rate is, with what the national interest \nrates are today, and fixed rates that are available to people, a lot of \nthose folks could stay in their homes, and they can afford to service \ntheir mortgage.\n  What we need do is stop the greed and unbelievable sort of arrogance \nof some of these companies, some of those people who asked literally to \nbe able to renegotiate: We were told no. I will tell you in a moment \nabout a woman I met in Lawrence, MA, where this predicament is also \ngoing on.\n  The fact is that nationwide, by last year, we all knew that 2.5 \nmillion mortgages were already in default. That was 40 percent more \nthan 2 years earlier. And despite a 40-percent increase, there was no \nresponse from this administration. Communities across\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nthe country are being hit hard. Last year the mortgage foreclosures in \nMassachusetts alone were up 128 percent, and the foreclosure rates of \nfive Massachusetts metro areas were in the top 100 in this country.\n  How did we get here? Well, we got here because lenders lowered their \nstandards for lending but did not appropriately plan for the increased \nrisk they incurred when they lowered the standards. They flooded the \nmarket with mortgage loans, ignoring the risks to borrowers and to \ntheir own bottom line.\n  As usual, most of these people turn around and expect us to bail them \nout; in most cases to bail them out first. For some time, some of us \nhere in Congress have been screaming about predatory lending practices. \nI happen to think it is usury to allow 30 percent rates. A whole bunch \nof Americans do not know they are actually paying 30 percent rates \nafter a group of penalties on their credit cards.\n  There are even more Americans, millions of them, who are paying 18 \npercent. I urge any American to go back and look at what their rate is \nat the bottom in the fine print on their credit card or ATM statements \nand they will be shocked by the levels of interest they are paying.\n  I think these are excessive. These are wrong. Many people I know, all \nthose of us who went to law school, learned about ``buyer beware,'' \n``caveat emptor.'' That is one of the first things you learn in law \nschool.\n  But the fact is, we put standards in place through the years as to \nwhat is an unfair practice. We have unfair trade practice laws in many \nStates, and they are simply not being applied. But legislators in this \ncase have backed up and turned a blind eye to what are unfair practices \nin the marketplace. Now, were there abuses on the other side of the \nledger? The answer is: Yes, there were. Some homeowners inflated their \nincome. Some misrepresented themselves to get a bigger home than they \ncould afford, and obviously we are not talking about bailing out people \nfrom those kinds of situations. But there is blame enough to go around.\n  I will tell you what has not been enough to go around, and that is a \nrapid and appropriate response from the Federal Government in order to \ndeal with this problem. Lenders are now getting help. But homeowners \nare still struggling. The fact is there are a lot of homeowners out \nthere who have the ability to pay for a mortgage. They cannot carry the \nincreased rates and they cannot necessarily carry the inflated levels \nthat some of them have been put into because of these predatory \npractices.\n  Let me give you an example. This week I went to Lawrence, MA and met \nwith homeowners who are facing foreclosure. Approximately 700 homes \nwere foreclosed in Lawrence last year alone. I am told that number is \ngoing to rise for this year.\n  I talked with a woman by the name of Rosa Hernandez, who has four \nchildren, works two jobs, one as a nursing assistant at the local \nnursing home, in order to support her family and to be able to earn \nenough to own her home. She did everything she could in order to make \nher house a home. She fixed the roof, she bought a new boiler, she \nupdated the electrical system of her new house, and she did it with \nthis increase in value that the company came and loaned her. After she \nwas hospitalized twice last year she could no longer afford to work two \njobs. At the same time her subprime mortgage interest rates went up \nfrom 4.5 percent 5 years ago to 7.5 percent. She told me, through a \ntranslator, that when she could not make the payments, she went to her \nlender. Her lender refused to make loan modifications that would allow \nher to stay in her home. Her lender told her they were going to devalue \nher home down to about $99,000. I think she had a total of $220,000 in \nthe home. They are going to devalue it to $99,000 and put it on the \nmarket and sell it. She said: I can afford to pay $99,000. Let me stay \nin it for that. They refused to let her stay in, even though she could \nservice that payment with the job she has with a family of four, stay \nin her home. They are prepared to kick her out and then put it on the \nmarket and sell it to someone else for the same price. That is \ndisgraceful. That is disgusting. And that is the kind of unregulated \npractice that is taking place out there because people have walked away \nfrom any sense of common decency and responsibility.\n  The fact is that thousands of families such as hers have been through \nthe same kind of predicament where they are forced to start all over \nagain. Each time a house is foreclosed on, a family's economic dream \nlies in tatters. But it is not only the family that faces the \nforeclosure that suffers; the entire community suffers. I have talked \nto police officers who tell me about the increased work they have now \nto try to patrol by houses that they know are abandoned and boarded up. \nThe property values of entire streets and communities start to drop, \nwhich affects the entire ability of that community to be able to \nfunction. As I described earlier, crime rates go up, neighborhoods get \ntorn apart, schools are disrupted because when the family gets kicked \nout, kids are yanked out of the classroom and you end up with a \ncomplete disruption to the school system.\n\n  According to the census, by late 2007 a higher percentage of houses \nin the Northeast sat vacant than at any time in the last 50 years, \nprobably since the Great Depression.\n  So today we are debating the Foreclosure Act of 2008. This has the \nopportunity to be able to deal with this crisis. It reflects a \nbipartisan compromise. It is a good first step toward addressing this \ncrisis. It includes a provision, and I thank Senator Smith from Oregon \nfor his long participation with me in this effort as a member of the \nFinance Committee. We both passed an amendment in the Finance Committee \nto the stimulus package. We had hoped this would have been included in \nthe stimulus package a few months ago so this good could have begun to \ntake hold so that families who have been foreclosed on in the last few \nmonths would not have been. Regrettably it did not happen. But we are \nhere now.\n  I am appreciative of him and his efforts to help include that in the \nbill to provide an additional $10 billion. We originally sought $15 \nbillion of tax-exempt private activity bonds that finance our housing \nagencies. What the housing agencies would do with this money is take \nthe proceeds from the bonds and use them directly to refinance subprime \nloans, provide mortgages for first-time home buyers, for multifamily \nrental housing.\n  In the case of Massachusetts, that would mean about $211 million of \ntargeted mortgage relief to the homeowners of our State. Similarly, \nevery State in the country would benefit from this provision. I thank \nChairman Baucus and Senator Dodd for their efforts to include this \nprovision in the final bill because of what it can do to help \nstruggling families.\n  In 2006, State and local governments financed 120,000 new homes with \nmortgage revenue bonds. With the additional $10 billion in funds, \nStates and localities can equal that amount and finance approximately \n80,000 more home loans. According to the National Association of Home \nBuilders, every mortgage revenue bond new home loan produces almost two \nfull-time jobs, $75,000 in additional wages and salaries, $41,000 in \nnew Federal, State, and local revenues. Each new home then results in \nan average of about $3,700 that gets spent by the new occupants on \nappliances, furnishings, property alterations, all of which provide a \nreal shot in the arm to our economy.\n  The reason this mortgage revenue bond proposal is so important is \nthat to many lower income families, they are having difficulty \nrefinancing their existing mortgages. This additional funding makes it \neasier for families facing foreclosure. It will make it easier for \nfirst-time home buyers to buy a home, which means that the glut in the \nmarketplace today of all of those homes that have already been \nforeclosed will finally find a group of people because of these bonds \nwho will be able to take those houses off the market and become part of \nthe community.\n  The goal is simple. We want to provide assistance to those who need \nit most. The extra $10 billion for this program is a proven way to help \nRosa Hernandez or others be able to stay in their homes. I might add \nalso, before I close and cede the floor to my colleague, there is in \nthis bill also $4 billion for the community development block grant, \nwhich a number of us have advocated strongly for, that will also help \nlocal communities to deal with the effects of the housing crisis.\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\n  As we all know, the community development block grant is the only \nreal flexibility mayors get in dealing with crises in their community. \nSo I am delighted that is here and that we can help local governments \nbe able to deal with this crisis.\n  Finally, there is a provision I fought for in this legislation that I \nam pleased is in it, which is the proposal I put forward to address the \nforeclosure concerns of our returning veterans. Those who have served \nour country in Iraq and Afghanistan should never come home to a home \nthat is in danger of foreclosure. But some are. You have a lot of \nNational Guard folks who are doing their second or third deployment, \nand many of these people are in small businesses, or in some cases even \nsole proprietors. They have taken a pay cut, in many cases, to serve \ntheir country. They do not get paid as much for serving on active duty. \nThe result is that many of them have been put into difficulty.\n  What we do is extend the foreclosure grace period from 90 days to 9 \nmonths, and we extend the freeze on mortgage interest rates for the \nfirst year a soldier is home. This is one of the ways we can make good \non the rhetoric which is present all over the country about how we care \nfor the veterans but, in fact, whether it is the VA budget or \ncounseling or post-traumatic stress syndrome, or a host of other \nthings, we have rarely put enough money there to keep pace with that \nrhetoric.\n  This helps to do it. I do thank Senator Dodd for his work to include \nthose provisions in this bill. I do not think anybody wants to see an \nIraq or Afghanistan or any other area veteran join their brothers and \nsisters who served in Vietnam, too many of whom were in the ranks of \nthe homeless or the dispossessed during those years. We owe them more \nfor their plights. This helps to do that.\n  I close by drawing attention to the fact that a record 37.3 million \nhouseholds currently pay more than 30 percent of their income on \nhousing costs, and more than 17 million Americans are paying more than \nhalf of their income to be in their homes. So as we consider additional \nremedies down the road, I hope we are going to deal with the fact that \nwe can create jobs while easing the affordable lending housing crisis \nif we were to pass this and pay more attention.\n  I used to be chairman of the Housing Subcommittee on Banking before I \nwent over to Finance.\n  I know for almost 10 years we were struggling to get one voucher or \ntwo for housing. It wasn't until 1999 that we got the first 50,000 \nvouchers in 10 years and the year after 100,000. But we have neglected \nhousing as a matter of national policy for almost 20 years now. What \nsome of us wish to do is create a housing trust fund that takes money \nfrom the surplus that comes through the FHA lending program, insurance \nprogram. But the money that housing produces in surplus actually goes \nto the general revenue. Some of us believe money produced by housing, \nthat creates a profit in effect or a surplus for the Federal \nGovernment, ought to go back into housing rather than continually have \nhousing be the stepchild of American policy. We hope we will ultimately \nbe able to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. I thank my \ncolleague from Oregon for his patience and, most importantly, for his \ncoefforts in this initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry, my colleague from \nMassachusetts, for his kind words. We come to the floor today as \nRepublicans and Democrats trying to work out a bill that will make a \ndifference on the central plank of the current economic slowdown. It is \na time, frankly, to note we are finally working in a way that will make \na difference and make progress for the American people.\n  Tuesday evening, I went home and TiVo'd the news. I saw Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell standing together before the cameras. Behind them \nwere Senators Dodd and Shelby, as well as Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley from the Finance Committee, who have worked with Senator \nKerry. When I saw these Senators together in a joint press conference, \nI thought I also heard a collective sigh of relief from the American \npeople that finally the Senate was proceeding in a way they expect. I, \nfor one, was breathing a sigh of relief that there was agreement and \nthat we are here productively engaged in finding a solution. I also \nthank Senator Kerry. He and I have been at this amendment now for \nmonths. I have had the privilege of working with him on many issues \nover a long time. I am currently on the Finance Committee, and this \namendment we actually got approved in the Finance Committee in the last \nstimulus package. I wish it had survived that process because it would \nalready be making a difference. But with the help of leaders on the \nFinance Committee and the approval of the Banking Committee, it has now \nbeen included in the underlying bill. I thank all of them for this.\n  As I noted back in January, we offered this legislation as an \namendment. The committee approved our amendment with an overwhelming \n20-to-1 bipartisan vote. Again, we were not able to keep it in the \npackage, but it is in the package today.\n  Across the country, rising interest rates and slumping home values \nare creating the perfect financial storm for many American families. \nThe legislation Senator Kerry and I authored is aimed at stemming this \ntide and providing homeowners an option to avoid foreclosure and stay \nin their homes. Under current law, State and local governments are \npermitted to issue tax-exempt bonds, called qualified mortgage bonds, \nto finance new mortgage loans to first-time home buyers. What our \nlegislation does is temporarily expand the use of this program to \ninclude refinancing of existing subprime loans. It would also provide a \n$10 billion increase in tax-exempt bond authority which could be used \nto provide these refinancing loans, issue new mortgages for first-time \nhome buyers, and, finally, invest in multifamily rental housing. Our \nproposal would also exempt mortgage revenue bonds from the alternative \nminimum tax to make them more attractive to investors and to cut home-\nbuyer mortgage costs further.\n  For Oregon, the increased bond cap will translate to roughly $122 \nmillion in new bond authority to address the State's housing needs. Our \nneighbors in Washington State will receive roughly $210 million in new \nbonding authority, enough to produce more than 1,300 loans. In Arizona, \nwhere the delinquency rate has jumped from 2.9 percent in the fourth \nquarter of 2005 to 5.45 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, an \nestimated 1,400 new mortgage loans will be generated by this bill.\n  Michigan, which had a delinquency rate of 8.9 percent at the end of \nthe fourth quarter of last year, will have its bond cap increased by \nmore than $332 million, enough to generate more than 3,300 new home \nloans or refinancing.\n  Another example, Arkansas, with a delinquency rate of 6.6 percent as \nof last December, will receive more than $92 million in increased \nbonding authority which would lead to more than 1,100 new loans. \nNationwide it is estimated our proposal would lead to roughly 80,000 \nnew loans.\n  To anyone who questions whether addressing the housing crisis is \neconomic stimulus, I would say each one of these new home loans is \nprojected to produce almost two full-time jobs; $75,000 in additional \nwages and salaries; $41,000 in new Federal, State, and local revenues; \nand an average of $3,700 in new spending on appliances, furnishings, \nand property alterations.\n  Our proposal is not going to solve all that ails the housing economy, \nbut it is an important and good start, and it will provide real relief \nto working families at risk of losing their homes. This relief is \ntargeted, not a bailout to investors who were looking to cash in on the \nhousing boom. The new housing bond authority will be subject to the \nprogram's income and purchase price requirements. In 2006, mortgage \nrevenue bond borrowers had an average income of $45,000 and bought \nfirst-time homes with an average purchase price of $137,000.\n  I wish to say, again, how pleased I am the Senate is finally moving \nto debate on this housing package. If we are serious about stimulating \nthe economy, we need to take a look at the root causes of this \nslowdown. First among\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nthose is housing. There are a number of important items in the bill we \nare debating. I was disappointed, however, the AMT exemption for the \nlow-income housing tax credit was not included in the base bill. This \nis something Senator Cantwell and I have been advocating and will \ncontinue to work this week to see if we can add to the bill.\n  I hope we can work quickly, though, as Americans, as Republicans and \nDemocrats, to get this bill to the President, a bill he can sign, so we \ncan, through common sense and common ground, achieve some common good \nfor the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4388\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before the Senator begins, I wonder if he \nwill yield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ncomments of the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Montana be \nrecognized and then I be recognized following the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for offering this amendment and for initiating very \nconsiderable discussion on the plight now being faced by many \nindividuals who are faced with mortgage foreclosure.\n  He and I have had very extensive discussions on his proposal and my \nlegislative proposal, which has been introduced as S. 2133, which \ndiffers from the Durbin amendment in that it provides authority for the \nbankruptcy court to change the variable interest rate mortgages which \nhave caused so much confusion and so much difficulty in leading to \nforeclosures by people who could not pay the increases which were noted \nby the variable interest rate mortgages.\n  There have been a number of situations where the mortgage rate has \njumped far in excess of what the borrower had anticipated.\n  A homeowner in Lithonia, GA, who borrowed on a variable interest rate \nmortgage, found the interest payments rising from $1,079 to $1,444, \nwhich the borrower could not afford.\n  A first-time home buyer in De Soto, TX, found their variable interest \nrate mortgage moving from $1,400 to $1,900.\n  It is a pattern across the country where people have faced \nforeclosures.\n  The difficulty which I see with the Durbin amendment is it will \nimpact on the ability of borrowers to secure mortgages in the future \nbecause lenders will be unwilling to loan money where there is the \nprospect that Congress will intervene and grant authority to bankruptcy \ncourts similar to that suggested by Senator Durbin today.\n  The core of the consideration was articulated by Justice Stevens in a \ncase captioned Nobleman v. American Savings, in 1993, where Justice \nStevens said:\n\n       At first blush it seems somewhat strange that the \n     Bankruptcy code should provide less protection to an \n     individual's interest in retaining possession of his or her \n     home than of other assets. The anomaly is, however, explained \n     by the legislative history indicating that favorable \n     treatment of residential mortgages was intended to encourage \n     the flow of capital into the home lending market.\n\n  So you have the anomalous situation, as articulated by Justice \nStevens, that on the principal home the bankruptcy court does not have \nsuch authority. That is for a very sound public policy reason: that if \nthe bankruptcy court did have that authority, then lenders would be \nunwilling to lend money for first-home mortgages. So if you have a \nsecond home or if you have a yacht or if you have other assets, the \nbankruptcy court does have that authority, but for good reason it does \nnot have the authority on first homes.\n  There have been a number of studies on the subject concluding that \nthe impact of the Durbin amendment would be deleterious to the ability \nof people to get mortgages because of the reluctance of lenders to put \nup the money.\n  Professor Joseph Mason of Drexel University testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that ``it is straightforward to conclude'' \nthat cramdowns will increase the cost of mortgage credit.\n  In its analysis of economic stimulus options, the Congressional \nBudget Office noted that one of the costs of cramdown proposals ``could \nbe higher mortgage interest rates.''\n  Federal Chairman Bernanke testified before Congress that modification \nof mortgages ``would probably lead to concern about the value of \nexisting mortgages and probably higher interest rates for mortgages in \nthe future.''\n  In studying the impact of cramdowns for farm real estate in Chapter \n12 bankruptcy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that \ncramdowns raise the interest rates on farm real estate loans by between \n25 and 100 basis points.\n  Even the report cited by supporters of Senator Durbin's bill \nconcluded interest rates will increase. In their paper, ``The Effect of \nBankruptcy Strip-Down on Mortgage Interest Rates,'' Georgetown law \nprofessor Adam Levitin and Joshua Goodman acknowledge that allowing \nbankruptcy courts to cram down mortgages will increase interest rates.\n  The effect of my bill, which is a great deal more modest, will not, I \nsubmit, have that effect. The essence of the bill which I have proposed \nwill apply only to mortgages given, borrowings, prior to the date of \nthe introduction of my bill and will sunset in 7 years.\n\n  I think it is important the legislation now pending in the Senate \ndeal with the so-called little guy, the guy who lives on Main Street. \nWe have already seen very substantial relief for Wall Street in the \nBear Stearns bailout. I am opposed to bailouts. If the entrepreneurs on \nWall Street are making investments with the prospect or the expectation \nor the hope of big profits, and they find their judgment is bad and \nthose profits are not realized and instead there are losses, it seems \nto me they ought not to be coming to the taxpayers for a bailout. Where \nthey are looking for big-time speculative profits, and they are wrong, \nthey ought to sustain those losses instead of having the losses \nsustained by the taxpayers.\n  It is understandable that the Federal Reserve took an exceptional \nview of the Bear Stearns situation in order to avoid a potential ripple \neffect and devastating consequences on the economy. It was not a \ngigantic bailout, in any event, when Bear Stearns stock was selling for \n$150 or thereabouts a year ago, and the initial bailout was for $2 and \nthe prospect of increasing that to $10.\n  But I believe the current legislation pending before the Senate is \nunduly balanced for the big guy as opposed to the little guy or the \nperson who operates on Wall Street as opposed to the person who lives \non Main Street. That is why I support the focus of attention which \nSenator Durbin has brought with his bill--although for the reasons I \nhave stated I disagree, and my bill takes a much more modest approach--\nSenator Durbin and I worked long and hard to try to reach some \naccommodation and some compromise, and we could not do it because our \napproaches are so basically different.\n  We finally had a vote on our bill in the Judiciary Committee today. \nOur legislation was introduced last fall and could have been acted on \nby the Senate a long time ago. We could have brought this matter to the \nfloor and stimulated other amendments and other discussion. The delay \nof months has resulted in many foreclosures. In the Judiciary Committee \ntoday, on a 10-to-9 party-line vote, my bill was defeated, and the \nDurbin bill was passed for action on the floor. But events on the floor \nhave finally overtaken the committee action. The committee did act \ntoday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could very briefly, because I know \nothers are here to speak, I would like to distinguish, if I can, three \nor four approaches where we differ between us.\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n  The first element that is important--and I wish to make sure it is \nclear for the record--my amendment gives to the bankruptcy court the \nauthority to modify the mortgage. But under your amendment, or your \napproach, the ultimate decision on whether a mortgage is going to be \nmodified still has to be approved by the lending institution; is that \nnot correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I answer the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois through the Chair by saying that is correct. My bill does \nallow for the modification of the principal sum but only where the \nlender is in agreement. I do not do that to give the lender control of \nthe situation. I do that to avoid having a principle established where \nlenders in the future will be unwilling to loan money for mortgages if \nthey think the bankruptcy court has the authority to reduce the \nprincipal over their objection. But if the lender agrees to it--and I \nthink it is important because the bankruptcy court would not have the \nauthority to reduce the principal unless there is the provision I have \nby obtaining the lender's agreement.\n  But the principle that the Senator from Illinois seeks to reduce the \nprincipal sum, I think, is sound, so long as you do not destroy the \nability of the lender to control it so as to not discourage future \nlenders. So my answer is yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for only two or \nthree more questions.\n  I might acknowledge the fact that currently those lenders can \nrenegotiate the terms of a mortgage without a bankruptcy court and that \ngiving them the last word is going to diminish, I believe, the \nlikelihood that they would agree to anything by the bankruptcy court.\n  I might also say that under chapter 12 bankruptcies and on farm loans \na few years ago, we gave this authority to the Bankruptcy Court and the \nlenders said: Oh, interest rates will go up, and they didn't.\n  But I wish to ask this specific question. My amendment limits these \nmodifications to mortgages that are subprime mortgages, and the Specter \nbill, S. 2133, says these modifications would apply to any type of \nloan, even prime fixed rate mortgages. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It would apply only as long as they are variable \ninterest rate mortgages.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to also ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania, through the Chair: Is it true that the Senator limits the \napplication of his modification of mortgages by the Bankruptcy Court to \nfamilies earning less than 150 percent of State median income, which \nwould be somewhere in the range of $60,000 to $70,000 a year in most \nStates--annual income of most States--and would not cover those, for \nexample, in the State of California and other States where they have \nhigher incomes and higher mortgages?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is correct. It \nmay be that my proposal is too modest in that respect. I am not in \nconcrete on that specific provision because I think that could be \nmodified to accommodate different markets without dealing with the \nunderlying principles I am concerned with.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I might say to the Chair, I have spoken to the Senator in the hopes \nthat we can bring this to a vote. I have spoken to the minority leader, \nSenator McConnell, and he has said there are other Members who wish to \ncome to the floor to speak on this amendment, and I hope they will. \nThere is no point in dragging this out indefinitely. There are many \nother amendments that are going to be offered and I wish to bring this \nto a vote.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for the \nquestions. I think the questions clarify the positions. It is almost \nlike debating an issue in the world's greatest deliberative body. Too \noften speeches are made with no one present except the Presiding \nOfficer and perhaps someone who is listening on C-SPAN 2, besides my \nsisters. But we need more of this kind of a discussion in the Senate to \nilluminate and provide a little life and a little spontaneity besides \nSenators who rise and read from a text, and frequently reading badly \nfrom a text.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois that we ought to move ahead on \nthis bill and vote as soon as possible, and I join him in urging people \nwho have amendments to come to the floor. It is my intention to offer \nanother--my amendment, S. 2133, and to have a vote on that after we \nconclude with the amendment by the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nPennsylvania. The last 10, 15 minutes has been one of the more \nedifying, constructive, and helpful explanations on various approaches. \nHe made the statement that perhaps there should be more of that on the \nSenate floor, a point with which I strongly agree. I thank both \nSenators for that dialog.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Charles Dickens wrote:\n\n     Home is a name, a word,\n     it is a strong one;\n     stronger than a magician ever spoke,\n     or a spirit ever answered to,\n     in the strongest conjuration.\n\n  Simply put, we are here today to help families keep their homes. We \nare here today to move a package of tax provisions that will help those \nfamilies to keep their homes. Our package does so with tax relief for \nhomeowners, for home buyers, and for home builders. We are offering \nthis Finance Committee tax package as part of the pending consensus \namendment assembled by the two leaders and by Senators Dodd and Shelby.\n  Today, many American families find their home is threatened. A weak \nhousing market has spread weakness throughout the larger economy. More \nthan 5 million households now owe more than their house is worth. That \nis about 1 out of every 10 home mortgages. As prices fall, that number \nis expected to grow.\n  Our tax package seeks to stabilize the housing market by providing \ntemporary, targeted, and timely tax relief to the housing market. We \nhave developed a consensus package that is limited to four provisions \nand these provisions focus solely on our ailing housing sector. The \nFinance Committee passed the first two provisions early this year as \npart of the economic stimulus package.\n  First, our package increases the number of mortgage revenue bonds. \nMortgage revenue bonds are tax-exempt bonds issued by State and local \nhousing finance agencies. With the proceeds, these agencies can extend \nmortgages to home buyers at interest rates below the market rate. This \nwill help. It will help homeowners avoid foreclosure and will increase \nfirst-time home purchases.\n  The subprime and affordable mortgage markets have virtually \ncollapsed. As a result, demand for mortgages financed by housing \nfinance agencies is increasing. State housing agencies can respond \nimmediately to the growing risks of foreclosure. These agencies can \nissue more mortgage revenue bonds. That can provide States the option \nto refinance subprime mortgages, and additional mortgage revenue bonds \ncan help clear out the glut of existing homes on the market through \nfirst-time home purchases.\n\n  Our proposal includes a second provision that the Finance Committee \npassed earlier this year. That is extending the carryback period for \nnet operating losses, otherwise known as NOLs, from 2 years to 4 years.\n  Generally, cyclical businesses have profitable years followed by loss \nyears. During a loss period, a company will carry back the net \noperating losses from the loss years to their prior profitable years. \nThey will file a quick refund claim and that quick refund claim will \nact as a cash infusion that will allow the company to survive a loss \nperiod.\n  The housing industry in particular will greatly benefit from an \nincreased NOL carryback period. The expanded period will allow builders \nto avoid selling land and houses at distressed prices, and it will \nprovide less costly financing.\n  An increased NOL carryback period will improve business conditions \nfor the eventual return of the housing market, and the expanded period \nwould give the housing industry cash to meet payroll, which would \ncertainly limit additional job losses.\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\n  Third, our proposal provides broad-based tax relief for low-income \nindividuals and those who have already paid off their mortgages. Under \nour proposal, homeowners would be allowed to deduct local real estate \nproperty taxes from their Federal tax return, even if they don't \nitemize. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, more than 28 \nmillion taxpayers pay property taxes but don't itemize. Our proposal \nwould provide these 28 million taxpayers a deduction for the amount of \ntheir property taxes up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for married \nfilers. Most often, nonitemizers are low or middle-income people. Our \nproposal will also benefit those who are not likely to itemize because \nthey have already paid off their mortgages. Senior citizens clearly \nwould benefit. The Congressional Research Service estimates that nearly \n130,000 property taxpayers could benefit in my home State of Montana \nalone.\n  Fourth, our package provides a home ownership tax credit for the \npurchase of homes subject to foreclosure. Behind each foreclosed \nproperty is a family kicked to the curb, and the suffering does not end \nthere. Foreclosed and vacant homes are a blight on the neighborhood. \nThey drag down home prices. They are targets for vandalism and \nburglaries. Congress should encourage people to purchase those \nproperties. That will help to stabilize home prices and get the housing \nindustry back on track.\n  Our proposal provides a one-time credit for taxpayers of $7,000. The \ncredit will be claimed over 2 years and the home purchase would have to \nbe made in the following 12 months. The short-term nature of this \ncredit is critical to providing immediate stimulus. It also ensures \nthat we do not oversubsidize the housing industry or exacerbate the \ncurrent oversupply of residential homes.\n  This focused package of four proposals will go far. It will go far to \naddress the housing downturn and economic weakness in our country. I am \nproud we have all pulled together on this with Senator Grassley and \nothers, and I hope the Senate can pass it into law expeditiously.\n  A lot of irresponsible actions led to the housing crisis, but now a \nlot of responsible homeowners, home buyers and home builders are caught \nup in it. Tax relief and mortgage help to folks who played by the rules \nin the housing market is the right thing for Congress to do. The tax \nprovisions in this package will keep property values up, keep folks in \ntheir homes, and keep businesses afloat, and those are all keys to \nhandling the housing crisis.\n  In sum, this is an effort to provide tax relief to homeowners, home \nbuyers, and home builders. It is an attempt to help families keep their \nhomes. It is an effort to preserve an important word stronger than any \nmagician ever spoke or any spirit ever answered to--the word called \n``home.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia has asked me to \nyield 1 minute of my time, and I will do so without yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  While the chairman of the Finance Committee is on the floor, I \nexpress my appreciation to him, Chairman Baucus, on the hard work that \nhas been done on this particular legislation, in particular, the tax \ncredit on foreclosed homes, and to praise his staff for the late night \nconcentrated hours Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning when this \nwas put together. It was a remarkable effort and I wanted the chairman \nto know how much I appreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might respond to the Senator from \nGeorgia, I certainly appreciate those remarks. He is to be complimented \nfor bringing the idea forward to me personally and to others. It is a \nmajor contribution to the solution we are providing here. We did have \nto tailor it down a little bit within the confines of the package. I \nthank the Senator from Georgia for being agreeable and for working with \nus to find a way to make this work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to address the Durbin amendment \nbecause I am concerned that the Durbin amendment would hurt low and \nmiddle-income families by making home mortgage interest payments \nhigher, make them more expensive, by discouraging credit counseling and \nmortgage renegotiations and inadvertently steering more American \nhomeowners into bankruptcy.\n  Let me try to quantify what I mean in terms of the expense. It is \nestimated that the so-called cramdown provision would raise interest \nrates on average by about 1\\1/2\\ percent. In Texas the average home \nloan is $122,000 a year. The monthly payment for a 30-year fixed home \nmortgage at 6 percent is $734. If you add a percentage point and a half \nto that, it goes up by $122 a month. So if these estimates are \ncorrect--and I think they are the best information we have available to \nus now--the average increase to Texas homeowners would be almost $1,500 \na year. It would be $1,465 a year. For that reason, among others, I \noppose the Durbin amendment.\n  The bill actually risks increasing the cost of owning a home for \nevery American, and not just for people in my State, in Texas. There \nhas been a little history to this provision as well.\n  The Democratic Congress and President Jimmy Carter back in 1978 had a \nreason for excluding from cramdown the ability for a bankruptcy judge \nto actually go in and rewrite the interest rate so people could afford \ntheir home. As a matter of fact, the cramdown exception, which this \namendment would eliminate, actually helps people buy homes. It is \npretty clear--Senator Specter from Pennsylvania quoted a U.S. Supreme \nCourt opinion relative to this, but it is pretty clear that the \ncongressional intent to exclude home mortgages from cramdown was \nintended. Some have disputed that Congress was pursuing a policy of \nmaking home mortgages more available when we created the cramdown \nexception.\n  Senator Durbin, I believe, has said that the cramdown exception for \nhome mortgages makes no sense whatsoever. The record from the 1978 act \nclearly shows that Congress viewed exceptions to cramdown as a means of \nmaking mortgages more available. The Senate Judiciary Committee report \nexplained that the purpose of the real estate exception was to: \n``afford greater protection'' to real estate financing ``by creating a \nsafe harbor that would facilitate, rather than discourage, this type of \nfinancing.''\n  As I alluded, the courts have recognized this policy in interpreting \nthe act, most notable in Justice Stevens' concurrence in Nobleman v. \nAmerican Savings Bank. So I would say that the Democratic Congress of \n1978, President Carter, and Justice Stevens all have acknowledged that \nthis policy of excepting home mortgages from cramdown makes sense and \nhelps keep mortgage rates low, which I think ought to be our policy.\n  Inadvertently, I think this amendment would also encourage more \npeople to seek bankruptcy as a way to deal with their financial \ndifficulties. It has been argued that this provision would actually \nencourage borrowers to negotiate with their lender. The one problem \nwith that is, as we all know, most mortgages these days are actually \nsold by the lender; they are packaged and then purchased as securities \nand sold on the open market. It is, in fact, what has happened in the \nsubprime mortgage market, which has created this crisis. The people who \nactually bought those securities now find that they are worth \ndramatically less than they thought because of the problems these \nmortgage holders are having. So it is certainly not a given that they \nwill be in a position to negotiate with the lender, who no longer even \nholds that mortgage.\n  I am concerned, though, that the amendment goes too far in those rare \ncases where negotiations are still possible to remove the homeowner's \nincentive to negotiate and, instead, steer them into bankruptcy. The \nDurbin amendment would, in fact, create a siren's song that would lure \nstruggling families onto the rocks of bankruptcy. For most Americans, \nour homes are our largest and most-cherished investment. The chance to \nhave their mortgage decreased by a bankruptcy court, basically to \nrenegotiate what a negotiated interest rate is, would encourage\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nstruggling families to seek bankruptcy protection instead of trying to \nnegotiate and get their finances back in order in a way that will \npreserve their credit and will not lure them into bankruptcy.\n  I think it is worth noting that bankruptcy itself has lasting and \nserious consequences to the credit rating of the people who seek it. \nBankruptcy is not in the long-term interest of every family who falls \nbehind on their mortgage. We should encourage negotiation where \npossible. In fact, we know that is what happens anyway. Very few \nmortgage holders refuse to negotiate with the borrower when they get \nbehind in their payments because, frankly, they don't want the property \nback. They want to continue the loan in effect, if possible.\n  So I think the Durbin amendment actually discourages negotiation and \ncreates an effective magnet, attracting people into bankruptcy. I have \nalready talked about why I think that is a bad idea.\n  Of course, this amendment also waives the bankruptcy law's counseling \nrequirement when a home is in foreclosure, which is inconsistent with \nthe underlying Shelby-Dodd compromise that provides $100 million to \nencourage credit counseling.\n  The goal of the bill should be to help struggling families get back \non their feet, not encourage bankruptcy filings that would raise \nmortgage rates for everybody, ruin the credit of the borrower, and \nultimately not solve the problem it is intended to solve. For that \nreason, I oppose the Durbin amendment and encourage my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge that the Senator is correct \nthat this modification of a mortgage on a primary residence would be a \nchange in bankruptcy law. I ask the Senator from Texas, is he aware \nthat in the 1980s we created chapter 12 bankruptcy for farms and \ncreated the opportunity for the bankruptcy court to modify mortgages on \nfamily homes and farms, and at the time the banking industry said the \nsame thing about that change as they have about my amendment--that it \nwould raise interest rates? Is the Senator aware of the fact that there \nwas no significant increase in interest rates on farms as a result of \nthe creation of chapter 12 bankruptcies?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I accept what the Senator says. I have no reason to \ndispute it. I, frankly, have no knowledge of it. I know that currently \nwe have roughly 2 percent of the mortgages in America that are in \nforeclosure proceedings. While there is undoubtedly a serious problem, \nI don't think this is the right solution to it. I said that some \nestimates are that it would increase interest rates by 1.5 percent on \nmortgages. On a $122,000 mortgage in Texas, it would increase annual \ncosts about $1,500. So I must oppose it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware that my amendment limits the \nmodification of mortgages in bankruptcy to those on primary residences, \nexisting as of the date of the enactment of this law, and that it would \nnot apply to any future mortgages and would not have an impact on \nfuture mortgages, those that are going to be issued. So the credit \nindustry is saying: We are afraid this is going to apply to everybody. \nThere is a limited application of a narrow class of people who would be \neligible.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification. I also \nnote that the tendency in Washington and in Congress, and the Federal \nGovernment generally, is for things to get bigger rather than to \ncontract. So while I appreciate the clarification, I am not consoled by \nthe current limitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from California \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am a cosponsor of the Durbin \namendment and am very happy to support it. Later, Senator Martinez and \nI will be submitting an amendment. The Senator is in the Banking \nCommittee now and will come to the floor shortly.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to speak about this amendment. It is \nalso supported by Senators Boxer, Obama, Salazar, Dole, Durbin, and \nClinton. Essentially, this amendment deals with the fact that today \nthere is a very thin patchwork of State licensing for brokers. It is \ninsufficient. There are no national standards for the licensing of a \nmortgage broker in this subprime marketplace. In many States, there are \nreally no requirements. What that has done is enabled bad actors to \nflourish. I wish to give you two examples of what a bad actor as a \nsubprime mortgage broker means.\n  I met this family in the picture in Los Angeles this past week. This \nis the Simmons family. Mr. Simmons worked for Northrop Grumman for 20 \nyears, and Mrs. Simmons has been a checker at Alpha Beta for 26 years. \nThey are retired. They have owned this home in Los Angeles for 39 \nyears. Mr. Simmons had a stroke. When he had this stroke, they \nobviously had additional medical expenses. Last year, they were in the \nmarket for a better rate than the 8 percent they were paying on the \nloan on their house which remained and was $550,000. They got a cold-\ncall from an unlicensed broker, who offered them a $629,000 loan with \nthese terms: $25,000 cash back, a 4.5-percent interest rate, and \nmonthly payments of $2,000 after four months at $5,300 to lower the \ninterest rate. They studied it and said, ``We can afford this.'' And so \nthey did it. Here is what really happened. The interest rate was 11.2 \npercent, not 4.5 percent. There was no cash back. The monthly payments \nwere $5,300 every month. They called about it, and they were told it \njust wasn't true. The paper they signed was for $5,300 every month for \nthe length of the mortgage. Then they learned that not only was there \nno cash back, but this broker walked off with $20,000 in his pocket. \nThese are retired people. They were confronted with hundreds of pages \nof loan documents, filled with small print. They trusted their broker.\n  Not too long ago, my husband and I bought a home. We trusted our \nbroker. He went through the papers with us. Candidly, I do not believe \nmost people read every line of what amounts to a stack about 6 inches \nhigh of papers when you buy a home.\n  For the Simmons family, they dipped into their life savings. They are \nafraid they may lose their home. This is exactly the type of situation \nour bill would prevent.\n  Let me give you another story of Steve and Valvina McFatten. They \nlive in Fresno, and they are in this photo with their children and dog \nin front of their house. They have two teenage daughters. Steve is an \nassembly-line worker. Valvina is an office assistant. They both work.\n  In 2005, a bank told them they could handle a mortgage of up to \n$135,000. When they saw their dream home the next year--listed at \n$250,000--they thought it was out of reach. But a broker steered them \ninto two mortgages for $250,000 for only $1,000 down, with an \nadjustable interest rate. Their combined monthly payments were $1,600. \nNow, the McFattens have weak credit, modest income, and two children to \nraise. They told their broker they could not afford this loan. The \nbroker told them not to worry, that their monthly payments included \ntheir property taxes, their mortgage insurance, and a warranty for home \nrepairs. Well, did that turn out? No. Here is what the real deal was: \nno money toward property taxes, no money toward insurance, and no \nwarranty. It was canceled without their knowledge.\n  These are two examples of what is happening in California. Many \nAmericans trying to get a piece of the American dream have actually \nbeen sold a bill of goods by unscrupulous brokers and lenders. When I \nwas in Los Angeles, the San Bernardino district attorney, the Los \nAngeles district attorney, and the State attorney general had just \narrested nine bad actors in the mortgage broker business. So it is \ngoing on all of the time. People are told: Don't worry, you don't need \na big downpayment. You can get into a zero-interest loan. Don't worry \nabout what you are getting into. Home values always rise. Don't worry \nabout the adjustable interest rate; you can always refinance. Don't \nworry, you cannot lose.\n  Well, the fact is that you can lose, and you can lose big. I can say \nthat everybody should read the fine print and take the time to \nunderstand exactly\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nwhat their mortgage documents say. The fact is that people have \ndifficulty understanding these very legal documents. They tend to \ndepend on their mortgage broker. So the damage is staggering.\n  There were more than 2 million filings last year, and another 2 \nmillion are expected this year. Senator Boxer's and my State is ground \nzero, with 4 of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure \nrates in the Nation. No. 2 is Stockton. No. 4 is San Bernardino. No. 5 \nis Sacramento. No. 7 is Bakersfield. It just so happens that these are \nareas with a lot of middle-class, hard-working families who tend to \ntrust their broker. Both people in the family work. They may not all be \ncollege graduates. They may have a tough time understanding the fine \nprint, and they depend on the person who comes to them as a \nprofessional and makes personal representations to them.\n  My State accounts for more than 20 percent of the Nation's \nforeclosure filings. It is very serious. We have now learned how easy \nit is for anyone to get into the mortgage business in some States and, \nquite frankly, it is astonishing. A simple Internet search will show \nhow easy it is.\n  These are statements taken right off the Internet for a broker. Here \nis the source: http://www.cflicense.com. We accessed this site on the \n27th of February of this year. Here is what they advertised:\n\n       No experience, education or exam is necessary.\n\n  To sell subprime mortgages in the State of California.\n  And here is also what we learned:\n\n       You can hire unlicensed sales agents to originate loans \n     under your company license.\n\n  In fact, a lot of the real estate industry is opposed to mortgage \nlicensing. They want to be able to do that. But our job is to decide, \nis this in the best interest of the consumer? I don't believe it is. As \na matter of fact, I find it rather outrageous. I say to the real estate \nindustry: This does you no good to have unlicensed subprime mortgage \nbrokers who give bogus information to your clients.\n  So here is what this bipartisan amendment would do. First, it would \nestablish some minimum, basic Federal license requirements. They would \nensure mortgage brokers and lenders are trained in ethics, consumer \nprotection, lending laws, and the subprime marketplace. To be licensed, \nyou would have to have no felony convictions, have no similar license \nrevoked, demonstrate a record of financial responsibility, successfully \ncomplete educational requirements, at least 20 hours of approved \ncourses--it seems to me that is pretty basic--pass a comprehensive \nwritten exam, and meet an annual license review and renewal \nrequirement. It would also require that all mortgage brokers and \nlenders provide fingerprints, a summary of work experience, and consent \nto a background check to authorities.\n  The bill would also establish a national database so individuals \nbuying a home who wanted to use a subprime mortgage broker could go on \nthe Internet and find out if that broker is, in fact, licensed.\n  The State would have the responsibility to carry out these minimum \nstandards and could add any standards they wished. But State regulators \nwould be required to develop a satisfactory licensing system within 1 \nyear following the enactment of this legislation. If this does not \noccur, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary is empowered to \nquickly develop a national database and license-generating revenue for \nits implementation through fees to license applicants.\n  There is broad bipartisan support for this amendment. Our amendment \nis similar to a provision authored by Representative Spencer Bachus, a \nRepublican from Alabama, the ranking member of the House Committee on \nFinancial Services.\n  The national licensing concept for mortgage lenders and brokers was \nincluded in the comprehensive mortgage reform bill which passed the \nHouse in November. And last month, the President's working group on \nfinancial markets recommended a similar proposal in their report on the \nhousing crisis.\n  I will conclude. The emergence in recent years of subprime and other \nexotic mortgage products have put many American home buyers at great \nfinancial risk, and many of these products require little or no \ndownpayment. They allow people with bad credit to get in over their \nhead. They do not verify their wages. Many have exaggerated wages on \nthe loan documents. And most lenders and brokers offered these \nmortgages, though, in a responsible fashion. But many others used \npredatory tactics, such as failing to disclose the full risk in order \nto place unsuspecting borrowers into mortgages they could not afford.\n  Madam President, my heart broke when I met the Simmons family. When I \nthink of somebody working for 20 years for a defense firm in \nCalifornia, his wife working for 26 years as a checker in a supermarket \nso they could buy and sustain a home which, as we can see, they have \nkept in pristine condition, having a health problem--namely, a stroke \nby Mr. Simmons; it is difficult for him to get around, it is difficult \nfor him to speak--costing them extra, using the home as a basis to try \nto refinance to take some money out of this house to pay for medical \nbills.\n  What is happening now? A bad actor got hold of them. They did not \nrealize what they were getting into. He promised certain things which \ndid not come through. And now this couple faces losing their home.\n  Fortunately, we were able to hook them up last week with a community \npro bono law firm that will now represent them and deal with their \nmortgage company and try to see if they can recondition some of this \nloan back to what they were promised.\n  This is going on, and it is going on all over California. The areas I \njust pointed out, the 4 out of the 10 highest areas are not the most \naffluent places in my State. They are places where families just like \nthe Simmons have heard the rhetoric: We can put you into the American \ndream; we can enable you to buy a home; and here, I, the mortgage \nbroker am willing to sit down and make you all these commitments. Then \nthey find out the commitments are ashes.\n  This has to stop. There is no place for the predator in this \nindustry. I know Citibank told me they oppose the legislation. I say to \nCitibank: Are you proud of this? Is this the way you want to do \nbusiness?\n  And I say to realtors who do not want these brokers to be licensed: \nIs that the way you want to do business? If it is, I am against what \nyou want.\n  I hope this amendment is adopted. It has been talked about, it has \nbeen dealt with in general terms in a past bill that passed the House. \nThe President's working group said we should consider it. We now have \nthe chance to do it.\n  We face 2 million additional foreclosures, and we have to do \nsomething about predatory lenders and brokers, and this amendment is a \nbeginning.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I am happy to be a cosponsor of the \nSenator's amendment. The last point she made is the one I found almost \nnothing short of amazing: that the largest banks that are involved in \nthe mortgage business, and the realtors who are involved, obviously, in \nthese transactions are resisting Senator Feinstein's amendment that \nwould provide some basic standards for the licensure of mortgage \nbrokers. That is the point I would like to make, through the Chair, to \nthe Senator from California. I continue to wonder why these noble \nprofessions are protecting the bottom feeders of our economy, those who \nare preying on people such as the Simmons.\n\n  I have stories in Illinois I can tell that will match each one of the \nSenator from California, where there is basic exploitation of people by \nthose who mislead people in terrible financial circumstances, people of \nlimited experience and education who are trying to understand the \ncomplexity of mortgages and closings and interest rates and all of the \nmatters that have to be understood well.\n  I ask the Senator from California, Madam President, does she have the \nsupport of any financial institutions or any of these professions that \nshould be in support of State licensing of these mortgage brokers?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me answer that. Not to the best of my knowledge. \nLet me also say--and perhaps I do, but I will find out--let me also say \nCitibank and even the California real\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nestate establishment want exemptions. Well, I am not willing to give \nexemptions. I say for shame if this is the way you want to practice \nyour business. It is not acceptable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, too many families in Missouri and across \nthe Nation are feeling the pain of the housing crisis. They need our \nhelp now. This Senate is coming together on a bipartisan basis to \nprovide some relief to deal with some of the real problems we find in \ncommunities throughout our Nation.\n  Over the Easter break, I traveled around the State. I talked with a \nlot of folks who have a real and deep interest in this housing crisis. \nI met with families struggling under the threat of foreclosure, \nneighborhood groups counseling families on how to keep their homes, \ngovernment officials at the local level--mayors and council members--\nwho were trying to find ways they could assist, community leaders \nasking for our help. They told me about the neighborhoods devastated by \nforeclosures. More critically, they told me of the personal problems \nfaced by families running into foreclosure where their adjustable rates \nhad risen so high they could no longer afford them. And they talked to \nme about the devastation of family after family being threatened with \nlosing their home.\n  I did not hear from speculators who overbuilt and are now caught with \ntoo much inventory. I did not hear from investors who bought a second \nor third vacation home, expecting that the price would go up more than \nthey paid for it and now regret their bad decisions. And I did not hear \nfrom the greedy lenders who went out and offered terms that were too \ngood to be true. Some of the worst ones were the no-downpayment loans. \nMany others offered unbelievable teaser rates and then put out paper \nthat was absolutely unaffordable by the borrowers. They spread this \ntoxic paper throughout the system. It is putting at risk not only our \nnational financial system, but that toxic stuff has spread to \ninternational markets, and markets across the world are feeling the \npain of our subprime crisis.\n  In Missouri, I heard from mothers and fathers who want to keep their \nhome. I heard from fixed-income seniors who thought they had a deal \nthey could live with until the rates started adjusting and the \nmortgages got out of their ability to pay. These folks do not want a \ngovernment handout. They do not want a bailout. They do not want the \nFederal Government buying their mortgage or buying the homes around \nthem. They are hard-working Americans who want to be able to meet their \noriginal commitments and keep the promises they made. They need \ntargeted temporary help to get them refinanced and on with the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  That is the kind of relief I offered on behalf of several of my \nRepublican colleagues in the Security Against Foreclosure and Education \nAct, or SAFE Act, of 2008. It provided help for families to refinance \ndistressed subprime mortgages, help for neighborhoods for the purchase \nof foreclosed homes, help for returning war vets coming home to the \nthreat of foreclosure, and reform of the Federal Housing Administration \nthat we all agreed upon last year and still have not been able to pass.\n  These proposals, I am very happy to say, form the core of the \nForeclosure Prevention Act substitute amendment that is before us \ntoday. I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby who came together and assembled \nthis bipartisan package of relief for families and neighborhoods. They \ntook proposals from our SAFE Act, housing proposals from our Democratic \ncolleagues, and provisions from our friends on the Finance Committee to \nmake this relief package.\n  Most importantly, this measure will help struggling families \nrefinance their subprime mortgages by authorizing State housing finance \nagencies to issue $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds and use the proceeds \nfor refinancing.\n  I happen to know very well how effectively our Missouri Housing \nDevelopment Corporation functions, and if they have this authority and \nif they can sell their bonds, then they will be able to refinance where \npeople have seen their mortgage payments escalate beyond their ability \nto pay. This is the kind of assistance we expect from our housing \nfinance agencies, and we need to empower them.\n\n  Secondly, to help families know their options to avoid foreclosure \nand keep them in their homes, it provides an additional $100 million \nfor loan counseling. I was proud to be able to join with my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, in the Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill last year to put $180 million in counseling. \nCongress passed it in December. The first of these funds has gone out, \nand they tell me already they are having a great effect. Many say that \nknowledge means power. Housing counselors I met with over the recess \ntold me how these counseling funds are helping families know how to \nrenegotiate with their banks to get good refinancing and keep their \nhomes.\n  The message all of us ought to carry back to our home States when we \ntalk to people who are threatened by these problems is that if you see \nyour mortgage rates going up beyond your ability to pay, if you have \nconcerns about whether you can meet the terms of the financing, don't \nwait until foreclosure proceedings are initiated. Don't wait until you \nget hauled up on the courthouse steps to see your property sold. There \nare counseling agencies that we have funded and will be funded \nadditionally across the country in every large community that will come \nin and work with the homeowner and with the lending agencies to try to \nwork out terms.\n  Many of these will be able to get refinanced. It has to be voluntary \non both sides, but as has been said earlier on this floor, lenders have \na real disincentive for foreclosing. They got into the business not to \nown homes, they got in the business to receive payments. Very often \nthis means there is common ground which can be agreeable to the \nhomeowners and the lenders to stay the costs and the risks of \nforeclosure.\n  Foreclosure not only is devastating to the family, it is very \ndevastating to the neighborhood. The neighbors see their home values go \ndown, and the whole community suffers. That is why I had mayors and \ncouncil members and city aldermen coming out and saying, what can we \ndo? I said: Get good education.\n  As the Senator from California said, we need better education for \npeople before they seek to buy a home, and certainly we need education \nand counseling for those who see mortgage payments rising above their \nreach.\n  Back to the provisions in this bill. We supported on our side--and \nthis measure includes--help for struggling neighborhoods by providing \ntax credits for that purpose over the next year of a home in or facing \nforeclosure. It is $7,000 available for families moving in and living \nin the home over 2 years to keep the neighborhoods from being flooded \nwith properties in foreclosure, which drags down property values for \neveryone. These tax credits should help all homeowners in the \nneighborhood by stabilizing property values as families get back into \nvacant homes and add value.\n  Not surprisingly--not surprisingly--when I laid out this proposal to \nthe roundtables and the discussion groups I had around the State, one \nof the things the mayors and the city councilmen liked the most was \nthis ability to get those homes in foreclosure sold and occupied by \nborrowers who would be contributing members of the community and \nhelping to stabilize those communities. They recognize the importance \nthis has for their communities as well as the families who would be \nliving there.\n  One other part of this proposal that is very important to me is that \nthe measure proposes new loan disclosure requirements with a prominent, \nplain English explanation of key loan conditions. I want the borrowers \nto see in big type any teaser rates or introductory rates, anything \nthat will change the terms of their payments or limit their ability and \nlead to foreclosure.\n  I have had the distinction of living in several houses in the last \nfew years. As we have moved from house to house and purchased homes, I \nhave seen that stack of documents. As the occupant of the chair, I used \nto be a lawyer. I am recovering from it now. I have looked at those \ndocuments and tried to make\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\nsense of them, and I tell you there is not enough time if you are \npurchasing a house. It took me about 45 minutes to sign all the pieces \nof paper that came before me. Now, that doesn't help anybody. The Truth \nin Lending Act has gone to ridiculous extremes. Unfortunately, we let \nlawyers draft that, and there ought to be a law against lawyers \ndrafting any kind of disclosure documents. We need to have those \nsimple, in plain English, so you know what your rate is, what it could \nrise to, whether there is a prepayment penalty, and whether you can \nrefinance it. That is on the first or second page.\n  Tell me something I need to know. Don't make me sign 30 pages saying \nI have read all the fine type or all the fine print.\n  Everybody knows that is a joke. Let us put disclosure in plain terms. \nThat should be a help in the future.\n  We also have a provision from Senator Coleman of Minnesota in this \nbill to give returning war veterans more time to avoid home \nforeclosure. Currently, they have a 3-month window from their return to \nwork out any mortgage difficulties they have. This may not be enough \ntime for them. So this proposed measure would extend the protection \nagainst foreclosure to 6 months after arrival home. That is the least \nwe can do for our returning heroes.\n  We have included provisions of the Federal Housing Act reform bill, \nwhich passed the Senate 93 to 1 last year. That bipartisan, near \nunanimous reform bill deserves to become law. FHA is one of our key \nfinancing insuring agencies for lower income people. We need to make \nsure it works. We have heard about the possible application of FHA \nSecure to assist borrowers whose mortgage payments have gone beyond \ntheir reach, but it is too limited. They can't use it. We need to \nloosen up the terms so that the terms are not so strict that FHA is in \nthe position of what some people used to characterize as a bank being a \nplace that lends you an umbrella and takes it back when it starts to \nrain. The FHA holds out great promise for being able to insure loans \nand get people in houses, but when they say, if you do anything, if \nthere is anything, if you miss any step, you can't get the protection, \nit seems to me maybe we have tightened it down too hard.\n  I believe, however, for the future, it ought to be the policy of the \nFHA--and I would hope it would be the policy of any responsible \nmortgage broker or lender--not to make any no-downpayment loans. No-\ndownpayment loans are one of the most significant contributors to \nhousing foreclosures and failure to be able to meet those terms. If you \ndon't have the money to buy a house, there is nothing wrong with living \nin a rented house. I have lived in rented houses. You can save up the \nmoney to buy a house. But to buy a house responsibly, you need to have \nsome downpayment. I hope that the FHA would get rid of the idea that it \nis the American dream to put somebody into a house with no equity in \nit. That is asking for trouble, and that is one of the sources of the \ntrouble we face.\n\n  I would say one other thing. A lot of people are now realizing that \nthis housing crisis is the basis of financial challenges and financial \ndifficulties in the United States and possibly even internationally. I \nsaid earlier, this toxic paper has been spread throughout the world, \nand there are banks in other countries, there are investment houses in \nother countries that are suffering because of it. There had to be steps \ntaken at the Federal level, and some of the steps were a little bit \nbreathtaking. I was not wild about seeing the Fed have to move in and \nwipe out Bear Stearns and provide the guarantees, but I am willing to \naccept what the Chairman said, and what others have said, that this was \nnecessary to stop the domino effect of collapsing Federal institutions \nand federally insured institutions, and it is necessary to stop a \nworldwide panic from subprime loans.\n  There are other steps that have been taken as well--lowering the Fed \nrate to 3\\1/4\\, 2\\1/4\\. These steps are necessary on a macro level. But \nlet me tell you one thing. This macro problem has a micro problem \nbasis. The problem we face is not just what happens in Washington or \nhappens in New York or happens at the Federal Reserve. This problem \ndepends upon how we solve the problems of the families facing \nforeclosure, of the communities seeing a wave of foreclosures driving \ndown property values.\n  This problem requires also that we work for a solution that begins at \nthe ground up; that takes care of the families in need; that takes care \nof the communities facing these problems and not do only what has been \ndone nationally, what we read about in the headlines, but what we can \nonly see in community newspapers back home, as to how we help families \nand communities struggling with foreclosure.\n  This housing bill before us represents the needs and values of our \nfamilies and neighborhoods. It doesn't provide for any government \nbuyouts of mortgages, as some propose. It does not provide for \nrefinancing of vacation or investment homes, as some fear. Together, \nour housing proposal will help families and neighborhoods across this \ncountry get through the crisis and help our financial systems to \nmaintain stability. But most of all, for our families, for our \nneighborhoods, for our communities, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis measure.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis statement. He made reference to something which I thought was so \nobvious. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island had an amendment to the \noriginal bill, and since Senator Bond is an attorney, and the Presiding \nOfficer is an attorney, and I have been one in the past, we know what \nhappens at a real estate closing. You give people a stack of papers and \nyou turn the corners and say: Keep signing until you are finished. If \nsomeone has the nerve to ask: What am I signing? Nine times out of ten, \nit is going to be dismissed by the realtor or the lawyer in the room: \nOh, it is another Federal form required by law. Just sign it. \nEverything is fine.\n  At the end of the day, let's be honest. No one has read all of those \nforms. No one understands all those forms, particularly those who are \nborrowing money. But the fine print in those forms is going to dictate \ntheir lives, and they do not even know it. How many of us take the time \nto carefully read the back of our monthly credit card statement? Not \nme. And the print is so fine, even with these glasses which I have all \nover my house, I can't keep up with it and understand it.\n  So what Senator Jack Reed proposed was that there be a cover sheet to \nthe disclosing documents which says: You are borrowing X number of \ndollars, the interest rate is X, the monthly payment will be X, the \ninterest rate can increase to X number, your monthly payment can \nincrease to a certain amount, and there is or is not a penalty for \nrepaying your mortgage. Pretty simple, right? Well, you ought to see \nwhat the financial institutions did to Jack Reed's very simple \nproposal--one that made sense.\n  The reason it caught my attention is it amends the Truth in Lending \nlaw in America. I have kind of a special attachment to this, because \nthe first person I ever worked for on Capitol Hill was Senator Paul \nDouglas, who tried to pass the Truth in Lending Act for 18 years. He \nwas fought by the banks and never succeeded. He left Congress in 1966, \nand Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin passed it.\n  It was, I am sure, a good-faith effort for better disclosure at \nclosing, but the law is so complicated, so arcane, that at the end of \nthe day it did not serve the ultimate purpose Senator Douglas sought. \nSo I was anxious to read what the banking institutions would agree to \nas part of the compromise bill before us. I hope my colleagues will \ntake a few minutes and go to section 501 of this bill and try to make \nsense out of this. What I described to you, in Senator Jack Reed's \nproposals, I could explain at any town meeting in Illinois--any Senator \ncould--and people would say: Sure, why shouldn't we know this? We might \nhave avoided some of the problems we have today if the borrowers \nactually knew what they were getting into.\n  Try to make sense out of what the financial institutions agreed to in \nthis bill. I have read through it. I don't get it. I mean, it does try \nmy patience that at this moment in history, with so many people facing \nmortgage foreclosures, we do not have an appetite in the Senate to \nchange the basic laws and rules to have more oversight and avoid this \nhappening again.\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\n  If it is uncomfortable for us to be plowing through all this \nlegislation, think about how uncomfortable it is for 2 million \nhomeowners facing the loss of their homes.\n  Senator Feinstein was here a few moments ago, talking about these \nhomeowners in her State. I have met them in my State. They are in \nMissouri, they are in Iowa. These are unsuspecting people, many of them \nretired, many of them with limited experience and education, drawn into \ncomplicated loans that have traps every time you turn. If you reach a \nsituation where you have lost a job, where you have a serious medical \nbill, where something has occurred here, you could lose your home. A \nlifetime of savings could be gone.\n  That isn't right. I understand people have to accept responsibility \nfor their actions, but you know a lot of these people are being preyed \nupon, they are being deceived. I have seen it happen. I have talked to \nthe families back in Illinois. We had a chance, with this bill, to put \na very important and simple provision in, on which the Senator from \nMissouri spoke. We didn't do it. I might say, I see the Senator from \nIowa, and I don't want to take any additional time, but I wish to say \nthrough the Presiding Officer: We convened this morning at 9:30. My \namendment, which is pending, has been on the floor for virtually 3 \nhours now--almost 3 hours. I have stayed that entire period of time to \nentertain any questions or to engage in any debate related to this \namendment.\n  There have been a lot of speeches about other issues. I don't wish to \nbe critical of my colleagues. I have done the same thing. They have \nissues that are important to them relating to this bill and other \nsubjects. That is their right.\n  I tried to get an agreement that at 12:15 we would vote on my \namendment, up or down, win or lose; let's debate it and vote on it. I \nasked the Republican minority leader and he said: Too soon. Other \nMembers want to come and speak to this amendment. I don't want to \nforeclose anyone's opportunity to speak on the floor for or against \nthis amendment, but why are we wasting this time? That is my question. \nThis is an important bill. There are a lot of very important \namendments. Let's get on with it. Three hours should be enough for this \namendment. It is way too much. We could have debated this thoroughly in \na matter of an hour. Unfortunately, a lot of Members have not come to \nthe floor.\n  There should reach a point where the minority leader says to his \ncolleagues: You had your chance. Now let's vote. That is kind of the \nnormal consequence in life--you snooze, you lose, whether you are in \nthe Senate or not. So I encourage those who support or oppose my \namendment, come to the floor. I am here. Let's have something \nunprecedented, a debate, an actual debate in the Senate, where I say \nsomething and someone challenges it or they say something and I \nchallenge it. Wouldn't that be exciting? C-SPAN might advertise that is \ngoing to happen on the floor of the Senate, it is so rare.\n  I am ready. I hope, if the Senator from Iowa is here on my amendment, \nthat we can be engaged in a debate shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise for two purposes. One, to state \nsome views on the Durbin amendment and, No. 2, to give very short \nremarks on tax provisions that are part of the underlying housing bill. \nI would like to speak on the Durbin amendment for the reason that I am \nthe author of the bankruptcy reform provisions that passed here, maybe \n3 or 4 years ago, and are now law. I would like to speak on the tax \nprovisions as ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Senator Durbin and I have had opportunities to work together on many \nissues, and in fact we are working together on other things this very \nday, unrelated to this bill. I appreciate the opportunities to \ncooperate in a bipartisan way with Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin, many \nmonths ago, was very polite, coming to me and asking me to take a look \nat his bankruptcy language. It is probably similar to the one that is \nbefore us right now. I know the language has been changed some since \nthen, but it is basically the same concept. He asked me to consider it.\n  I and my staff did consider it, and I am standing here now to speak \nagainst it. But Senator Durbin was very courteous in giving me a heads \nup, not just a few weeks ago but a long time ago. I want my colleagues \nto know Senator Durbin is an easy Senator to work with, even if you \ndisagree with him.\n  So I am here to voice opposition to Senator Durbin's bankruptcy \namendment. While I appreciate Senator Durbin's sincerity in trying to \nalleviate the home mortgage crisis, I believe his amendment is \nmisguided and will have serious unintended consequences. So I am going \nto point out some of my concerns.\n  First, the proposal would make filing bankruptcy a deceptively \nattractive option for people trying to keep their homes. But we do not \nwant to encourage people to go into bankruptcy for the sole reason of \nkeeping their homes. Rather, we should be working on solutions outside \nof bankruptcy to address this issue, and that is what a great part of \nthe other provisions of this housing legislation before us is all \nabout. That is what a lot of the things the Federal Reserve and the \nSecretary of the Treasury are trying to do, both through public policy \nas well as through encouraging private sector policy.\n\n  Other solutions need to be sought before bankruptcy. In order to get \nthe relief Senator Durbin wants, homeowners will have to go into \nbankruptcy to get it. That is no news. He has made that very clear. I \nbelieve otherwise; that voluntary efforts and programs outside of \nbankruptcy will be quicker and more efficient, in terms of helping \npeople keep their homes and shoring up the housing market. We need to \nlet these efforts work.\n  Also, people will not risk ruining their credit history by filing for \nbankruptcy just because they think that this is the only way maybe they \nare going to be able to keep their home. The mortgage banking industry \nneeds to be doing all it can to make sure that all homeowners in \ndistress, not just the ones in bankruptcy, are getting help in making \ntheir payments.\n  I think more importantly, we have been told the cramdown provision in \nSenator Durbin's amendment will increase the cost of mortgages for all \nborrowers in the form of higher interest rates or higher downpayments, \nor both. Independent experts, as well as the Congressional Budget \nOffice--and I like quoting the Congressional Budget Office because they \nare not partisan--have concluded that there will be an interest rate \nincrease for all home mortgages, between 1 and 2 percent. Higher \ninterest rates will deny many Americans the ability to buy a home and \nwill make it more expensive for other Americans to get a home loan. So, \nin effect, this will put up barriers--maybe unintended barriers, but \nreal barriers, the experts tell us--to the American dream of owning a \nhome.\n  The fact is, in 1978, a Democratic-controlled Congress and a \nDemocratic President specifically--and I wish to emphasize \n``specifically''--exempted primary residences from cramdown to keep \ninterest rates low for primary homes and to ensure credit was available \nfor low-income borrowers. In fact, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stevens \nexplained, in the Nobleman case, that the legislative history of the \n1978 bankruptcy law indicated very clearly that:\n\n       . . . favorable treatment of residential mortgages was \n     intended to encourage the flow of capital into the home \n     lending market.\n\n  Debate surrounding the Senate version of the 1978 act indicates that \nexceptions for real estate liens were allowed with the explicit goal of \nmaking home mortgages more available and more affordable than other \nkinds of credit. So I think, from the history of the 1978 act, there is \na sound policy basis for this decision to not allow cramdown for \nprimary homes in bankruptcy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator--I don't question what he \nhas said, but after that, in the 1980s, we created a new chapter in \nbankruptcy, Chapter 12.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now you are getting personal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is why I wish to make this point. Because we said \nthat\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nwhen it came to the so-called cramdown or modification of mortgages, we \nwould make an exception and the exception would apply to the homes of \nfarmers and their farm property. We said if they go into bankruptcy, \nthey can have the mortgage on their farm home crammed down or modified.\n  At the time, the banking industry said this is a terrible decision \nbecause we are going to have to raise interest rates on farms. You are \ngoing to regret this. We did it anyway, and there was no significant \nincrease in interest rates.\n  I would like to ask, through the Chair, whether the Senator from the \ngreat agricultural State of Iowa objects to cramming down mortgages on \nfarm homes under Chapter 12.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am glad to answer that. First, let \nme explain why I said he is getting personal. I am the author of that \nChapter 12 bankruptcy provision. I am going to address it very soon. So \nif you would listen, I think I will answer your questions. I appreciate \nwhat you are saying and, in fact, I anticipated that, and I hope I am \nready for it. I am sure it is going to be difficult to satisfy the \nSenator from Illinois, though.\n  The amendment of Senator Durbin will not only increase interest rates \non mortgages and make home ownership more expensive for everyone, many \nexperts tell us this proposal will also have an adverse impact on \nfinancial markets because of difficulties and uncertainty in valuing \nthe mortgages that back up securities. In addition, innocent investors \nwould be hurt. So the Durbin amendment would cause other adverse \nimpacts beyond higher costs of home loans.\n  Proponents of this amendment, particularly the cramdown provisions, \nargue that primary residences should be crammed down in bankruptcy just \nas second homes, family farms, and boats are. But there are good \nreasons why primary homes are treated differently from these other \nthings.\n  First, interest rates and downpayments for vacation homes are \nsignificantly higher than for primary homes. If we are to start \ntreating primary homes the same as vacation homes, I am told that then \ninterest rates are certain to rise to the same level of second homes \nwhere cramdown is permitted.\n  Second, Chapter 12, referred to by the Senator from Illinois, only \napplies to very small commercial farming and ranching operations, not \nall farms and not all ranches. There are very specific requirements \nthat need to be met in order to be able to file under Chapter 12. So we \nare not talking about the same number of loans that could be eligible \nunder the Durbin amendment. I would be glad to give some statistics on \nthat, but I am going to wait and see if the Senator from Illinois is \nsatisfied.\n  Actually, I will give these numbers now because I think they are \nsignificant at this point. According to the USCOURTS.GOV Web site, the \nFederal courts Government Web site, for fiscal year 2006 there were \nonly 348 Chapter 12 filings; in fiscal year 2007, there were only 361 \nChapter 12 filings. This would compare to what, at least I believe, you \nare saying are possibly at least 600,000 filings under your amendment.\n  Moreover, it took Congress over two decades to make Chapter 12 a \npermanent part of the Bankruptcy Code because people were concerned \nabout the possible negative consequences to allowing cramdown for \nfamily farms. Chapter 12 was initially only enacted as a temporary \nprovision.\n  In addition, I would like to say that the definition of family farm \nwhich can file under Chapter 12 is very limited. In fact, Chapter 12 \nonly applies to a limited number of farms--those that have less than \n$3.2 million in debt; debt has to arise out of the farming operation; \n50 percent of income within the last 3 years has to come from farming \nincome; and 80 percent of the assets in the estate have to be related \nto farming operations. Those are some of the requirements.\n  So probably Chapter 12 ended up, quite frankly, being a lot more \nnarrow than maybe I originally intended. But I think it is working.\n  Finally, I want to go to the cramdown that is allowed for boats, \nbecause boats are like cars: their values diminish rather than \nincrease, which is very different from real estate, where values are \nexpected to rise over the long term.\n  Proponents of Senator Durbin's amendment argue that the way the \namendment is now drafted, only a very limited number of loans will \nqualify for cramdown in bankruptcy. Now, while the amendment does \nattempt to limit the scope of the legislation from how it was \noriginally drafted when Senator Durbin introduced his bankruptcy \nproposal as a stand-alone bill--that was probably soon after he had \ntalked to me about it several months ago--the reality is that the \nlanguage still is extremely broad. Cramdown and other loan \nmodifications are available for many loans, both nontraditional and \nsubprime as defined by Senator Durbin's amendment, made before the \namendment's effective date. That is, of course, a lot of loans. Since \nthere is no sunset date in the amendment, borrowers could file for \nbankruptcy and still get this cramdown relief years and years from now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, through the Chair, if he is aware of \nthe fact that this only applies to mortgages, subprime mortgages on a \nprimary residence that had been entered into as of the date of the \nenactment of legislation, not to any future mortgages of any kind?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So then you are saying my statement was wrong?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am saying your statement should be modified.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am looking at my staff because I am not a lawyer. My \nstaff would disagree with you that my statement is inaccurate. But I \nwill not go into that now.\n  Furthermore, according to the Durbin amendment, subprime loans are \ndefined to be any loan with an interest rate of 3 to 5 percent over the \nTreasury yield rates for comparable loans. It is my understanding that \nthis definition could include prime loans and home equity lines of \ncredit, which would encompass a large number of loans.\n  The cramdown provision is just one of several problematic provisions \nin Senator Durbin's amendment. The amendment will increase bankruptcy \nfilings, something I really do not think we should encourage. We should \nbe doing everything we can to keep people out of bankruptcy. It ought \nto be very much a last resort, particularly because filing bankruptcy \nin and of itself hurts a consumer's credit rating. I think we can all \nagree that bankruptcy should be a last resort and one should not file \nfor bankruptcy unless it is absolutely necessary. The amendment will \nincrease mortgage interest rates and downpayments for other homeowners \nand potential home buyers. The Durbin bankruptcy amendment will inject \ngreater risk into and negatively impact our financial markets.\n  I would like to be clear: I want to help homeowners weather the storm \njust as much as the next Senator. I want to support constructive \nsolutions to help homeowners meet their obligations so they do not lose \ntheir homes. In fact, I have worked very hard with other Senators to \ncraft tax provisions that I am soon going to address that are currently \ncontained in the underlying housing proposal before us. But I am \nconcerned that the Durbin bankruptcy amendment we are considering right \nnow--if we adopt that, we are going to pass legislation that would do a \ngreat deal of harm. I am concerned about the possibility of the \namendment helping some, but hurting many others. I am not alone in my \nconcerns. Many experts agree that the Durbin bankruptcy cramdown \nproposal is problematic and could have serious adverse consequences. So \nI am asking my colleagues to vote against the Durbin bankruptcy \namendment.\n  I said that I am the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I now wish to give a short statement about some of the tax \nprovisions. I may have to be more specific when we get into debate on \nthis, so this is kind of a preliminary notice of where the committee is \ncoming from. First of all, as usual, I find it very necessary to thank \nChairman Baucus for his courtesy and hard work in the legislative \neffort. Our goal was to develop a bipartisan tax package that responds \nto the needs of Americans and, in particular, the housing market.\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\n  Americans are struggling to keep their homes and their jobs. As \neconomic conditions continue to worsen, it is appropriate that Congress \nact to enact tax laws that address the housing problem. After all, the \nhousing problem is at the root of the current economic turmoil and \nanxiety that people have.\n  Last year, we responded to the call for help. Congress enacted the \nMortgage Debt Relief Act of 2007 which was signed into law by the \nPresident. This law excludes from income discharges of indebtedness \nincurred by taxpayers to acquire homes. It also extends the tax \ndeduction for mortgage insurance premiums.\n  Earlier this year, Congress acted at lightning speed to enact a \nstimulus package that delivers additional relief to American taxpayers. \nAs a result of that legislation, Treasury will be sending out rebate \nchecks in a few weeks that will give the economy a much needed boost.\n  We have carefully balanced this tax relief package being considered \ntoday on the floor. It addresses the housing downturn but is limited so \nas to ensure that it helps the problem and does not simply create new \nproblems. We are mindful that any relief that benefits one sector of \nthe public does not do so at the expense of another sector. The other \nsector is the taxpaying population that carefully managed their family \nbudget, especially as it is related to housing costs. Taxpayers bear \nthe burden of a bailout of these risky mortgages that went south. So it \nis important that we have a compassionate view that recognizes \ntaxpayers possibly picking up some of the tab.\n  Once again, the Senate is stepping in to help Americans in distress. \nThe tax relief package helps encourage home ownership and encourages \nthe basic businesses that are tied to the housing industry to recover \nsome losses. Keep in mind that those businesses create jobs. More jobs \nmeans a stronger economy.\n  In 2002, Congress passed a stimulus bill that provided some of the \nvery same relief that is contained in this bill. In 2002, Congress \npassed, with overwhelming support, a provision to extend the net \noperating loss carryback. This provision passed without controversy. \nHopefully, there will be no controversy this time. Then, again, earlier \nthis year the Senate Finance Committee passed a similar provision to \nextend the net operating loss carryback once again, with overwhelming \nsupport by the committee.\n  Relying on our successes in the past, we have included similar \nprovisions in this bill. However, the net operating loss provision in \nthis bill is even more conservative than the relief offered in the \npast. Instead of a 5-year carryback, this proposal offers a 4-year \ncarryback. This provision, of course, is a no-brainer. It helps the \nvery industries suffering from this housing downturn and will help \nAmericans continue to be employed.\n\n  This bill also offers a tax credit to help people buy homes that are \nin foreclosure. These homes are depressing home values in the \nmarketplace. It is important that this inventory is moved so as to help \nretain home values.\n  This bill also increases the cap on mortgage revenue bonds to give \npeople in distressed loans additional options for refinancing. This is \nnot a bailout for homeowners; this is a provision that helps enable \npeople to keep their homes and to pay mortgages.\n  As we proceed on this bill, I am asking everybody to keep in mind \nwhat I said at the beginning: We need to address the housing downturn, \nbut we need to show restraint. We need to limit the relief so that it \neases the problem, but does not create new ones. We need to be \nconsiderate of the many Americans who worked hard to save and buy homes \nand who will ultimately pay the price for this relief, if the relief is \nused, and we expect it will be. They should benefit, too, in that any \ntargeted relief will, in fact, give the economy a boost and not be a \ndrag on the economy, drag it down even further. We want to keep people \nemployed, and particularly the taxpayers who were conservative in their \nfinancial plans should not be harmed as a result of this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Iowa. He and I \nare friends. We have worked together and continue to work together on \nmany issues. We have profound disagreements on some issues, but we have \nmanaged to maintain our friendship regardless.\n  We had the responsibility for a number of years of dealing with the \nBankruptcy Code. I will say to my friend from Iowa, for a man who is \nnot an attorney, I was always impressed by his knowledge of the issues \nand his ability to articulate his position effectively whether his \nopponents were attorneys or not. So I thank you very much for your \ncomments today. I respect very much your point of view, although I \ndisagree with the conclusions.\n  The purpose here is not to send people to bankruptcy court, it is the \nopposite. Going to bankruptcy court these days is not a trip to Disney \nWorld. It is a problem. You have to go through credit counseling, you \nhave to gather all of your documentation, walk into a courtroom, \nusually with a lawyer, and be prepared for a pretty tough ordeal. And \nthen, if you successfully complete the bankruptcy, you carry that \nstigma with you for years. Whenever you want to apply for a loan, one \nof the questions asked is: Have you ever filed for bankruptcy? So I do \nnot believe people are gleefully jumping at the chance to go to \nbankruptcy court. For most of them, it is an embarrassing experience, \nit is a humbling experience, and it is one they want to avoid.\n  The purpose of this bankruptcy provision is to avoid that experience. \nHere is the problem: If banks today, if mortgage lenders today were \njumping forward to renegotiate these mortgages, we would not be \nstanding here in this debate. They are not. People are in a position \nwhere they are about to lose their homes, and these mortgage \ninstitutions are not responding.\n  I will give you an example. A woman named Carol Thomas in Peoria, IL, \nretired as a drugstore clerk, spent her lifetime in that very basic \njob, retired with her husband, who worked at a factory. They bought a \nlittle home in Peoria. After they retired, her husband got sick. He \ncould not climb the stairs anymore. She wanted to keep him home as long \nas possible and knew he could not get upstairs to the bedroom, so she \nwent looking for another house, a smaller house but one floor. She \nfound one near where she lived, and she ended up buying the house.\n  Unfortunately, the medical bills got the best of them. She ended up \nneeding some money to pay off medical bills. Now, this is the No. 1 \nreason people do file bankruptcy in America: medical bills. But to \navoid bankruptcy, she thought: Maybe I can borrow more money on my \nhome. She got ahold of one of those mortgage lenders. And this is why I \nsupport Senator Feinstein's effort to license these mortgage brokers. \nShe could not have received worse advice. This poor woman who was no \nbusiness expert, no college graduate, just a hard-working woman who \ndeserves a decent retirement, was advised to consolidate her debts in \nher new mortgage. They brought together all of the debts she had and \nlumped them into a new debt on her home. They were so unscrupulous and \nso deceptive that they brought into this package of consolidated loans \na zero-percent loan she had from the city of Peoria for home \nimprovements. Can you imagine? This woman was paying off that home-\nimprovement loan with zero percent, and this unscrupulous mortgage \nbroker and lender ended up putting that debt into her home where she \nwas paying interest on it now. Thanks so much for the help for Mrs. \nThomas.\n  It did not take but a year for the bottom to fall out. The reset came \nin. Her husband has since passed away. She was trying to get by on \nmeager savings and Social Security. Her mortgage payment doubled, and \nthere she stood, about to lose her home and her retirement, thinking \nabout going back to work to save the home.\n  That is when she showed up at that little gathering I had to talk \nabout this issue. It is a heartbreaking situation. She said to me ahead \nof time, before the press conference got started: I hope I do not cry. \nI said: Just be as strong as you can. And she did not cry.\n  She contained her emotions but almost lost it when she talked about \nher husband and what he went through. She then said: I don't know which \nway to turn. I call this mortgage company.\n  I will not give their names here because there is a good ending to \nthis.\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\n  She said: I call the mortgage company and they say to me, you clearly \ncan't make these payments, so just stop making payments.\n  So she said: I didn't send in the monthly payment which would have \nexhausted my savings. Then they sent me a notice and said: You are in \ndefault. You are facing foreclosure. I can't win. I follow their \ninstructions; they tell me they are going to foreclose.\n  She had some counselors helping her, and the counselors said to me: \nWould you call the mortgage institution and see if you can talk to \nthem?\n  So I did. I called and left a message for the vice president of this \nmajor company. If I gave their name, it would be recognized instantly.\n  I said: Please give this woman straight advice and figure out if \nthere is any way she can stay in her home. Within 24 hours this vice \npresident said: We will take care of it. Ms. Thomas can stay in her \nhome, new interest rate, much lower percent interest rate, and she is \nOK. Don't worry about it.\n  Why did she have to go through that? Why did I have to make that \ncall? Do Senators have to get on the phone, all 100 of us, and call on \nbehalf of 2 million home owners to get this straightened out? I had to \nmake that call because that mortgage company wouldn't step up and do \nthat until somebody pushed them. I didn't have any threat I could hang \nover their head other than the embarrassment to their company of not \nhelping this poor woman out. But they finally did it. Why did I have to \nmake that phone call? Why did she have to go through month after month \nof being beaten up by people on the phone giving her conflicting \nadvice?\n  That is why this is needed, not so that Carol Thomas and people such \nas her end up in bankruptcy court but so that the mortgage lenders know \nif they will not sit down and work with people, those folks may end up \nin bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy judge may modify the terms of \nthe mortgage. If they know that is coming, they might sit down and talk \nto Carol Thomas or somebody before it reaches that point.\n  Some of my colleagues may have been listening or on the Senate floor \nearlier when my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, told his \nstory. Isn't this a great story? Irene Hernandez of Lawrence, MA, a \nmother trying to raise her children, ends up over her head with a \nmortgage. They come in and tell her that since she has defaulted, they \nare going to have to foreclose on her mortgage and toss her out of the \nhouse.\n  They say: Your $210,000 house is now only worth $99,000. So we are \ngoing to toss you out and we are going to sell your house for $99,000.\n  Irene Hernandez says: I will buy it. I can pay a mortgage on $99,000. \nYou know that. I have been paying this mortgage. So why don't you let \nme buy it?\n  They said: No. You are disqualified. You are disqualified because you \ndefaulted on a mortgage with our company.\n  You think of these cases, and you wonder what is going through the \nminds of these financial institutions. Here many of them have created \nthis subprime mortgage mess which was a catalyst for this recession, \nwhich we are sadly heading into according to Mr. Bernanke, and these \nsame mortgage bankers still rule the debate in the Senate. Doesn't this \ntell you a great story about this institution; that the mortgage \nbankers responsible for this mortgage foreclosure crisis are telling \npeople: Don't vote for that Durbin amendment. We are opposed to that. \nAnd Senators say: That is what mortgage bankers say, and that is where \nI am going to be.\n  We have a responsibility beyond the special interest groups that line \nthe hallways in nice silk suits. We have a responsibility to a lot of \npeople like Carol Thomas and Irene Hernandez. These are hard-working \npeople who deserve a break. Many of them were exploited, deceived. They \ndeserve a chance. That is all I am asking. The vast majority of them \nwill never end up in bankruptcy court, will never have the benefit of \nthis proposal. But some of them will. Some of them are going to be able \nto keep their homes because of this.\n  I cannot imagine what it would have meant to my family when I was \nraising them if I thought I was going to lose my home--not only the \nembarrassment of it, the uncertainty of where they would go, but moving \nout of the neighborhood, changing schools, leaving their friends. That \nis something we should not just look on as a routine occurrence in \nlife. It is something they will never, ever forget. That is why this \nbill is important.\n  I have been on the Senate floor now for 3 hours and 10 minutes with \nmy amendment. I have invited every Senator who wants to come to this \nfloor to oppose or support this amendment to come on down. The Senate \nfloor is empty but for the Presiding Officer, whom I thank very much \nfor being here. There have been three Senators on the other side of the \naisle who have come to speak against my amendment. When I asked the \nRepublican minority leader if we could schedule this for a vote up or \ndown, let's have the decision of the Senate, he said: Senators want to \nspeak. Well, good. That is appropriate. There should be speeches, and I \nhope even debate. But I have to urge my colleagues, if they believe \nthere is a sense of urgency about the housing crisis, please come to \nthe floor. Please join us in a conversation for or against the \nprovision.\n  I respect Senator Grassley of Iowa who opposes my provision. I \nrespect the fact that he came to the floor and expressed his point of \nview and submitted to a question or two. For some who don't follow the \nSenate, this is a rare occurrence. A Senator actually allowed another \nSenator to ask a question. We have reached the point where we just come \ndown to the floor and read speeches and finish the speeches and leave \nthe floor. That is unfortunate. It would be better for the debate, for \nthe Senate, and for people following it to hear both sides of the \nstory, to hear me defend my amendment and those who are critical of it \nexpress their point of view. It doesn't happen much. It should happen \nmore. I hope it will happen soon.\n  I am going to renew my request of the Republican leader after the \nlunch period which many Senators now are involved in to try to bring \nthis to a vote. I think we have given Senators over 3 hours to come to \nthe floor, and exactly three Republicans have come to speak to this \namendment. If it is one an hour, then we have 46 more hours to go \nbecause there are 49 Republican Senators. That is unfortunate. It is \nunnecessary. I hope those who do come to the floor will read this \namendment carefully.\n\n  The argument that this change in the bankruptcy law is going to raise \ninterest rates is one that cannot be sustained. When I asked Senator \nGrassley about the provision relating to farmers' homes being allowed \nto be treated this way, he said it was a limited number of farmers who \nhave filed for bankruptcy. He is right. But if the principle is sound \nfor a farmer's home, why is it not sound for a person living in town? \nIf a farmer can go into court and ask the bankruptcy court to change \nthe terms of the mortgage so that they can stay on the farm, why is \nthis inappropriate when it comes to those living in town? The principle \nis the same, and the principle is sound.\n  It is true that chapter 12 bankruptcies for those facing agricultural \nshortcomings are restricted, but so is this provision, restricted to \nthose who qualify for bankruptcy; to those who have a primary \nresidence, a home at stake; for existing mortgages, as of the date of \nenactment of this law, not after; to provide, as well, that the \nmortgage terms can only be reduced for the principal to fair market \nvalue, no lower; that the interest rate on the new mortgage \nmodification cannot be lower than the prime rate plus a premium for \nrisk; that the term of the new mortgage modification cannot be more \nthan 30 years; that we protect the lending institution; if the property \nappreciates in value over the next 5 years after the bankruptcy, any \nappreciation in value goes to the lender, not to the owner of the \nproperty. We have put all of these provisions in there. We keep \nnarrowing it down to what I think is a very discrete group of people. \nIt is not prospective. It does not apply to things in the future.\n  Once every 60 years or so we have a housing crisis in America. I am \nglad it doesn't occur more often. To respond in a temporary, focused, \nand narrowly gauged way is appropriate. I think it gives people a \nfighting chance.\n  I have taken the floor most of the morning. I know my colleague from\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\nLouisiana is here and has a very important statement to make regarding \nthis bill and her region of the country. I thank Senator Landrieu for \nbeing such a strong advocate for the State of Louisiana and for their \nrecovery from Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague from Illinois for those comments. \nI do appreciate his help because from the beginning of the catastrophe \nwe faced from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the anniversaries of which \nwe will not celebrate, by any chance, but mark by the end of August of \nthis year and, of course, 3 weeks later in September, we still are \nstruggling. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his constant help and \nsupport as we work through how to recover, how to rebuild with a \nFederal agency, FEMA, that was caught flat footed and poorly staffed \nand poorly resourced and disorganized. Initially, it made some \nimprovements, but we still have great challenges when it comes to the \nrebuilding of the gulf coast.\n  That is why I am here to take this opportunity, while we are on a \nhousing bill for the Nation, and there is some real urgency to get real \nhelp to real people who need the Federal Government to act to help \nstabilize markets appropriately. And as we are talking about this, I \nwanted to offer an amendment that I would like to speak on, one \namendment that I intend to offer to make sure this bill, in its attempt \nto help homeowners struggling to get back in their homes, as this bill \ntries to help neighborhoods stabilize from Detroit to California to the \neast coast, as this bill attempts to do other things, that we do \ncontinue to give appropriate aid and support to the hundreds of \nthousands of homeowners who are still struggling despite the good work \nthis Congress has done to give them help.\n  A chart illustrates this, if I could put it up. We have heard a lot \nabout the city of Detroit and a region which has, outside of Stockton, \nCA, and Las Vegas, NV, the highest percentage of foreclosures, almost 5 \npercent in this region, which is a significant percentage. Stockton, \nCA, almost 5 percent; Las Vegas, 4.2; other communities from Sacramento \nto Miami, FL, to the Denver-Aurora area, Fort Lauderdale, a fairly \nsignificant percentage of homes that are foreclosed. In some areas, it \nis quite a few people.\n  Let's look at San Bernardino, CA. This is 51,000 homes. That is a lot \nof homes, a big place, lots of people, lots of children. You can \nimagine in your mind, if you are from a community of 50,000, how big \nthat could be. They are not all in this situation, clustered, 51,000 \nforeclosures all in the same block. Some of them are spread throughout \na great area. But that is still a large number.\n  This is why we have come to the floor to try to bring help to these \nfamilies. Some of them, in my opinion, deserve help. Maybe some of them \ndon't. I hope this bill will sort the wheat from the chaff because \nmaybe some of these people entered into the kind of loans they \nshouldn't have. Maybe they should have read the fine print, and they \ndidn't. I am not here saying every single one deserves a handout, but I \nam saying they deserve this Senate to talk about what help they might \nneed to receive and the ramifications.\n  If the whole financial establishment could get together and have a \ndebate about Bear Sterns and Wall Street and what it might mean, what \nit would mean to the country if Bear Sterns collapsed, and they debated \nand came up with a solution, we most certainly need to be on this \nSenate floor talking about what solutions might be appropriate for \nhomeowners. I understand the Bear Sterns issue was that they were all \nintertwined and, if they failed, maybe all the other banks would fail.\n  Let me say for the record that in places such as Detroit, if all of \nthese homes fail, it will put such a burden on that city or that area \nthat others who had nothing to do with any of this may also fail. That \nis the principle. It is the same principle for which the Fed sort of \nbailed out Bear Sterns. And we most certainly need to be on the floor \nof the Senate talking about not trying to save people who did the wrong \nthing but trying to help people who did nothing wrong and may get \npulled down by maybe whatever people want to characterize as our \ninaction or inappropriate regulation, whatever. But this is not normal. \nWe are on the floor talking about these numbers because they are high.\n\n  Let me show you what the gulf coast numbers, though, look like \nbecause it is striking.\n  Let's take St. Bernard Parish. Let's look at this chart with the \nother one so we can get a comparison. Remember, Detroit has 41,000 \nhomes, or 4.9 percent, that were destroyed. That is basically this \nDetroit, Livonia, Dearborn area.\n  Let me tell you about what the people from St. Bernard are still \nreeling from. It is not a 5-percent, it is not a 10-percent, it is a \n54-percent destruction rate--54 percent. There is no county or parish \nin the country that is experiencing right now the devastation of homes, \nincluding those that are closed, empty or vacated.\n  Now, we are recovering from a disaster, which is not necessarily the \nsame thing as a foreclosure. But I hold these charts up to show the \nnature and the scope of the problem.\n  In Cameron Parish, it is not 4 percent, it is not 10 percent. It is \n46 percent.\n  In Plaquemines Parish, it is 44 percent. In Orleans, it is 78,000 \nhouseholds, 41 percent.\n  In Hancock County, MS, it is 27 percent.\n  In Harrison County, MS, it is 10 percent.\n  In Jackson County, MS, it is 4 percent.\n  In Jefferson Parish, LA, it is 2.6 percent.\n  In St. Tammany Parish, LA, it is 2.4 percent.\n  In Vermilion Parish, LA, it is 1.0 percent.\n  So my amendment is drafted to address something that will help these \nfamilies.\n  After the storm, when these homes were destroyed, we passed a special \ncommunity development block grant, extra grants to Mississippi and \nLouisiana and Alabama and Texas, sort of like we did right after the \nTwin Towers fell in New York, there was some extra community \ndevelopment block grants sent. The Congress did the same. Not \neverything we did was perfect in that regard. There were still some \ndiscrepancies in how it was allocated. But suffice it to say for this \ndiscussion that money was sent, and out of that money, Mississippi \ncreated the Homeowners Assistance Program and Louisiana created the \nRoad Home Program.\n  These were grants that were given to homeowners to try to help them \nbetween what their insurance would pay--and many of these homes were \nfully paid. These are problems where the mortgages were completely paid \noff. Some of these properties had insurance. Some of these properties \ndid not have insurance because they were not in a flood plain, and they \nwere not required to have insurance. So these are homeowners who did \nnot do anything wrong. The homeowners I am talk talking about did just \nabout everything right. Some of them maybe should have had insurance \nand did not, but, believe me, they are suffering the consequences of \nthat. We are not bailing everybody out.\n  But what we did do was allow them to take this Road Home grant. Then \nin the tax law they can also take a casualty deduction. This is the \nproblem: If my amendment, which I am going to offer when I can, and ask \nfor a vote on it--and I will offer this amendment not just for myself \nbut for Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, and Senator Wicker. All of us \nare together in a bipartisan way asking the Congress to give us some \nrelief. If this amendment I am going to offer is not adopted, these \nfamilies--I am going to give you an example of the Jones family and the \nSmith family--will end up paying much more in taxes than they can \nafford, and it will be counterproductive to our recovery effort.\n  Let's take the Jones family. They earn $75,000 a year. Their home was \nsubstantially damaged. They did not take a casualty deduction as the \ncurrent law allows. They paid the full amount of the taxes. Then out of \nthe community development block grant--let's say they are in \nMississippi--they received a grant from the State of Mississippi of \n$75,000, from the Mississippi Homeowners Assistance Program. Their Road \nHome grant will not be taxed. This family is fine.\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n  But for this family, the Smith family--which makes the same amount of \nmoney, and their house was completely damaged--they did take the \ndeduction. They got about a $7,000 benefit. Because of what we did, \nthey got their $75,000 grant, but if they have to pay taxes on this, \ntheir tax could be as high as $24,000.\n  Now, the people whom I represent in Louisiana--and I am sure this is \nthe same for Mississippi--can barely pay their utility bills right now, \ntheir insurance bills. They most certainly cannot pay a $24,000 tax \nbill.\n  If my amendment is not adopted--and I think it has good support from \nFinance on both sides--this family that I told you about that makes \nonly $75,000 a year, that had their home destroyed--through no fault of \ntheir own--because of a confluence of things we have done, will end up \nhaving to pay $24,000.\n  So you may ask me: Senator, how expensive is your amendment? It is \nnot cheap. The score for this amendment is $1 billion. It is not cheap. \nBut we have to provide this support for these gulf coast families or \nyou will have thousands and thousands of families suffer who arguably \nneed the most help in the country.\n  These are families who at one time owned homes such as this, as shown \nin this picture. This happens to be a double. I will show you another \npicture of another home. These are people who did not do anything \nwrong. They did not take out any subprime loan. They did not try to \ntake out a low adjustable mortgage. They took out their regular 30-year \nmortgage. They paid off their regular 30-year mortgage. They paid \ninsurance their whole life. They will have to end up paying $24,000 in \ntaxes, and it will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n  So you have heard me speak before about this issue. I know it can be \na little complicated. We are not trying to ask for double dipping or \nanything. But I am going to be offering this amendment. It is important \nto remember, if we do not do this, we will have thousands of people, \nhomeowners, who are trying to stay in their homes, rebuild these \nneighborhoods that are virtually destroyed, not on a beach--even though \nthat is the case in some places in Mississippi--in the middle of the \ncity, not close to any water or any beach, 5 minutes from the Super \nDome, where the Hornets will be playing in one of their division \nchampionship games in a couple days, 5 minutes from the Super Dome.\n  They did not even know the levees were going to break. The Federal \nlevees broke and put their homes underwater. As shown in this picture, \nthis is where the water line is. These families will have to pay \n$24,000 in taxes if we cannot get this fixed.\n\n  So the bottom line is this: I am happy to try to vote for this bill \nfor Michigan and California and places that have families that are \nexperiencing some difficulty with their mortgages. But I have to ask \nthis Congress to please continue to know that we still have homeowners \nwho are struggling after 2\\1/2\\ years to get back into their homes, \nwith some very complicated help that we and the States and the parishes \nare trying to give them.\n  So my amendment will correct that. I will offer it when we move to \nthat part of the legislation. I will also have several other amendments \nthat will help the recovery process move forward. They are all about \nhousing. They are all about helping people get back in their houses. \nThey are not necessarily on a different subject or anything because I \nrealize we will have other discussions later.\n  But while we are on housing and while we are trying to fix it for \neverybody in the country, let's please stay focused and give a few \ntweaks here and there to keep this recovery going in the right \ndirection on the gulf coast because we have a long way to go.\n  I see my colleague from Kansas, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, homeownership has long been the American \ndream, and over the last decade record numbers of families have been \nable to achieve the dream of homeownership. Unfortunately, too many \nhomeowners now find themselves in mortgages they can't afford. Many of \nthem knowingly or unknowingly took out exotic mortgages that made \nwildly unrealistic assumptions about the housing market; namely, that \nhousing values would continue to dramatically increase.\n  As we all now know, home price growth was unsustainable. \nUnfortunately, too many families are now facing the possibility of \nforeclosure. Just as ownership brings many benefits to families and \nneighborhoods, foreclosures have dramatic negative consequences for \nboth individual homeowners and the economy as a whole.\n  We have seen a rapid increase in the number of foreclosures, and many \nexperts predict that the number will continue to climb in the near \nfuture. Obviously, this creates great hardships for the families facing \nthis possibility. Accordingly, Congress is currently considering \nvarious proposals to help prevent foreclosures.\n  As part of any proposal, though, I think we must be careful not to \nreward irresponsible behavior. Borrowers have a responsibility to \nunderstand the terms of their loan, and lenders have a responsibility \nto provide them with clear, accurate information in order to help them \nunderstand the terms. Borrowers have a responsibility to only borrow \nwhat they can repay, but lenders have a responsibility to only lend to \nthose who can repay.\n  Should Congress choose to provide relief, it should not do so in a \nmanner that is simply a ``bail out'' for either lenders or borrowers \nwho acted irresponsibly. We should also not set a broad precedent that \nthe Government will simply bail people out whenever they lose money or \nface tough times in the housing market. Financial investments involve \nboth risk and reward, and contracts are legal documents; we need to \nreinforce accountability amongst all parties for these elements.\n  I also believe that any efforts to address foreclosures should be \ndone in a thoughtful, comprehensive manner. Any effort to provide \nforeclosure relief must carefully address any risk to taxpayers.\n  As part of the housing package before the Senate, we are considering \nan amendment which would give bankruptcy judges the ability to modify \nmortgage contracts after the fact.\n  The bankruptcy modification provision would undermine the recovery of \nthe housing market and the economy by creating a credit crunch: It \nwould have a negative impact in the financial markets, making it \ndifficult to value mortgages that underlay securities. The provision \nwill discourage securitization, and securitization encourages \nhomeownership. Securitization frees up capital to go back into making \nmore mortgages. Approximately 84 percent of primary home mortgages are \nsecuritized; however, looking at second homes, where the mortgage can \nbe modified in bankruptcy, we see that only 9 percent are securitized. \nJustice Stevens of the Supreme Court reiterated in the Nobleman case \nthat ``the favorable treatment of residential mortgagees was intended \nto encourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.''\n\n  The cramdown amendment would significantly increase the cost of \nhomeownership: This provision will inject risk into the lending \nprocess. Whether the other side likes it or not, the markets will price \nto this risk by increasing the cost of mortgages for primary residences \nin the form of higher interest rates, down payments, points and fees. \nIt is a basic tenant of the free markets that more risk requires a risk \npremium. Even the Congressional Budget Office noted in a recent report \nthat one of the costs of the bill ``would be higher mortgage interest \nrates.'' Estimates are that the provision will increase mortgage \ninterest rates by 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Assuming an increase of 1.5 \npercent, for a Colorado family with an average sized loan--$184,362--\ntheir monthly mortgage payment would increase by $184. For those \nfamilies who can still afford a home, it will cost them anywhere from \n$23,000, in rural areas, to well over $500,000, in many metropolitan \nsuburbs, in extra interest over the life of a 30-year mortgage. That \nmoney should be used for bills, their children's education, or other \nexpenses.\n  The other side likes to claim that the talk of increased interest \nrates is little more than a scare tactic. They couldn't be more wrong. \nThese effects are not merely a hypothetical. We have seen the effects \nin a real life case example:\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\nsecondary homes. A bankruptcy judge can currently change the balance on \na mortgage for a second home. As a result of this, the cost of buying a \nsecond home is higher--interest rates, down-payment, shorter repayment \nperiod--than a primary home. Title IV will increase the cost of buying \na primary home similar to the cost of buying a second home.\n  The bankruptcy provision would have a price far too high: Every \nquarter point increase in mortgage interest rates will prevent 1.1 \nmillion Americans from being able to afford a home. This provision \ncould price homes out of reach for 9 million Americans. Those \nadvocating for this ill-advised provision have estimated that it could \nhelp as many as 600,000 families, although more realistic estimates put \nthis number closer to only 15,000. We can surely find a better way to \nhelp a small number of families than to deny homeownership to 9 million \nfamilies and increase costs for millions more. Quite simply, the cost \nfor this provision, in terms of what it will mean for families, is far \ntoo high. Congress shouldn't be forcing families into bankruptcy for \nmortgage relief.\n  The bankruptcy amendment is bad policy: The provision would reopen \nthe bankruptcy code and would undo the 2005 requirement for \nprebankruptcy counseling. Senator Durbin's proposal would grant new \npowers to bankruptcy judges to change the terms of primary mortgages. \nJudges have little, if any, expertise in the complexity in mortgage \nterms. The bankruptcy code is not the right area to address the \nsubprime issues and mortgage markets. The Senate Banking Committee, the \nHouse Financial Services Committee, Federal banking regulators, and \nindustry are all working. These are the appropriate areas.\n  The bankruptcy provision will discourage other alternatives: It will \nundermine efforts to put the two parties to the mortgage contract \ntogether. Borrowers must file for bankruptcy in order for the proposed \nchanges to work. The HOPE NOW Alliance has helped more than a million \nhomeowners through workouts and repayment plans. In Colorado, the \nForeclosure Hotline received thousands of calls and has been able to \nhelp 80 percent who called. The hotlines are not perfect, and they \ncannot help all borrowers, but they are helping many. The 1 million \nplus families helped didn't have to pay a bankruptcy attorney; they \ndidn't have to deal with the long-term problems caused by filing for \nbankruptcy; the Federal Government didn't have to spend taxpayer \ndollars. That is a far better approach. Drying up the credit markets \nand making loan terms less favorable will make it far more difficult \nfor homeowners to refinance their loans, thus creating new problems \nwhere none existed previously.\n  I know that many families are hurting from foreclosures, but this \namendment isn't the right approach, and I urge my colleagues to oppose \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana. I appreciate the information she \nhas put forward. I will certainly be looking at it and considering it.\n  I am delighted we are on the housing bill. Chairman Bernanke of the \nFederal Reserve, who was in front of the Joint Economic Committee \nyesterday, I thought did a nice job testifying. There are lot of \ninteresting things going on as to what he was talking about taking \nplace. But he was saying the primary thing to watch in the economy \nright now is housing, the price of housing, it is holding or \ndeclining--it is declining in a number of key areas--but to watch that \nmarketplace because that is the linchpin issue. He urged Congress to \nact on housing.\n  So I am delighted we have this bill up. I am delighted we have a \nbipartisan bill that I can look at and say a number of the provisions \nlook pretty good. We do not try to get too one-sided one way or the \nother so it gets held up. Because this is something we need to act on. \nI think it would be a good confidence builder for the housing market \nacross the country if we can get something through here, through the \nHouse, and signed by the President.\n  Having confidence is a key part of the marketplace. Confidence is a \nkey part of what they did on the Bear Stearns bailout. He said a year \nago they probably would not have done it. A year from now, they \nprobably would not do it. But right now things are too shaky and it \ncould cause things to crumble. The key piece to watch is housing.\n  So it is good we are working on this legislation. It is good we are \nworking in a bipartisan fashion. I will be filing an amendment that I \nthink can be very helpful in the pay-fors on this because we need to \npay for this. We are in a difficult budgetary situation, so we have a \ncommission bill to look at all spending within HUD and within Treasury \nand to make recommendations for programs to be eliminated and then \nrequiring a vote of Congress, up or down, whether to eliminate these \nprograms and then use those funds to pay for some of the efforts that \nare taking place here.\n  I think this is the sort of thing we ought to look at and the sort of \nthing we ought to do in paying for this because nobody wants the \ndeficit to go up further. I think that is everybody's objective. So we \nare going to be putting forward that amendment and at the appropriate \ntime bring that up.\n  One of the key things we need to look at and to do on this is \nsomething every physician in the United States does when they become a \nphysician. They take an oath. We take an oath of office. We swear to \nuphold and abide by the Constitution. A physician takes an oath. It is \na very simple, very old oath. I think it is a very good one for \nlegislating as well. The oath is very simple. It is, ``First, do no \nharm.'' That is the first premise that you operate on: ``First, do no \nharm.''\n  I appreciate the amendment my colleague from Illinois has up on the \nrestructuring of loans within bankruptcy, cramdown provisions on \nresidential homes people own. I understand the provision. As to my \nbackground in the law practice I had, such as it was--I am not bragging \nabout a fabulous law practice; it was a pretty simple pedestrian law \npractice in Manhattan, KS--we did bankruptcies and we had provisions \nsimilar to these in other areas. They were not existing on the loans. \nSo I think I have some familiarity with the impact of this. I believe \nthis one violates the oath of: ``First, do no harm.''\n  I know my colleague from Illinois has all the right intentions, and I \nhave worked closely with him on a number of issues. He is a very \nsuccessful, able legislator. I believe this one violates that oath of: \n``First, do no harm.'' I say that advisedly. A number of people looking \nat this believe this provision, if added to this bill and becoming the \nlaw of the United States, will drive up mortgage interest rates on \nresidential homes 1 to 2 percent because it introduces a degree of \nuncertainty. Markets do not like uncertainty, so they factor in for \nuncertainty. It is believed this would increase mortgage interest rates \n1 to 2 percent. I think there could be some fluff in that number. It \ncould be low, initially. Typically, as well, markets will look at \nthings, and at first they will factor more risk in until they have had \nsome practice with this and seen how it hits in the numbers. So maybe \nover a period of time it would not have as much of an impact. But \nearlier on it could have more of an impact. Right at the point in time \nwhen we are trying to stimulate the housing market, you up your \nmortgage interest rates on your primary residence 1 to 2 percent, \npossibly more, because early on the market has not factored in: What \nwill this actually do?\n  The other thing it could well do on top of increasing interest rates \nis reduce the number of people who could borrow to buy a home. In fact, \nin 1978 Congress specifically barred cramdown on primary residences to \nkeep interest rates low for primary homes and to ensure that lenders \nprovide credit to low-income borrowers. As many people are in a low-\nincome situation, a more fragile economic situation, if things go south \nfor them on a set of items, they have no choice but to pursue \nbankruptcy. So now then you introduce another set of risk factors on \nlow-income individuals where it is going to make it harder for them to \nget a mortgage to buy a home.\n  We want people to be able to buy homes. We want particularly low-\nincome individuals to be able to buy homes. If we introduce another \nfactor of uncertainty that is going to drive interest rates up, it \ncould well end up\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nworking out that a low-income individual will have their interest rates \ndriven up even more than the 1 to 2 percent, as the factors for risk \nare built into it.\n  Again, I add, these are things that are unknown. I have groups that \nare saying this is indeed the case. I don't think we particularly know \non this provision. But you are introducing that period of uncertainty \nwith it.\n  If I could say to my colleague: I know you have talked a long time \nand you know this issue very well; I wish to finish my statement and \nthen I am happy to take questions or comments, because I know there \nwill be extensive rebuttal taking place on it.\n  I am talking about my experience. I am talking about what I believe \nwill happen in this marketplace. I know it is intended to have a \npositive effect, but I think it violates this first ``do no harm'' \nprovision.\n  I wish to add some other comments. What we are trying to do here is \nto stimulate a housing market, not introduce factors of risk into the \nhousing market. We have a good bipartisan proposal that is being put on \nthe floor by Senators Dodd and Shelby, two senior Members of this body \nwho have seen a lot and who have worked on a lot. I think our wisest \ncourse at this point in time would be to work together on those \nprovisions where we can get bipartisan support rather than introducing \nfactors that are highly likely to slow down a bill. We need to \nencourage the market by showing an ability to work together.\n  This amendment, I believe, will be highly controversial and will \ncontinue to have the effect of slowing this bill down. The amendment \nwould actually create an ability for unsecured creditors as well of an \nindividual, to reduce their exposure, at the expense of a \nmortgageholder in consumer bankruptcy proceedings. I think this is an \nunintended consequence, but it is a consequence of it. This would be \nbad policy. This was considered in 1978. We want these mortgages to \nhave as low a rate as we possibly can.\n  Potentially 4.5 million Americans could be priced out of the housing \nmarket for every 1 percent increase in mortgages. That is according to \nhome builders. They are saying that. So if you have a 2-percent \nincrease, you are looking at the possibility of keeping 9 million \nAmericans priced out of the housing market at a time when we want them \nin the housing market. That is not going in the right direction.\n  Having said all of that, I think there are people who could look at \nthis another way. Indeed, I asked Chairman Bernanke about this \nparticular provision, because he said we ought to do work on the \nhousing market. I asked him about this particular provision and he did \nnot take a stance on it. He just said he didn't take a stance on prior \nbankruptcy reform. He said there are arguments on both sides. So I \nrecognize arguments on the other side. I have used cramdown provisions \nin other bankruptcy settings, in business settings. It does introduce a \nfactor of risk. It does allow restructuring to take place.\n  I think where we are right now, with his statements and with our \nability to move a piece of legislation, the key thing we should do is \nto get the base legislation moving forward, add things where we can get \nbroad bipartisan support, not introduce more risk into the marketplace \nand possibly limit mortgageholders. I am presuming my colleague from \nIllinois has facts he is putting forward which say this is not going to \ntake place. I think it is too much of a possibility that it will take \nplace, and that it will first do harm. For those reasons, with all due \nrespect to its supporters, I don't think this is a wise provision. Of \ncourse, I don't think this is the time for us to do it. I think we \nought to spend a lot more time studying and thinking about this. I \nbelieve this is not the bill for this amendment, and I object to the \nDurbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have two questions. I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, wishes to speak on an unrelated issue. \nFirst, I wish to ask the Senator from Kansas, through the Chair, on the \nissue of uncertainty: Is the Senator from Kansas aware that on this \namendment I am offering, I have narrowed the class of people eligible \nfor this benefit, which would be modification of mortgage in Bankruptcy \nCourt, to those who first qualify to go into Bankruptcy Court which, in \nmany instances, requires credit counseling; secondly, that they must be \ntalking about property that is their primary residence, not a piece of \nreal estate they happen to own; third, that it be subject to a mortgage \nwhich is a subprime mortgage, not a prime rate mortgage; and fourth, \nthat it has to be a mortgage that exists as of the date of the \nenactment of this legislation and none in the future? Also, that if \nthere is to be a modification of the mortgage, it can be to a principal \nlevel no lower than the current fair market value; that the interest \nrate imposed by the court be no lower than the prime rate plus a \npremium for risk; that the term of the modification of the mortgage can \nbe no more than 30 years, and that if within 5 years of bankruptcy the \nproperty is sold at a price higher than the fair market value at the \ntime of bankruptcy, all of the proceeds will go to the lender--not to \nthe owner, but to the lender?\n  I say to the Senator from Kansas that every time the banking and \nfinancial institutions came to me and said: It is too uncertain, too \nmany people could benefit from this, every time they did that I would \nnarrow this more and more and more. I would further say to the Senator \nfrom Kansas that if we are talking about a limited group of people who \nfit the description I have given here, how can you project this to have \nan impact on real estate mortgages of 1 and 2 percent into the future?\n\n  The last time we dealt with this issue in Congress was 30 years ago. \nThe last time we had a housing crisis was 60 years ago. It isn't as if \nwe are meeting every 6 months to change the law on mortgages and \nbankruptcy. I ask the Senator: How much more can I do to deal with his \nconcern and the stated concerns of the banking industry about \nuncertainty?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, responding to my colleague through the \nChair, a couple of things. I appreciate that the Senator has narrowed \nthis down from when he started, because he started with a much broader \namendment; no question about it. I think what the Senator has done is \nadvisable and good.\n  The base of the concern remains then the same, that now you have \nnarrowed this in on a smaller class that you are going to raise the \ninterest rates on because of the uncertainty that is going to be \nconducted there, or the likelihood of this having impacts on the \nmortgage marketplace and reducing their ability to get these houses on \nthe market, which could further depress the prices on those houses. I \nthink this is first do no harm. I appreciate that the Senator has \nnarrowed this and he has narrowed it substantially.\n  I would also point out--and it was 1978 when we did the overall--we \ntook up bankruptcy reform. We did that within the last 5 or 6 years \nwhere we had broad bankruptcy reform, and this sort of provision could \nhave come forward in that bankruptcy reform at that point in time. I \nvoted against that bankruptcy reform. I didn't think that overall was \nthe way to go and that again was based on the experience I had in \ndealing with bankruptcy.\n  I appreciate the Senator's efforts. I think the basic issue he is \nintroducing here continues to be the same even if it is within a narrow \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask the Senator from the great farming State of \nKansas if, in his private practice experience with bankruptcy, he ever \ndealt with a chapter 12 bankruptcy involving farm real estate and \nwhether he believes that the change in the bankruptcy law in the 1980s, \nwhich allowed cramdown or modification of the mortgages on farm homes, \nwas unreasonable; whether he believes that the banking institutions \nwhich fought that chapter 12 bankruptcy saying it would raise interest \nrates 1 or 2 percent on farmers--and it didn't turn out to be the \ncase--whether we ought to believe those financial institutions again \ntoday when we talk about using the same provision--or a similar \nprovision,\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nI should say--as chapter 12 to deal with the current housing crisis? \nDid the Senator from Kansas feel it was unfair to allow cramdowns or \nmodifications of mortgages in farm bankruptcies in his own State under \nchapter 12?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to my colleague \nthrough the Chair, again in my limited background--I have actually \ntaught agricultural law and written a book on it. It is not very good. \nI doubt my colleague has read it. I would recommend this chapter of it \nfor him if he wishes to read it.\n  In the provisions that were done at that time before either of us \nwere in the Senate, what you were doing was taking business bankruptcy \nreorganizations and allowing for farm application because it was a \ndifferent business type of setting that was taking place. It did \nintroduce risks that are even still factored in today, because this is \na provision that is allowed within it.\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier, over a period of time as markets get \nadjusted to these, they say: Well, OK, this factor is only going to \nhappen in this series of cases. Or they looked at lower end income \nclients and they said this is a more likely situation where we are \ngoing to see this taking place. Therefore, we are not going to loan to \nthis guy, or it only goes to a bank that is willing to get into a more \naggressive loan position and is desirous to do it. So it does have \nthose impacts.\n  But what you were doing with that chapter reorganization during the \nfarm crisis was taking a business reorganization and allowing for the \ndifferences in agriculture which are substantial. Now you are getting \ninto the basic housing market with this. This isn't a business \nreorganization; this is a housing market issue, and you are introducing \nthe very factors I talk about--in a limited fashion; I appreciate that \ngreatly. I think it is less harmful potentially than the original \ndesign of the Durbin amendment. I appreciate your heart on it. It is \ngoing to have an introduction of factors of uncertainty and will drive \ninterest rates up, and it will drive lenders out in this situation. \nThat is what will happen. I don't think we should go that route.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, as I see Senator \nKennedy is here and wishes to speak, I wish to make a point for the \nRecord.\n  We introduced this amendment 4 hours ago. I have come to the floor, \nand but for a brief period off the floor, to entertain any debate on \nthis amendment. In 4 hours there have been four Republican Senators who \nhave come to the floor, one each hour, to oppose this amendment. At \nthis rate, with 49 Republican Senators, in 45 hours we should be able \nto close this amendment and vote on it. I say that facetiously.\n  I hope those who have an interest in the amendment will come forward \nand that we can schedule it for a vote. I have asked repeatedly for \nthat. I don't know what more I can do other than be here and be \navailable for any debate they want to take place.\n  This is a critically important bill. There are several important \namendments, and I think mine might be one of them. But if Members won't \ncome to the floor and debate it, apparently they either don't have an \ninterest in the amendment or the bill. I hope they will seriously \nconsider coming to the floor in the very near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an interesting situation. We have a \nsubstitute amendment that has been laid down. We have worked hard to \nget it here. We started on the bill at 9:30 this morning. It is now 2 \no'clock. We have one amendment that has been laid down. I even tried to \narrange a vote on a resolution honoring the 4,000 Americans who have \nbeen killed in Iraq. We can't even get that up for a vote. I don't know \nwhat is going on. We are going to work through this. I asked for a \nconsent agreement that any amendments that would be offered would be \nrelated to the housing bill. No, we can't do that yet. I realize the \nmajority we have is very slim, but we do have the majority and that \ngives us certain rights. I am going to exercise those rights.\n  I would like to have a housing bill. I think it is important to the \ncountry. I hope the American people see what we have put up with now \nduring the last 15 months. Every step of the way is a struggle. We are \nnot able to legislate. We are constantly trying to figure a way \nprocedurally to get past the minority, which is still upset about the \nNovember 2006 elections. That is what this is all about. We are in the \nmajority, as slim as it might be, and they have to get over this. Let \nus work together. We want to work. We want to pass things. My friend \nhas offered an amendment.\n  Let's vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see our leader leaving the floor. He \nwas expressing his frustration about the lack of action. I join him in \nunderlining what he has stated here. Yesterday, a number of us, \nincluding the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, listened to Mr. \nBernanke. Mr. Bernanke was before the Joint Economic Committee talking \nabout how they had let go more than $200 billion over the period of \nthese last weeks--$200 billion in secret transactions, without any \nguarantees to the American taxpayers. And here we have a proposal that \nthe Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and Senator Dodd and others are \ninvolved with in the Banking Committee, trying to do something about \nthe fact that homes are being foreclosed while we are here on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  What is it about the other side that they are quite prepared to see \nhundreds of billions of dollars flow out of the Treasury, and when you \nstand up and say: Can we not this afternoon help stop some of these \nforeclosures of homes of working-class people, they say: No go, no way, \nwe are not going to let you take action, but we are fine with the \nhundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed out of the Treasury in \nthe last several days. What possible justification is there for that?\n  Finally, when I asked the Federal Reserve--I said: Well, we have the \nimmediate crisis, but we are also going to have the crisis in the \nStates. States have two options: they can either raise their taxes or \ncut services. What are they going to cut? Medicaid is first. They are \nthe poorest of the poor. When we ask the leader of the Federal Reserve, \nthe architect--because he is the man in charge--whether he believes we \nought to reach out and help those families, he said he did not have a \nposition on that and that is a position that will have to be taken up \nby the Congress of the United States. Why doesn't he tell that to the \nRepublican leaders? Why? Here you are trying to take some kind of a \nposition, and this is the old Chicago movie that I remember so well \nwhere they talk about ``Give us the old razzle-dazzle. I will razzle-\ndazzle me, too.'' We are finding out that the American homeowners, who \nare hard pressed, are being given the old razzle-dazzle.\n  I applaud the determination and resolution the leader has shown on \nthis issue. Real people are hurting. We are here this afternoon waiting \nto take some action, ready to move ahead on a proposal that has broad \nsupport, and we find out the emptiness and vacuousness of the \nRepublican response.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Massachusetts realize that today, \nthis day in April, April 3, 2008, almost 8,000 people will be pushed \nout of their homes because their foreclosure has been completed? They \nare gone--8,000 today and 8,000 tomorrow. Now, foreclosures usually \ndon't happen on weekends; it is during the week. So this week, 5 times \n8,000 is 40,000 people, approximately, who will be out of their homes \nwhile we have been here this week. If we don't get something done \ntoday, we will start tomorrow, and there will be another 8,000. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I have been aware of it because we have listened \nto our good leaders, including yourself, Senator Durbin, Senator \nSchumer, and Senator Dodd, talking about between 8,000 and 12,000.\n  I had a chance to be out in Youngstown, OH, recently. Five-thousand \nhomes are empty there, and it is increasing every single day just in \nthat one community. That is being replicated in my State. People are \nsaying:\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nWhere is the action? Where is the leadership? When are you going to do \nsomething on this issue? We are interested in getting something done.\n  Mr. Bernanke was asked, after he became Chairman of the Federal \nReserve: How are things going in terms of our economy? ``Fine,'' he \nsaid. He never exercised the bully pulpit to stop the explosiveness \nthat is taking place in the housing market and put so many homeowners \nat risk.\n  This is as bad as Katrina and as bad as the Iraq war. We have a \nsimilar response from the administration, and that is a failure of \nleadership and a failure of action. The American people ought to \nunderstand that.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator hear me when I said we have asked for an \nagreement that the only amendments that will be offered on this bill \nare relating to housing? Is he aware that they said no deal? And is the \nSenator aware that Senator Durbin had offered an amendment at \napproximately 10 o'clock this morning, and there have only been four \nspeakers, with not long speeches, and that we are not voting because of \nthe speeches, because they are gone? Is the Senator aware that I said: \nOkay, how about voting on a resolution offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts that honors the lives of 4,000 Americans who have been \nkilled in Iraq? Is he aware that we could not get a vote on that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, it is difficult to believe, Mr. President. We had \nour moment just last week in which those of us who were there in the \nRotunda listened to our leader, who spoke so well, so movingly, as well \nas the other leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, to honor the \nanniversary of the war. Now, in the last few days, we have another \nmoment of special significance, and that is the 4,000 soldiers--just \nwith regard to Iraq--who have been lost and 500 more in terms of \nAfghanistan. I was very grateful to the Senator and to our other \ncolleagues--and I am sure on the other side as well--who thought it \nwould be useful to memorialize in the Congressional Record the names of \nthese extraordinary men and women, listing their names, hometowns, \ntheir ranks, and their service, and that we could include that in the \nRecord at this time. We are trying to do it at an appropriate time \nbecause we have been reminded about the loss of the 4,000--not as an \nadd-on to some other kind of action here but to give respect and \ndignity and honor to these individuals and do so by having a rollcall \nvote to send a special message to their families and friends in their \ncommunities that we honor their service. Why is it that we cannot get \nan agreement on that?\n  The good Senator--I will not insult his intelligence. I read the \nresolution, and it may be 8 lines long. It is honoring these \nextraordinary men and women and in tribute to their valor. Why is it \nthat we cannot have a time when we could bring the membership together \nto honor those names? What is the possible problem? Where is the \nRepublican leader? Can he explain to the American people why we cannot \nhave that? Usually, if they are going to object, at least they indicate \nwhy. Why don't they take the floor? Why can't they give an explanation \nto the American people? Look at these pages. On each one of these pages \nis 50 names. Look at these pages. There are 50 names on each and every \none of them with their home addresses. We ought to be able to take a \nfew moments for those who want to speak to be able to express \nthemselves and pass this resolution and include it in the Record at \nthis time, where we have paused as a Nation out of respect for the loss \nof some 4,000 Americans.\n  I thank the majority leader for all he has done. Since I have the \nfloor, I will just take a few moments here, obviously, before the \nSenator from Illinois, whose amendment is pending. I will withhold at \nany time he thinks he can get action.\n  Mr. President, this is the resolution we will be offering. It honors \nthe sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who were killed in \nIraq and Afghanistan:\n\n       Whereas 4,009 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have lost their lives in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom \n     and 487 members of the United States Armed Forces have lost \n     their lives in support of Operation Enduring Freedom;\n       Whereas we honor the ultimate sacrifice that these men and \n     women made for our country;\n       Whereas the sacrifices of the fallen are in keeping with \n     the highest traditions of the United States Army, Navy, \n     Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard;\n       Whereas, as their families and loved ones have sacrificed \n     as well, we honor them in commemorating the memory of those \n     that lost their lives;\n       Whereas the following 4,009 members--\n\n  It starts off listing the fallen members of the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, progress in this body is sometimes very hard \nto come by, but progress has been made. I appreciate Senator Kennedy \ncoming to the floor. As those of us who have such affection and love \nfor him know, once in a while he raises his voice. As a result of \nraising his voice, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote on the adoption of S. Res. 501, honoring the \nsacrifice of the members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been killed \nin Iraq and Afghanistan; that upon adoption of the resolution, the \npreamble be agreed to, with no intervening action of our debate; and \nthat no amendments be in order to the resolution or the preamble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership in making this all possible.\n  Mr. President, the war in Iraq has deeply divided our country. But \nwhatever our views are about the war, we know our soldiers are serving \nnobly under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and that far too \nmany are making the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The war \ncontinues to impose an enormous human toll on our soldiers, their \nfamilies, and their loved ones. Our men and women in uniform have \nserved with great courage and honor for 5 years, and last week, during \nthe recess of Congress, we reached a sad milestone--the loss of 4,000 \nservice men and women in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. An \nadditional 30,000 service men and women have been wounded. We have also \nlost nearly 500 service men and women in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan.\n  This loss of life is deeply distressing, and the impact of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan continues to be devastating to families and \ncommunities around our Nation. We honor their service, and we pray that \nGod's grace and mercy may ease the anguish of those they have left \nbehind.\n  It is fitting, therefore, that today we honor and remember the \ncourageous men and women who gave the last full measure of their \ndevotion to our country in these wars. From Lexington and Concord and \nGettysburg, to Normandy and Iwo Jima, to Korea and Vietnam, to Iraq and \nAfghanistan today, these heroes are part of a long line of courageous \npatriots who stood their ground with uncommon valor and sacrificed for \nall of us.\n  Since the terrorist attack by al-Qaida on September 11, millions of \nAmericans have proudly and voluntarily defended our country and our \nConstitution by serving in our Armed Forces, our Reserves, and our \nNational Guard. Their devotion to duty is beyond question, and their \nvalor is proven. They volunteered to serve and help us meet the immense \nchallenge we face. They knew the vast danger to life and limb and were \nwell aware that at any moment they might make the ultimate sacrifice. \nAnd as of today, 4,496 have made that sacrifice in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They were all patriots. They put themselves in harm's way \nto protect us all. And because of their dedication and sacrifice, we \ncontinue to enjoy the freedoms we cherish in our democracy.\n  Each of these men and women has a poignant story to tell. Just as \npoignant are the fond memories of their loved ones here at home. I know \nsomething of that feeling. I was 12 years old when my mother became a \nGold Star mother. It still seems like only yesterday when that knock on \nour door came in 1944, and we learned that my oldest brother, Joe, had \nbeen lost in World War II.\n  I know there is no easy way to mend these broken hearts, no way to \nlift the\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nalmost unbearable burden from the families and friends of those we \nlost. We mourn the loss of these heroes. We honor their sacrifice and \nextend our deepest condolences to their families. Words cannot ease the \ngrief of losing a loved one, but I hope the families may find some \ncomfort in the words of Abraham Lincoln in that famous letter he sent \nto a bereaved mother during the Civil War. He wrote:\n\n       Dear Madam, I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words \n     of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of \n     a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering \n     to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the \n     Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father \n     may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you \n     only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost, and the \n     solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a \n     sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  The consequences of the decisions we make in Congress profoundly \naffect our military, their families, and the communities they have \nleft. We have an obligation to our soldiers to make sensible decisions \nthat will not place them needlessly in harm's way.\n  It is fitting that we now pause to recognize, remember, and honor \nthose who have lost their lives far from home for our grateful Nation \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I \nhave been a Senator for a number of years and have visited Iraq and \nAfghanistan on three separate occasions. I try my best to meet with as \nmany of our soldiers as possible--but, of course, focus on those from \nIllinois--to sit and eat lunch with them and talk about the Cubs, the \nWhite Sox, the Bears, the Bulls, the news back home. The thing that \nhaunts me--and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for reminding \nme--the thing that haunts me are the frequent conversations where they \nsay: Does anybody know we are still here? Does anybody back home know \nwhat we are going through? It really is heartbreaking to think that \nthese men and women are risking their lives every day while we go about \nour safe, secure, normal, daily routine and how little focus we put on \nthis war and the men and women who are fighting it for us and \nparticularly those who have given their lives.\n  We have lost almost 150 soldiers in Illinois. I took an inspiration \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts and said I was going to send a note \nto every family in Illinois who loses a soldier. I thought after a year \nor two that task would have been completed. After 5 years, it is not. \nSadly, in our State and every other State we are still losing lives. \nThe fact that the Senator from Massachusetts would take the time to \ncome to the floor today as a solemn reminder of what this means to us, \nshould mean to us, and what it means to these families is something I \ndeeply appreciate.\n  Last week or so, the New York Times had a front-page story talking \nabout the lives that had been lost just last year, with color \nphotographs of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who were \namong the casualties. There were six or eight personal stories of their \nlives. I took the time to read it carefully to try to absorb what was \nhappening to these men and women and their families.\n\n  I think I can speak for the Senator from Massachusetts. We have cast \nbetween us thousands of votes on the floor of the Senate, myself in the \nHouse of Representatives as well. I cannot think of another vote more \nprofound and more important than the vote to authorize the invasion of \nIraq in October 2002. Senator Kennedy and I joined 21 of our colleagues \nin voting against that authorization to go to war. At the time, it was \nnot the most popular vote, but it turned out to be the right vote. Not \nto take anything away from these brave men and women who have given so \nmuch for our country, but this war may be the most fatal foreign policy \nmistake of the modern era, and we continue to pay for it every day in \nAmerican lives and blood and treasure and in our reputation and safety \nin the world.\n  The fact that the Senator from Massachusetts would take some time--\neven a brief period of time--to remind us is something that should be \ndone and I am glad is being done. I know this will receive an \noverwhelmingly unanimous vote of support, as it should. We all want to \nbe on record. But I hope that also, the next time this matter comes up \nfor a debate about the policy of this war in Iraq, some of our \ncolleagues who want to just continue this indefinitely for years and \nyears will reflect on how many more American lives will be sacrificed \nif that happens. That is the sad reality of where we are.\n  The Senator could not, because his stack of papers would be \ndramatically larger, include the names of all those who have been \nseriously wounded or injured in this war. They deserve our thanks and \nour recognition as well. Many of them will carry scars for a lifetime. \nSome are very visible scars and some not visible. They are struggling \nwith lives, facing blindness, burns and amputations, traumatic brain \ninjuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder. I visit these veterans \nhospitals and see those veterans of past wars who are still paying the \nprice today, alive--maybe barely alive--but paying the price for their \nservice.\n  I hope beyond the resolutions we will have the resolve to make sure \nwe keep our word to these veterans, that when they come home they will \nreceive the best medical care, they will receive our help to continue \ntheir lives, to go to school or to own a home. When I read about the \npercentages--half the homeless people in America are veterans--when I \nread that the unemployment rate among returning veterans is so high, it \nis a grim reminder that those who have given the most often receive the \nleast when they come home.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope I can add my name, \nalong with many others, as a cosponsor of this resolution and thank him \nfor his leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier, when I was speaking to Senator \nKennedy's resolution, I made reference to a New York Times article. It \nis an article from Tuesday, March 25. It tells in a very graphic way \nthe correspondence of fallen soldiers and the circumstances they faced \nin Iraq before they died. As I mentioned before, I read this article in \nits entirety and was moved by it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this New York \nTimes article so my colleagues and others have an opportunity to read \nit as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 25, 2008]\n\n               Six of the Fallen, in Words They Sent Home\n\n\n  From Latest 1,000, Words by E-Mail, and in Journals to Those at Home\n\n               [By Lizette Alvarez and Andrew W. Lehren]\n\n       By the time Specialist Jerry Ryen King decided to write \n     about his experiences in Iraq, the teenage paratrooper had \n     more to share than most other soldiers.\n       In two operations to clear the outskirts of the village of \n     Turki in the deadly Diyala Province, Specialist King and the \n     rest of the Fifth Squadron faced days of firefights, grenade \n     attacks and land mines. Well-trained insurgents had burrowed \n     deep into muddy canals, a throwback to the trenches of World \n     War I. As the fighting wore on, B-1 bombers and F-16s were \n     called in to drop a series of powerful bombs.\n       Once the area was clear of insurgents, the squadron, part \n     of the 82nd Airborne Division, uncovered hidden caches of \n     weapons.\n       Two months later, Specialist King, a handsome former honors \n     student and double-sport athlete from Georgia, sat down at \n     this computer. In informal but powerful prose, he began a \n     journal.\n\n       After 232 long, desolate, morose, but somewhat days of \n     tranquility into deployment, I've decided that I should start \n     writing some of the things I experienced here in Iraq. I have \n     to say that the events that I have encountered here have \n     changed my outlook on life . . .\n       The most recent mission started out as a 24-36 hour air-\n     assault sniper mission in a known al-Qaida stronghold just \n     north of Baghdad. We landed a few hours before daybreak and \n     as soon as I got off the helicopter my night vision broke, I \n     was surrounded by the sound of artillery rounds, people \n     screaming in Arabic, automatic weapons, and the terrain \n     didn't look anything like what we\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n     were briefed. I knew it was going to be a bad day and a half.\n                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,\n     March 7, 2007\n                                  ____\n\n       A month later, Special King was sitting inside his combat \n     outpost, an abandoned school in Sadah, when suicide bombers \n     exploded two dump trucks just outside the building. The \n     school partly collapsed, killing Specialist King on April 23, \n     2007, along with eight other soldiers, and making the blast \n     one of the most lethal for Americans fighting in Iraq.\n       In that instant, Specialist King became one of 4,000 \n     service members and Defense Department civilians to die in \n     the Iraq war--a milestone that was reached late Sunday, five \n     years since the war began in March 2003. The last four \n     members of that group, like the majority of the most recent \n     1,000 to die, were killed by an improvised explosive device, \n     known as a I.E.D. They died at 10 p.m. Sunday on a patrol in \n     Bagdad, military officials said; their names have not yet \n     been released.\n\n       The next day we cleared an area that made me feel as if I \n     were in Vietnam. Honestly, it was one of the scariest times \n     of my life. At one point I was in water up to my waist and \n     heard an AK fire in my direction. But all in all the day was \n     going pretty good, no one was hurt, I got to shoot a few \n     rounds, toss a grenade, and we were walking to where the \n     helicopter was supposed to pick us up.\n                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,\n     March 7, 2007\n                                  ____\n\n       The year 2007 would prove to be especially hard on American \n     service members; more of them died last year than in any \n     other since the war began. Many of those deaths came in the \n     midst of the 30,000-troop buildup known as ``the surge,'' the \n     linchpin of President Bush's strategy to tamp down widespread \n     violence between Islamic Sunnis and Shiites, much of it in \n     Baghdad. In April, May and June alone, 331 American service \n     members died, making it the war's deadliest three-month \n     period.\n       But by fall, the strategy, bolstered by new alliances with \n     Sunni tribal chiefs and a decision by the Shiite cleric \n     Moktada al-Sadr to order his militia to stop fighting, \n     appeared to be paying off as the country entered a period of \n     relative calm. Military casualties and Iraqi civilian deaths \n     fell, and the October-December period produced the fewest \n     casualties of any three months of the war. The past month, \n     though, has seen an uptick in killings and explosions, \n     particularly suicide bombings. The violence has traveled \n     north to Mosul, where the group calling itself Al Qaeda in \n     Mesopotamia remains strong.\n\n       Everything changed in a matter of 15 minutes . . . About \n     the time I was opening my MRE (meal ready to eat) I heard an \n     explosion. Everyone started running towards the sound of the \n     explosion. Apparently a suicide bomber had blown himself up \n     killing four soldiers from my squadron and injuring another. \n     Our 36 hour mission turned into another air-assault into a \n     totally different city, the clearing of it, and 5 more days. \n     We did find over 100 RPG's, IED making materials, insurgents \n     implacing IED's, artillery rounds, a sniper rifle, and sort \n     of like a terrorist training book and cd's.\n                                   Jerry Ryen King, Journal Entry,\n     March 7, 2007.\n                                  ____\n\n       Unlike the soldiers of some previous wars, who were only \n     occasionally able to send letters back home to loved ones, \n     many of those who died left behind an extraordinary \n     electronic testimony describing in detail the labor, the \n     fears and the banality of serving in Iraq.\n       In excerpts published here from journals, blogs and e-mail, \n     six soldiers who died in the most recent group of 1,000 \n     mostly skim the alarming particulars of combat, a kindness \n     shown their relatives and close friends. Instead, they plunge \n     readily into the mundane, but no less important rhythms of \n     home. They fire off comments about holiday celebrations, \n     impending weddings, credit card bills, school antics and the \n     creeping anxiety of family members who are coping with one \n     deployment too many.\n       At other moments, the service members describe the humor of \n     daily life down range, as they call it. Hurriedly, with \n     little time to worry about spelling or grammar, they riff on \n     the chaos around them and reveal moments of fear. As \n     casualties climb and the violence intensifies, so does their \n     urge to share their grief and foreboding.\n\n\n                             A Last Goodbye\n\n       Hey beautiful well we were on blackout again, we lost yet \n     some more soldiers.

Juan Campos, 27, flew from Baghdad to Texas \n     for two weeks last year, there was more on his mind than rest \n     and relaxation. He visited his father's grave, which he had \n     never seen. He spent time with his grandparents and touched \n     base with the rest of his rambling, extended family.\n       The day he was scheduled to return to war, Sergeant Campos \n     and his wife went out dancing and drinking all evening with \n     friends. Calm and reserved by nature, Sergeant Campos could \n     out-salsa and out-hip-hop most anyone on the dance floor. At \n     the airport, his wife, Jamie Campos, who had grown used to \n     the upheaval of deployment, surprised herself.\n       ``I cried and I have never ever cried before,'' said Mrs. \n     Campos, 26, who has a 9-year-old son, Andre. ``It was just \n     really really weird. He knew, and I kind of knew. It felt \n     different.''\n       We both felt that it was the last goodbye,'' she said.\n\n     Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2006\n       Mood: gloomy\n       The life of an infantryman is never safe . . . how do I \n     know, well I live it every day.\n       I lost a good friend of mine just two days ago to an enemy \n     sniper. The worst feeling in the world is having lost one of \n     your own and not being able to fight back. The more I go on \n     patrol, the more alert I tend to be, but regardless of the \n     situation here in Iraq is that we are never safe. No matter \n     the countermeasures we take to prevent any attacks. They seem \n     to seep through the cracks. Every day a soldier is lost or \n     wounded by enemy attacks. I for one would like to make it \n     home to my family one day. Pray for us and keep us in your \n     thoughts . . . for an infantryman's life is never safe.\n     Juan Campos, Myspace Blog\n                                  ____\n\n       Sergeant Campos, a member of the First Battalion, 26th \n     Infantry, Charlie Company out of Germany, was one of \n     thousands of infantrymen assigned to stabilize Baghdad and \n     the surrounding areas last year during the troop buildup. \n     Troops were sent deep into insurgent neighborhoods, where \n     they lived in small outposts, patrolled on foot, cleared \n     houses, mingled with Iraqis and rebuilt the infrastructure.\n       The extra 30,000 service members--160,000 in all--were \n     deployed to Iraq to help quell the runaway violence that \n     threatened large-scale civil war. Most soldiers spent 15 \n     months in Iraq, a length of time that military commanders \n     have said is unsustainable. Many had fought in the war at \n     least once. A few had been in Iraq multiple times.\n\n       My only goals are to make it out of this place alive and \n     return you guys and make you as happy as I can.\n            Juan Campos, E-Mail Message to his Wife, Dec. 15, 2006\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       But to Sergeant Campos and the rest of Charlie Company in \n     Adhamiya, a north Baghdad stronghold for Sunni insurgents, \n     the buildup seemed oddly invisible. The men patrolled almost \n     every day, sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day for months, often \n     in 120-degree weather. Exhaustion was too kind a word for \n     their fatigue.\n       More than 150 soldiers lived in a two-story house with \n     portable toilets, no air-conditioning and temperamental \n     showers. Sleep came only a few hours at a time. The fighting \n     was vicious. Adhamiya was such a magnet for sectarian \n     bloodletting that the military built a wall around it to \n     contain the violence.\n       ``They walled us in and left us there,'' Staff Sgt. Robin \n     Johnson, 28, said of the 110 men in Charlie Company. ``We \n     were a family. I would die for these guys before I die for my \n     own blood brother.''\n       On patrol, sniper fire rang out so routinely that soldiers \n     in Sergeant Campos's platoon seldom stood still for more than \n     four seconds. They scoured rooftops for Iraqi children who \n     lobbed grenades at American soldiers for a handful of cash. \n     Roadside bombs burst from inside drainage pipes, impossible \n     to detect from the street. The bombs grew larger by the \n     month.\n       Last year, these powerful improvised explosive devices were \n     responsible for a majority of American fatalities, a new \n     milestone. The bombs also killed multiple soldiers more often \n     than in the past, a testament to their potency.\n       ``It was the most horrible thing you could possibly \n     imagine,'' Sergeant Johnson said. ``As soon as you left the \n     gate, you could die at any second. If you went out for a day \n     and you weren't attacked, it was confusing.''\n       Charlie Company soldiers found a steady stream of Iraqis \n     killed by insurgents for\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n     money or revenge. Some had their faces wiped clean by acid. \n     Others were missing their heads or limbs.\n\n\n                       ``It Could Have Been Me''\n\n     To tell the story of iraq is a hard one.\n                                           Ryan Wood, Myspace Blog\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Sgt.

Workers today who are going to fill up their car's gas tank \nare paying $3.20 for a gallon of gas in the State of Vermont, and there \nis a fear that may go higher. People are paying higher and higher \nprices for food. Since President Bush has been President, some 8 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance, health care costs \nare soaring, and a college education is unaffordable. In the meantime, \nwages, the real median family income for the average American family is \ngoing down, and the gap between the very rich and everybody else is \ngetting wider. So we have some very serious problems. Among other \naspects of that crisis is that the personal savings rate today is below \nzero, which, up until 2005, hasn't happened since the Great Depression. \nSo what is happening is that people are working longer and longer \nhours, their wages are going down, we are losing good-paying jobs, and \nthey do not have enough money to survive on so they are borrowing more \nand more money. That is the reality.\n  There is a lot, to my mind, that we have to consider as a country to \nbegin addressing the fact that poverty is going up, the middle class is \ndeclining, and the gap between the rich and everybody else is growing \nwider. There is a lot we have to do. But as we now focus on the \nmortgage crisis, we have to take a hard look at interest rates in this \ncountry. I intend to offer an amendment to the housing bill that I want \nto say a few words on now and I will speak to at greater length later.\n  My amendment will clearly not solve all of the problems facing the \nmiddle class, but it will do one very important thing: It will take one \naction that is long overdue, and that is it would stop big banks, \ncredit card companies, payday lenders, mortgage bankers, and other \nlenders from ripping off American consumers by charging outrageous \ninterest rates.\n  I do a national radio show every Friday afternoon where people call \nin. And you know what they say? They say: We are sick and tired of \npaying 20, 25, 30 percent interest rates when, in fact, we pay our debt \non time every single month. That is what they are saying. People who \nare borrowing money to send their kids to college are \npaying outrageously high rates, and certainly we know, given the crisis \nwe are debating today, that mortgage interest rates are off the charts.\n\n  With this amendment I will be offering, it would cap all interest \nrates at 8 percent above what the IRS charges income tax deadbeats. \nThat is the formula we are using. Currently, the IRS charges a 6-\npercent interest rate to Americans who are late on paying their income \ntax returns. That is what we are doing today. The IRS adjusts these \nrates every quarter based on the Federal funds rate. If the Federal \nfunds rate rises, the interest rate the IRS charges late filers goes \nup. If the Federal funds rate goes down, so does the interest rate the \nIRS charges late filers.\n  If the amendment I am offering were signed into law today, all \ninterest rates in this country would be capped at 14 percent, including \nsubprime mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, payday loans, and income \ntax refund anticipation loans. Why 14 percent? Why do we pick that \nnumber? It is an interesting point. I am glad you asked that question, \nMr. President, and here is the answer. Because 14 percent happens to be \nthe same level that former Senator Al D'Amato chose when he offered an \namendment in 1991 to cap credit card interest rates. Al D'Amato, \nSenator from New York, offered that amendment.\n  Do you know what the vote was on that bipartisan amendment, offered \nby the Republican Senator from New York? That amendment passed the \nSenate by a vote of 74 to 19--74 to 19--a huge bipartisan vote. And \namong those Members who are today in the Senate, and who cosponsored \nthat amendment, were Senators Specter, Lieberman, and Domenici, among \nothers. Unfortunately, that amendment ended up not being signed into \nlaw.\n  Like my amendment, the D'Amato amendment was also pegged slightly \nabove the interest rates for late income tax filers. I have the feeling \nthat in my career in the Senate I will not often be quoting former \nSenator D'Amato, probably won't be doing that, but let me quote what \nSenator D'Amato said on the Senate floor in 1991. This is what he said.\n\n       Fourteen percent is certainly a reasonable rate of interest \n     for banks to charge customers for credit card debt. It allows \n     a comfortable profit margin, but keeps banks in line so that \n     interest rates rise and fall with the health of the economy.\n\n  He was then the chairman of the Banking Committee.\n  I say to my colleagues that if the Senate in 1991 thought that \ninterest rates should be capped, trust me, we should at least do as \nmuch today, because the problem is in fact much more severe.\n  A recent report, published by Tamara Draut, the Director of the \nEconomic Opportunity Program at Demos, found\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nthat one-third of all credit card holders in this country are paying \ninterest rates above 20 percent and as high as 41 percent--more than \ndouble what they paid in interest rates in 1990. In other words, if we \nhad a problem then, the problem today is much more severe.\n  Between 1989 and 2006, Americans' overall credit card debt grew by \n315 percent from $211 billion to $876 billion. One-third of low- and \nmiddle-income families reported going into credit card debt to pay for \nrent, utilities, and food in 2006.\n  Now, I don't know about Nebraska, but I will tell you that in the \nState of Vermont there are a lot of people who are buying their food \nwith credit cards. They do not have the cash. They have to go in debt \nto buy food and pay for other basic necessities. All of this--high \ninterest rates--has resulted in credit card companies earning $90.1 \nbillion in interest in 2006 alone--credit card companies ripping off \nthe American people and earning huge profits.\n  But credit card companies aren't the only ones charging outrageous \ninterest rates, and that is why my amendment expands on the D'Amato \namendment to cover all forms of loans. For example, the Center for \nResponsible Lending has found that some American consumers are paying \ninterest rates for payday loans as high as 800 percent. And if you want \nto know why these outrageous levels of interest on credit cards and \npayday loans are relevant to the debate on foreclosure, let me quote \nfrom two articles on the subject. The first is a recent Reuters article \nentitled ``Pay Day Loans Exacerbate Housing Crisis.'' According to this \narticle:\n\n       As hundreds of thousands of American homeowners fall behind \n     on their mortgage payments, more people are turning to short-\n     term loans with sky-high interest rates just to get by. While \n     figures are hard to come by, evidence from nonprofit credit \n     and mortgage counselors suggests that the number of people \n     using these so-called ``pay day loans'' is growing as the \n     U.S. housing crisis deepens, a negative sign for economic \n     recovery.\n\n  The second article is from a recent front-page story from USA Today. \nThe title of the article says it all. ``Facing losses on bad loans, \nbanks boost credit card rates.'' According to the article:\n\n       Even as the Federal Reserve has aggressively slashed short-\n     term interest rates, banks are raising rates on credit cards.\n\n  Federal Reserve lowering; banks increasing. This should not happen. \nWhen the Federal Reserve has slashed the Federal funds rate five times, \nfrom a high of 5.25 percent down to 2.25 percent, credit card interest \nrates should be going down, not up. Interest rates for payday loans \nshould be going down, not up. Mortgage interest rates should be going \ndown, not up.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator can suspend for just a second?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Please \nproceed.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Unfortunately, in many cases interest rates for \nconsumers are going up at the worst possible time. One of the reasons \nfor this is the virtual lack of regulation when it comes to interest \nrates. For example, credit card companies are able to raise interest \nrates at any time for any reason, and recently that is exactly what, \nfor example, the Bank of America has done. According to a recent \nBusiness Week article:\n\n       Bank of America sent letters notifying some responsible \n     card holders that it would more than double their rates to as \n     high as 28 percent, without giving an explanation for the \n     increase. Fine print at the end of the letter advised calling \n     a 800 number for the reason, but consumers who called said \n     they were unable to get a clear answer. What is striking is \n     how arbitrary the Bank of America rate increases appear, \n     credit industry experts say.\n\n  This is unacceptable. Lenders should not be able to raise interest \nrates at any time for any reason.\n  There are Biblical references to what can be described as usury; that \nwhen people are down and in need of money, there is a strong moral \nobjection to charging them sky-high interest rates.\n  In the ``Divine Comedy'' by Dante, there is reserved a special place \nfor people who charge usurious interest rates, the inner ring of the \nSeventh Circle of Hell.\n  I don't wish this on the credit card companies or the mortgage \nlenders, but this is what I do say. In this country today, especially \nas interest rates go down from the Fed, it is an outrage that millions \nof our fellow Americans are paying 25 percent or 30 percent interest \nrates, and our amendment would begin to address this issue. The time is \nlong overdue for us to move in that direction. I ask at the appropriate \ntime for the support of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2401-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING THE SACRIFICE OF MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES WHO \n                HAVE BEEN KILLED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are in a situation that is hard for me \nto comprehend, but that is where we are. We have an amendment pending, \nthe Durbin amendment, and we cannot get a vote. That is unfortunate.\n  We have been told by the minority they want a 60-vote threshold. I \ncannot understand--there are a lot of people who have been in the \nSenate a lot longer than I have. But I do not know where we came up \nwith a 60-vote deal.\n  We should legislate. If someone on the minority side would offer a \nmotion to table and that motion fails, they still are protected with \nthe 60-vote margin. I do not understand why we cannot move forward on \nthis legislation. It appears we cannot. It appears we cannot.\n  It appears we have legislated our hearts out to try to arrive at a \nbipartisan arrangement. Let's go back and start at the beginning.\n  Madam President, we offered a Democratic package. In good faith, \nSenators Dodd and Shelby, along with the Finance Committee chair and \nranking member, came with a package for us. If you look at it, the only \nthing taken out of the Democratic package was the bankruptcy amendment. \nMany other provisions were changed drastically, but that was the only \none that was taken out.\n  Senator Durbin has offered to send it to the bill. During the \nnegotiations, Senators Dodd and Shelby knew we on this side of the \naisle wanted that bankruptcy amendment in the bill, so the minority \nwould have to take it out. But negotiating in good faith, and \nrecognizing that a legislator is someone who needs to be able to \ncompromise, in the presence of Senator Dodd we agreed to take that \nprovision out.\n  That is where we are. We are not going to agree to a 60-vote margin. \nIt is unfair. It is unfair that every time someone thinks they may \nlose, they want a 60-vote margin. I do not comprehend that. It has not \nbeen that way until the recent minority came into power, or lack of \npower, whatever the case may be.\n  Today about 8,000 people will be told: You are out of your home \nforever. Someone else owns your home. Foreclosure is over with--Friday, \ntomorrow, another 8,000 people. Because of our inaction today and \ntomorrow, that is 16,000 people. Fortunately, foreclosure finalizations \ndo not occur on weekends. That is standard law around the country. So \nwe come back Monday. It is a nonvote day that has been scheduled for \nseveral months. That will be another 8,000 people. Now we are up to \n24,000 people and their families. I don't know how many it would add up \nto, but their families are out. So if on some phantom matter of \nprinciple the Republicans are going to say: You are going to have to \nget 60 votes on this, then I guess we will not have a bill. I ask my \nfriends who have been in the Senate much longer than I why we have to \ndo that.\n  I think we are in an impossible situation. I admire, I have said many \ntimes, the good work done by Senators Dodd and Shelby. I have also said \nthe substitute amendment that is before us is far from being perfect. I \nhave had members of my own party say: Why did you give up on that or \nwhy did you add that? For example, Senator Shelby, why did we raise the \ndownpayment to 3.5 percent? It was a compromise. The House wanted 1 \npercent. People over here wanted 6 percent. We compromised. The whole \nsubstitute before us is a compromise. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise. I would be satisfied if we walked out of this Chamber today \nwith just the substitute amendment as having been agreed upon.\n  Some think we have done too much for certain segments of society and \nwe haven't done enough, on my side, for the middle class. ``Other \nside'' people think we have done far too much, that we should back off. \nGovernment is involved in this too much.\n\n  I repeat, that is what legislation is all about. It is compromising. \nThe American people are waiting for us to act. Someone please explain \nto me, I say to my friend, the Republican leader, why do we need to \nhave 60 votes on every amendment that comes along? We have another \namendment sponsored by Senators Feinstein and Martinez. There are some \npeople who are concerned about that. They don't like it. It is a \nlicensing provision. All kinds of special interest groups have weighed \nin on this. Should we have 60 votes on that? Senator Schumer has been \nsomewhat aggrieved at both me and Senator Dodd because of a provision \nin here for counseling that is not $500 million. It is $100 million.\n  It was a compromise. Our bill had $200 million. Senator Schumer \nwanted $500 million. But do we need to have 60 votes on that? If that \nis the case, we would not get 60 votes on anything.\n  There may be a point that there are so many amendments offered that I \nwould consult with the Republican leader and say: Well, maybe we need \nto file cloture on this bill. We have been here since 9:30 this morning \non this bill, and we have not had a single vote.\n  Again, through the Chair, I ask the distinguished Republican leader, \nwhy can't we move forward and try to dispose of, affirmatively or \nnegatively, the Durbin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with all due respect to my good \nfriend the majority leader, this is somewhat of a manufactured \ncontroversy. Where are we? We have an underlying bill, negotiated on a \nbipartisan basis by Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd. Then we have, with \nall due respect to our friends on the other side, an expression of \nincredulity that 60 votes might be required for something in the \nSenate.\n  Let me quote my good friend the majority leader who said last year:\n\n       In the Senate, it has always been the case you need 60 \n     votes. I don't have 60 votes.\n\n  Senator Reid said in January of last year:\n\n       Sixty votes are required for just about everything. We may \n     have to come up with a number of resolutions that require 60 \n     votes.\n\n  My point is--I say this with the greatest respect and admiration for \nmy counterpart--acting like this is unusual is--well, it is clearly not \nthe case.\n  Why would Members on my side want to subject this proposal to a 60-\nvote threshold? It is the most controversial provision in the bill. It \nis the principal reason my side was unwilling to go to the bill as \npreviously crafted. So why would anyone feel aggrieved that the most \ncontroversial part of the bill, the issue which needed to come out in \norder to craft a bipartisan beginning, which Senators Dodd and Shelby \ndid, why would anybody be incredulous that 60 votes would be required \nfor this? That is routine in the Senate. It is also frustrating to the \nmajority. I was in the majority recently. But that is the way it is. To \nact like it is somehow unusual strikes me as somewhat odd.\n  I would be happy to propose a unanimous consent request now, if the \nmajority leader would like me to, that we have a vote on this amendment \nin the very near future at a 60-vote threshold. It is quite routine and \ncommon in the Senate. It would allow us to dispose of the Durbin \namendment and move on to completion of the bill in the near future, \nsomething most of my Members would like to do. I assume, based on what \nmy good friend said, that he would object to that, so I would not \npropose it, but I would be happy to. It would allow us to do what I \nthink he wants to do, which is to go on and vote on the Durbin \namendment and move ahead with amendments on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I apologize. I was interrupted. Did the \nSenator make a suggestion? What was that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I did not make a consent request. But I said I would \nbe happy, if you would like me to, that we vote on the Durbin amendment \nshortly with a 60-vote threshold, which is pretty common around here on \nall matters of controversy. I was pointing out that this Durbin \namendment is the most controversial part of the bill. Both sides knew \nthat. I don't know why we don't have a vote at 60 like we do on \nvirtually everything of controversy in the Senate. Then dispose of the \nDurbin amendment and move on.\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I had the good fortune in 1982 to be \nelected to the House of Representatives, one of the biggest thrills of \nmy life. As a result of that, I have made some very good friends. One \nof the people who came in that class of 1982 was Richard Durbin of \nIllinois.\n  What everybody here witnessed was an act of unselfishness. Senator \nDurbin procedurally moved to table his own amendment. That is unheard \nof in the Senate. He did that in an effort to move this along. He knew \nwhere the votes were. I want the Record to be spread with the fact that \nthis is a fine legislator, a good human being. The people of Illinois \nare so fortunate to have this man who cares so much about people. In \nfront of all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, I express my \nappreciation to Dick Durbin for doing something that is unheard of \nhere, something very unselfish, for which he gets no credit.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I served in the House of Representatives \nwith the Senator from Illinois as well. This isn't the first time he \nhas done something unheard of. I was in the minority in the House of \nRepresentatives and on a particular vote--I don't know how many were on \nthe floor, but probably about a dozen altogether--Dick Durbin was in \nthe chair as Presiding Officer. He called the vote--a voice vote. It \nwas supposed to be ``the ayes have it,'' but there were a bunch of \nRepublicans on the floor and, in full-throated voice, we said ``no.'' I \nthink one timid soul said ``aye.'' The Presiding Officer said: ``The \nnos appear to have it, the nos do have it.'' He called the vote, but \nnot the way his side of the aisle wanted it called. Of course, about 10 \nminutes later, the appropriate number of people were on the floor and \nthe vote was reversed. So this is not the first time the Senator from \nIllinois has done something unusual and in a way to move the process \nalong and be fair in it. I always have appreciated that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized--the \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, may I inquire about the order of \namendments that will be offered? Is there an order?\n  Mr. DODD. May I ask the Senator from Ohio to yield without giving up \nhis right to the floor?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Shelby will be coming over shortly. A lot of \nMembers have amendments they want to offer. We wish to obviously \naccommodate as many people as we can. I don't know what the leader's \nintentions are for this evening, but we will try to accommodate people \nand go back and forth in the normal process. We will be here while \nSenator Voinovich is offering his amendment. I know Senator Schumer is \nnext in line. We will have to sit down and work out an order after \nthat.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, reserving the right to object--\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I will try to accommodate \neverybody.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. My suggestion is that we get an order now.\n  Mr. DODD. I am going to try to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4406 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I send amendment No. 4406 to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Smith, Ms. \n     Cantwell, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4406.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Madam President, along with my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow, we have worked to craft an amendment to \nhelp struggling companies and their employees during this time of \neconomic downturn. The two of us have been joined by a bipartisan group \nof cosponsors, including Senators Hatch, Smith, Vitter, Levin, \nCantwell, and Rockefeller.\n  Without a job and financial security, it is extremely difficult to \nkeep paying your mortgage and keep your home out of foreclosure. A job \nis the first step in ensuring that Americans can achieve the dream of \nhome ownership.\n  My hometown of Cleveland is the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, \nand with Ohio ranked No. 1 in foreclosures nationwide, according to the \nMortgage Bankers Association, addressing this issue is of critical \nimportance to me and all of my constituents in the great State of Ohio. \nThe reason Ohio is experiencing a foreclosure crisis has nothing to do \nwith speculators. It has to do with a bubble of rapidly rising prices. \nOhio has a foreclosure crisis despite the fact that house prices never \ndid increase there as they did in other parts of the country. Ohio \nfamilies have been losing their homes because Ohio manufacturing \nworkers have been losing their jobs.\n  It is the same story next door in Michigan. Our amendment is one step \nin the plan to turn things around for workers in these and other \nmanufacturing States so families have the income to stay in their \nhomes.\n  Our amendment will help unprofitable companies--many of which are in \nOhio--to use existing AMT and R credits in 2008 to stimulate their \nbusinesses, turn profits, and create new jobs. The amendment would \nallow companies operating in the red to use the AMT and R credits \nalready on their books instead of bonus depreciation deductions, as \nlong as the money is used to expand operations in the United States.\n  Bonus depreciation has already been included in the economic stimulus \npackage, but it left out companies that don't have income against which \nto deduct their expenses because they are not making any money. This is \nan important thing. Ironically, these are the companies that are most \nin need of relief during a strained economy, but they are not receiving \nit.\n  My colleagues should also note that this amendment is fiscally \nresponsible because it simply allows for the speedier use of tax \ncredits that would be used anyway in the future. In other words--and I \nwasn't aware of this--companies that are not making money pay an AMT \ncorporate tax, and what happens is when they do start making money, \nthey deduct the corporate AMT from the taxes, so in effect they get \ncredit for that corporate AMT. We are basically saying let's let those \ncompanies--because they cannot use the bonus depreciation--use that AMT \ncredit so they can create jobs and keep people working. So this \nbasically lets them use these credits speedier than they would \nordinarily be used if we waited over a longer period of time.\n  I want everybody to know we will continue to work with the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to get a fiscally responsible revenue estimate. \nWe have every reason to believe it is going to be very small during \nthis 10-year period. As a matter of fact, if you take into \nconsideration that these companies, down the road, would use the R or \ntheir corporate AMT, it could end up being a wash.\n  This bipartisan amendment has wide-ranging support from the biotech \nindustry, to the American auto industry, to the coal industry. All of \nthese industries are hurting and need a boost to get back on track. \nThis amendment would give them that boost to make investments now and \ncreate jobs so Americans can keep their homes. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and work to protect their constituents' jobs and \nhomes.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan, whom I appreciate \njoining me on this amendment. It is something the two of us have been \nworking on for quite some time. I am glad we have a bipartisan group \nthat understands how important it is to our respective States and to \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I first give thanks to my colleague \nand friend from Ohio. We have been working together on this issue. \nMichigan and Ohio are part of the epicenter as we have seen the \ndownturn in the economy since 2000. We have seen 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs--middle-class jobs that created the standard of \nliving in this country--that have been lost.\n  This amendment addresses those companies that have done the right \nthing, that have paid good wages, provided health insurance, provided \npensions, that now find themselves in a challenging time but that we \nwant to continue to support so they can continue to keep great American \njobs in this country.\n  I am so pleased we are joined by others in a truly bipartisan effort. \nWe have four Democrats and four Republicans cosponsoring the amendment. \nWe have Senators Hatch, Rockefeller, Cantwell, Vitter, Levin, and Smith \ncoming together from all parts of the country, representing important \nAmerican industries that are asking to be recognized and to basically \nallow them to use the AMT and R credits they have already \naccumulated. They have made investments and we want them to make more, \nand we want to create a mechanism that allows them to benefit from the \nmechanisms we are putting into place to support industries that need \nassistance in this difficult time and need to be ready to come out of \nthis economic downturn as quickly as possible.\n\n  There is no question that we are in a housing and economic crisis in \nAmerica. Few States have been hurt worse than Michigan and Ohio. In \nMichigan alone, right now, we rank No. 6 in the number of foreclosures. \nLast year, 87,000 households were foreclosed upon; 87,000 families \nfaced the loss of their homes and their piece of the American dream.\n  Last year, Michigan lost 62,000 good-paying jobs. Unfortunately, we \nare not alone. In February, the manufacturing sector lost 52,000 jobs. \nOver the last 7 years, manufacturing has lost more than 3.6 million \njobs. Again, these are middle-class jobs and these companies have \nstepped forward to do the right thing and pay health care, pensions, \nand provide a standard of living that has been unsurpassed in the \nworld.\n  Yet the Labor Department announced that the number of new people \nsigning up for unemployment benefits last week shot up to the highest \nlevels in more than 2 years, from a seasonal adjusted 38,000 people to \n407,000 people.\n  In Michigan alone, right now, our unemployment rate is 7.2 percent. \nAmerican families are in a state of crisis. They are losing their \nhomes, their jobs and, of course, we cannot ignore this situation. We \nneed to do everything possible to be able to support families, workers, \nand businesses that are being affected.\n  The Voinovich-Stabenow amendment would help save many of these \nimportant middle-class jobs and keep families out of foreclosure. From \nmanufacturing States such as Michigan, families are not losing their \nhomes because of a housing bubble, they are losing their homes because \nthey lost their jobs, their livelihood. They have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits and they have spent all of their savings, \nprobably dipped into the equity in their houses, and they cannot afford \nto pay the mortgages anymore. This is a daily reality for the families \nI represent in Michigan.\n  The bonus depreciation provision we passed in the stimulus package \nearlier this year gave manufacturers a strong incentive to increase \ntheir capital investments in an effort to stimulate the economy. \nUnfortunately, that did nothing for manufacturers that are struggling \nthe most right now, the ones that are not profitable, that are being \nforced to shut down plants and lay off workers.\n  Our amendment would also give these struggling manufacturers an \nincentive to be here in America and invest in American jobs. By \nutilizing the AMT and R credit provision, manufacturers in this loss \nposition that have built up AMT and research and development tax \ncredits will now be able to use their credits, stimulate the economy, \nand create new jobs. These manufacturers will be able to recover their \naccumulated credits--in other words, they have invested and developed \ncredits. They just cannot use them because they are currently not \nmaking a profit. This will allow them to recover those credits after \nthey have made new investments, which will help them to fully realize \nthe intended benefits of the bonus depreciation provision and put them \non equal ground with profitable companies.\n  This amendment will not only allow these manufacturers to stay afloat \nin this time of economic uncertainty, but will help them invest, \nexpand, and create more American jobs. It will allow them to avoid \nlaying off more workers, many of whom are the most vulnerable when it \ncomes to the issue of foreclosure, losing their home.\n  Adopting this amendment is an important first step in addressing the \ncrisis facing our Nation. It cannot wait for another day. We would very \nmuch appreciate strong bipartisan support for this amendment that is a \nvery important piece of addressing what is happening to so many \nmillions of American families across this country.\n  I urge colleagues to join us in this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I hope the tabling motion that the Senate \nhas dealt with has broken the logjam and we can move to the amendments, \nsuch as the one we are now on, and work our way through the evening. \nThe reason I say that is because there are a good many of us, well over \na month ago, who said if you want to fix the economic trouble in our \ncountry today, solve the housing crisis.\n  I did not agree with the stimulus package we debated a month ago. I \ndid not agree with borrowing $150 billion and standing on street \ncorners and handing out $500 bills. That helps someone, but it does not \nhelp the economy in general because that money has not been handed out \nyet.\n  What we do today, and if it were to become law in a reasonable period \nof time, would deal with one of the bigger industries in our country. I \nthink few people, unless you look at it, recognize the value of the \nhousing industry to our country, its breadth and its depth.\n  One of the things I monitor in Idaho, and I know my colleague from \nMontana, who is on the floor, monitors as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is mill closures; that is, sawmill closures, across the \nUnited States since the first of the year because the timber industry \nis flat. It is at a 40-year low in prices of dimensional lumber.\n  Why is it? Because the housing industry is flat. Talk to plumbing \nfixture manufacturers and everybody else out there and look at the \nbreadth and the depth of the housing economy.\n  So it is time we deal with the real problem. Had we dealt with it a \nmonth ago, possibly the House would have been done with it, it could \nhave been signed into law, and, more importantly, it would be \nrecognized in the marketplace today as a reality and the marketplace \nwould be adjusting. That is the banking industry, that is the mortgage \nindustry, that is the housing industry.\n  There are real problems out there, and they are very real problems if \nyou are involved in it. If you have been conned into a subprime loan \nand it sounded so good at the time you took it and it turned south on \nyou and your values drop, that is one thing and you are out on the \nstreet or you simply walked because you used the ``credit card'' \neconomy of the subprime market to buy a house.\n  If I am across the street from you and you have left your house and \nthe bank now has it and they knock it down 20 percent in the market, \nwhat does that do to the value of your home? You may be in better \nshape. You may have a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage. You may not be \nlosing your job or you may not be in a subprime market, but your house \nwent down 20 percent because the house across the street that is \ncomparable went down 20 percent.\n  That is the reality of the world in which we are playing, and that is \nwhy I was so extremely pleased when Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby \ncame to grips with this issue in a very real, honest, brokered bill in \na bipartisan way and have brought to the floor the bill before us. I \nhope the House will respond quickly, and we can get this to the \nPresident and it actually can become law in our timeframe so the \nmarkets can begin to react.\n  Back at the time we were debating the $150 billion bailout, I and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\nIsakson and others said: Wait a moment, that is all well pleasing and \nit may be politically correct for the time and the White House and the \nmajority party in the Congress may agree with it, but when will it get \nto the ground and how much will it stimulate?\n  I had a lot of people in Idaho say: Larry, we are not going to buy \nanything; we are going to pay off the credit card debt; in other words, \nwe are not going to move the money through the market in a way to \nstimulate the economy, we are simply going to put it in savings or pay \noff a debt. We are not going to go out and buy a new Chinese or \nJapanese television set or anything in the market that was not produced \nin our market that is oftentimes the kind of consumer product that kind \nof money buys today.\n  So Senator Isakson and I said we ought to go back and look at history \nand what worked. In the seventies, we had a housing bubble, and it \nbroke. The housing industry said we have a 3-year inventory. At that \ntime--and I was not here; some who serve today were here--they put a \ntax credit out there, and they said: If you are going to be an owner \noccupant and you are going to buy out of inventory or repo or \nbankruptcy, you get the credit. What was supposedly a 3-year glut in \nthe market of housing inventory turned into a 12- to 15-month glut, and \nthe lights came on in our sawmills, workers went back to work, \ncontractors went back to work, and we were able to effectively get that \neconomy stabilized.\n  In December of 2007, housing starts fell to the weakest level since \nMay of 1991. As a whole, housing starts were down 24.8 percent in 2007, \nthe second largest decline on record, and housing prices declined \nalmost 9 percent in the final quarter of 2007, the largest year-to-year \ndrop in a 20-year history of the index. That is what we were looking at \nin February and in January and saying to this Senate in a bipartisan \nway: Let's fix this problem; let's do it now; let's do it sooner rather \nthan later.\n\n  It is now later, and I wish it had been done earlier. But, most \nimportantly, the Congress has recognized it, or at least the Senate has \nrecognized it. Leaders such as Senators Dodd and Shelby have recognized \nit and they have come to an agreement. I hope we stick to that \nagreement.\n  There are amendments floating around that ought not pass, and if they \ndo pass, all of us will have to reevaluate the compromise because the \ncompromise, in large part, is a bipartisan effort to solve this \nproblem.\n  We owe it to the American people this time to get it right, this time \nto fix the underlying primary problem that is dragging the economy \ndown, threatening everyone out there in that industry, in the mortgage \nbanking industry, and we ought to get it done in a way that makes it \nwork.\n  I believed all along that a timely targeted housing stimulus bill \nwould focus on the builders and the buyers, and I think this housing \nlegislation is workable and does that.\n  Overall, I think it is a pretty good package, as I have said, and I \nwill support it as long as we do not mess it up with more partisan-like \namendments that might make their way to the final text.\n  I believe in compromises when it is necessary and appropriate and \nwhen issues are as big as this issue is, when the problem is as big as \nthis problem is, whether it is Boise, ID, or Las Vegas, NV, or San \nDiego, CA, or Seattle, WA, it is a problem that deserves to be dealt \nwith in a timely and an appropriate way.\n  Extending the carryback period for net operating losses will allow \nthese companies, these builders to receive the infusion of cash helping \nthem stay in business and pay their employees. The legislation will \nalso help the buyer, as I have mentioned. We are proposing to provide \nadditional money to tax-exempt private activity bonds authority to be \nused to refinance subprime loans which will keep families in their \nhomes and make it easier for them, the home buyers, to buy that home.\n  We are also going to allow taxpayers who do not itemize on their \nFederal taxes, which tends to be middle-class and lower income \nfamilies, to deduct property taxes from their Federal tax liability. \nFrankly, that is a good deal. That makes sense in this interim period \nof time.\n  Finally, the last tax provision in this legislation, in my opinion, \nis one of the most important provisions in the bill because it is the \nIsakson concept I listened to, helped develop, bought into very early \non several months ago as we were looking at this problem, and that is \ngiving taxpayers a $7,000 direct tax credit to buy homes that have been \nforeclosed on, payable over a 2-year period of time.\n  Foreclosed homes are a significant problem in any housing market. For \nthe reasons I explained a few moments ago, they drive down the prices \nof everybody else's values. They are oftentimes not maintained, they \nare attracted to vandalism and burglary, and they become eyesores in \ncommunities if banks and those companies that hold them are not doing \nthe due diligence to make sure the lawns are mowed and the house is \nmaintained and at least the house looks as if it is being occupied.\n  Oftentimes, if there are too many in the market, that simply does not \nhappen. This tax credit will help clear our housing inventory sitting \nin today's market. I talked about the seventies. There is no reason to \nbelieve we cannot clear the inventory in a reasonable period of time.\n  Lastly, let me once again turn to Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby and \nthank them. We are all partisan, but we are all bipartisan when we see \nbig issues that deserve a solution, that demand it, and these two \nSenators stepped up and, in my opinion, have put a very good package \ntogether. It is certainly a package I wish to support, that I hope we \ncan move in a timely and responsible way to conclude because it is, in \nmy opinion, the greatest stimulus to the biggest problem in the economy \ntoday.\n  In Idaho, a State that has experienced phenomenal growth over the \nlast good number of years, those foreclosures are beginning to develop. \nBut unlike some States, we have something else happening. We have \nsawmills going down and lights going out and hard-working men and women \nsimply not having their jobs in the housing industry because the \nhousing industry is flat.\n  This kind of legislation, when it becomes law, will work in the \nmarketplace to solve those problems and allow the markets to adjust in \na way we ought to be allowing them to do, not to step in and fix it \nwith a Federal bailout but to allow the markets to adjust, the buyers \nto adjust, and those who may have been victimized, in part, by the \nuniqueness of the loan packages of a few years ago, to make sure they \ncan be helped a bit. But more importantly, they have learned their \nlesson that there is no free ride, that you cannot buy a house with a \ncredit card, that a little savings and a little investment and a little \nfortuitousness can help you into probably one of the largest \ninvestments you will make in your lifetime and historically--and it \nwill be true tomorrow as it was true yesterday--will be the best buy \nyou have ever made in your lifetime and that is to own a home in a \ncommunity of your interest and your support.\n  I hope we can work this through the evening. I hope we can move to \nfinal passage with the quick handling of these amendments. It is \nimportant we get this work done and say to the American people: You \nsee, when there is a big problem out there, the Congress can respond in \na responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I first thank the Senator from Idaho for \nhis very generous comments about the effort. We appreciate that very \nmuch. His willingness to work with us will be of help to see if we \ncannot move this legislation along.\n  I am going to ask consent to get a batting order of amendments. Madam \nPresident, we have already considered the Durbin amendment. We are now \nconsidering the Voinovich-Stabenow amendment. Following that amendment, \nSenator Murray and Senator Schumer have an amendment, Senator Specter--\nI should refer to them by number. The Voinovich amendment is amendment \nNo. 4406, the Murray-Schumer amendment is No. 4397, the Specter \namendment is No. 4392, the Feinstein-Martinez amendment is No. 4393, \nand an amendment offered by Senator Kyl of Arizona is No. 4407. I ask \nunanimous consent that those amendments\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nbe considered in the order I announced them; that the underlying \namendment, the Voinovich amendment, at the conclusion of debate, be set \naside and we move to consider these next amendments. We will try to \ncomplete four or five of these amendments, I am told by the leadership, \nwith the possibility of votes on one or all these amendments this \nevening, with a couple more tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to ask the chairman of the Banking Committee to \nread those amendments off one more time.\n  Mr. DODD. Be happy to. Presently, we are considering the Voinovich-\nStabenow amendment, No. 4406. The next amendment would be the amendment \noffered by Senators Murray and Schumer, No. 4397. There is then an \namendment offered by Senator Specter, No. 4392; an amendment offered by \nSenators Feinstein and Martinez, which is amendment No. 4393; and an \namendment offered by Senator Kyl, No. 4407. There are other amendments, \nbut these are the four or five we are going to try to deal with here by \nsetting aside the underlying amendment and debating them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object, Madam President. There is one in there I don't \nwant on that list, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is the Ensign amendment. Take that off the list.\n  Mr. DODD. It is not on there.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is not on there? OK, good. I am okay as long as that \namendment is not on there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the objection withdrawn?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. May I also just request that Members let the staff know how \nmuch time they may need. It would help us to inform other people about \nwhen their amendments are coming up. So if you need a half hour, 15 \nminutes, or whatever to explain your amendment, we can let others know \nabout coming over and offering their amendments in a timely fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I believe the Voinovich amendment is the \npending amendment. I have spoken to that amendment and at this point \ncannot agree to it. It costs about $3 billion over 10 years. I have \nspoken to the sponsors and asked them to rewrite that amendment and \ntalk to the Joint Committee on Taxation to get the score down to about \n$1 billion, and they are working on that right now. I very much hope \nthey can get that amendment down to a billion because then it would be \nin a much more acceptable form. But right now, the size and scope of it \nis just too large. And I think it is appropriate, when we consider \nthese tax amendments, to be somewhat prudent when we consider them and \nnot go overboard. I do believe the current scope of the Voinovich \namendment is too large, and they are very agreeable and are working \nwith Joint Tax in amending the language to get it down to about $1 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may, since the Senator from Montana \nhas spoken on this amendment, I wish to advise Members that any \namendment that is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, I \nam going to defer entirely to the Senator from Montana and his \ncolleague from Iowa as to their advice and counsel. So if you have any \namendment that impacts the Finance Committee, I am happy to see you, \nbut I will turn you right over to see the Senator from Montana to talk \nabout it. So I am going to make it clear we are going to rely entirely \non the judgment of the Finance Committee on any amendments that affect \nthat committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4397 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe Voinovich amendment in order to call up amendment No. 4397.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4397.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for housing counseling resources)\n\n       On page 58, line 10, strike ``$100,000,000'' and all that \n     follows through ``2008'' on line 11, and insert the \n     following: ``$200,000,000, to remain available until December \n     31, 2008''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I offer this amendment for myself and \nSenator Schumer, Senator Casey, and Senator Brown.\n  I am extremely happy that we do have a bipartisan bill now that \nprovides a solution to the problem at the very center of our Nation's \neconomic downturn--the housing crisis--that has shaken communities \nacross this country. We know that each month this year thousands of \nhomeowners will see their interest rates rise, and many more will find \nthemselves underwater as the housing market in their region continues \nto suffer. If the Federal Government doesn't take action, as many as 2 \nmillion American families are going to lose their homes to foreclosure \nthis year. Each one of those foreclosures represents a family whose \ndream of a comfortable home and a secure future is going to be dashed, \nand each one of those foreclosures really weakens the foundation of a \ncommunity.\n  This crisis has already rippled across our economy. If we don't take \naggressive steps to prevent it from becoming worse, it is going to take \nthat much longer for our neighborhoods and our hometowns to recover. \nThat is why I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment with Senators \nSchumer, Casey, and Brown which I believe will help make this bill much \nstronger. Our amendment will provide an additional $100 million for \nhousing counselors, who really are our front line of defense in the \nfight to prevent more families from losing their homes. What our \namendment does is double the money for housing counseling that is in \nthis bill. It builds on our efforts we started last year.\n  In last year's omnibus budget, we included $180 million through the \nNeighborWorks America Program for housing counseling to help 450,000 \nhomeowners who are in trouble today. As chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Housing, I worked hard with my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, to push for that money. The bill before us \ntoday would provide the resources to help another 250,000 homeowners, \nand our amendment would enable us to bring the total number of families \nhelped through this bill to 500,000.\n  Many homeowners today don't know that they can get help if they get \nbehind on their mortgage. Too many of them don't make contact with \ntheir lender when they miss their first payment, and too many just feel \nintimidated or don't trust their bank enough to make a call. But \nhousing counselors can help these families. They can help them \nnegotiate with their lender, readjust their payment, or learn how to \nbudget their expenses better.\n  The last couple of years have really proven that this kind of \nassistance may be the most cost-effective and important piece of the \nsolution to the housing crisis, and that is why we believe we must \nensure that counseling agencies get more resources as soon as possible \nif we are going to turn around this economic crisis.\n  According to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 96 \npercent of the families who get counseling avoid foreclosure. Let me \nsay that again. Ninety-six percent of the families who get counseling \navoid foreclosure. That means almost all the people who seek help from \nan expert will not lose their homes.\n  We know the demand is there. Last year, the demand for the $180 \nmillion made available for counseling in the omnibus was twice as high \nas the money available, and that happened even though counseling agents \nacross\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nthe country had only 2 weeks last year to apply for the grants. In just \nthe couple of months that have passed since then, several States have \nseen a dramatic increase in their foreclosures, and people in those \ncommunities and other communities across the country are very worried. \nWe all know that foreclosures have left our neighborhoods full of \nvacant homes. Families are distressed, they are in trouble, and State \nand local governments are seeing their tax revenues drop now, even as \nthe needs out there are piling up.\n  These counseling agencies we provide the funding for are telling us \nthey need desperately more resources to help address this. In my home \nState of Washington, the number of calls to counselors doubled in just \nthe first few months of this year, and we know that is true across the \ncountry. But if the numbers aren't compelling enough, let me tell you \npersonally about a few people I know who have been helped.\n  One of them is a man named Clifford. He is a gentleman from my State, \nand I don't want to use his last name to protect his privacy, but he \ntold me what happened to him. He and his family thought they had \nachieved the American dream by owning a home. Their home represented \nstability. It was an important investment in their future. But they \nstarted having trouble with their mortgage because Clifford lost his \nfactory job, and pretty soon his wife got sick and she needed surgery. \nBefore they knew it, they were a couple of months behind and were \nstruggling with their mortgage company about how they could ever catch \nup. They turned eventually to Consumer Counseling Northwest, got a \ncounselor who gave them help and advice, and he told me that made all \nthe difference. Clifford's housing counselors were able to help him get \nhis payments reduced, and now his family has been able to pay the \nmortgage and keep their home.\n\n  Madam President, there are many families like Clifford's across the \ncountry--people who are teetering on the edge and just need a little \nbit of help and counseling to avoid a crisis.\n  Earlier this year, at an event with Senators Bond and Cochran--and \nwith Representatives Olver and Knollenberg from the House--I had an \nopportunity to meet a single mom from Ohio. She told us she had fallen \non very hard times, which in turn led her to fall behind, and she soon \nfound out she couldn't pay her mortgage. But thanks to help from \nNeighborWorks America, she told us that she and her children didn't \nlose their home and they were able to stay there. She told me that when \nshe got behind, she just got completely overwhelmed. She told me she \ndidn't know what to do. She said: You know, this is not something they \nteach you in school.\n  Well, these counselors made a difference in her life and thousands of \nothers. We should not turn our back on families today who want to make \na call and get help, who want to get their mortgages back in line and \nkeep their homes. The economic health of this country depends on \nAmericans having a safe and stable place to live and raise their \nfamilies. We want every family who is facing a challenge today to know \nthat there is help out there, and when they call, we want to make sure \nthere is a knowledgeable counselor on the other end of the line who can \ngive them the help they need.\n  So here is the bottom line. We know we have millions of people who \nneed help, and we know housing counseling can make a difference. So I \nthink it would be unconscionable not to provide this money, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment that will put the resources out \nthere to make sure families in all our communities can pick up their \nphone, make a call, get the help they need, and keep their investment \nin their home and their security for the future.\n  Madam President, I have been proud to work with the Senator from New \nYork, as well as others, on this bill, and I know he is on the floor \nand ready to speak as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am proud to rise in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Washington, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the Senator from Ohio, and myself, and I first wish to \nthank Senator Murray for her leadership on this issue. This is crucial, \nand when Senators Casey, Brown, and I sent her a request to include \nthis money first in the appropriations bill and then in the omnibus \nbill, Senators Dodd and Bond offered an amendment for another $100 \nmillion, and by the time we got through with conference, $180 million \nwas offered. So I thank all my colleagues. We also have Senators \nClinton, Menendez, and Kerry as cosponsors of our amendment.\n  Madam President, as you know, we are in the midst of a massive spike \nin mortgage delinquency and foreclosures. Housing prices are going down \nat record levels. We haven't seen housing prices go down this much \nsince the Depression. Our economy, the national economy, is heading \nsouth. Yet where is the President? The President has been in Bucharest, \nboth literally and figuratively. The President is literally in \nBucharest today, but he has been in Bucharest for months when it comes \nto the economy and housing. He is nowhere to be seen here.\n  Foreclosure filings are soaring. They are up 57 percent in January. \nFrom December to January alone, foreclosures increased 8 percent. The \n57-percent figure is over the year. Home foreclosure filings topped 1.3 \nmillion in 2007, and more than 2 million are likely now. We are all \nmore than aware of the havoc this has wreaked in neighborhoods, on Main \nStreet, on Wall Street, and throughout the Nation and even the world. \nSo it is amazing that with all of these problems rippling out from \nhousing foreclosures, a simple addition could greatly ameliorate the \nproblem, and that addition is mortgage counselors. Why, you ask? Why \nshould a mortgage counselor help solve not just problems of individual \nforeclosures but of declining home prices and declining economy and \nfinancial ripples throughout the world, in London and Shanghai? The \nanswer is simple: The majority of those in foreclosure do not have to \nhave their houses foreclosed upon. They have the resources, and the \nprice of their home is such that a simple refinancing would work.\n  In the old days--when banks were the only issuer of mortgages, they \nissued them and held them--none of this would have happened. The \nmortgage counselor from the bank would have gone over to the homeowner \nand helped him or her rework this. Madam President, 60 percent of those \nin foreclosure or about to go into foreclosure are prime borrowers; \nmost of them, the majority, are in home refinancings, not new homes; \nand many of them were duped through no fault of their own.\n  A mortgage counselor on the scene, provided there are dollars to \nrefinance, can help that homeowner refinance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Klobuchar, the Presiding \nOfficer, be added as a cosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank her for always being on top of things.\n  In any case, a mortgage counselor could easily do the job in so many \ncases, but there are none around. Foreclosure counselors are skilled \nand work. There are groups throughout the country that do this and do \nit well, with very little waste and much dedication. That is why \nSenators Casey, Brown, and I went to Senator Murray and asked her to \nput this in the omnibus bill. That is why she did it, and that is why \nSenators Bond and Dodd added additional money in an amendment. We need \nthese people.\n  I wish to tell a story. I have told it before on this floor, but I \nwant to make sure people hear about it. It shows the need for \ncounselors. It is about Frank Ruggiero, a homeowner from Ozone Park in \nQueens. Frank is a retired subway motorman. He had a pension of $28,000 \na year, Social Security of $11,000 a year--$39,000 income a year. He \nlived in his nice little brick house with a mortgage of $1,100 a month \nor about $12,000 a year and happily paid the mortgage for 16 years of \nthe 30-year mortgage.\n  Then Frank got diabetes. He needed $50,000 for some kind of treatment \nthat his medical plan would not pay for. Instead of going to the bank, \nwhich was Frank's mistake--because banks have not caused this problem; \nit is the independent mortgage companies, unregulated, that caused it--\nhe saw an ad in the paper for one of these fiends--they are not all \nfiends but this person was--\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nthat said ``get quick cash; refinance your home.''\n  Frank called, and he came over. Frank said: How much more will I pay?\n  He said: You will pay $100 more in January.\n  And Frank says: I can easily afford $1,200 a month to cure my \ndiabetes. That is worth it. He signed a new 30-year mortgage and sure \nenough, his mortgage only went up to $1,200 in January.\n  What he was never told was that the following January his mortgage \nwould go up to $3,900 a month. That is easy math. That is about $47,000 \na year. Frank's total income was $39,000 a year. Even if he didn't pay \none nickel for the whole year for any food or heat or taxes, he \ncouldn't pay it.\n  What happened? This more relates to the amendment of my colleague \nfrom California--the mortgage broker was paid a huge commission to dupe \nFrank. He duped him legally because there are no regulations. It said \non the big document Frank signed, on page 23--I am a lawyer, but I \ncouldn't understand it--6 points above LIBOR after 4 months, after \nthis, after that--it said the mortgage would go up that much, but no \nright person would understand it. It wasn't in plain English, and it \nwasn't available. The mortgage broker made a huge fee, walked off into \nthe sunset, and Frank was about to lose his home.\n  The irony is, Frank was a prime borrower. He had never missed a \npayment on his mortgage, he had never missed a payment on his credit \ncard. His FICO score was above 700. He easily could refinance. Frank is \na good customer for a lending institution. But there was no one to help \nhim. There was no bank. It was a mortgage broker, independent, who got \nmoney from a mortgage company, independent, both unregulated. That \nrelates to the amendment of my friend from California. They are off \ninto the sunset with their profits, and Frank is stuck and no one is \nthere. The mortgage company didn't hold the mortgage, they chopped it \nup in 40 pieces and gave it to some investment house that sold \nsecurities, and it is now scattered among thousands of investors in \nlittle tiny pieces in different degrees of reliability.\n  So Frank is out there alone. If there were a mortgage counselor on \nthe scene, that mortgage counselor could easily help Frank refinance.\n  You say, where would they get the money for refinancing? Good news; \nfinally, after months of prodding by myself and Senator Dodd and \nothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made $200 billion available for \nthese kinds of mortgages.\n  But the dollars are not going to walk over to Frank's house in Ozone \nPark, Queens, and say: Here we are. You need a mortgage counselor. And \nthat is what the amendment of the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Ohio and my amendment \ndoes. It simply provides more mortgage counselors. It is not huge \nscience. You do not need a Ph.D. in mathematics or an accounting degree \nto be a mortgage counselor. You have to take a little course and learn \nit. It is easy for the various groups that have done this for years but \nwere not faced with a flood of foreclosures to do it again. We could \nprobably prevent about 50 percent of all the foreclosures that are \nabout to happen, maybe even more, because 60 percent are prime \nborrowers, and even some of the nonprime borrowers could be helped by \nthis, depending on the value of the home and the cost of their mortgage \nand the mortgage processing agreement.\n  That is all we want to do. In this package originally that we offered \nabout 3 weeks ago, there was $200 million. That is not enough. Senator \nMurray and I and others wanted to ask for $500 million, but we were \nasked by the majority leader to keep the cost down so we offered $200 \nmillion. Madam President, $200 million is not enough. We need more than \nthat.\n  We did appropriate $180 million in the omnibus bill, as I mentioned \nbefore, that Senator Murray put together--at least her part of it. Now \nthere is talk we don't need the $180 million; they have not even spent \nthat. Why give them more?\n  Here is a letter. I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n         Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: As you \n     consider the current housing stimulus legislation we urge you \n     to restore essential funding for foreclosure prevention \n     counseling. We respectfully request that you fund this \n     program for not less than $200 million as was initially \n     proposed by Senator Reid in S. 2636.\n       As you well know, the nation is experiencing a serious \n     spike in mortgage delinquency and foreclosures. In 2006 more \n     than 1.3 million homes were in default, up 42 percent from \n     the year before. Foreclosures are expected to be greatest in \n     2008 when one in three loans is predicted to end in default \n     as a result of mortgage payment resets on adjustable rate \n     loans. The crisis is widespread and not just confined to the \n     urban housing market. Increasingly, rural borrowers are \n     subject to harsher prepayment penalties and targeted lending \n     discrimination so the prosperity and stability of rural \n     counties, like their urban and suburban counterparts, is \n     becoming jeopardized.\n       The FY 2008 HUD Appropriations Act provided $180 million \n     for use by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to \n     provide mortgage foreclosure prevention counseling. \n     Neighborhood Reinvestment received applications for $340 \n     million in grants to combat the foreclosure crisis. With only \n     two weeks to apply for funds, demand was nearly twice the \n     $180 million that Congress appropriated for these mitigation \n     activities. Several states were underrepresented in the \n     applicant pool, in part because those states had not seen \n     high rates of foreclosure up to that point. Now, however, \n     many of the states that did not apply or receive an initial \n     grant have seen a dramatic increase in home foreclosures and \n     are in desperate need of these supplemental counseling \n     resources.\n       In particular, there is a need to expand the capacity of \n     housing counselors to assist delinquent homeowners with \n     accurate and honest information and options, budget and \n     workout plans, loan modifications, refinancing or responsible \n     sales of the residence. It is also essential given the nature \n     of this crisis to ensure an ongoing, adequate level of \n     support for mortgage foreclosure activities.\n       We urge you to fund the foreclosure mitigation counseling \n     program at no less than $200 million in order for housing \n     counselors to keep pace with rising rates of foreclosure in \n     rural and urban neighborhoods. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this important request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peg Malloy,\n       President, NNA.\n     David C. Brown,\n       Executive Director, NNA.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is a letter dated yesterday, to Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby, signed by about 100 organizations that do this, saying \nthe following:\n\n       We respectfully request that you fund this program for not \n     less than $200 million as was initially proposed by Senator \n     Reid in S. 2636.\n\n  They said they have received applications for $340 million in grants, \ntwice the $180 million Congress appropriated. Several States were \nunderrepresented in the original applicant pool because they had not \nseen high rates of foreclosure, but now many of them have applied. Of \nthe $180 million, $130 million has already been spent in a short 6 \nweeks. The only reason the rest has not been spent is they are keeping \nit aside for a very rainy day. They could spend that in a minute if we \nwere to ask them to in report language, should this bill get that far, \nwhich I hope and pray it does.\n  So we need the money. It is not much money. We are putting $4 billion \nin for CDBG. That is worthy, but it is not as important as mortgage \ncounselors. We are putting $6 billion in for the loss carryback \nprovisions, the FOLs, to help homebuilders. We can't afford a needed \n$100 million more for mortgage counselors, who do more good to prevent \nforeclosure and provide more bang for the buck than any other part of \nthis bill, bar none?\n  Why the $100 million was cut out--I was told they said they didn't \nneed it. This letter proves conclusively they need it. It is now in the \nRecord. I urge my colleagues to look at it. We desperately need it.\n  I hope we will have bipartisan support for this amendment. Senator \nBond, who has been a leader on these issues, supported the amendment, \nwith Senator Dodd, to put in the original $200 million. This is hardly \na partisan issue. This is not a bill that costs $15 billion. Another \n$100 million is not\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\ngoing to make that much difference, especially when we are doing $6 \nbillion for the loss carrybacks, and $4 billion for CDBG. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. It is a much needed amendment that will do \ntremendous good. It will help the Frank Ruggieros and the millions of \nothers like him to keep their homes. It will prevent housing prices in \ntheir neighborhoods and in the country from declining more than they \nhave to. It will stabilize mortgage markets and thus stabilize many of \nour largest banks and institutions, both here and abroad.\n  So this little amendment is like Mighty Mite--it is small, it is at \nthe center, but it has tremendous power to ripple outward and affect us \npositively.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it so we \nmight strengthen this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I do not see anyone on the \nRepublican side on the floor, although if they are coming, now would be \na good time. I believe Senator Martinez and I are up, after a \nRepublican, for an amendment. I am prepared to proceed.\n  Madam President, although I spoke about this amendment this morning, \nI wish to speak about it again. This amendment is called the SAFE \nMortgage Licensing Act, ``licensing'' being the dispositive word. I am \nvery proud to work with this with Senator Martinez of Florida. He is on \nhis way and he will be making a statement following mine. This \namendment is cosponsored by Senators Boxer, Obama, Dole, Durbin, \nSalazar, and Clinton.\n  One of the things I didn't realize is how big scams are a part of the \nsubprime market. I remember picking up a USA Today newspaper in January \nand the headline reading, ``Housing Scams Rising, FBI Says. 2007 \nConvictions More Than Doubled.''\n  As we began to look at this, we found there was a very real problem. \nThe problem is that there is but a thin patchwork of State regulations. \nThey vary. Some do not have any. Some are pretty good; some are not so \ngood. So we put together this bill, Senator Martinez and I, and I am \nvery proud to say it is supported by the National Association of \nMortgage Brokers, by the Conference of Bank Supervisors, by the mayor \nof Los Angeles, and by the National Association of Realtors. I wish to \nread, if I might, the realtors letter because I think it is important \nto the discussion.\n\n       On behalf of over 1.3 million members of the National \n     Association of REALTORS, I want to share our views on the \n     SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act offered by Senators Feinstein and \n     Martinez.\n       We believe this amendment will go far towards preventing \n     another subprime market failure that would further erode \n     confidence in the Nation's housing finance system. While \n     responsible subprime lenders have played an important role in \n     helping millions of consumers achieve homeownership, abusive \n     subprime lending has occurred much too often. As a result, \n     roughly 2.2 million American households have been projected \n     to lose their homes, and as much as $164 billion due to \n     subprime mortgage foreclosures.\n       Many of the provisions of the amendment are consistent with \n     NAR's ``Responsible Lending Principles.'' We believe our \n     principles provide an appropriate basis for legislation that \n     would help eliminate irresponsible practices such as making \n     loans without sufficient regard to the borrower's ability to \n     repay the loan and avoid foreclosure.\n       The National Association of REALTORS supports responsible \n     lending, mortgage servicing, and appraisal practices. We \n     support this amendment that will help close the door on \n     abusive lending practices.\n\n  I wish to say on behalf of the cosponsors of this amendment and \nmyself, thank you to the National Association of Realtors.\n  We are very grateful for the support. The fact is, mortgage fraud \ncomplaints have jumped more than 700 percent over the last 5 years, \nfrom 5,623 in 2002 to 46,717 last year. Mortgage fraud complaints in my \nState, California--Senator Boxer's and my State--have increased 400 \npercent over the last 5 years, from 1,143 in 2002 to 4,060 last year.\n  All you have to do is take a look at the jump in these complaints and \nthe jump in convictions to know there are scams going on and we need to \nstop them. The best way to stop them is to license these brokers and \nlenders so we prevent the 25-year-old scam artist--I do not pull this \nout of the air; this is a fact--who can come in, get on a telephone, \nand tell lenders or tell individuals what they can do to refinance \ntheir house and do it all in a bogus manner.\n  We have 10 States that are mortgage fraud hot spots in the United \nStates. They are California, New York, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, \nIllinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. These are mortgage fraud hot \nspots because of the number of complaints and convictions of mortgage \nfraud coming from these States. So the time has come to do something \nabout it.\n  Now, there are some people in this body who say: Do not pass this \nbill today; put it in regular order. Let it go to the committee.\n  Let it go to the committee, and it will be another year before this \nbill is before us. And I will bet any amount of money the mortgage \nfraud will continue because all of the conditions are ripe for it.\n  The only way to handle it is to pass this bill so we set into motion \nsome minimum national standard and allow the States to carry out this \nminimum standard and add to it anything the States might want.\n  As I say, the 1.3 million-member National Association of Realtors is \nin support of this amendment. And the group that regulates them is in \nsupport of the amendment as well. Today, subprime mortgages are 30 \npercent of all the mortgages in the largest State in the Union. Thirty \npercent of every mortgage is subprime in California. This is a \ncommunity because they are mainly working class, not necessarily \ncollege graduates, who are eager pawns for bad actors in the mortgage \nand lending business.\n  Now, having said that, not all brokers are bad actors; many of them \nare honorable professionals. The fact is, this is a profession. This is \nwhat you do as a mortgage broker, as a lender.\n  You should have standards. You should have to pass a test. You should \nhave to get a license, and you should have to renew that license \nperiodically. How else can you be able to go out, get on a phone, call \npeople and say: Look, I can refinance your house at 4 percent. You \nbring in the eager homeowner, and then the reality is something very \ndifferent.\n  These bad actors must be stopped. There is only one way to stop them; \nthat is, have minimum Federal standards, allow the States--and in my \nState it would be the Corporation Department that would do this, that \nsets up the licenses, that sets up the training. And individuals would \ngo through the training, they would have their background checked, they \nwould get a license, and the license would go up for renewal annually.\n  Some object to it. My goodness, attorneys have to renew their \nlicenses. Why not someone who puts out mortgages which is very often \neverything an individual owns? Why is it not important for them to have \na license and have that license renewed?\n  Once again, I would like to tell you about this family. I do so \nbecause I met them in Los Angeles last week. This is the Simmons \nfamily. Look at their house. It is not a mansion. It is a one-story, \nwell-kept stucco home with flowers planted, bushes trimmed.\n  The gentleman, Mr. Simmons, was an employee of Northrop Grumman for \n20 years; his wife employed as a food checker at Alpha Beta for 26 \nyears. They have owned this home for 39 years. Mr. Simmons had a \nstroke. They found they needed cash. They received a cold call, a phone \ncall from somebody. They wanted $500,000, to be able to get a loan, \ntake this out, use it for medical expenses.\n  They offered them a $629,000 loan with $25,000 cash back, 4.5 percent \ninterest rate, and monthly payments of $2,000. Now, they are not \ncollege graduates. These are working people who did everything they \ncould to buy a home, who have kept that home up for 39 years in good \ncondition, and who today are going to lose that home.\n  And here is why: There was no cash back, different from what they \nwere promised. The interest was 11.2 percent on this loan. The monthly \npayments were not $2,000 as they were told; it was $5,300. When they \nhad to make the first payment, they called the broker and said: You \ntold us $2,000. Why is it $5,300?\n  The broker said: It is only that for 4 months, to draw down the \ninterest rate.\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\n  They said: Ok, I guess we can do it for 4 months. It was not only for \n4 months, it was for the length of the mortgage. And the broker walks \noff with a $20,000 fee.\n\n  Now, in my book this is fraud. There are some who say: Oh, people get \nthe papers. Let them read through them.\n  You have bought a home, Mr. President. I have bought a home. I did \nnot read all of the fine print on all of the documents. I depend on the \nword of the broker. And I believe most people do that.\n  Now, I am not a lawyer. I do have a college degree. What if I only \nhad a high school degree or not even that? I worked all my life. I do \nnot understand the fine print. This is why you have professionals \nrepresenting you to tell you the truth.\n  There is a penalty--should be--if they do not tell you the truth. \nBuying a home should not be a scam. Refinancing a home should not be a \nscam. So we then went on the Internet. Let's see what companies \nadvertising to employ brokers say. And here is one of them. Here is the \nsource. We accessed it on February 27 for brokers: No experience, \neducation, or exam is necessary. No experience, education, or exam is \nnecessary.\n  They go on to say to the company: You can hire unlicensed sales \nagents to originate loans under your company license.\n  I do not think they should be able to do that because it is these \npeople who pick up the phone and call the homeowners and offer that \nsecond mortgage. Particularly in the subprime market, where many people \nhave very little, if any, downpayment, this presents enormous \ndifficulty.\n  Consequently, we have a real problem. I hope this amendment passes \ntoday. Perhaps some people do not like this or that. It can be worked \nout in conference. But when we are passing this bill, we ought to pass \nsomething that says once and for all the Federal Government is willing \nto step in, set minimum standards; you, the State, set up your laws, \nset up your licensing requirements. These are the minimum standards, \nand you can add to them and see that those people, mortgage brokers and \nlenders, are licensed.\n  The legislation also creates a database so that I, Joe Doe, about to \nbuy a house, can go into my computer, if I have one, and see that my \nmortgage broker is licensed, know that he has been to school, know that \nhe has been informed of ethics, know that he does not have a felony \nbackground right now, you can have a felony background--and know that \nhis license is renewed annually so he is kept up to date on ethics and \nbest practices.\n  This industry, real estate, because it controls such a large \nproportion of most people's wealth, their homes--their home is their \nrock. Everything flows from that home ownership. And for most people \nbuying a home is truly the American dream. Owning, having that equity, \nbuilding that equity over the years, being able to finance retirement \nfrom the equity in a home when they choose to sell it is such a big \ndeal. And to have bad actors, flim-flam artists going around suckering \nin people makes me angry. So I would hope this body, on behalf of \nSenator Martinez and me, will be willing to pass this legislation \ntoday.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Klobuchar as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to add to the Record letters \nfrom the State Bank Supervisors and the National Association of \nMortgage Brokers in support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Conference of\n\n\n                                       State Bank Supervisors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: The Conference of State Bank Supervisors \n     (CSBS) supports the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage \n     Licensing Act of 2008 (S. 2595 the SAFE Mortgage Licensing \n     Act of 2008) introduced by Senators Feinstein and Martinez.\n       The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 will help protect \n     borrowers from unscrupulous lenders and brokers and improve \n     transparency in the mortgage lending process. CSBS encourages \n     Congress to include this bipartisan reform in a legislative \n     package to address the current mortgage crisis.\n       State regulators recognize that this reform effort builds \n     on state initiatives to modernize our mortgage regulatory \n     system. Specifically, the legislation establishes a \n     nationwide mortgage lending database that coordinates with \n     the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System currently being \n     operated by CSBS and the American Association of Residential \n     Mortgage Regulators (AARMR).\n       By January of this year, 42 state agencies representing \n     mortgage regulators in 40 states have signed a statement of \n     intent indicating their commitment to participate in the \n     CSBS/AARMR Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System. Eventually, \n     CSBS and AARMR expect all 50 will transition onto the System. \n     The System successfully began operations on January 2, with 7 \n     states launching the system. An additional 9 states will be \n     on by the end of 2008 with the rest of the states rolling on \n     in 2009 and beyond.\n       Again, we strongly encourage you to include the provisions \n     of the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act in legislation designed to \n     resolve the current mortgage crisis.\n           Sincerely\n                                                      Neil Milner,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Realtors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2008.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mel Martinez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Martinez: On behalf of over 1.3 \n     million members of the National Association of REALTORS, I \n     want to share our views on the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act \n     amendment offered by Senators Feinstein and Martinez.\n       We believe this amendment will go far toward preventing \n     another subprime market failure that would further erode \n     confidence in the Nation's housing finance system. While \n     responsible subprime lenders have played an important role in \n     helping millions of consumers achieve homeownership, abusive \n     subprime lending has occurred much too often. As a result, \n     roughly 2.2 million American households have been projected \n     to lose their homes and as much as $164 billion due to \n     subprime mortgage foreclosures.\n       Many of the provisions of the amendment are consistent with \n     NAR's ``Responsible Lending Principles.'' We believe our \n     principles provide an appropriate basis for legislation that \n     would help eliminate irresponsible practices such as making \n     loans without sufficient regard to the borrower's ability to \n     repay the loan and avoid foreclosure.\n       The National Association of REALTORS supports responsible \n     lending, mortgage servicing and appraisal practices. We \n     support this amendment that will help close the door on \n     abusive lending practices.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard F. Gaylord,\n                                                   2008 President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nMr. Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator from California. What a pleasure it \nis to work with the Senator on this bill, this important piece of \nlegislation. She has stated it so well.\n  I want to perhaps go over a few items I think ought to be also said. \nI know when I first became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development I \nwas shocked at the role, ever-increasing and prominent role, that \nmortgage brokers play in the home purchasing process.\n  When there is such a close working relationship with a customer--\nthere are issues that deal with premiums, there is the question of \nfiduciary responsibility--all of these issues arise because of that \nrelationship, and oftentimes it is the closest point of contact with \nthe customer. And many times they are the most vulnerable of customers.\n  So that is why I am delighted to join with the Senator from \nCalifornia in the Safe Mortgage Licensing Act. I hope, like her, that \nwe can get at it and talk about it, and I would like for us to work \nwith the managers of the bill. I know there are some concerns that the \nSenator mentioned perhaps that can be resolved in conference. But I \nlook forward to working with the bill managers toward the resolution of \nthose small issues that may remain.\n  With foreclosures at record levels and home prices in steady decline, \nwe must act quickly to restore consumer confidence in the housing \nmarket. Florida has the dubious distinction of ranking No. 2 in the \nNation in foreclosures. In February, Florida had one foreclosure filing \nfor every 254 households, up more than 7 percent from January's rate--\ntruly frightening.\n  Last year, more than 2 percent of Florida's households entered some \nform of foreclosure, and that is a 124-percent increase from the year \nof 2006. Many of these foreclosures can be attributed to predatory \nlending practices\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nof unscrupulous mortgage brokers. And while the mortgage broker \nindustry ought to be commended for supporting this bill, and to my own \nprofession of law, there are always bad actors out there. That is what \nthis is getting at.\n  Let me point out, in the State of Florida we have the dubious \ndistinction of leading the country when it comes to foreclosures. This \nis the list of the top cities across the country. And you can see why \nthe Senators from Florida and California are here talking about this. \nWe have been hit hard.\n  No. 1 leading the country is Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL, at 5.8 \npercent. Then we have No. 2, which is Port St. Lucie, FL, at 3.9 \npercent. Then Miami, Miami Beach, and Kendall at 3.1 percent; Fort \nLauderdale, Pampano, Deerfield Beach at 3 percent. And then after a \ncouple of California communities and Ohio, we have Naples-Marco Island, \nFL, at 2.7 percent. This is concentrated in some of the better areas of \nFlorida where home prices have been in a dramatic rise for many months \nand years in the recent past.\n  The current system provides little coordination between State \nregulators and, therefore, exposes consumers to predatory loan \noriginators who have crossed State lines. The creation of a nationwide \nsystem will eliminate bad actors by keeping track of those who violated \nthe law, had their licenses revoked or failed to fulfill appropriate \neducational requirements that will benefit families and eventually the \nmarketplace.\n  It would give home buyers more transparency and more peace of mind as \nthey make one of the most important decisions and, frankly, maybe the \nlargest financial decision of their lives. The SAFE Mortgage Licensing \nAct would, for the first time, establish a national professional \nlicensing standard for mortgage brokers and lenders. This would ensure \nthat all mortgage professionals are trained in Federal lending laws, \nethics, consumer protection, and subprime market lending. The \nlegislation also would create a national database that consumers can \nuse to verify the credentials of the brokers and lenders. This \namendment would require all residential mortgage loan originators to be \nlicensed, provide fingerprints, and a summary of work experience, and \nconsent to a background check.\n  States are given 12 months to develop licensing standards to ensure \nthat applicants meet the following minimum criteria: No felony \nconvictions; no similar license ever revoked; a demonstrated record of \nfinancial responsibility; successful completion of educational \nrequirements; and passage of a written exam. If this does not occur, \nthe Housing and Urban Development Secretary is empowered to develop the \nnational database and license, generating revenue for its \nimplementation through fees to license applicants. The Federal Reserve, \nTreasury, and FDIC must also register all residential mortgage loan \noriginators employed by national banks within 12 months of this \nlegislation being enacted.\n  The SAFE Act has been endorsed by mortgage regulators in 40 States, \nand the National Association of Realtors agrees with and supports this \namendment.\n  I thank the Senator from California for working with me on this \nimportant piece of legislation. We need to do more to empower families \nwho have worked hard, who look to home ownership as an important piece \nof their American dream. While there are details to be worked out, I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby to \nsee if we cannot eliminate any concerns that might be out there. We \ndon't want to throw the net so wide it may ensnare people for whom we \nare not intending this to be their concern, but we also are committed \nto getting this done. This is an important step forward. I look forward \nto moving the process along.\n  I appreciate working with the distinguished Senator from California.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside for the purpose of my offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4407 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 4407 be called up. I \nbelieve it is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4407 to amendment No. 4387.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust for \n   inflation the dollar limitation for the principal residence gain \n                               exclusion)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n              TITLE _--PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE GAIN EXCLUSION\n\n     SEC. _01. INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE GAIN \n                   EXCLUSION DOLLAR LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 121(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to limitations) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any calendar \n     year after 2008, the dollar amount contained in paragraph (1) \n     shall be increased by an amount equal to--\n       ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year, determined by \n     substituting `calendar year 2007' for `calendar year 1992' in \n     subparagraph (B) thereof.\n\n     Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--So much of subparagraph (A) of \n     section 121(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as \n     precedes clause (i) thereof is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) Limitation for certain joint returns.--Paragraph (1) \n     shall be applied by doubling the dollar amount specified in \n     such paragraph if--''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to years beginning after December 31, 2008.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment is actually very simple, and I \nthink it will be another one of the things that we can do to help \npromote home ownership and the transfer of property to make it less \nexpensive for people and, frankly, to advance a policy that we should \nhave advanced a long time ago.\n  Most people know under current law they can exclude $250,000--for a \nmarried couple it is $500,000--from the capital gains when they sell \ntheir principal residence. In other words, even though you may make \n$250,000 on the value of your home when you sell it, that is excluded \nfrom the capital gains that would otherwise have to be paid.\n  You are limited by some requirements. You have to live in the home \nfor 2 years. You have to own and occupy the home in 2 of the previous 5 \nyears from the sale. But you are able to exclude from the capital gains \n$250,000. The problem is, as we found out with the alternative minimum \ntax, inflation can drive the value of this exclusion down.\n  So what this amendment does, simply, is index the exclusion for \ninflation. It is very simple. I cannot imagine it would be \ncontroversial. What this would do, of course, is to preserve the value \nof this deduction that we have all taken advantage of for the future \nand thereby encourage individuals to purchase a new home. Of course, \nmuch of what we are trying to do in this legislation is encourage home \nownership but, more than that, encourage people to purchase homes or be \nable to transact the sale and purchase of a home.\n  There is another point I want to make, and it is important because \nsome people have been caught in an innocent situation with regard to \nthe foreclosures we are concerned about. People do not buy homes, for \nthe most part, to make money. Now, it is true there were speculators in \nthis red hot housing market and, obviously, we are in no mood to bail \nout speculators. But most people buy a home to raise their family, and \nthey live in the home.\n  This exclusion, of course, requires they live in the home for 2 years \nout of 5 years before the sale. So we are not\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\ntalking about the situation where brokers would buy a home and then \nwait a couple months and flip it and sell it and make a big profit. \nThis is for legitimate folks who bought a home to live in and have \ntheir family live in it and then sold it.\n  A large portion of a capital gain on a home is now inflation. That is \nthe hard reality of it. I do not think any of my colleagues believe it \nshould be subject to taxation. Unfortunately, inflation now is around 4 \npercent. It is growing faster than that. Therefore, for the future I \nthink this is an important amendment as well.\n  So this amendment protects homeowners from unexpected changes in \nfamily status, employment, and health. It would help elderly taxpayers \nwho sell their home and choose to move into less expensive housing \nduring their retirement. Frequently, there is a capital gain on their \nlongtime residence, and it would help them avoid having to pay a \ncapital gains tax.\n  It clearly simplifies tax administration and record keeping. It would \nprovide people with a much easier situation for acquiring a home.\n  Mr. President, there are some additional arguments that I could make. \nLet me cite a couple statistics. Then I am hoping I can perhaps engage \nsome of my colleagues in a discussion to see if there would actually be \na need to vote on this amendment or whether we could agree to it.\n  Let me cite a couple statistics. Usually we do not like to get into \nthis much detail, but I think in this case it makes sense. We have seen \nhousing prices now fall from what some call their bubble highs--the \nvalue that was driven up so dramatically, and now it has fallen. Alan \nGreenspan famously called it the froth in the housing market.\n  But housing prices are still much higher than they were in 1997. I \nthink about my State. I think about the Senator from California, her \nState, and those States where property values appreciated, but a lot of \nthat appreciation is now due to inflation.\n  Here are a couple of interesting stats: The median single-family home \nprice in 1997 was $146,000. A decade later, in 2007, the median home \nprice was $247,200--over $100,000 more in just 10 years. The median \nhome price in California 10 years ago was $186,500, roughly. In \nFebruary of 2008 it was $409,240--in other words, an increase of \n$222,750.\n  So, very clearly, there is a huge inflation factor going into the \nvalue of these homes, and we are going to have to pay capital gains tax \non that above the $250,000 level if we do not index that amount for \ninflation.\n  So I could go on. I think it is so simple. It is a proposition that I \nwould assume would have support from both sides of the aisle. There is \nnothing political about this, of course, and it would certainly help a \nlot of our homeowners at a time when we are searching for ways to do \nexactly that.\n  So I would pause at this point to see if anyone has any objection or \nquestions about it. I will yield the floor otherwise. But I would love \nthe opportunity to get into a discussion about it and see if there is \nany concern on anybody's part about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, let me say to my friend from \nArizona, I do not know. I have asked Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, with matters involving tax policy, to come over and defer to \nthem.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DODD. This is within their jurisdiction, and I just do not feel \ncompetent to address this as an issue. I am told by staff we are \nwaiting for a score on this, how you would score it. That much I do \nknow, that you have to score tax amendments. So I will let them come \nover and make a case for or against when they arrive. They should be \nhere at some point to respond to the Senator from Arizona. I apologize \nto him, but I just do not feel--\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. We have an estimated cost, \nbut perhaps we should wait until my colleagues get here. I will be \nhappy to discuss that aspect of it as well.\n  With that, if there is no further discussion, then I will be happy to \nyield the floor. But I certainly hope my colleagues will take a look at \nthis amendment and join me in supporting this amendment for the benefit \nof homeowners all over the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the \npending amendment aside so I can offer the amendment I spoke on earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4389 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4389 for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Cochran, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Wicker, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4389 to amendment No. 4387.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow use of \n  amended income tax returns to take into account receipt of certain \nhurricane-related casualty loss grants by disallowing previously taken \ncasualty loss deductions, and to waive the deadline on the construction \n     of GO Zone property which is eligible for bonus depreciation)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n               TITLE _--HURRICANE-RELATED CASUALTY LOSSES\n\n     SEC. _01. USE OF AMENDED INCOME TAX RETURNS TO TAKE INTO \n                   ACCOUNT RECEIPT OF CERTAIN HURRICANE-RELATED \n                   CASUALTY LOSS GRANTS BY DISALLOWING PREVIOUSLY \n                   TAKEN CASUALTY LOSS DEDUCTIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986, if a taxpayer claims a deduction for any \n     taxable year with respect to a casualty loss to a personal \n     residence (within the meaning of section 121 of such Code) \n     resulting from Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita and in a \n     subsequent taxable year receives a grant under Public Law \n     109-148, 109-234, or 110-116 as reimbursement for such loss \n     from the State of Louisiana or the State of Mississippi, such \n     taxpayer may elect to file an amended income tax return for \n     the taxable year in which such deduction was allowed and \n     disallow such deduction.

Mr. President, I really appreciate the cooperation of \nthe manager because this is a very important amendment for the gulf \ncoast. It is an amendment I offer with the support of the Senators from \nMississippi--Mr. Cochran and Mr. Wicker--as well as Senator Vitter from \nLouisiana.\n  We have been waiting for some time now for some housing bill to get \nto the floor of the Senate where we could offer a small number of \namendments that are essential to give aid during the ongoing housing \ncrisis that exists in the gulf today.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as you know, as you remember because \nyou have been down to Louisiana, to New Orleans particularly--and we \nare very grateful for the support that so many Senators have given--\nthroughout the gulf coast, literally from Mobile to Beaumont, and \nparticularly from Biloxi to Cameron Parish, there is still a tremendous \ncrisis in housing and reconstruction.\n  I am not going to belabor the point--only to say that I have had \nSecretary Chertoff on the record as late as 3 weeks ago, Chief Paulson \ntoday, the IG of the Homeland Security Committee today in Homeland \nSecurity saying the Stafford Act was not intended to handle \ncatastrophic disasters and that FEMA has yet to make any substantial \nprogress in getting ready to handle catastrophic disasters. They have \nmade\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nmoderate progress. They have made modest but not substantial progress.\n  Our people need substantial everything. They needed it yesterday. \nThey need it today. This amendment will help them get a little bit of \nit now. My amendment basically will allow the people of Mississippi and \nLouisiana and Texas and Alabama--those who are affected by Katrina, \nRita, and Wilma, which was one of the worst seasons of hurricane \ndisaster, in 2005--to basically receive the aid we have already sent to \nthem through the community development block grants. In Louisiana we \ncall it the Road Home Program. These programs were designed at the \nState level, but they were funded by us. In Mississippi it is called \nthe Mississippi Homeowner Assistance Program. It has literally sent \ndirect lifesaving aid to over 150,000 families in Louisiana and about \nprobably 50,000 to 75,000 in Mississippi. I do not have the Mississippi \nnumbers.\n  My amendment will help to correct this great injustice that is \noccurring now. We did not intend for this to occur, but it is going to \noccur if this amendment or something like this amendment is not \nadopted.\n  We sent under a design, basically designed by this Congress, an \napproximately $150,000 grant to homeowners to help close the gap \nbetween what their insurance covered and the total cost of their loss. \nAs I have said many times, homes that were worth $1 million or $2 \nmillion were totally destroyed, as well as homes that were worth \n$50,000.\n  Many of these homes were not in the flood plain. They were not \nrequired to have flood insurance. They were destroyed by the failure of \na Federal levee system that collapsed, as well as historic highs of \nflooding and water coming from Hurricane Rita, which was one of the \ntoughest and most aggressive storms on record.\n  So the long and short of it is, when we sent this $150,000 grant--we \nare still in the process of sending it. It has been very slow, very \nfrustrating, and just so aggravating to so many people who are holding \non by their fingernails to try to save what equity they had in their \nhomes, which, as you know, for most American families that is their \npersonal wealth. I think 95 percent of all Americans have almost 100 \npercent of their entire personal wealth tied up in their home. So this \nissue of helping homeowners in the gulf coast is literally trying to \nhelp restore to them a lifetime of work. In some instances, generations \nof work have been lost in this storm.\n  Now, we are not making everybody whole. Believe me, there has been \nenough pain in the gulf coast to go around for a century or more. But \nwhat happens is, when they receive their $150,000 grant--and most \npeople have received an average of about $65,000. The authorized level \nis $150,000, but you have to qualify for that amount. So the average is \nabout $60,000, which sounds like a lot of money, but if your house was \nworth $500,000, and your insurance has refused to pay you, it is not a \nwhole lot of money to rebuild your house with labor costs that are \ngoing up at 20 percent or more since the storm.\n  So what is happening now is, when they receive these grants--and \nunder the tax law, they can take a casualty deduction. If they did that \nlast year, what happens this year--by April 15, which is in about 2 \nweeks--for that family who makes $75,000 a year--let's say the Smith \nfamily--let's take the Jones and Smith families. They make about the \nsame amount of money. One family this year who took the casualty loss \ndeduction is going to have to pay $24,000 in taxes. The family only \nmakes $75,000, if they are lucky enough to have the job they had before \nKatrina and Rita struck.\n  Now, this amendment is not cheap. I make no bones about it. It is \nabout $1 billion. It can be done on an emergency basis. This most \ncertainly is an emergency in housing.\n  So that is the essence of the amendment. The Finance Committee is \nwell aware of it. We have been talking about it with them for over a \nyear now actually. We have just been waiting for a time to get it \nfixed.\n  Now, again, this is an emergency. It is a real problem. It is almost \nApril 15. We have, I would argue, families in America who need the most \nhelp on housing. I feel very sorry for people who are losing their \nhomes in foreclosure, and I am not even going to try to say whether \nthey are suffering more than the people in the gulf south. All I can \nsay is the people in the gulf south didn't take out any adjustable \nmortgages. The people in the gulf south, most of them had already paid \ntheir 30-year mortgage. They own their house scot-free. They paid for \nit. Now they have lost everything, and we are trying to help them, but \nin my view, everything we try to do to help them kind of--sometimes it \nturns out to not help them as much as we would like. There is no \ntextbook. There is no Stafford Act. There is no way to help people who \nlost everything because of levees that should have held but didn't. We \nare making it up as we go along, and this is part of my job here to do \nthis. So we have to fix this, and that is what this amendment will do. \nI am very proud that the Senators from both States have agreed to \ncosponsor this.\n\n  On behalf of Senator Cochran, at his request--and I am happy to \nsupport it--there is also a small change in this amendment which will \nallow this deduction--this goes on the accelerated depreciation piece \nthat we gave to help some of our businesses. We lost 20,000 businesses \nthat weekend. I think Mississippi lost 1,800. That is a lot of \nbusinesses to lose over a weekend. To help those businesses and people \nget back on their feet, this Congress extended to them a way to \naccelerate their depreciation, but we said: The way to get that \naccelerated depreciation is you have to start your project by a certain \ntime and finish by a certain time. The problem is, the recovery has \nbeen so much slower than everybody anticipated because we have never \nreally gone through this catastrophic situation. Senator Cochran is \nright when he says we should eliminate the start date. We are not \nasking for an extension, so technically it really shouldn't add money. \nWe are not asking to extend it to any time or to let a lot of new \npeople come in. But for the same universe, just don't make them start \ntheir project the way it said, but let them end it. That is also in my \namendment. So we will solve two big problems: We will help our \nbusinesses, many small businesses, get the full benefit of what we \nwanted to give them anyway, actually work for them, and we will make \nthis grant program work for them.\n  Now, let me be clear. When we pass this amendment, which I hope we \nwill do by unanimous consent or get a large vote on it because I think \nwe really should do it in a bipartisan way, the people to whom we give \nthis tax break--this will lower their rate to their regular rate they \nwill have to pay. They have to go back and reimburse the Treasury for \nthat deduction they took. So, in other words, we are not allowing them \nto take two benefits. They are going to have to lower their tax this \nyear, eliminate the tax on Road Home, and go back and pay the Federal \nGovernment the benefit they took. Their CPAs will have to figure that \nout. But if we don't do this, there will be people who will be stuck \nwith a tax bill they could not possibly pay, and they shouldn't have \nto; they have suffered enough.\n  So I know the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, knows full well what is happening down in the gulf. This is \nonly one thing we are attempting to fix. I have several other \namendments I intend to offer, if my colleagues would allow me, at an \nappropriate time, but this is the amendment I wanted to get in. April \n15 is right around the corner, and they need to know what our intention \nis. This will help so many people. I appreciate it. I will ask for this \namendment to be voted on when the first group, however large that group \nis--2, 5, 6, 10--whenever the first group of amendments is voted on, I \nwould like for this to be included in that group. I ask unanimous \nconsent for that to be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will repeat for the Senator from \nConnecticut that I will be happy to take this amendment whenever, but I \nwould like it to be voted on in the first group of amendments, however \nbig that group is and whenever that group will be taken up.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, reserving the right to object, I \nwould say to my colleague, this is a tax\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\namendment, and I am very carefully deferring any questions regarding \ntax matters to the Finance Committee, to Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, as to how they want to proceed. So I really would be hesitant \nabout agreeing to--no votes have been agreed to on anything at this \npoint. I would strongly recommend that my colleague from Louisiana talk \nto Senator Baucus about this.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate that. Let me tell my colleague that I \nhave, and it is included in their tax package. So just so the Senator \nfrom Connecticut knows, I will not agree to any votes going forward \nunless this amendment is in the group. So I am fine, and I will just \nstay here. The Finance Committee is well aware of this, and they have \nactually put it in their package. My concern is that their package may \nnot ever really sort of get to the floor. There are some things in that \npackage that I think really need to be voted on. So that is OK. I will \njust stay here, and we will work on what we can do. I really appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, further, having spoken with Senator Baucus \nand his staff on this matter, they are trying to accommodate the \nvarious amendments that are being posed in the area the Senator is also \nsuggesting some ideas for, and I think they are desirous of \naccommodating as many as they can, provided it can be worked out. I \ndon't know enough about this to say any more than that. They are \nworking on it. It might make more sense to work with them to make sure \nwe are OK.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, again, I just want to be clear that I \nwould expect this to be in the first group of votes that are taken as \nwe proceed on this bill. Whether it is 2 or 3 or 10 or 20, this needs \nto be in it or I will object to going forward. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw her unanimous \nconsent or is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I have to object to any unanimous consent request at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Does my colleague from Louisiana need to be heard any \nfurther on the amendment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No. Thank you.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4401 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the \npending amendment aside so I may call up my amendment No. 4401 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4401.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a national consumer credit usury rate, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT USURY RATE.\n\n       Section 107 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1606) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) National Consumer Credit Usury Rate.--The annual \n     percentage rate applicable to any extension of credit may not \n     exceed by more than 8 percentage points the rate established \n     under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, as determined by the Board.''.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is extremely important \nbecause it addresses not only the foreclosure crisis we are seeing in \nthis country, but it is also an issue that impacts millions and \nmillions of Americans every single day of their lives well above and \nbeyond the housing crisis.\n  What this amendment essentially says is the time is long overdue for \nthis Congress to have the courage to stand up to the banks, credit card \ncompanies, and mortgage lenders who are charging outrageously high \ninterest rates and ripping off the American people. I know when I go \nback to Vermont, I talk to people who say: Why is it I am paying 20, \n25, 28 percent interest rates on my credit card? I can tell you, as a \nformer member of the Financial Services Committee in the House, we \nheard horror story after horror story about payday lending.\n  We know mortgage brokers are, in some cases, bringing forth \nunscrupulously dishonest packages that drive interest rates up far \nbeyond what should be charged in this country. This is an issue we must \naddress, and now is the time to do that.\n  Specifically, this amendment would cap all interest rates at 8 \npercent above what the IRS charges income tax deadbeats. Currently, the \nIRS charges a 6-percent interest rate to Americans who are late on \npaying their income tax returns. The IRS adjusts these rates every \nquarter based on the Federal funds rate. If the Federal funds rate \nrises, the interest rate the IRS charges late filers goes up as well. \nIf the Federal funds rate goes down, so does the interest rate the IRS \ncharges late filers.\n  If the amendment I am offering were to become law today, all interest \nrates would be capped in this country at 14 percent, including subprime \nmortgages, credit cards, auto loans, payday loans, and income tax \nrefund anticipation loans.\n  Why 14 percent? How did we come up with that magical number? Well, it \nis interesting. I will tell you why we came up with that number. In \n1991, our former colleague, the Republican Senator from New York, the \nformer chairman of the Banking Committee, as I recall, Al D'Amato, \noffered an amendment that would cap credit card interest rates at 14 \npercent. Senator D'Amato was not remembered as a radical extremist. He \nwas the chairman of the committee. Here is what is interesting. That \namendment to cap interest rates at 14 percent for credit cards won on \nthe floor of the Senate by a vote of 74 to 19; it was not even close. \nIt had strong bipartisan support.\n  If I might, obviously, 1991 was a while ago and many people who \nserved are no longer here. But a number of people who served in 1991 \nare still here today. These are the people who voted in 1991 for the \nD'Amato amendment to cap credit card interest rates at 14 percent in \nalphabetical order: Senators Akaka, Baucus, Biden, Byrd, Cochran, \nConrad, Dodd, Domenici, Grassley, Inouye, Kennedy, Kerry, Kohl, \nLautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, McCain, Mikulski, Reid, \nRockefeller, Shelby, Specter, Stevens, and Warner. Those 25 Members, in \n1991, voted to cap interest rates at 14 percent on credit cards.\n  In truth, this amendment goes beyond credit cards to other areas \nwhere people are today paying very high interest rates. Similar to my \namendment, the D'Amato amendment of 1991 was also pegged slightly above \nthe interest rates for late income tax filers. We are using the same \nformula D'Amato used.\n  Let me quote Senator D'Amato on the floor in 1991:\n\n       Fourteen percent is certainly a reasonable rate of interest \n     for banks to charge customers for credit card debt. It allows \n     a comfortable profit margin but keeps banks in line so that \n     interest rates rise and fall with the health of the economy.\n\n  Other people went to the floor and also spoke on this issue. Senator \nLieberman spoke on it and Senator Domenici spoke on it as well.\n  What I say to my colleagues is, if this legislation, which passed \nwith overwhelming support in 1991, made sense then, let me tell you, it \nmakes a lot more sense today. A recent report published by Tamara \nDraut, the director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, found \nthat one-third of all credit card holders in this country are paying \ninterest rates above 20 percent and as high as 41 percent--more than \ndouble what they paid in interest in 1990. So if we had over 70 Members \nof the Senate voting to cap interest rates at 14 percent in 1991, today \nthe vote should be even higher because the crisis is far more severe.\n  Between 1989 and 2006, Americans' overall credit card debt grew by \n315\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\npercent, from $211 billion to $876 billion. All over this country, \npeople who are not earning enough money to pay for basic needs are \nbuying groceries and gasoline to fill up their car with credit cards. \nAnd then, in turn, what happens is they are paying 20, 25 percent \ninterest rates, and we have the cycle of misery going around and \naround, where they are too poor to pay with cash, so they pay with \ncredit, and credit card interest rates are soaring, and they go deeper \ninto debt.\n  I know this is a hard vote. It is no secret to anybody in the Senate \nthat the financial services industry is enormously powerful. But it is \ntime for us to think about the folks back home who are going deeper \ninto debt and to stand with them and put a cap on interest rates.\n  One-third of low- and middle-income families reported going into \ncredit card debt to pay for rent, utilities, and food in 2006. That \nsame year, Americans charged $51 billion worth of fast food on their \ncredit card, a 29-fold increase since 2001.\n  All of this, and more, has allowed credit card companies to earn $90 \nbillion in interest in 2006 alone. I will repeat that.\n  But credit card companies are not the only ones charging outrageous \ninterest rates. That is why this amendment I am offering expands on the \nD'Amato amendment to cover all forms of loans.\n  For example, the Center for Responsible Lending has found some \nAmerican consumers are paying interest rates for payday loans as high \nas 800 percent. I think all the Senators understand this. These types \nof outrageous interests should not be allowed to continue. When the \nFederal Reserve has slashed the Federal funds rate five times, from a \nhigh of 5.25 percent to 2.25 percent, credit card interest rates should \nbe going down, not up. Interest rates for payday loans should be going \ndown, not up. If the Fed is cutting interest rates, how in God's name--\nand why--are people paying higher and higher interest rates on their \ncredit cards, their mortgages, and in other areas?\n  One of the reasons for this scam, this rip-off, is the virtual lack \nof regulation in this country when it comes to interest rates. For \nexample, credit card companies are able to raise interest rates at any \ntime for any reason. I suspect I am not the only Member of the Senate \nwho talked to a constituent who said: I pay my credit card bill on time \nevery single month, and I used to be paying 9 percent, but now they \nraised it to 14 percent. What did I do wrong? Why are they raising my \ninterest rates?\n  Every Member of the Senate has, himself or herself, received, along \nwith everybody else in this country, all these fancy prospectives that \ncome from the credit card companies, saying zero percent interest rate \nor 2 percent interest rate. But they forget to tell you in big bold \nprint what is in the little print on page 4: They can raise interest \nrates any time for any reason. You don't even have to be late paying \nyour phone bill or rent. They can raise it for any reason whatsoever.\n  One of the interesting facts, in terms of credit cards, is people \nwould be stunned to know that the credit card companies send out, every \nsingle year--do you know how many of these things they send out? Four \nbillion. We are a country of 300 million people. I thought I was \ngetting all of them but apparently not. They seem to come to my house \ntwice a day. Apparently, others are getting them as well. They send out \n4 billion of these fancy brochures, urging you to buy into the credit \ncard thing and it costs them a fortune. But, obviously, they can afford \nto do that because they are ripping off the American people, and they \nare charging 20, 25, and 30 percent, in some cases, in interest. This \nis unacceptable behavior. Lenders should not be able to raise interest \nrates at any time for any reason.\n  I am not going to go into a religious theme now. I am not going to do \nthat. But I know the Presiding Officer is a religious person and \nprobably more familiar with the Bible than I am. But he will know that \nthe word ``usury'' is mentioned in the Bible on many occasions. I will \nnot quote from them, but in Leviticus chapter 25, verses 35 to 37, the \nissue about usury rates is, in fact, addressed.\n  I will talk about Dante's ``Divine Comedy.'' In the ``Divine Comedy'' \nby Dante, he speaks about a special place for people who charge \nusurious interest rates, and that is the inner ring of the Seventh \nCircle of Hell.\n  I don't particularly wish that on the banking industry and all the \nlobbyists who come here every day. I don't wish that on them. But I do \nwish they would take a deep breath and understand that this is not just \nan economic issue, it is a moral issue. People who are struggling to \npay their bills, who are going into debt, through no fault of their \nown, should not have to pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will be very happy to yield to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I direct my question through the Chair to the Senator and \nthank him for offering the amendment and say to the Senator from \nVermont that over a year ago, while making a phone call to someone in a \nfinancial institution in New York on an unrelated issue, the person \nsaid to me: Watch out for subprime mortgages. It did not register with \nme, but I should have paid closer attention. A few months ago, while \nmaking a similar call to a financial institution in New York, the \nfellow said: Watch out for credit cards because people are shifting \ntheir debt now into credit card debt with the sky-high interest rates.\n  Many people listening may ask what is this about. This is supposed to \nbe about housing. It is not about housing. It is about the credit \nvulnerability of America. Housing is the first canary in the cage the \nSenator shared, if he will allow me to use that analogy. Credit cards \nwill quickly follow.\n  I say to the Senator from Vermont, when we debated bankruptcy reform \non the floor of the Senate 3 or 4 years ago, the credit card industry \nwas pushing that bill because they wanted credit card debt to survive \nbankruptcy so you could carry it to the grave. I put a provision in \nthat bill that said on a monthly statement for a credit card asking for \na minimum monthly payment, you have to disclose to the person holding \nthe credit card how long it would take them to pay off the balance if \nthey paid the minimum monthly payment. The credit card industry \nrefused, saying it was technically impossible to calculate. Does \nanybody believe that?\n  I say to the Senator from Vermont, they had a feature on ``NOVA,'' \nwhich I think is an extraordinary program, about credit cards. They \nheralded this one man who is the guru of credit cards who dreamed up \nlowering the percentage of minimum monthly payments from 5 percent a \nmonth to 2 percent because he created an endless stream of debt. If you \npay 2 percent, you will never catch up with yourself. You will pay debt \nforever.\n  So those who think this amendment of the Senator from Vermont is \nunrelated to our conversation about housing are wrong.\n  The last point I will make is, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nmentioning payday loans. They rip off members of the military like no \nother entity in America, and they are a blight on America's credit \nhorizon.\n  I thank the Senator for offering this amendment. My question is, Can \nI sign on as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. SANDERS. With pleasure. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude because the Senator from Illinois made \nthe point better than I can make it. Every Member of the Senate knows \nthis is a huge issue. In their heart, every Senator knows there is \nsomething immoral, that there is something outrageous about hard-\nworking people paying 25, 30 percent, especially at a time when the Fed \nis lowering interest rates.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is no great secret. The financial services \nindustry is very powerful. We all know that. They make huge campaign \ncontributions. They have a lot of power here. But I hope that on this \namendment, we have the courage to stand up to them.\n  In concluding, I remind my colleagues that in 1991, when Senator \nD'Amato offered a similar amendment, there was overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. The American people want us to act on this issue. As the \nSenator from Illinois indicated, this is directly related to the \nhousing crisis, and I think it is time we move forward and put a cap on \ninterest rates.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I commend Senator Sanders on his \namendment and look forward to supporting it. We have a lot of work to \ndo on credit cards. It is much worse than people realize in terms of \nsome of the practices the credit card industry has employed. One of my \nfavorites is trying to lure people to their limit on credit, and when \nthey get them there, raising their interest rates and telling them: \nWell, you are at your credit limit.\n  I can give many examples of how that practice is utilized, including \nsending people the check already made out so if they sign their name on \nthat check and use it, then they are at their credit limit and up pops \ntheir interest rate. All kinds of tricks are used to try to--by the \nway, don't ever try to pay off a bunch of credit cards because it is \nhard to pay them off. First, they don't want you to pay in full every \nmonth and they don't want you to pay them off. For gosh sakes, they \ndon't want you to cancel a card. They will immediately take notice you \nlost your card because they are on the hook. In fact, I pointed out in \none of the hearings we had to the credit card executives, the only \nthing that is easy to understand on this is the first line which says \nif you lose your credit card or your credit card is stolen, call this \nphone number because they know they are on the hook if the credit card \nis lost or stolen, so they are interested in you getting to them in \nthose circumstances. All the other circumstances you press this number \nand maybe you will get someone who will talk to you after you have hung \non the phone for 2 hours.\n  I do not rise to talk about credit cards today. I rise to talk about \nreverse mortgages. I have an amendment that will be called up at a \nlater time. I am proud we have been working on this amendment. We had a \nhearing on this subject in the Aging Committee. We have been working \nwith Senator Shelby and his staff. We have been working with HUD. AARP \nhas been helping with this amendment. They did a massive report that \nthey issued about reverse mortgages.\n  If we look at the subprime mess and sit back and say, what caused the \nproblem, the root of the problem is the people selling the subprime \nmortgages had no risk. If you have a risk, you are careful. If you have \nno risk, then it is very simple: I just have to close the sale.\n  We are doing the exact same thing with reverse mortgages. If you are \nwatching any cable TV--and probably way too many people in this Chamber \nare watching way too much cable TV right now because everybody is \nwatching the cable news channels because we are all addicted to the \nPresidential race and every twist and turn it encompasses--if you are \nwatching any of the cable news shows, you are seeing advertisements \nover and over again by Robert Wagner, Pat Boone, and all these \nfamiliar, trusted faces saying: You know, don't miss out. There are \nadvertisements that are being marketed to elderly people across this \ncountry that are saying: Don't pass up this Government benefit you are \nentitled to.\n  I have to tell the truth, I don't think anybody envisioned reverse \nmortgages were going to be called ``a Government benefit you are \nentitled to.'' Why are they saying that? They are saying that because \nultimately the taxpayers are on the hook for these loans.\n  Guess what. The people who are selling them are making commissions, \nand they have no risk. We kind of like these reverse mortgages around \nhere because, guess what, we make some money on it, too. That is, the \nFederal Government. So there is a push to lift the lid on how many \nreverse mortgages can be marketed to elderly people because the Federal \nGovernment is getting some of the money when they are sold. But we are \ngoing down a dangerous path because we are marketing a product that is \ncomplicated and expensive to the most vulnerable population in America.\n\n  For many of these elderly people, all they have is their home. For \nmany of these elderly people, they do not have a loved one with whom \nthey can talk about whether this financial instrument is a good idea.\n  Don't get me wrong, some reverse mortgages are good and they may be \nappropriate in some circumstances. But here is what is not appropriate: \nWe require counseling. We have appropriated a whopping $300 million for \ncounseling. They have to have counseling in every case, so guess who is \npaying for the counseling? Bad news: The lenders are paying for the \ncounseling. So the same people who want to close the loans are paying \nthe counselors who are supposed to be giving these elderly people \nadvice that is unbiased as to whether this is a good idea for them.\n  The amendment will step up to the plate and say we are not going to \nrepeat the subprime fiasco with the Nation's ``greatest generation.'' \nWe are going to, in fact, fund the counselors so they get good, \nindependent information. We are going to make sure those counselors are \ncertified. Right now, they can have a criminal record, they can have no \ntraining. This is the wild, wild west out there selling a financial \nproduct that is expensive and complicated to our elderly. It does not \ntake a rocket scientist to figure out that is a dangerous combination.\n  The other thing this amendment does is it is going to prohibit \nsomeone who is marketing one of these reverse mortgages from being able \nto sell another product. Believe it or not, there are actually some \npeople who are sitting down with elderly people right now in America \nsaying: We are going to get you a reverse mortgage and, by the way, at \nthe same time, we are going to sell you a deferred annuity. I don't \nknow how these people look themselves in a mirror.\n  We had a witness in front of our committee whose mother was in her \neighties and sold a deferred annuity and a reverse mortgage at the same \ntime. It is unconscionable to make the sale and make the money. It is a \nget-rich-quick scheme for some of these sales people. If we can provide \ncertified counselors who are truly independent to make sure that every \nelderly person understands exactly what they are getting into, and if \nwe can make sure they are not being marketed products that are \ninappropriate by the same people who are selling them reverse \nmortgages, and if we can make sure we are not closing a blind eye to \nthis because we are benefiting in the short run from the marketing of \nthese products, then I think reverse mortgages have an appropriate \nplace as one potential help to people in their elderly years who need \nto get the equity out of their homes for emergencies or medical bills \nor even to send a loved one to college. Right now, it is a dangerous \nsituation.\n  I look forward to hopefully having unanimous, bipartisan support for \nthis amendment. As I say, HUD has been very helpful in drafting this \nlanguage, along with AARP, along with our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. It is well thought out. I think it is very appropriate, \nnoncontroversial. It is not opposed by the industry. There are many \ngood guys who are doing this work. We want to make sure we are \nprotecting the elderly from the bad guys and making sure we are not \nstanding here 5 years from now saying: Why didn't we do something about \nreverse mortgages? It is the same kind of dangerous mix we have in the \nsubprime mortgages.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before our colleague from Missouri leaves \nthe floor, I thank her. She has done a terrific job on this proposal. I \nknow she is working with Senator Shelby and others on the committee in \ncrafting this proposal in a way that can make a difference.\n  Our colleague is absolutely correct in describing this problem. It is \ndespicable in many ways how people are being lured into arrangements \nthey cannot afford. It would be devastating for them economically. I \nthank her for the proposal and let her know we are going to do \neverything we can in these hours of trying to work this out to \naccommodate this very important idea. She has put in tremendous effort \non this issue and needs to be recognized. I thank the Senator from \nMissouri, and we will try to be helpful on this amendment. I thank the \nSenator for raising it.\n  My colleague from Vermont, Senator Sanders, who has left the Chamber, \noffered his amendment. I listened to my colleague from Missouri. I \nspent the\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nlast 20 years or so dealing with the credit card industry and various \nproblems with it. I have not done terribly well, I might point out, \ntrying to modify some of these ideas that have become outrageous. \nSenator Carl Levin of Michigan cares deeply about the issue as well. We \nhave been preoccupied with the housing issue, obviously, in the Banking \nCommittee over the last year, but we are also crafting legislation \ndealing with the credit card companies.\n  Many are doing the right things today. Some of the major companies \nare. I don't want to suggest here it is an indictment of every credit \ncard company, nor do any of us have any objection to credit cards. It \nhas been a tremendously valuable vehicle for a significant number of \nconsumers. But an abuse of the process, and where literally they are \ntargeting some of the most vulnerable people in our society and \ntargeting them in such a way where the slightest delay, even an hour or \nso, can add significant cost, fees, and an interest rate climb, makes \nit virtually impossible for some people to ever get out from underneath \ntheir credit card debt.\n\n  The average person in this country today, an adult, has a revolving \ndebt exceeding $9,300, getting close to $10,000, I was told the other \nday. And 95 percent of that is credit card debt. This is, obviously, \nheading in the wrong direction at a time when we have a negative \nsavings rate and consumer debt is mounting. We need to be doing \neverything we can to make it possible for people to have credit cards, \nfor the credit card industry to make a legitimate profit in that \nindustry--that is critically important--but not to make it impossible \nfor people to pay off these obligations and to get their lives in \norder.\n  This is one of the concerns I had with the bankruptcy bill a few \nyears ago when it was adopted; that bankruptcy legislation made it so \ndifficult for people with credit cards to get out from under those \nobligations if they took the bankruptcy act. So there are a lot of \nissues to talk about, and Senator Sanders has raised an important issue \nand certainly Senator McCaskill has as well in talking about these \nproblems. I want my colleagues to know that at some point we are going \nto craft legislation dealing with this issue in a comprehensive and \nthoughtful manner so we don't allow the abuses to go on where people \nnever, ever can manage to climb out from under those obligations, \nsaddling them with lifelong economic burdens and making it impossible \nfor them to accumulate wealth and provide for the needs of their \nfamilies.\n  So I appreciate very much their raising these concerns as they have \nthis evening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 4419 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I see my \ncolleague from Montana is here, and we need to see the amendment, first \nof all. I have no idea what the amendment is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the amendment I was attempting to offer is \na bipartisan amendment on renewable energy at a time when our country \nis looking for cleaner sources of energy. We are also looking for more \ndomestic sources of energy and at ways to help our economy. This \nhousing bill is not just a housing bill, it is a bill to help our \neconomy. It is a bill to keep us from going further into recession. The \namendment I introduce is a bill Senator Cantwell and I have worked on \nfor the last several weeks because there has been an impasse on \nrenewable energy legislation. The offsets that were included in the \noriginal bill were unacceptable. And because there are going to be very \nfew vehicles that are moving this year, we are trying to get this \namendment on this bill to try to get renewable tax credits included so \nit can be signed into law this year.\n  The problem is, if you wait too long on these renewable tax credits, \nthese businesses will shut down because they require time in advance \nfor planning and business development. So it is critical we get this \ndone.\n  I know the chairman of the Finance Committee is working on a bill, he \nis working on some offsets, but the problem I see with what he is doing \nis it may not pass later on in the year, and it also may be too late. \nSo this bill may be the best vehicle we have to ensure America becomes \nless dependent on foreign sources of oil and other energy sources. It \nmay be the last chance we have to preserve over 100,000 jobs in the \nUnited States that have been and can be created in the renewables \nindustry. And it may be the last chance we have this year to \nsignificantly help the environment in America.\n  So I appreciate that the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee \nhas objected to us bringing up this amendment, but we are going to \ncontinue to try to get this amendment on this bill. Mr. President, I \nthink it is a mistake at this critical time for renewables and for our \ncountry that an objection has been made to our offering of this \namendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all of us are concerned about ways to \nprotect and to make our country more self-sufficient in the production \nof energy. We have made many attempts on this floor, in fact a major \nbill was voted on last year and was actually one vote shy of the \nnecessary 60 votes.\n  Many of us are working here, including the Senator from Nevada, as \nwell as the Senator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, to find a way to \nbring up a significant energy bill later this year. There are various \ncandidate bills for that. One is something called the extenders, and I \nthink that is one of several ways where we can get this done. Extenders \nis going to pass. That is not an idle bill. It is going to pass.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Ensign is unpaid for, and, to be \nhonest, I frankly think the other body--some of them are called Blue \nDogs--is not going to put up with it. We have to pay for an energy \nbill, and we are working on the offsets so we can get it paid for and \nso we can get it enacted into law.\n  So I think, at this point, it would be a mistake to bring up this \nversion because it would not survive a point of order challenge, and I \nurge the Senator from Nevada to work with the Finance Committee, work \nwith others together, in a concerted way, to get something passed \nrather than going solo and trying on his own to push something that is \nnot part of a team but, rather, as an individual. Because individual \nefforts are not going to be as successful as team efforts, and so I \nurge the Senator to be a part of the team so we can get this thing \npassed.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Through the Chair, I will be glad to.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we have over 20 cosponsors of the bill we \nintroduced today. It is a bipartisan effort. We are working as part of \na team. What we are trying to do is work together.\n  So I would ask the Senator: With 20 Republicans and Democrats \ncosponsoring this bill together, does he consider them to be working as \nindividuals or as part of a team? We will probably have over 50 \ncosponsors by the early part of next week. It seems to me that the way \nthe Senate works is getting people together and not worrying about \nwhether you are a Republican or Democrat but worrying about what is \nright for the American people. That is what we are attempting to do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate the Senator wanting to be part of the \nteam. There is another number here called 60. And it is my judgment \nthat with more working together on measures with others, the greater \nthe likelihood we will get this passed. We all want it passed. Let us \ndo it in the context and in a forum in which we can get it passed.\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw that \namendment for a moment so we can make sure everyone has copies of it. I \nwill use this time now to speak on the amendment, and then I will offer \nit when I have completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not yet pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4421 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the amendment I will be offering shortly, \nalong with Senator Ensign, is an amendment that would try to help the \nhousing market itself. It would provide a tax credit, a temporary tax \ncredit just for this next year, for residential home purchases. It is \nfor someone who is using the house as their primary residence. It would \nbe a $7,000 credit spread out over 2 years. It would be aimed at trying \nto get people to buy homes today.\n  As I am sure you are aware and as has been explained on this floor, \nthere is a glut on the housing market. There are so many homes that \npeople are trying to sell, and potential buyers are reluctant to come \nin to purchase a home because they don't know whether the value will go \ndown. They are waiting. They are sitting it out.\n  It was the housing market that triggered our current downturn in the \neconomy. We need to pay attention to the housing market in order to get \nour economy back on track.\n  The intent of this amendment is to get more interest by home buyers \nso they will buy homes today knowing that the Government, through a tax \ncredit, is covering some of their risks and making it more affordable \nfor them to be able to buy a home. That is exactly what this amendment \nwould do.\n  Senator Ensign and I have crafted this amendment so it is temporary. \nIt is available only for the next year. We have crafted it so it is \ntargeted. It only applies to first-time home buyers, those who are most \nin need. In the Nation, approximately 35 percent of those who buy homes \nare first-time home buyers. In my own city of Baltimore, it is closer \nto 65 percent. So it is a large number of people who are potentially in \nthe market, but they are the most reluctant--those who do not own homes \ntoday are the most reluctant to come in and buy a home because of the \nuncertainty in the market. It is targeted in that it only applies to \nthose of limited income, middle-income families. It uses the same \ndollar limits that are currently used in the District of Columbia tax \ncredit that has been so successful in encouraging families to buy homes \nwithin our Nation's Capital. About 3,000 to 4,000 individuals every \nyear take advantage of the tax credit we provide for the residents of \nthe District to buy a home.\n  This credit, which is temporary and which is targeted, which is aimed \nat middle-income families, which is aimed at first-time home buyers, \nwhich is aimed at getting more interest among consumers into our \nhousing so we can try to help our economy--I think it is the right \ncomplement to the legislation that is before us.\n  The legislation before us is aimed at trying to help people to be \nable to find mortgages. It is aimed at dealing with homes that are in \nforeclosure, trying to allow people to stay in their homes, and \nallowing local governments to have more ability to deal with \nrefinancing homes for those who have subprime mortgages. I have already \ntalked on the floor about this issue. It is aimed at trying to get \nbetter advice to people who may be buying homes, and it also has a tax \ncredit. I acknowledge Senator Isakson, who has worked on that. It deals \nwith distressed properties. I would also like to acknowledge that my \ncolleague, Senator Stabenow, has been a longtime proponent of tax \ncredits to stimulate home buys. This amendment is aimed at generating \nmore interest in home buys so we can help bring our economy back to \nrecovery.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Ensign, for his input in helping to \ncraft this amendment and his cosponsorship of it. I urge our colleagues \nto consider that.\n  Mr. President, I now offer that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself and Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 4421 to amendment \n     number 4387.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit \n   against income tax for the purchase of a principal residence by a \n                         first-time homebuyer)\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n               TITLE _--FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT\n\n     SEC. _01.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to applaud the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin, for his great work. It has been a pleasure \nworking with his staff and with him personally on this very important \namendment.\n  We are trying to help the housing situation in the United States. My \nState, Nevada, leads in foreclosures. I saw a statistic the other day \nthat, after a record month of foreclosures in February, foreclosures in \nMarch were up another 50 percent over February. So it is a huge \nproblem. There are a lot of young people out there--first-time home \nbuyers--who want to get into the marketplace to try to participate in \nthe American dream. That is what this amendment is about. It is \ntargeted right at those young people, or the single person, who is \ntrying to buy a home for the first time. And maybe they might even be a \nlittle older but have never been able to afford a home until now. This \nmight be the economic incentive to get them into owning their home for \nthe first time.\n  There are so many benefits to home ownership. There is more of a \nsense of community when you are paying property taxes; you care more \nabout the schools; you care more about where those taxes are going.\n  So this is an excellent amendment at a great time when we are trying \nto help the housing market. But we will also be helping individual \nAmericans with this tax credit at the same time. I wish to applaud the \nleadership of Senator Cardin on this. We worked together well when we \nwere both on the Ways and Means Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives. This is another example of what bipartisanship can be \nabout. It is about putting the country before your party and looking \nfor solutions that actually work. So I am proud to cosponsor this \namendment and be the lead Republican on it. I hope this amendment can \nbe adopted as part of the final package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague again from \nNevada, the two of us did work together very closely in the other body, \nand now it is a real pleasure to serve together in this body. It is a \ngreat honor.\n  I think the comments the Senator has made about home ownership are so \nimportant. Home ownership is critically important to our country. We \nknow where there is home ownership, schools are better, the crime is \nless.\n  One of the statistics I found very interesting was a study in Chicago \nthat there was a distinct relationship in a neighborhood between the \nnumber of foreclosures and the rise of violent crime. This is an issue \nthat should involve all of us.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Dodd. He has done a great service to our \nNation in being able to bring forward a bill that has bipartisan \nsupport. That is not easy today; it is very difficult. We now have the \nopportunity to move forward.\n  I was explaining to Senator Dodd that one of my constituents a little \nbit earlier this evening said: You know, we are so encouraged that \nDemocrats and Republicans could come together on a housing bill, that \nthere is now hope we can act quickly.\n  What he said to me is interesting. He said: You know, there are a lot \nof good things in this bill. I think I could have done it better. There \nare some things I would like to have seen in there. But what I like is \nyou are able to move, you are able to get something done. It is a real \nsignal to this country that Congress is engaged on the housing crisis \nand wants to do something to help that person who today is in danger of \nlosing his or her home because of a foreclosure, or is in danger of \nwalking away.\n  One of the things I found amazing is 50 percent of people walk away \nfrom their homes; they do not even try. This bill will give them hope \nthat the Government is on their side. It can provide some additional \nfinancing, it is going to provide some additional help and counseling, \nit is going to provide an opportunity for that person to maintain the \nAmerican dream.\n  The American dream is about being able to succeed in this country. \nThe most visible sign is owning a home. A lot of people are going to \nlose their homes as a result of this recession. This legislation will \nmake it possible for more Americans to save their homes.\n  The amendment Senator Ensign and I are offering is a way in which we \nbelieve, I think our colleagues believe, that this body has a \nresponsibility to help build our economy. One of the ways we can do it \nis by encouraging more home ownership.\n  This amendment, by providing a tax credit, is saying: The Government \nis on your side. Go now, buy a home, we will help you hedge against the \npotential risk and make it a little more affordable for you to own a \nhome.\n  I encourage my colleagues to accept that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from Maryland a \npoint of clarification for the Members. This amendment is an additional \ntax credit in addition to the one that is already in the bill; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CARDIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. So what you are doing, you leave targeted the stimulus\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nto absorb the foreclosed properties, but you add a stimulus for first-\ntime home buyers in the marketplace?\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I wanted to make sure that is reflected in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Maryland \nfor his generous comments about the effort and to also commend him and \nSenator Ensign and others who are working on these ideas to provide \nsome relief and some opportunity for people. I think he said it well.\n  It becomes almost axiomatic, maybe it is becoming overused, but it \ncertainly captures what all of us feel. That is, there is no greater \nwealth creator, there is nothing more to stabilize a family or a \ncommunity, there is nothing that does more for families than having a \nstable, reliable home. It sounds maybe silly to some people.\n  I am old enough to remember when this issue was never a partisan \nissue. In fact, some of the strongest advocates of affordable shelter \ncame from some of the most conservative Members of this body \nhistorically. Going back, I recall as a young man growing up listening \nto the distinguished Senators from Alabama and others, they were ``Mr. \nHousing'' in those days. They made a huge difference. This was an issue \nwhere we all worked together to see to it that families and individuals \nhad the opportunity to have affordable shelter.\n  So our colleague from Maryland is absolutely correct. In fact, you \ncould make the case even more so today. And to watch what has happened \nover the last relatively short period of time, values decreasing, \nprices falling, which has been good news to some degree, except that \nobviously as supply increases demand and neighborhoods deteriorate--we \nwere talking about the city of Baltimore.\n  I do not know if my colleague heard me talking about Bridgeport, CT, \nthe other day. I have a new mayor that got elected, Bill Finch, former \nState Senator in Connecticut. He got elected to be mayor in my biggest \ncity in Connecticut. He walks in to be mayor, he has got between 5,000 \nand 6,000 foreclosures in a city in Fairfield County, one of the most \naffluent counties in America, hearing as many as 6,000 families could \nbe losing their homes in the coming days.\n  So his point here about how to make sure we rehabilitate, provide \nopportunity, create those ideas and thoughts that will make it possible \nfor people to move into a home, to acquire a home, is critically \nimportant.\n  I commend him for that, thank him for his generous comments about the \neffort here tonight.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank again the Senator from Connecticut. The \ncircumstances in Baltimore, in Maryland, in June we ranked 40th in the \nNation in foreclosures. We now rank in the teens, 18th in foreclosures. \nThe number of foreclosures in communities where we never thought we \nwould see foreclosures is recordbreaking. That is not the type of \nrecords we want to have.\n  So as the Senator knows, it not only affects that homeowner who is \ngoing to potentially lose his or her home, it affects every house in \nthe community. I was talking with some of the housing authority people, \nsome of the people from the nonprofit community who work with these \nneighborhoods, and the cost to the neighborhood is staggering when you \nhave foreclosed properties. So we are going to have to do something \nabout that.\n  But it would be a lot better investment that we prevent the \nforeclosures for those who are financially able to stay in their homes. \nI think that is what your legislation does. I applaud you for that. \nEvery person we can keep in the home who can afford to stay there will \nbenefit many more people in that community. By the way, it is good for \nlocal Government. It will help their property tax revenues. It is good \nfor local governments; I think it will reduce their costs. I think it \nis a win-win situation. So I congratulate you for bringing forward a \nbill we can act on quickly, in order to save homes for people who \notherwise are likely to lose their homes and to strengthen \nneighborhoods that would otherwise be suffering as a result of those \nforeclosures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to first extend my \nappreciation to the Senator in the chair for the courtesy he extended \nto me earlier with regard to the duties of the Presiding Officer. The \nSenator from Vermont is very kind.\n  Later on, I will be offering an amendment with Senator Coleman, and \nwe think this is an amendment that will possibly be accepted. So I am \ngoing to wait and not offer the amendment until Senator Coleman is able \nto be here.\n  But I wish to go on and set the record of what this amendment would \nbe. Under current law, if a person has a 401(k) retirement plan and \nthey want to buy a house and it is to be their principal residence, \nthey can take up to $10,000 out of their retirement plan for the \npurchase of that house and not pay the penalty under law for taking \nassets out of their retirement plan.\n  Now, since that is available to us under current law, would it not \nmake sense for a person, if they are about to lose their home, their \nprincipal residence, to be able to take money out of their retirement \nplan in order to save their home from foreclosure, if it were done in a \nlimited period of time, if it were the principal residence for them, \nnot to have to pay that 10-percent penalty?\n  So that is the essence of the amendment. It would allow a person, \nunder these circumstances, and this would only be available for 2 \nyears, given the fact that now is the time of the foreclosure crisis, \nthat the homeowner, on their principal residence, could then take \n$25,000 out of their retirement plan without having to pay that \npenalty.\n  Now, of course, if they keep it out, they are then going to have to \npay income tax on that, which has up to that point been nontaxable \nbecause it has been in the retirement plan. But if they put it back in \nwithin a 3-year period, they would avoid the income tax.\n  So we are trying to make it available under the theory that if it is \ngoing to purchase a home and to give someone a break by going into \ntheir retirement savings, then it ought to be good public policy to \nhelp them save their home from foreclosure by going into their \nretirement savings in order to save their home.\n  That is why we think, at least from the early signals from the staff \non both sides of the aisle, this would be a salutary amendment that may \nget some serious consideration to accept.\n  This benefit is limited to 2 years, so it is not going to be \npermanent. So it will address the situation here. Why? Because in most \ninstances, for Americans, their home is the single source of wealth for \nthose Americans. So it makes sense, it makes common sense, to allow \nhomeowners to use every tool available to stay in their own home and \navoid foreclosure and save their greatest investment.\n  So I am certainly encouraging my colleagues to support this \namendment, and at the appropriate time, with the approval of the \nchairman of the committee, we will actually offer the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 7:40 \ntonight, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following two \namendments, with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to the \nvote; that if a point of order is raised against any of the amendments \ncovered in this agreement for tonight and Friday and a motion to waive \nthe appropriate point of order is made, then there be 2 minutes of \ndebate with respect to the waiver prior to a vote on the motion to \nwaive, equally divided and controlled in the usual form; and that upon \nthe use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments in the order listed for today and Friday: \nMurray-Schumer amendment No. 4397, and the Kyl amendment No. 4407; that \nwhen the Senate resumes consideration of the bill on Friday, the Senate \nthen proceed to vote in relation to the following two amendments: \nVoinovich-\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nStabenow amendment No. 4406 and the Landrieu, et al., amendment No. \n4389, with no amendment in order to the amendments prior to a vote; \nthat in the sequence of votes for today and Friday, after the first \nvote, the remaining vote be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, but I will not \nobject, it is my understanding it would be the intention of the \nmajority leader that immediately following the prayer and pledge and \nthe opening of the session, we would begin the votes, that there would \nnot be a long period of leader time taken in speaking by the leaders; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am always very short in my speeches. \nBut we will have to talk to Senator McConnell. I am happy to set a good \nexample and have about a minute and a half.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that very much. I do not object, therefore.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I said 7:40. Let me modify the request and \nsay 7:30. I was trying to provide a little leeway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4397\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with respect to Murray-Schumer amendment No. \n4397, I make a point of order that the amendment violates section \n201(a) of S. Con. Res. 21 of the 110th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 201(b) of S. Con. \nRes. 21 of the 110th Congress, I move to waive the point of order for \nthe consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, there are 2 minutes to be \nequally divided for debate.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what our amendment simply does is provide \nan additional $100 million for counseling so families do not go into \nforeclosure. There is $15 billion in spending in this underlying bill, \nall of which is being declared an emergency. It seems to me that $100 \nmillion of it, which is a small additional amount compared to that $15 \nbillion, that we know has a 96-percent success rate of keeping families \nin their home so they do not go into foreclosure, is a very smart \ninvestment.\n  I think it would be very foolish to block this on a budget point of \norder because it is one of the few issues in this bill that will \nactually keep people in their homes and prevent this crisis from \ngetting larger.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the budget point of order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jack Reed of \nRhode Island be listed as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the motion to waive?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I agreed to provide an \nadditional $100 million for foreclosure counseling. This is already in \naddition to the $180 million provided for the same purpose earlier.\n  It is my strong belief that we should conduct some due diligence on \nthe money we have already provided to ensure that it is being spent \nproperly and, most importantly, that it is actually helping people.\n  In the interest of reaching an accommodation, I agreed to provide an \nadditional $100 million. It is in the amendment. This brings the total \nspending for counseling for 2008 up to $280 million, an amount that \nrepresents a $238 million increase from last year. That is a lot of \nmoney.\n  If there is a gap between what we have provided and what is needed, \nthat need can be addressed through the normal appropriations process.\n  I think a point of order has already been raised. I hope it will be \nsustained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator \nfrom New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from \nHawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Webb) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, under section 904, I move to waive the Budget \nAct, and I will ask for the yeas and nays after the presentation by \nSenator Baucus and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the motion to waive?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds out of my time.\n  This is not a proper amendment--\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment essentially indexes the \ncapital gains exclusion for the sale of a home. The problem is that \nhomes are decreasing in value, not that they are increasing, and most \npeople who are trying to sell their homes have a much lower market \nvalue for their house. Therefore, this is not a necessary provision for \nthem.\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n  This amendment would apply to others who are not subprime candidates \nwho are in good shape and have nothing to do with the subprime issue, \nand I don't think we want to index for them at this point. It is $50 \nbillion that is the cost. It is unpaid for. This swallows up the \nhousing bill. This is not the proper time, and that is why the point of \norder should stand because it violates the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. We all know \nthat for individuals, there is a $250,000 exclusion from capital gain \nwhen you sell your owner-occupied property. For a couple, it is \n$500,000. But just like the AMT, it is not indexed for inflation. This \namendment indexes that for inflation. That is all it does.\n  Now, to my colleague saying that home values are going down, here are \ntwo statistics. I will cite one for the Nation and one for one State. \nTen years ago, the median family priced home was $146,000. Today, it is \n$247,000. That is $100,000. In California, the median price 10 years \nago was $186,000, roughly. It was $409,000 in February of this year, an \nincrease of $222,000. The reality is that inflation has caused a \ntremendous increase in the value of homes, and when they are sold, \npeople are going to have to pay the capital gains tax above $250,000.\n  Could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent for 15 \nseconds to make the point that the cost of this is $2.1 billion over 5 \nyears, not the number the chairman indicated.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on my remaining time, the cost is $15 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Mr. KYL. Ten years.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are taking 10-year numbers here. That is all we are \ntalking about is 10 years, $15 billion.\n  Second, this is not targeted to people who need it the most. Who \nneeds it the most are those people whose homes are declining in value, \nnot those homes that are increasing in value.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thought the yeas and nays had been ordered, \nbut I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the \nSenator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), the Senator from North Dakota \n(Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Webb) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a soldier \nfrom Kentucky who has fallen in the war on terror. SFC Lance S. Cornett \nof London, KY, was killed while engaging the enemy in a firefight near \nRamadi, Iraq, on February 3, 2006. He was 33 years old.\n  As a special operations soldier, Sergeant First Class Cornett was \namong the most elite of the men and women who make up our fighting \nforces. A veteran of nearly 15 years, he received many awards, medals, \nand decorations throughout his career, including nine Army Achievement \nMedals, four Army Commendation Medals, the Joint Service Commendation \nMedal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Purple Heart, and \nthree Bronze Star Medals for Valor.\n  As a highly trained member of a special operations team, Sergeant \nFirst Class Cornett also earned the prestigious Ranger and Sapper tabs.\n  ``He was a very dedicated soldier, loving husband, and devoted father \nand grandfather,'' says Lance's wife, Sandra. ``Lance lived by and died \nby the words `Don't Ever Give Up.' He taught us all to do the same.''\n  Lance's 10-year-old daughter, Cheyenne, adds simply, ``I hope to \nfollow in my dad's footsteps one day, and it was truly an honor to be \nhis daughter. He was a true American soldier.''\n  Lance's father, Rhudell Cornett, served as a Marine for 22 years, \nrising to the rank of master gunnery sergeant. But having a Marine \nsergeant for a father did not stop young Lance from sometimes getting \ninto trouble. I'll let his mother, Karen McMullen, explain.\n  ``While Lance's father was in the Marines, when Lance was three and \nhis sister was four, and we were temporarily assigned to a base in \nAlbany, GA, Lance decided to use the neighbor's golf cart and take his \nsister for a ride,'' she says. ``They went through the side of a \ntrailer.''\n  Growing up, young Lance loved to camp, fish, ski, and go caving. He \nenjoyed outdoor sports. He collected dragon figurines. ``Eye of the \nTiger,'' from the movie ``Rocky III,'' was his favorite song.\n  Lance's sister, Cristal Chesnut, has fond memories of her brother. \n``He was my best friend,'' Cristal says. ``We went to school together. \nWe worked together at McDonald's and we did everything together.''\n  Lance went on to graduate from London's Laurel County High School. \nFollowing in the footsteps of his father and other veteran relatives, \nLance enlisted in the U.S. Army as an infantryman in August 1991.\n  He made the Army his career and sought to advance as far as he could, \neventually becoming a special operations soldier. Special operations \nsoldiers serve as the tip of the spear in our country's war on \nterrorism. Sergeant First Class Cornett had to endure rigorous military \ntraining to earn that position.\n  That training included successful completion of the air assault \ncourse, the basic airborne course, the sniper\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\ncourse, the special forces diving supervisor course, and the military \nfreefall jumpmaster course.\n  I mentioned earlier that Sergeant First Class Cornett also earned his \nRanger and Sapper tabs. That meant he had successfully completed combat \nleadership training at the Army's Ranger school and in a Sapper leader \ncourse.\n  Lance was eventually assigned to the HHC Company, U.S. Army Special \nOperations Command, based in Fort Bragg, NC. His father, Rhudell, \nbought Lance a huge sword with a skull and crossbones on it that became \nhis unit's official team logo.\n  Even while remaining the consummate soldier, Lance never lost sight \nof the simple pleasures of helping others. His wife, Sandra, tells us \none story that illustrates this.\n  ``We were in London one winter and it was really cold outside and \nsnowing,'' Sandra recalls. ``We passed a homeless man. Lance went down \nthe street and went back until he found [him and] he gave him the coat \noff of his back and all of the money he had. He was that type of \nperson.''\n  His mother, Karen, tells another story that reveals the same sense of \ncaring and compassion in the man everyone else called ``Lance,'' but \nshe called ``Lanny.''\n  ``Lance came home on leave before he was married,'' she says. ``His \nuncle Rayne Smith wanted to build a brick firepit in his back yard. He \nasked Lanny to help him. They went to buy the bricks and then Rayne \nsaid, `I don't know how many to get.'\n  ``Lanny said, `Let's put it together here in the parking lot and then \nwe'll know for sure.' They built the entire firepit in the parking lot \nbefore bringing the bricks home.''\n  Lance got married on February 10, 1996, to Sandra S. Cornett at the \nLaurel County Courthouse. Together they raised three wonderful \nchildren, Brandy Hart Rudy, Christopher Hart, and Breanna Cheyenne \nCornett.\n  When Lance was home with his family, he would enjoy their company, \nand get down on the floor to play with his children. One time his \nmother asked him, ``How do you do what you do?''\n  Lance said to her, ``I turn my baseball cap the right way when I'm \nhome and backwards when I'm not. I separate my work from my life.'' But \nwhether at home or at work, Lance excelled at and was loved in both.\n  Lance was buried in Manchester, KY, and his uncle Rayne delivered the \neulogy at the funeral. In London, England, they also held a memorial \nservice. This was because Lance's special operations unit had once \nserved alongside a British unit, and Lance earned so much respect from \nthese men that they created a memorial to him and just this last \nNovember 11, Veterans Day, placed a wreath there to honor his life.\n  Recently, Lance's family received a visit from a soldier who was with \nLance the day he died. This soldier stayed with Lance for 45 minutes \nafter he had been shot, covering him and sheltering him in a ditch \nuntil he could be recovered.\n  He received the Silver Star for his heroic efforts. ``He is a \nwonderful man,'' Lance's mother Karen said about the warrior who became \nlike a brother to her son on his last day on this Earth.\n  Mr. President, my prayers are with the Cornett family after the \ntragic loss of their husband, father, brother and son. We are thinking \ntoday of his wife, Sandra S. Cornett; his daughter, Breanna Cheyenne \nCornett; his stepchildren, Christopher Hart and Brandy Hart Rudy and \nher husband, Benjamin Rudy; his mother, Karen McMullen; his sister, \nCristal Chesnut and her husband, Jimmy, and their son, Jesse; his step-\ngrandchildren, Logan and Taylor Rudy; his grandmother, Mary Lou Egan \nhis uncle Rayne Smith, along with his wife Pam and their family; his \nuncle Warren ``Jopo'' Egan, along with his wife Patti and their family; \nand many other beloved family members and friends. Since Lance's \npassing, his father, Rhudel Cornett, has also sadly left us.\n  I have tried to describe Lance Cornett as best I can, Mr. President, \nbut his mother, Karen, knows and understands her son more than I could \never hope to. So I will let her have the closing words.\n  ``He was and is the finest man I've ever known, and it was an honor \nto be his mom,'' she says.\n  It is also an honor for this U.S. Senate to pay tribute to SFC Lance \nS. Cornett's lifetime of service. He gave his life in the performance \nof that service. Our Nation is richer today for the sacrifice he made \non behalf of freedom's cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2425-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2425-S2426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH OPTIONS PROGRAM (SHOP) ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bipartisan bill \nwith Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Coleman to make health \ncoverage more accessible and affordable for small businesses and the \nself-employed.\n  In Illinois and across the Nation, families and individuals agonize \nover the availability and rising cost of health insurance. Those who \ndon't have health insurance desperately want it. And those who have \nhealth coverage realize how easily they could lose it.\n  Health insurance premiums continue to rise faster than wages and the \nrate of inflation, placing a great strain on businesses and family \nbudgets.\n  We are seeing the consequences. People are less likely to receive \nhealth coverage through their employer today than in 2000. And the \nnumber of uninsured Americans has soared to 47 million, largely because \nof this drop in employer-sponsored coverage.\n  While everyone is struggling with rising health costs and reduced \nhealth coverage, small businesses and the self-employed experience \nthese problems most acutely.\n  Workers in the smallest businesses are almost three times as likely \nto be uninsured as those who work for the largest businesses.\n  And when you look at who makes up the uninsured, you find that over \n60 percent are either self-employed or work for business with fewer \nthan 100 employees.\n  This disparity is not because small businesses don't want to offer \nhealth insurance. It occurs because small businesses face more \nobstacles than large employers when they seek coverage.\n  Administrative costs for health insurance are higher for small \nbusinesses than larger businesses. About 20-25 percent of a small \nbusiness's premium goes to administrative expenses, compared to about \n10 percent for large employers. Small businesses are less able to \nspread the risk of someone getting sick than large employers. Even a \nsingle employee with a serious medical condition can cause a dramatic \nincrease in a small business's health insurance premium. Small \nbusinesses are also more likely to have lower wages and narrower profit \nmargins than large businesses, making it more difficult for employers \nand employees to cover the cost of health coverage. Our bill addresses \neach of these problems. This is not comprehensive health care reform. \nWe leave that to the next President.\n\n  But our legislation addresses one of the most serious weaknesses in \nour current health coverage system, by making health coverage more \naccessible and affordable for small businesses and the self-employed.\n  More than a year ago, Senator Lincoln and I reached out to the \nNational Federation of Independent Business and the National \nAssociation of Realtors to see if it was possible to find common ground \non an issue that previously could not move forward in a closely divided \nSenate. We indicated a willingness to make changes to the approach we \ntook during the previous Congress, and they expressed a desire to work \nwith us to try to find a middle ground that would allow us to move \nforward in a bipartisan manner.\n  Over the course of many months, we have succeeded in finding that \nmiddle ground. With the contributions of Senators Snowe and Coleman, we \nhave developed a bill that provides practical solutions to the very \nreal problems small businesses and the self-employed face in today's \nhealth insurance system.\n  Our bill has three core elements: purchasing pools for small \nbusinesses and the self-employed; health insurance rating reforms; and \ntax credits.\n  Our bill would create incentives for States to establish purchasing \npools and would create a national pool that we call SHOP, the Small \nBusiness Health Options Program, for small businesses with up to 100 \nemployees\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nand for the self-employed. Purchasing pools will lower administrative \ncosts, provide more private health insurance plans for employers and \nemployees to choose from, and enhance competition by making it easier \nto compare those plans and pick the one that best meets particular \nneeds.\n  Our bill would prohibit insurers from setting premiums based on \nhealth status in both the national SHOP pool and in States' small group \nmarkets. Over time, the rating rules in SHOP would reduce insurers' \nability to use other factors in setting premiums in order to reduce the \nwide variation in premiums that often exists today. The bill would \nprovide incentives for states to adopt similar rating rules. These \nrating changes will make premiums more stable from year to year and \nmake coverage more affordable for those who need it most.\n  To lower the cost of health coverage, our bill would provide a tax \ncredit to small businesses with up to 50 workers who pay at least 60 \npercent of their employees' premiums. The size of the tax credit would \nbe targeted to the size of the business. The full tax credit of $1,000 \nfor self-only coverage and $2,000 for family coverage would be \navailable to the smallest businesses, with the value of the tax credit \nphased down as the size of the employer increases. Employers who cover \nmore than 60 percent of the premium would be rewarded with a bonus \ncredit.\n  In addition, we would begin moving to a system where individual \nemployees would be able to choose their own health plan instead of \nhaving their employer choose. Where rating rules permit it, each worker \nwould be able to enroll in the health plan in SHOP that best meets his \nor her needs.\n  The bill we have introduced reflects our commitment to find \nreasonable compromises and address the challenges faced by small \nemployers and the self-employed.\n  I am pleased that the National Federation of Independent Business and \nthe National Association of Realtors support the bill.\n  I am also delighted that this is a bipartisan bill. We reached out to \nSenator Snowe last year, and she has made valuable contributions to \nthis bill. We are pleased that Senator Coleman also has joined us as a \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  I am also glad to say the Service Employees International Union is \nsupporting our bill. It is a true sign of our ability to find a \nreasonable middle ground that such a diverse group has come together to \nsupport this bill.\n  We recognize that other Senators, on both sides of the aisle, have a \nsincere interest in addressing the problems small businesses and the \nself-employed are facing. We are committed to working with them to see \nif an even broader consensus can be found.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a close look at what we have developed \nso far and join with us in the fight to expand small businesses' access \nto affordable health insurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2426-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLAN ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the cost of health care \nand what the Senate can do this year to make health care more \naffordable for America's working families.\n  Last summer I introduced a bill, Ten Steps to Transform Healthcare in \nAmerica, which if enacted would provide every American with private \nhealth insurance. To help spread the word and get some suggestions and \ncomments from the people of Wyoming, I took it on the road and headed \nthroughout our State, making 10 stops to talk about my bill, Ten Steps \nto Transform Healthcare in America.\n  I designed Ten Steps to be an evolving product, something that could \nbe moved in pieces. I have found that Congress isn't very successful \ndoing things in a revolutionary way. I believe we can have success and \naccomplish real health care reform in an evolutionary fashion.\n  In just over 3 days we traveled over 1,200 miles, visited 10 towns, \nand met with hundreds of Wyoming folks. They all had one message for \nus--they are worried about their health care, and so am I. Of all of \nthe Ten Steps, one in particular created a host of comments and \nsupport: Step No. 4, Small Business Health Plans. You see, 70 percent \nof the people in Wyoming work for small businesses. They experience \nfirsthand the challenges of finding affordable health insurance and \nkeeping it.\n  So today I am introducing Step 4 of my Ten Steps bill, the Small \nBusiness Health Plans Act of 2008, to give a special level of focus to \nthe need to find a way to help small businesses stem the tide of rising \nhealth care costs. They simply cannot keep up with the increases and \nare clamoring for us in the Senate to do something, anything, to help. \nAnd do it now.\n  Small Business Health Plans is something I have been working on for a \nwhile with my friend, Senator Ben Nelson. I want to thank Senator \nNelson for his leadership and expertise in this matter and for his \nsteadfast support.\n  Step 4, the Small Business Health Plans Act, will reduce the cost of \nhealth care, especially for America's small business owners and working \nfamilies. Today, of the 46 million people without health insurance in \nthis country, 12 million people own or work for small businesses or \nlive in families that depend on small business wages. Another 5 million \nare self-employed. That makes 17 million people who can't afford decent \nhealth insurance right now and would be helped by this bill.\n  Small Business Health Plans, SBHPs, will allow business and trade \nassociations to band their members together across State lines and \noffer group health coverage to their employees. By banding groups of \nsmall businesses together on a regional or national basis, SBHPs create \nreal purchasing power that small businesses could never have on their \nown. This purchasing power will allow them to negotiate for better \nprices and greater benefits. Just like big businesses do.\n  A report prepared by an independent analyst found that Small Business \nHealth Plans would reduce health insurance costs for small business by \n12 percent--in today's dollars, about $1,000 per employee--and would \nreduce the number of uninsured in working families by 8 percent, or \napproximately 1 million people. That is real relief.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support giving small businesses \nthe same power that big companies have to negotiate for better benefits \nand better prices. And small business owners for years have been asking \nfor the power that big businesses have, so they can secure affordable \nhealth care for their employees and their families.\n  Every day, emergency rooms treat more than 30,000 uninsured Americans \nwho work for or depend on small businesses. That is at least 30,000 \nreasons why we need to get something done now to help create \naffordable, market-based choices for America's small businesses and \nworking families.\n  I am a former small business owner, and I know something about the \nstruggle to provide affordable health coverage to my own family and to \nmy ``work family.'' And Senator Nelson is a former State insurance \ncommissioner, so he knows something about the importance of protecting \nconsumers.\n  I also want to thank Senator Gregg for his leadership on this issue. \nSenator Gregg has worked very hard to help find relief for small \nbusinesses, and I very much appreciate his support and thank him for \nbeing a cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  Let's take the first step toward more affordable health care for all \nAmericans by giving small business owners the power to create Small \nBusiness Health Plans for themselves, their families, and their \nworkers. Let's give them the change they are seeking instead of ``more \nof the same'' or more excuses for not acting.\n  I believe we can agree on 80 percent of the issues and on 80 percent \nof each issue. If we focus on that 80 percent, we can get things done. \nI have been and will continue to work with my colleagues and \nstakeholders to find that 80 percent on Small Business Health Plans to \nprovide real relief for America's working families. The time for action \nis now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2426-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2426-S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DHS APPOINTMENT FLEXIBILITY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to support a bill offered by my good \nfriend Senator Voinovich to treat the appointment of the chief Human \nCapital Officer, CHCO, at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, the \nsame as all other CHCO appointments.\n  As part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress established \nCHCOs at Federal agencies to improve\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\nworkforce planning so agencies could better meet their omissions. \nAgencies were given the discretion whether to designate the position as \na political appointment or career civil servant. However, the act \nrequired the CHCO at DHS to be a political appointee nominated by the \nPresident. Where most agencies can select political or career positions \nwithout having to go through an external source, DHS has to go outside \nits walls to have the President select a person for this position.\n  Throughout the Federal Government, the mix of political and career \nCHCOs is almost equal. The important factor is that each agency has the \ndiscretion to choose whether the CHCO position best fits into the \nframework of the agency and its human capital strategy as a political \nor civilian employee. DHS by statute does not have this flexibility. As \nsuch, we believe that DHS should be treated like all other Federal \nagencies and have the discretion whether to make the position a \npolitical or career civil service job. Our bill would make the \nrequirements for the CHCO position uniform for all agencies.\n  DHS has faced many management challenges and integration issues. The \nDHS CHCO office has been working diligently to address the human \ncapital challenges within DHS and through the CHCO Council. The DHS \nCHCO has partnered with other agencies to discover best practices and \ntackle difficult issues of succession planning, administration \ntransition planning, hiring strategies, and workforce flexibilities. \nCHCOs' work is critical to the support of effective government \nmanagement and strategic workforce planning. Given DHS's critical \nmission and the fact that it continues to remain on the Government \nAccountability Office High-Risk List, it is important to give DHS the \nsame flexibility as other Federal agencies in appointing its CHCO.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the night of January 21, 2008, in Charleston, SC, Adolphus Simmons \nwas shot to death on the steps of his apartment. According to reports, \nSimmons had been dressed as a woman when the attack occurred. Friends \nsay that Simmons, an 18-year-old transgender person, often dressed in \nwomen's clothes. Sadly, the suspect charged with Simmons' murder is \nonly 15 years old. Baffled by this seemingly unprovoked attack, \ninvestigators are not ruling out that Simmons may have been targeted \nbased on his sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2427-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nthe Peace Corps and its volunteers for 47 years of service to our \ncountry.\n  In 1960, John F. Kennedy challenged students to dedicate a portion of \ntheir lives to serving their country overseas in the cause of peace. A \nyear later, as President, he established the Peace Corps. And now, \nafter 47 years, the Peace Corps shines as a beacon of our commitment to \nthe world.\n  Created to extend the volunteerism of the American people abroad, the \nPeace Corps has sent more than 190,000 citizens to nearly 140 countries \nas grassroots ambassadors of American goodwill. They have made lasting \ncontributions in fields like agriculture, education, health care, and \nthe environment.\n  Twenty-seven North Dakotans currently serve in the Peace Corps. I \nknow many individuals who volunteered their service. What I have heard \nof their experiences is truly remarkable.\n  President Kennedy challenged us to ask what we can do for our \ncountry. The men and women of the Peace Corps rise to that challenge. \nThrough their service, they demonstrate to the world that America and \nher people truly do care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2427-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2427-S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MARY LANGSTON TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity today to pay \ntribute to a wonderful woman, dedicated public servant and loyal \nfriend--Ms. Mary Langston Taylor. Mary is retiring from my staff on May \n1, 2008, after 31 years of dedicated service.\n  Mary has been with me from the beginning. She joined my staff on \nJanuary 1, 1977, the first week I was in office. You could say we have \nliterally grown up in this job together. I believe the very first \nassignment I ever gave her was to take dictation for letters I wanted \nto send to all of my new colleagues. She didn't miss a word then and is \nstill one of the fastest people I know at shorthand--a vanishing talent \nI might add.\n  In the early days of my Senate career, Mary was instrumental in the \nbeginnings of all aspects of running a U.S. Senate Office. She drafted \nand implemented the initial quality control procedures for all office \ndocuments, and correspondence. She managed the ``conversion'' of the \noffice from typewriters to computers--hard to fathom knowing what \nequipment we now have at our fingertips. She also helped spearhead the \nfirst Utah Women's Conference, an annual event Elaine and I have the \npleasure of hosting for women across Utah. From its beginnings with \nJihan Sadat as the first keynote speaker to today, this conference has \nserved a vital purpose to bring together women from diverse backgrounds \nto discuss the issues most important to their health and well-being. \nHer innovation and hard work, along with many others, has made this \nannual event the huge success that it is.\n  Mary has worn many hats during her years of service: personal \nsecretary, office manager, legislative assistant, special assistant, \nand currently constituent services representative. In fact, she was \neven kind enough to wheel me to the Capitol for votes after I severed \nmy Achilles tendon. She got pretty fast with my wheelchair.\n  In her current position Mary helps solve hundreds of constituent \ncases each year that are brought to my attention by Utahns needing help \nworking with the Federal Government. Mary's areas of expertise include: \nveterans and military affairs, transportation issues, and the U.S. \nPostal Service. While working with constituents, Mary has always \nconveyed her warmth and deep caring for each person. Perhaps her work \nis summed up best in the words of gratitude expressed to Mary by a \nhappy constituent: ``What would we have done without you? You are our \nhero. I want to thank you for never giving up. . .Thank you for making \nall the difference in the world to my mom and us.''\n  Even in the face of severe adversity, she always came to work each \nday with a smile on her face and a willingness to get the job done. I \nhave always admired Mary for her courage and fortitude. As a single \nmother for many years, she raised three wonderful boys--Robby, David, \nand James. She has taught them well and has sacrificed many things for \nthe happiness of her children. Mary is not only the proud mother of \nthese three boys but the loving stepmother to five children she was \nfortunate to inherit when she wed Brian Taylor. They have formed a \nwonderful partnership and it is always a pleasure to see them together.\n  In addition to her Senate service, Mary has been a tireless advocate \nfor conservative ideals, and women's issues. She has served as the \npresident of the Professional Republican Women of Utah, is a member of \nthe Women's State Legislative Council, and is currently finishing her \nterm as the president of the Salt Lake Council of\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\nWomen. In this position Mary spearheaded the Hall of Fame to honor \noutstanding women who have provided service to the community. She also \ncreated a special committee on domestic abuse to help others learn to \nspot indicators and educate women on what resources are available to \nthose in need.\n  Mr. President. I am truly grateful for the service Mary Taylor has \ngiven to me, to our community, and to Utah. I will miss Mary \ntremendously but know that life holds many exciting and wonderful new \nopportunities for her to enjoy. When I think of the best way to \ndescribe Mary, the word ``loyal'' just seems to fit. Mary is a loyal \nfriend, mother, wife, and has been a tremendously loyal staff member \nfor 31 years. Someone once said: ``Loyalty cannot be blueprinted. It \ncannot be produced on an assembly line. In fact, it cannot be \nmanufactured at all, for its origin is the human heart.'' This is \nMary--her heart is pure and she is loyal to all.\n  I want to wish Mary the very best in retirement and want her to know \nthat I will pray for her continued good health, success and happiness. \nMay God bless Mary and her family for her wonderful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2428-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING THE MANGINOS' DIAMOND ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the \nsixtieth wedding anniversary of Antonio and Rose Ann Mangino of \nPortland, ME on April 4, 2008.\n  Originally born in Lewiston, ME, Antonio, Tony, graduated from \nPortland High School in 1942. He was the son of Camillo and Antoinette \nMangino, who owned a small grocery store in Portland. He had two \nbrothers and three sisters. From 1943-1945, Tony served in the United \nStates Army in the Third Armored Division, where he was one of the \nbrave men who landed on the beaches of Normandy, 13 days after D-Day. \nTony went on to fight the Nazi army in Normandy, France and in Germany. \nAnd he is one of the proud members of the ``greatest generation'' who \ncan say they fought in the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Having served his Nation courageously, placing his own life on the \nline, Tony returned home to Maine where he met Rose Ann Atripaldi, a \n1947 graduate of Portland High School and the daughter of Vincent and \nMarie and one of five sisters and three brothers. In 1948 Tony proposed \nto Rose, and they got married at St. Peter's Catholic Church in \nPortland. Preferring not to return to the family grocery business, Tony \nworked for the United States Postal Service as a letter carrier, and he \nwas actively involved in his union and worked at the Postal Service \nuntil he retired. At the same time, Tony enjoyed selling real estate, \nand worked as a part-time broker with Deering Realty in Portland, \nhelping to sell property in areas of North Deering in Portland.\n  Although Rose Ann was a full-time mother, raising two daughters--Judy \nFox of Portland, ME and Camilla McCannell of Gray, ME--she remained \ncivically involved by volunteering for the Maine Democratic Party, one \nof the highlights of which was riding in a motorcade when President \nJohn F. Kennedy visited Portland, ME. In addition, Rose Ann volunteered \nat the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and was known for her weekly \ntrips to Brunswick, ME to make her famous meatball recipe for \nVincenzo's, a restaurant owned by her brother Andy.\n  With a marriage that is an enduring inspiration to us all and a \nstanding testament to their mutual devotion and love, Tony and Rose \nMangino today are the proud grandparents of three grandchildren, \nChristopher McCannell of Washington, DC, Michael Fox of Denver, CO, and \nJennifer Fox, also of Denver. They are also blessed with two great-\ngrandchildren, Zack and Coby Fox, sons of Michael and his wife Eileen \nFox. I couldn't be more pleased to join with the McCannell and Fox \nfamilies in wishing Tony and Rose Mangino a happy diamond anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2428-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAJOR PERRY JEFFERSON\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Major Perry \nJefferson. On April 3, 1969, Major Jefferson was an aerial observer on \nboard an O-1G Bird Dog observation aircraft conducting a reconnaissance \nmission in the Ninh Thuan Province of Vietnam when the aircraft \ncrashed. After an extensive search, Major Jefferson's body was not \nrecovered and he was subsequently listed Missing in Action. However, in \n2001, after 32 years, a Vietnamese national turned over remains that \nwere identified to be that of Major Jefferson. Today, Major Jefferson \nwas finally laid to rest in our nation's most hallowed grounds in a \nmoving ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  While growing up in Colorado, Major Jefferson developed a love for \ngeology, wilderness and the mines of Colorado; so much so, that his \ncode word was Geneva Creek, after a tributary of the North Fork South \nPlatte River in central Colorado. A graduate of Southern Methodist \nUniversity, Major Jefferson joined the Colorado Air National Guard as a \ntechnician and intelligence officer with the 120th Tactical Fighter \nSquadron when it was mobilized to Vietnam in 1968.

Mr. President, 5 years ago, Africa was in crisis and in \ndespair. HIV/AIDS was decimating whole communities. Some countries, \nsuch as Botswana, were literally on a path to extinction, with rates of \nHIV infection among pregnant women in some locations reaching as high \nas 40 and even 50 percent. In South Africa, while a third of pregnant \nwoman were infected with the virus, the country's political leaders \nwere actually denying that AIDS was caused by HIV infection, an ominous \nsign that little help was on the way for the over 4 million South \nAfricans--over 10 percent of the population--dying of AIDS.\n  In 2003, if a woman in sub-Saharan Africa was infected with HIV, the \nfamiliar story was all too oft-repeated. She would very likely watch \nher husband die first, and then her youngest children would also become \ninfected either at birth or through breastfeeding, as she languished \nunder her own death sentence. Within a short time, her children would \nbe orphans, left to fend for themselves in the streets and slums of \nNairobi, or Soweto, often getting sick with their own HIV infections \nand dying alone, without food or shelter or medicine.\n  The sheer numbers at the time were staggering. The disease affected \nwell over 20 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by the year 2000, \nroughly equivalent to the total number of American children under 6 \nyears old. The problem seemed overwhelming, indeed hopeless.\n  What was the world doing to stop the carnage? Were there armies of \ndoctors sweeping in with the miracle drugs that had been saving lives \nin America and other rich countries for nearly a decade? No. The U.S. \nwas spending under $200 million a year on HIV/AIDS overseas, mostly on \nreport-writing, some condom marketing, and ``capacity-building'' \nprograms that never actually used any of the capacity supposedly built \nand that had no measurable impact on the devouring epidemic.\n  Treatment was the demand of most global health activists of the day. \nAn indignant group gathered in South Africa in 2002. ``While a \nnecessary component of the response to HIV/AIDS, prevention will never \nbe enough,'' insisted Winston Zulu of the Network of Zambian People \nLiving with HIV/AIDS (NZP+). ``When will the world wake up to the fact \nthat the 16 million Africans that have already died of HIV/AIDS? This \nis only the beginning if we continue down the prevention-only path. \nThis movement will make treatment, which we all know strengthens \nprevention efforts, our priority demand.'' Domestic and international \nchapters of ACT-UP and others were heckling U.S. officials at \ninternational health conferences, demanding antiretroviral treatment \nfor people with HIV/AIDS in the developing world, especially in Africa.\n  And then something remarkable happened. On a cold January night in\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nWashington, DC, far from the overcrowded, underequipped clinics of \nAfrica, an American president made a promise--a $15 billion promise to \nprovide treatment to millions of Africans, within 5 years.\n\n       Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And \n     the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to \n     under $300 a year--which places a tremendous possibility \n     within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history \n     offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so \n     many...tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--\n     a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to \n     help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will \n     prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 \n     million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane \n     care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for \n     children orphaned by AIDS.--President George W. Bush, State \n     of the Union Address, Jan. 28, 2003.\n\n  Glimmers of hope ignited around the world that night, as the U.S. \npolicy against providing treatment in a foreign aid program came to an \nabrupt and inspiring end. The Congress took up the challenge, and \npassed a bill a few months later that was ground-breaking, a seismic \nshift in current policy and funding levels. The first and perhaps most \ndramatic policy shift was the statutory requirement that over half, a \nfull 55 percent of all $15 billion of the program's funding be spent on \nlife-saving medical treatment for people with HIV/AIDS.\n  People said it couldn't be done. The naysayers said that Africans \nwould not be able to adhere to complex drug regimens. They said that \nthere simply wasn't the capacity to absorb all those dollars and build \nnew clinics and expand hospital wings. They said people wouldn't come \nfrom miles around to get tested and treated. We wouldn't be able to use \nmopeds and bicycles to deliver drugs to the rural hinterlands. There \nweren't enough doctors. There wasn't sufficient logistic ability to \nstore so many drugs. These arguments are being repeated today. They \nwere uninspired and uninformed in 2003 and they still are today. The \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, has proven them all \nwrong.\n  Since PEPFAR started, over 1.4 million people who would either be \ndead or dying today have received life-saving antiretroviral treatment. \nThat's millions of children who didn't become orphans. Millions of \nparents who get to see their children grow up. Millions of moms whose \nbabies were protected from infection. Countless communities across the \nplains and prairies, streets and slums of Africa and the Caribbean, \nwhere hope has taken a foothold. Where once stigma and despair kept \npeople from even getting tested, people now come out by the thousands \non HIV testing days in Kampala and elsewhere.\n  PEPFAR is a comprehensive program, investing heavily in prevention \nand care as well as treatment. However, the majority of the funds have \nbeen spent on treatment. The true nature of PEPFAR, the appeal of the \nprogram, the miracle that has raised millions from the dead is the \nprogram's commitment to life-saving anti-\nretroviral treatment. If you ask Africans what PEPFAR is, they'll tell \nyou it's about AIDS treatment. It is the treatment component of PEPFAR \nthat has made it the most successful U.S. humanitarian effort in \nhistory because it has literally saved the lives of millions, preserved \nfamilies and communities, and rescued countless babies from being born \nwith an AIDS death sentence.\n  Five years later, the American people stand at a crossroads. PEPFAR \nis expiring and the true test of our commitment to life-saving \ntreatment is before us. We have a choice. Will we lose heart? Will we \nlose our focus? Will we allow a program that was ambitious, inspiring, \ntargeted and tangibly and measurably effective at saving lives become \ndiluted, vague, ill-defined and lose its life-saving impact? Will we \nallow partisanship and competing priorities and even some good \nintentions cloud and subvert the long-term success of PEPFAR? Will we \nturn PEPFAR into just another bloated, unmeasured and unmeasurable \nforeign aid program with no accountability and no real impact, a \nprogram that tries to do too much and accomplishes too little? As \nfunding increases and rhetoric builds, will we, in this moment of \ntesting, betray our historic commitment to Africa and the lives of \nmillions of its inhabitants?\n  It is embarrassing to admit that we find ourselves on a direct path \nto that shameful outcome. The once loud and indignant voices demanding \ntreatment for Africans have found other priorities, it would seem. \nInexplicably and inexcusably, the House and Senate PEPFAR \nreauthorization bills, negotiated with the approval of the \nAdministration, reverse what was undoubtedly the most important element \nof PEPFAR the requirement that the majority of funding be spent on HIV/\nAIDS treatment. What's more, the bills more than triple PEPFAR funding, \nbut only increase treatment targets by 50 percent. Despite their $50 \nbillion price-tags, the House-passed bill and the Senate committee-\nreported bill would only add an additional one million people, of the \nmany more millions in need, to the treatment rolls over the next five \nyears. It seems that, after five years focusing on helping people with \nHIV/AIDS, the focus of the program under these proposed \nreauthorizations would shift to helping the foreign aid ``industrial \ncomplex'' of USAID contractors based in the U.S. and European capitals. \nThe proposed reauthorization bills would prioritize literally every \npossible development cause except HIV diagnosis and treatment.\n  It is this glaring policy reversal that is the impetus for S. 2749, \nthe ``Save Lives First Act of 2008.'' The bill reinstates the current \npolicy requiring at least 55 percent of funding to go to life-saving \nmedical treatment for people infected with HIV/AIDS. It also allocates \na small percentage of funding for the critical diagnostic screening \nthat must be ramped up dramatically if we are to locate and treat every \ninfected person in the countries where PEPFAR operates. Finally, the \nbill acknowledges that every baby infected with HIV by her mother \nduring birth or breastfeeding is a largely preventable tragedy that \nshould be eliminated.\n  Although we have grave concerns about many other policies in the \nHouse and Senate reauthorization bills, including the prevention \npolicy, the expansion of funding to rich countries, the ``mission \ncreep'' that diverts funding from high-priority HIV/AIDS programs to \nlower-priority development programs, and others, we chose to focus in \nthe Save Lives First Act on the critical problem of the House and \nSenate bills' betrayal of the President's and the 108th Congress' \nhistoric commitment to life-saving HIV/AIDS treatment.\n  There is no question that PEPFAR has been the most successful foreign \naid program since the Marshall Plan. The structural reason for its \nsuccess is that it approaches and addresses AIDS for what it is--a \nviral epidemic. Though much may have changed in the past four years, \nthis simple fact has not, and will not, change.\n  Regardless of location, demography, mode of transmission, and so \nforth, the basic method of combating an epidemic, any epidemic, is the \nsame: find the infected, provide them care, and help them prevent \ntransmission to others. There are 33 million people living with HIV, \nand only they can prevent the transmission of the disease. If we find \nthe people with HIV, we could not only treat them, but yes, prevent new \ninfections as well. That's why treatment and testing are critical to \nprevention efforts. They are not the whole story--behavior change \nprograms are needed--but diagnosis and treatment are two of the \nfoundations of disease control. What's more, prevention through \neducation is far less costly than treatment. Uganda's success in the \n1990s proved that with the proper message and political leadership, \nbehavior change that reduces transmission rates dramatically can be \nachieved fairly inexpensively. The current PEPFAR program and its \noriginal authorizing legislation are appropriately structured on this \nfoundation of diagnosis, treatment and successful prevention.\n  So what are the mechanics of treating people? First, you must \ndiagnose those who are infected. That is why this bill designates \nspecific funding for performing rapid tests, and sets testing target \ngoals. If we test 1 billion people over the next 5 years, we will \ndiscover the vast majority of all those living with HIV. However, \nexperience shows that people will not get tested, no matter how much \nthey may want to, without an incentive to know their status. \nIt cannot be disputed that people\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nknown to be HIV positive suffer enormous stigma and discrimination \nthroughout the world, and therefore need an incentive strong enough to \novercome this.\n  The incentive is treatment. If people know that, should they be found \nto be HIV positive, there is hope and health in their future, they will \nhave an incentive to get tested. The promise of a longer and healthier \nlife is necessary to overcome the stigma--and, in a self-reinforcing \nloop, the presence of treatment, and the effect of people literally \nreturning from the dead, goes a long way to reduce HIV stigma. That is \none of the reasons why the Save Lives First Act maintains the 55 \npercent allocation of PEPFAR funding for treatment, and seeks to \nincrease the number of people treated proportionally to the increase in \noverall funding.\n  The AIDS drug nevirapine, which costs only $4 per treatment, can \ndramatically reduce the likelihood that a newborn will become infected \nwith HIV. Yet a new U.N. report delivers the news that only a quarter \nof HIV-positive pregnant women in poorer countries are receiving the \nmedication needed to prevent baby AIDS. Furthermore, the number of AIDS \norphans in poorer countries continues to increase, and in sub-Saharan \nAfrica an estimated 12.1 million children in 2007 had lost one or both \nparents to HIV.\n  By sticking to the fundamental disease control methods of testing and \ntreatment, new infections are prevented. First, we have seen here in \nthe U.S. that people who know their HIV status are less likely to \nengage in risky behavior--they seek to protect themselves and their \npartners. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that \nthe 25 percent of Americans who don't know their HIV status transmit \n50-75 percent of new infections. What's more, a recent study has \nsuggested that increased testing in the U.S. reduced infection. \nFurther, people who are receiving treatment have less of the virus in \nthem, and are less infectious. There is increasing evidence documenting \nthis phenomenon. Behavior change programs targeted to the general \npopulation, most of whom are uninfected, may help reduce infection \nrates to a point, but it is hard to think of a more direct preventive \nmeasure than rendering an HIV positive person less infectious and less \nlikely to infect others.\n  Therefore, claims that the bill does not address prevention are \nsimply untrue. First, billions and billions of dollars not dedicated to \ntreatment and testing are available for prevention in the House and \nSenate bills. After spending 55 percent of the $50 billion in the bills \non lifesaving treatment, there will still be $27.5 billion left over \nfrom which prevention programs could be funded, dramatically more \nprograms than under the current, $15 billion program. Second, and to an \nimportant extent, testing and treatment are part of an effective \nprevention approach.\n  In addition, some have claimed that the Save Lives First Act \nsignificantly increases costs, anywhere from $13-$17 billion. These \nclaims miss the point of the Save Lives First Act--which is not to add \nto costs, but to prioritize how authorized funds are spent. As the \nattached treatment cost analysis shows, the total dollar amount for all \ndrugs, test kits, and prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission \nmaterials needed to meet the goals in the bill is just over $11 billion \n(using conservative assumptions about costs that are likely to be lower \nin reality due to government discounts). A reauthorization bill \ncontaining $50 billion plus numerous ``such sums'' authorities, such as \nthe bills under current consideration in the House and Senate, would \ncontain sufficient money to meet these goals as well as procure the \ninfrastructure necessary to deliver these drugs and diagnostic tests. \nThese costs are not added on top of the proposed reauthorization \nspending levels, as some have claimed. Rather, the Save Lives First Act \ntakes the first 55 percent of all funding in any reauthorization bill--\nwhatever the ultimate amount of funding turns out to be--$30 billion, \n$50 billion or more (as is actually likely given the current \nappropriations frenzy in the Congress)--and directs it to treatment \ncosts. If meeting the heroic targets in our bill--adding 5 million new \npeople to treatment (in addition to the 2 million already in \ntreatment), conducting a billion HIV tests, and saving babies from \nbeing infected by their moms--ends up costing more than 55 percent of \nPEPFAR funding, we challenge any critic to think of a better use of \nfunds. However, as the attached chart demonstrates, there will be \nplenty of money in a $50 billion bill left for prevention and care \nafter meeting the requirements of the Save Lives First Act.\n  The current alternative to this approach, as embodied by the House \nand Senate bills containing no money dedicated to testing and \ntreatment--is that millions of people will die for lack of treatment. \nIn addition, the vast majority of people with HIV will remain ignorant \nof their status, and will continue to unknowingly infect others, \ncontinuing the cycle that led to the devastating epidemic we now face. \nLetting people die, and keeping people ignorant of their status, is not \nthe way to end this epidemic. We recognize this truth here in the U.S., \nwhere we spend 11 percent annually on prevention, but 67 percent on \ntreatment out of a total budget of $23.3 billion spent on AIDS \ndomestically.\n  Some have argued that a heroic American commitment to testing and \ntreatment such as the targets in the Save Lives First Act will \ndiscourage other donors from supporting diagnosis and treatment. The \ntruth is that other donors have yet to demonstrate substantial \ncommitment to bilateral treatment programs. Most other donors prefer to \nfund treatment through their contributions to the Global Fund to Fight \nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a multilateral organization \naffiliated with the United Nations, to which the U.S. is the largest \n(by far) contributor. That is what the Global Fund is for--to create \nefficiencies of scale and allow smaller donors to contribute to those \nmore efficient programs rather than reinventing the wheel and starting \nup their own bilateral programs. When other donors do invest in \nbilateral efforts, it is almost always on the prevention side--funding \nneedle exchanges for drug users, condom and ``empowerment'' programs \nfor prostitutes, and other prevention efforts in Africa, Asia and \neastern Europe, usually based on behavior change programs. This is all \nthe more reason why one donor, the U.S., needs to focus on diagnosis \nand treatment--the rest of the donor community is not as committed to \nthese programs compared to other approaches. But let's say that other \ndonors want to support treatment--great! We welcome their \nparticipation. There is so much to do--between 7 and 8.4 million people \nstill need treatment today. PEPFAR certainly can't treat everyone in a \ngiven year, and will have to rely on the efforts of others going \nforward, if we want to bring hope to everyone affected by this dreadful \ndisease.\n  We are proud of PEPFAR and the millions of miracles it has created \nalready in its first four years of operation. The American people can \nlook at PEPFAR and, unlike what they'll find with most government \nprograms, they can see measurable and tangible results in the faces of \nthe millions saved and cared for with U.S. funding. PEPFAR isn't \n``broken,'' and it doesn't require ``fixing'' in its reauthorization--\nit's a stunning success. The burden of proof is on those who want to \nradically change PEPFAR policies, not on those of us who want to \npreserve them. We look forward to working with the President and House \nand Senate leaders to ensure that PEPFAR continues its successful, \nmiraculous, life-saving track record.\n  Bertha, a 23-year-old PEPFAR treatment client in Tanzania speaks for \nmillions when she says, ``If it is not these ARVs, I think I was dead \nlong time ago because I use and I am still using these drugs. Now I can \ndo anything. I'm healthy and I'm strong.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my endnotes and graph be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS03AP08.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS03AP08.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2433-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 IN CELEBRATION OF REBECCA WOOD WATKIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nmy dear friend Rebecca, Becky, Wood Watkin as she celebrates her 95th \nbirthday.\n  Born on April 4, 1913 in Portland, OR, Becky graduated from Bryn Mawr \nCollege in 1933 and went on to the University of Pennsylvania to study \narchitecture. Undeterred by the fact that the architecture department \ndid not accept female students at that time, Becky completed all \nrequired courses, and became the first woman graduate in architecture \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania in 1937. That same year, Becky \nrelocated to San Francisco and applied at a variety of architectural \nfirms, none of which wanted a woman in the drafting room. Despite her \ndifficulties with finding employment in the male-dominated workforce, \nBecky persevered, earning her California architectural license in 1944.\n  A vanguard for aspiring women professionals everywhere, Becky opened \nher own architectural practice in Marin County in 1951. In the midst of \nthese professional milestones, Becky also gave birth to three wonderful \nchildren. As a working mother, Becky looked for ways to use her \npersonal and professional talents to help those in need, becoming a \ntremendous source of support and energy to causes that she believed \nhelped the community, including the Ecumenical Housing Association and \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Mr. President, 1948 saw Becky enter the political realm for the first \ntime, by fundraising for Roger Kent, a local Democratic candidate for \nCongress. This initial political activity 60 years ago spearheaded a \nlifelong involvement with Democratic politics, a passion of Becky's \nthat allowed her to work on the presidential campaigns for Adlai \nStevenson, John Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, and Jimmy \nCarter.\n  Inspired by Becky's trailblazing story and her fervent belief in good \ngovernment, I first met Becky in the 1960s as we worked together to end \nthe Vietnam war. As a young working mother myself, Becky quickly became \na deeply admired mentor. As the years passed and our friendship grew, \nshe was instrumental in helping me move up the political ladder from \nthe board of supervisors to the House of Representatives and then to \nthe Senate.\n  As we celebrate the 95th year of her remarkably courageous and \npassionate life, I remain in admiration of Becky's strong sense of \ncivic duty, honesty, integrity, and perseverance. Along with hundreds \nof her family, friends, and admirers, I wish her many more years of \ncontinued happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2433-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EL MALPAIS CONSERVATION AREA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the turn of the year marked the \n20th year the El Malpais Conservation area in western New Mexico has \nhad the benefit of special Federal protection. Two decades ago with the \nhelp of the delegation, Congress passed legislation to ensure the \nprotection of this culturally and geographically significant portion of \nNew Mexico, while an amendment of mine allowed the nearby native tribes \nto continue to utilize the area for their traditional religious and \ncultural activities.\n  Located just south of Grants, between State highways 53 and 117, the \nEl Malpais conservation area is unlike any other in the United States. \nThis unique area is an important cultural resource for the pueblos of \nAcoma, Laguna, Zuni, and Ramah Navajo. El Malpais, meaning ``the \nbadlands,'' describes the hardened lava plains where molten rock once \nflowed thousands of years ago. The uneven cooling of these lava flows \ncreated many lava tube caves throughout the designation which now \nprovide for a unique hiking experience. This exceptional conservation \narea also contains the West Malpais and Cebolla Wilderness areas, \nspectacular sandstone cliffs and canyons, and a habitat for a multitude \nof desert vegetation such as aspen, pine, juniper, fir, grasses and \ncacti. The El Malpais conservation area offers visitors guided tours, \npicnicking, camping, biking, and horseback riding in designated areas.\n  Last year I was able to help secure $250,000 for the purchase of 200 \nacres of inholdings at the El Malpais national conservation area. This \nadditional acreage is an important additional step to preserving the \nhistory and consolidating the varied landscapes contained within this \none of a kind conservation area.\n  Our public lands are truly national treasures, and as such, they \ndemand our most thoughtful management. The outdoors in New Mexico \nreminds us all of the things we hold so dear. I am proud to have played \na role in ensuring the expansion and continued protection of El \nMalpais. This New Mexico treasure remains much the same as it did as so \nmany years ago, and I am glad this will be the case for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2433-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CENTER FOR DISABILITIES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I congratulate the \nUniversity of South Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences \nCenter for Disabilities in Vermillion, SD, which will celebrate its \n35th anniversary in 2008.\n  Started in September of 1973 as the Developmental Disabilities \nEvaluation Center, the Center for Disabilities has a long and \ndistinguished history of providing training, service, information, and \nresearch not only to South Dakota but to the entire region. My wife \nBarbara worked on the DDEC staff during those initial years. Thirty-\nfive years later, the school continues to serve those needs of South \nDakota through current projects, such as the Autism and Related \nDisorders Program, Birth to 3 Connections, Cheyenne River Reservation \nRural Health Outreach Project, Deaf-Blind Program, Dietetic Internship, \nthe Upper Midwest Public Health Training Center, and the Pine Ridge \nDevelopmental Clinic, which was established in 2008. The Center for \nDisabilities is also working with other States to provide service in \nprojects such as the Four-State Consortium on Studies in the Prevention \nof Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effect and the Upper Midwest \nPublic Health Training Center.\n  Over the last 35 years, the University of South Dakota School of \nMedicine and Health Sciences Center for Disabilities has provided \nquality services to the people of South Dakota. Their goal, to help \nthose with disabilities live without limitations, has been demonstrated \nthrough the citizens with whom they have worked. Those ideals have also \nbeen carried out by the students who have graduated and gone on to \nexcel in their careers.\n  Not only has this center encouraged learning and research, but the \nUniversity of South Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences \nCenter for Disabilities also strives to bring together communities. \nIndeed, one of the core functions of the center is community education. \nThe center works to provide training and assistance, not only to \nindividuals with disabilities and their families, but also to \nprofessionals, paraprofessionals, policymakers, students, and any \nmember of the community who chooses to get involved.\n  I am proud to honor the University of South Dakota School of Medicine \nand Health Sciences Center for Disabilities for its 35 years of \noutstanding service. It is an honor for me to share with my colleagues \nthe exemplary leadership and strong commitment to education and \nresearch the University of South Dakota School of Medicine and Health \nSciences Center for Disabilities has provided. I strongly commend their \nyears of hard work and dedication, and I am very pleased that their \nsubstantial efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2433-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2433-S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly commend \nthe University of South Dakota women's basketball team for their great \nseason, and their 2nd place finish in the 2008 NCAA Division II Women's \nBasketball tournament.\n  The USD women's basketball team has worked especially hard this last \nyear, to reach the Division II championship game. All South Dakotans \nare extremely proud of their wonderful efforts and achievements in \ngoing so far.\n  They finished with a 33-2 record, won the North Central Conference \nwith a\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nperfect 12-0 record and won the North Central Region title for the \nfirst time in school history. They then won two out of three games in \nthe Elite Eight Championship and finished in second place.\n  These young women represented USD and South Dakota in an \nextraordinary fashion. Their hard work is representative of South \nDakota values and was rewarded with a great season.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of telehealth services under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague, Senator \nStabenow, to introduce an important piece of legislation for Medicare \nbeneficiaries living in rural areas. The Medicare Telehealth \nImprovement Act will ensure that rural beneficiaries have access to \nhealth care services by connecting remote areas to the services often \nonly available in large urban centers.\n  Fifteen years ago, I cofounded the Congressional Steering Committee \non Telemedicine and Health Care Informatics to bring more attention to \nthis technology and its potential. I took an interest in this \ntechnology because in large, rural, medically underserved States like \nmine, telemedicine provides access to care that is simply unavailable \notherwise. In many areas of North Dakota, routine check-ups with a \nspecialist can require a 200 mile round trip journey. That's fine for a \nyoung person on a nice spring day. But it doesn't work for seniors in \nthe middle of a North Dakota blizzard.\n  That's why in 1997, we fought to provide Medicare coverage of \ntelemedicine services. But access to this benefit was strictly limited. \nFor example, the telehealth service must be provided in a health \nprofessional shortage area or county not classified as a metropolitan \nstatistical area. In addition, only consultations, office visits, \nindividual psychotherapy and pharmacologic management are covered \nservices. Moreover, reimbursement, which is the same as the current \nphysician fee schedule amount, is limited to physicians, nurse \npractitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives, clinical nurse \nspecialists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and \nregistered dieticians. Finally, only physician offices, hospitals, \nrural health\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nclinics, and Federally-qualified health centers are eligible to be \noriginating sites and receive the ``facility fee.''\n  While this benefit has been helpful to seniors in rural areas, the \nadoption of telemedicine in the Medicare program has been slow. That is \nbecause we had to place too many restrictions on the benefit to control \nthe estimated costs o covering these services. However, experience has \nshown that the use of telemedicine does not dramatically increase \nspending. In fact, it can actually save money.\n  That is why Senator Stabenow and I are introducing the Medicare \nTelehealth Improvement Act today. More seniors need to have access to \nthis technology in all areas of health care, and our bill makes \nimportant changes in Medicare coverage.\n  First, the Medicare Telehealth Improvement Act would increase the \nnumber of originating sites eligible to receive the facility fee to \ninclude nursing homes, dialysis facilities and community mental health \ncenters. Moreover, it would allow any other site that has \ntelecommunications systems to be an originating site, but these sites \nwould not be eligible for the facility fee.\n  Second, the bill allows more providers to participate. For a number \nof years, we have advocated to include physical therapists, \noccupational therapists, audiologists, and speech-language \npathologists. This bill would make that change.\n  Finally, we would improve the Medicare process for updating the list \nof eligible services. Despite widespread support for the inclusion of \nnew codes, CMS has not sufficiently updated the list of covered \nservices in recent years. In response, our bill creates an advisory \npanel that would give recommendations on the addition or deletion of \nservices.\n  Senator Stabenow and I have worked to garner support from a variety \nof stakeholders. In fact, the bill we are introducing today has the \nsupport of the American Telemedicine Association, the National Council \non Community Behavioral Healthcare, the American Health Care \nAssociation, the American Health Information Management Association, \nthe Center for Aging Services Technologies, the National Association \nfor the Support of Long Term Care, and the National Center for Assisted \nLiving.\n  This bill is a meaningful step to further adoption of telehealth in \nthe Medicare program. It will allow seniors to seek care in the comfort \nof their communities, instead of having to drive hundreds of miles. I \nurge my colleagues to support this initiative to ensure that every \nsenior has access to the care they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            American Telemedicine Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2008.\n     Hon.

Conrad: I am pleased to express the strong \n     support of the American Telemedicine Association for your \n     proposed legislation, the Medicare Telehealth Improvement Act \n     of 2008.\n       This legislation would improve the current Medicare \n     telehealth program in three significant ways. First, it would \n     increase the number of eligible sites by adding skilled \n     nursing facilities, dialysis centers and community mental \n     health centers to the list of approved originating sites. \n     These are areas where telemedicine is proven to improve \n     quality and reduce costs.\n       Second, this bill would expand the list of eligible \n     providers under the Medicare telehealth program. This is not \n     only appropriate but necessary as more and more health \n     professions develop their telemedicine capabilities.\n       Finally, your legislation would improve the process used \n     for updating covered Medicare telehealth services by creating \n     an advisory committee of telemedicine practitioners to advise \n     CMS on the appropriate addition of deletion of telehealth \n     services. This committee, made up of physician and non-\n     physician providers, will improve the process by providing \n     the perspective of those directly involved in the provision \n     of telehealth services.\n       The ATA is the leading resource and advocate promoting \n     access to medical care for consumers and health professionals \n     via telecommunications technology. ATA seeks to bring \n     together groups from traditional medicine, academic medical \n     centers, technology and telecommunications companies, e-\n     health, medical societies, government and others to overcome \n     barriers to the advancement of telemedicine through the \n     professional, ethical and equitable improvement in health \n     care delivery.\n       ATA is happy to support your proposed bill, the Medicare \n     Telehealth Improvements Act of 2008.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jonathan D. Linkous,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 18, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conrad: Our coalition of long term care and \n     health information technology organizations is pleased to \n     support your efforts to expand the use of telehealth to \n     skilled nursing facilities and other care settings serving \n     Medicare patients. Telehealth will enhance the quality of \n     care for those with chronic illnesses, permanent \n     disabilities, or terminal illnesses and will improve the \n     communication and information exchange between caregivers and \n     patients.\n       According to the June 2007 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services Statistics report, roughly 1.8 million persons \n     received Medicare-covered care in skilled nursing facilities \n     in 2005. Long term care is a critical stakeholder in the \n     adoption of health information technology and the use of \n     telehealth to ensure continuous quality of care to our \n     patients and residents.\n       Your recognition of the importance of telehealth in the \n     long term care setting will go a long way toward bringing the \n     benefits of this technology to millions of Medicare patients. \n     Your legislation will facilitate the adoption of technologies \n     that can save lives, reduce administrative costs, and provide \n     better medical care, and we support your efforts \n     wholeheartedly.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you to secure \n     passage of legislation to accelerate the adoption of \n     telehealth to increase quality and safety for patients.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Health Care Association.\n     American Health Information Management Association.\n     Center for Aging Services Technologies.\n     National Center For Assisted Living.\n     National Association for the Support of Long Term Care.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Council for\n\n\n                              Community Behavioral Healthcare,\n\n                                    Rockville, MD, March 31, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad and Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the \n     National Council on Community Behavioral Healthcare--\n     representing 1,400 Community Mental Health Centers and other \n     community mental health and substance abuse agencies serving \n     over 6 million low-income Americans with mental illnesses and \n     addiction disorders--I am writing to express our strong \n     support for the Conrad/Stabenow Medicare Telehealth \n     Improvement Act.\n       The National Council is particularly pleased that you \n     included provisions designating CMHCs as originating sites, \n     thereby authorizing to seek reimbursement directly from \n     Medicare for tele-mental health services in rural areas.\n       Such proposals have long enjoyed strong bipartisan support. \n     As an illustration, President George W. Bush's New Freedom \n     Commission on Mental Health stated: ``Telehealth--using \n     electronic information and telecommunications technologies to \n     provide long-distance clinical care and consultation, patient \n     and professional health-related education, public health and \n     health administration--is a greatly underused resource for \n     mental health services.'' The Commission went on to note that \n     tele-mental health can increase access to care for patients \n     in remote geographic areas, and is especially important for \n     individuals with multiple chronic conditions, people with \n     severe mental illnesses, underserved populations, children \n     and the frail elderly [Achieving the Promise: Transforming \n     Mental Health Care in America, pg. 80, July 2003].\n       Like other safety net providers in rural America, CMHCs \n     struggle to recruit skilled medical staff in health \n     professional shortage areas. The only practical means of \n     expanding access to mental health services in these regions \n     is through the application of new technologies--including \n     tele-mental health care.\n       The National Council is committed to working with both of \n     your offices to secure passage of the Medicare Telehealth \n     Improvement Act.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Linda Rosenberg,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am pleased to join with my good friend, Senator Kent \nConrad, in introducing the Medicare Telehealth Improvement Act, which \nimproves access for many Medicare beneficiaries by expanding telehealth \nservices.\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\n  As Senator Conrad has noted, this legislation makes a number of \ntechnical corrections to promote telehealth. First, this bill would \nexpand the number of sites that provide telehealth services under \nMedicare to include nursing homes, dialysis facilities, and community \nmental health centers. Also, it would expand the list of providers to \ninclude physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language \npathologists, and other providers determined appropriate by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. Lastly, this bill would require \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to update the list of \ncovered telehealth services, along with the creation of a permanent \nadvisory committee made up of physicians and non-physicians to provide \nrecommendations to the Secretary and continue expansions of telehealth \nservices forward.\n  Michigan providers have been very innovative in using telehealth, \noften out of necessity because of geographic isolation. Telehealth \nallows providers to collaborate across great distances and share, \nrather than duplicate, services. This helps save money and improve \npatient access. One innovation is the use of tele-mental health \nservices. Many Michigan community mental health centers have made \ntremendous strides in their ability to monitor patients and provide \nclinical consultations long distance.\n  I am very pleased that both the Michigan Association of Community \nMental Health Boards and the National Council on Community Behavioral \nHealthcare support this legislation.\n  I believe that the Medicare Telehealth Improvement Act will build \nupon already successful initiatives happening in my home State of \nMichigan and across the country. I urge my colleagues to join with me \nand Senator Conrad in expanding upon this promising technology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Michigan Association of Community Mental Health Boards,\n                                      Lansing, Mi, March 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senator; SH-133 Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the Michigan \n     Association of Community Mental Health Boards (MACMHB)--\n     representing county administered community mental health and \n     substance abuse agencies serving low-income people with \n     mental illnesses and addiction disorders statewide--I am \n     writing to express our strong support for the Stabenow/Conrad \n     Medicare Telehealth Improvement Act.\n       MACMHB is particularly pleased that you included provisions \n     designating CMHCs as originating sites, thereby authorizing \n     these agencies to seek reimbursement directly from Medicare \n     for tele-mental health services.\n       As you well know, we have consistently struggled to expand \n     access to mental health care in the vast northern reaches of \n     Michigan for many years. In the best of times, MACMHB member \n     agencies have fought to retain skilled professional staff, \n     but the current economic challenges that our state confronts \n     make personnel recruitment and retention along with services \n     delivery in rural areas--even more difficult. By contrast, \n     tele-mental health care can partially compensate for these \n     staff shortages and, furthermore, we believe that these \n     services can be successfully implemented and expanded in \n     highly urbanized communities including metropolitan Detroit.\n       Passage of the Stabenow/Conrad telehealth improvement \n     legislation would be of greatest benefit to individuals \n     eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid--who compose roughly \n     one-third of the combined caseload of our member agencies. \n     This patient population is likely to have multiple chronic \n     conditions in addition to severe mental illnesses, and they \n     generally reside in underserved communities. The expansion of \n     tele-mental health services will substantially improve our \n     ability to provide long distance clinical consultation and \n     health status monitoring for these ``dually eligible'' \n     persons.\n       Senator Stabenow, we deeply appreciate your support. You \n     can count on MACMHB and the National Council of Community \n     Behavioral Healthcare to fight for passage of the Medicare \n     Telehealth Improvement Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        DAVID A, KAKMIA, L.M.S.W.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2814. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfinancial assistance to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Authority for the \nplanning, design, and construction of the Eastern New Mexico Rural \nWater System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill, with \nSenator Domenici's support, that would authorize the Bureau of \nReclamation to help communities in eastern New Mexico develop the \nEastern New Mexico Rural Water System, ENMRWS. The water supply and \nlong-term security to be made available by this project is absolutely \ncritical to the region's future. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to help make this project a reality.\n  This is the third time this bill has been introduced. In June 2004, \nit was the subject of a hearing before the Water & Power Subcommittee \nof the Energy & Natural Resources Committee. At that hearing, the \nBureau of Reclamation raised a number of issues that needed to be \naddressed by the Project sponsors prior to securing Reclamation's \nsupport. Last August, the Energy & Natural Resources Committee \nconducted a field hearing on the project in Clovis, New Mexico, and it \nwas clear that the sponsors have worked diligently to address the \nissues raised by Reclamation. Given that progress and the broad support \nthat exists for the project, it is time to move forward with Federal \nauthorization under Reclamation's rural water program.\n  The source of water for the ENMRWS is Ute Reservoir, a facility \nconstructed by the State of New Mexico in the early 1960s. In 1966, \nCongress authorized Reclamation to study the feasibility of a project \nthat would utilize Ute Reservoir to supply water to communities in \neastern New Mexico, P.L. 89-561. Numerous studies were completed, but \nit was not until recently that several communities, concerned about \ntheir reliance on declining and degraded groundwater supplies in the \narea, began to plan seriously for the development of a regional water \nsystem that would make use of the renewable supply available from Ute \nReservoir.\n  As part of that process, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority \nwas formed to carry out the development of the ENMRWS. The Authority \nconsists of six communities and two counties in eastern New Mexico, and \nhas been very effective in securing local funds and State funding to \nsupport the studies and planning necessary to move the project forward. \nTo date, the State of New Mexico has provided approximately $7.5 \nmillion to develop the ENMRWS.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important bill to the citizens of New \nMexico. It has the broad support of the communities in the region as \nwell as financial support from the State of New Mexico. There is no \nquestion that completion of the ENMRWS will provide communities in \nCurry and Roosevelt counties with a long-term renewable source of water \nthat is needed to sustain current economic activity and support future \ndevelopment in the region. I hope my colleagues will support this \nlegislation and help address one of the many pressing water needs in \nthe rural West.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 in order to \nincrease unsubsidized Stafford loan limits for undergraduate students, \nprovide for a secondary market for FFEL loans, allow for the in-school \ndeferment of PLUS loans, augment the maximum Federal Pell Grant for the \nlowest income students, and expand the number of students eligible to \nobtain loans under the lender-of-last-resort program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Americans are facing economic challenges \nat every turn. They see jobs disappearing, homes being foreclosed, \ndebts soaring, and benefits worth less and less. Now families are \nfinding that the loans they rely on to afford the high cost of college \nmay also be at risk.\n  Some lenders have stopped making private student loans, and others \nhave even temporarily stopped making loans under the Federal program. \nWe can't allow problems in the credit market to prevent students from \ngoing to college.\n  We have been working with the Secretary of Education to take steps to \nsee that all Federal backstops are in place and operational in order to \nprotect students from these problems.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation for additional steps to protect \nstudents by reducing their reliance on loans, and by improving the \nexisting Federal student loan programs to give them better terms and \nconditions.\n  The legislation does three things. It increases grant aid for the \nneediest students. It expands options for students and parents under \nthe Federal loan programs so that fewer of them will have to turn to \nhigher cost private loans. It takes steps to shore up the reliability \nof the current Federal loan programs so that families will have timely \nand reliable access to Federal loans.\n  Over 6 million students relied on Federal loans last year. It is \nessential to make sure this support is there for them when they need \nit. In the past 20 years, the cost of college has tripled, and more and \nmore students are relying on student loans to afford a college \neducation. In 1993, less than half of all graduates took out loans, but \nin 2004, nearly \\2/3\\ did so.\n  The average U.S. student now graduates with more than $19,000 of \nstudent loan debt. As a result, they are under increasing pressure to \ngive up lower-paying jobs and careers they may prefer, due to the \nburden of repaying their loan debts.\n  Legislation was enacted last year that increased grant aid and made \nFederal loans cheaper for students by reducing interest rates. We also \nprovided that no graduates should have to pay more than 15 percent of \ntheir income in monthly loan payments, and that those who enter public \nservice will have their loans completely forgiven. But these benefits \nwill be meaningless if students cannot obtain the loans needed to gain \na degree.\n  In recent weeks, the credit market crisis has made it more difficult \nfor lenders to obtain capital for student loans. As a result, some \nlenders are leaving the student loan market and those operating outside \nthe Federal loan program are cutting back on loans to high risk \nborrowers.\n  So far, because of the attractiveness of the Federal guarantee in the \nFederal loan program, other lenders are stepping in to fill the gaps in \nthat program.\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nSince the interest rates in that program are capped, students are \nprotected from inflated interest costs.\n  But students who need to go beyond the Federal loan program will have \na more difficult time finding lenders, and their rates will go up.\n  Also, parents who traditionally had various options for borrowing to \nfinance college for their children are seeing those options disappear. \nSome no longer have access to low-cost home equity lines of credit. \nOthers are being turned down for additional loans as they struggle to \npay their own mortgages.\n  As I mentioned, we are already taking action to ensure that programs \nalready in place to protect students and families from credit market \ndisruptions are fully operational.\n  I have urged Secretary Spellings to make it as easy as possible for \ncolleges and families to participate in the existing loan program that \nallows students and parents to borrow directly from the Federal \nGovernment, without going through a bank. This Direct Loan program uses \nTreasury funds. It does not rely on capital from the private financial \nmarkets, so it's insulated from the market disruptions now taking \nplace.\n  I have also urged the Secretary to put in place a plan to activate \nthe ``Lender-of-Last-Resort'' program, which enables the Secretary to \nadvance capital to designated lenders and guaranty agencies, so they \ncan help students who are having trouble finding loans through other \nbanks.\n  These programs are now in the law, and nearly 2,000 colleges are \nalready signed up to use the Direct Loan Program.\n  We're also taking steps to help students and parents who must borrow \noutside the Federal loan program, since they are the ones most likely \nto be affected by the credit market decline.\n  Currently, however, many students and parents don't know about their \nFederal options. According to Department of Education estimates, \nbetween 40 and 60 percent of students who turn to high-cost private \nloans are not actually taking full advantage of Federal grants and \nloans first.\n  We're taking steps to correct that problem in the Higher Education \nReauthorization bill that's in conference now.\n  But there is much more we can do to reduce families' reliance on \nhigh-cost private loans. The legislation I am offering today will \nincrease access for students and families to low-cost Federal loans. It \nwill also strengthen the backstops in the Federal program, to ensure \nstudents and families will continue to have access to Federal loans.\n  The legislation cuts back in several ways on the number of private \nloans that families have to take out:\n  It increases Pell Grant aid for the lowest income students.\n  It increases the amount that students can borrow under the Federal \nloan program.\n  It makes Federal loans for parents more attractive by enabling \nparents to defer payments on the loans while students are in college \njust as students can defer payments on their own loans.\n  It also takes steps to shore up the Federal loan program to ensure \nthere are no disruptions in access for students.\n  It makes it easier for schools to use the ``Lender-of-Last-Resort'' \nprogram when students or schools have problems finding lenders.\n  It provides an additional backstop to give lenders access to the \ncapital they need for new loans, if the situation worsens.\n  I will take a moment to describe each of these provisions.\n  The best way to help students and families afford college is to \nincrease grant aid. More aid up front means fewer loans and less debt \non graduation day. That is why the Democratic Congress delivered on our \npromise last year to raise the Pell Grant. The maximum grant will \nincrease to $5,400 by 2012--an increase of $1,350 over the level at \nwhich it had stagnated under the current administration.\n  This increase in up-front aid means that students eligible for the \nmaximum Pell grant will have to borrow $6,000 less in loans over the \ncourse of their college career.\n  The legislation I am introducing builds on that progress, and focuses \non students who need it most. Currently, over 2.6 million students--\nhalf of all Pell Grant recipients--come from families whose income, \nunder the Federal formula, makes them eligible for the maximum amount \nof Federal assistance because they are determined to be unable to \ncontribute to their children's college bills. Still, after all grant \naid, these families face an average unmet need of $5,600, which they \nare forced to borrow in order to pay for college. This bill brings \nadditional assistance to these students, by increasing the maximum Pell \nGrant for these students by up to $750.\n  Because Federal grant aid has not kept pace with the rising cost of \ncollege in recent decades, many students have been forced to turn to \nloans. The bill helps students who still need to borrow for college by \nguaranteeing their access to additional low-cost federal loans, rather \nthan forcing them to turn to the more expensive private loan market.\n  Currently, undergraduate students who are dependents of their parents \ncan take out loans of between $3,500 and $5,500 annually, depending \nwhat year of college they're in. The total amount they can borrow is \n$23,000. Independent students can borrow about double that amount.\n  Consider what this means for a middle-class family in Massachusetts \nstruggling to send a child to college.\n  Here is a family that makes $68,700--the median income in our State. \nOn average, these families will spend $17,424 a year for college. Based \non the federal formula, the parents are expected to contribute between \n$8,000 and $10,000 a year from their earnings with the rest to be \nobtained through grants and loans. After accounting for all federal, \nstate, and institutional aid, this family still faces over $2,600 in \nunmet costs each year--on top of their expected family contribution. \nThe estimate is conservative, because many parents don't have the \n$8,000-10,000 they're expected to contribute.\n  To make up the difference, many families can take out federal parent \n``PLUS'' loans at a 7.9 percent interest rate. If they don't qualify \nfor such loans because of poor credit, their children may have to turn \nto higher cost private loans.\n  The bill increases eligibility for Federal student loans in order to \ngive students a better, lower-cost option than relying on private \nlenders.\n  It allows undergraduates dependent on their parents to borrow up to \n$1,000 more a year. It tracks current law by allowing independent \nstudents to borrow twice that amount. It also allows students whose \nparents are not able to borrow under the Federal parent loan program \nbecause of poor credit to borrow an additional $2,000 per year.\n  In addition, the bill increases the total amount that students can \nborrow over the course of their college career. Dependent students will \nbe able to borrow up to $29,500. Independent students, and students \nwhose parents don't have access to PLUS parent loans, can borrow up to \n$57,500.\n  Further, the legislation makes federal parent loans more attractive. \nCurrently, most parents have the option of borrowing low-cost federal \nloans--up to the cost of attendance--for their children. In the 2006-\n2007 school year, 600,000 parents borrowed approximately $8 billion in \nPLUS loans, and the average loan was $13,600.\n  Many parents in recent years have not taken advantage of PLUS loans, \nbecause they had other options, such as home equity lines of credit, or \nprivate loans with good terms and conditions. This year, for the first \ntime in a decade, the number of PLUS loan borrowers declined--by about \n160,000. At the same time, student and parent dependence on private \nloans has increased. In the 2006-2007 school year, over $17 billion in \nprivate student loans were used to finance higher education.\n  With the credit crunch making it harder and more expensive for \nparents to borrow from private sources, this legislation will make it \neasier for parents to obtain Federal loans. Specifically, it allows \nparents to defer payment on those loans until their children graduate \nfrom school--just as students are able to do under their own Federal \nloans.\n  This provision protects parents from having to make any payments over \nthe next few years, and allows them to use that time to meet other \nfinancial obligations, such as getting their mortgages back on track.\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n  In addition to these provisions that significantly reduce families' \nneed to turn to the private loan market, the legislation also takes two \nimportant steps to strengthen the backstops in the Federal loan \nprogram, to ensure that students and parents can continue to have \ntimely, uninterrupted access to Federal loans.\n  First, it makes it easier for students and schools to participate in \nthe ``Lender-of-Last-Resort'' program. Current law requires designated \nlenders to make loans to students who are having trouble finding a \nFederal student loan elsewhere. But the program requires individual \nstudents to demonstrate that they can't find a loan before they can \nturn to a ``lender of last resort.''\n  If the current market worsens, more lenders may stop making Federal \nstudent loans, and this ``lender-of-last-resort'' process will become \nuntenable. Nationally, 18 million students are enrolled in colleges and \nuniversities. We can't require each of them to demonstrate they can't \nfind another lender before using this safety net.\n  The legislation instead allows financial aid officers and colleges to \nmake this determination on behalf of all their students, so that \nstudents can easily obtain a loan through a ``lender of last resort.'' \nConsider the difference this would make at state universities, some of \nwhich enroll more than 50,000 college and graduate students and \ngenerally rely on one or two primary lenders.\n  The Clinton Administration enacted such a policy in 1998--the last \ntime lenders threatened to leave the program. The legislation requires \nthe Secretary to make clear that colleges have this option should they \nneed it.\n  Finally, many lenders who have announced they will not be able to \nmake loans for this college year have had to make that decision because \nthey cannot obtain capital for those loans through their traditional \nsources in the private financial markets.\n  Many of these lenders sell the loans they originate in order to \nreplenish their capital and make new loans. But these so-called \n``secondary markets'' have begun to close because of the credit crunch.\n  Some lenders can't find a buyer for their loans. They are stuck with \nthe loans now on their books, and have no capital for new loans in the \nfall. Over the past month, this has caused some lenders to announce \nthat they will stop making new Federal loans.\n  This legislation provides a back-up plan for lenders who need it, in \ncase the private credit markets are unavailable to lenders. It allows \nthe Secretary of Education to act as a ``secondary market of last \nresort,'' by buying the loans that lenders are currently holding on \ntheir books and cannot sell.\n  This will not cause students any greater complexity--under the \nprogram established by this legislation, student loans will continue to \nbe serviced under the same terms and conditions that the borrower \nsigned up for. The Department can contract with the same loan servicers \nthat private banks use, and the transition will be seamless for \nborrowers.\n  We hope that these additional protections for students and families \nwill not be needed. But given the uncertainties in the overall economy \nand the credit markets, Congress has an obligation to shore up programs \non which millions of students heavily depend. Few things are more \nimportant than ensuring that families can afford a college degree for \ntheir children, and the goal of this legislation is to make that \npossible. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the appointment of the Chief Human \nCapital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security by the Secretary \nof Homeland Security; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\ncorrect what I perceive to be an anomaly in the law. I am grateful to \nbe joined in my efforts by my good friend and partner in human capital \nreform, Senator Akaka.\n  The enabling statute of the Department of Homeland Security requires \nthe Chief Human Capital Officer, or CHCO, to be appointed by the \nPresident. This differs from all other departments and agencies where \nthe head of the agency designates the CHCO. Using that authority, \nagency heads have varied in appointing Chief Human Capital Officers who \nare political appointees as well as career employees.\n  This bill would strike the provision of statute that requires the \nChief Human Capital Officer to be appointed by the President. \nTherefore, the Department would be covered by section 1401 of title 5, \nwhich directs the head of each agency to appoint the CHCO. Of the 23 \nagencies that make up the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, 11 are \ncareer employees.\n  As the Department prepares for its first transition between \nadministrations, it is imperative that there are able and capable \nindividuals in place to continue its important mission and all related \nfunctions. Key to a successful Department of Homeland Security is a \nwell trained workforce. I believe central to this smooth transition \nwould be a career Chief Human Capital Officer. While I have no \nintention of mandating that position be a career position, I believe \nthe Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security should have the \nflexibility and authority to hire a career employee to that position, \njust as all other agency heads do, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Coleman, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 2817. A bill to establish the National Park Centennial Fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nNational Park Centennial Fund Act, a bill that will help restore the \ngrandeur of our national parks in preparation for the 100th birthday of \nthe National Park System in 2016. I am pleased to introduce this bill \nwith Senator Collins, Senator Baucus, Senator Coleman, and Senator \nTester. I want to thank them for their work and for their support of \nthis bill, which I hope we can pass this year.\n  Nearly a century ago, following the extraordinary vision of leaders \nwhose dreams were ahead of their time, we as Americans pledged to \nprotect our Nation's most special lands and treasures. At places like \nYellowstone, Yosemite, Mesa Verde, and Gettysburg we have set aside for \npermanent protection those landscapes that conjure the sublime, those \nhistoric treasures that tell the American story, and those cultural \nsites that help define us as a people.\n  In 2016, we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Park \nSystem. The centennial celebration will be an opportunity to resurrect \nthe spirit that drove people like Enos Mills, one of the founders of \nRocky Mountain National Park, to work tirelessly to protect our \nNation's crown jewels for future generations. ``In years to come when I \nam asleep beneath the pines,'' Mills proclaimed in 1909, ``thousands of \nfamilies will find rest and hope in this park.'' He was right. Thanks \nto the excellent work of the Park Service and its employees over the \npast 90 years, the 3.2 million visitors that come to Rocky Mountain \nNational Park each year experience the same wild lands and spectacular \nvistas that our ancestors enjoyed.\n  The coming of the 2016 centennial of the National Park System is an \nopportunity to restore the luster of our national parks and inspire \nfuture generations to protect these national treasures.\n  Secretary Kempthorne took an important step in this direction when, \nin August 2006, he announced that the National Park Service will \nundertake the Centennial Initiative to prepare for the 100th \nanniversary of the Park System in 2016. As part of the Centennial \nInitiative, Secretary Kempthorne proposed the creation of a partnership \nbetween: the federal government; the private, philanthropic sector; and \nother non-federal sources. The goal of this partnership would be to \nincrease philanthropic contributions to the parks by providing Federal \nmatching funds for donations made by Americans for projects that \nimprove the parks and visitor experiences. This program is called the \nCentennial Challenge.\n\n  When Secretary Kempthorne presented this proposal to the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee last year, I offered my strong \nsupport for the concept. However, the legislation offered by the \nAdministration to put the Centennial Challenge into action suffered \nfrom a number of deficiencies--namely, a lack of a spending offset and \nan unclear delineation of the public's and Congress' role in the \nprogram. There were also concerns about the bill's effect on other Park \nService accounts, friends groups, and existing philanthropic \ninitiatives.\n  The National Park Centennial Fund Act that we are introducing today \nanswers many of these questions and, I believe, is a legislative \npackage that is worthy of bipartisan support and passage.\n  This bill takes Secretary Kempthorne's Centennial Challenge proposal \nfrom vision to reality by establishing the Centennial Challenge Fund, a \nmatching donation fund in the federal treasury that will provide up to \n$100 million a year to the national parks in support of signature \n``Centennial projects and programs.'' This would allow supporters of \nthe parks to match their contributions with federal dollars to carry \nout a program or a project at a national park unit, provided that the \nproject or program is approved by the Park Service and Congress.\n  This bill provides $100 million in mandatory spending for each of the \nfiscal years from 2008 to 2017 to carry out special, select Centennial \nprojects throughout the National Park System. Non-federal philanthropic \nparticipation is encouraged, but not required, for a project to be \nexecuted with Federal money from the Centennial Fund.\n  To ensure that Congress has the opportunity to review and approve the \nproposed project list, the bill requires the Secretary oflnterior to \nsubmit to Congress, as part of the President's annual budget \nsubmission, a list of proposed Centennial projects. The yearly project \nlists are to be developed by the Secretary with input from the public \nand National Park Service employees.\n\n  Projects must meet specific criteria set forth in the bill. All \nprojects must be consistent with Park Service policies and adopted park \nplanning documents and be representative of the breadth of the national \npark system. The bill also requires that project proposals fall into \none of seven categories or ``initiatives'' defined in the bill: \nEducation, Diversity, Supporting Park Professionals, Environmental \nLeadership, Natural Resource Protection, Cultural Resource Protection, \nand Visitor Enjoyment and Health, and Construction. No more than 30 \npercent of the amounts available in the fund in any fiscal year may be \nspent on construction activities.\n  The National Park Centennial Fund Act also specifies that the Federal \ndollars made available from the Centennial Fund shall supplement and \nnot replace annual Park Service expenditures, and that adequate \npermanent staffing levels must be maintained. The Secretary is required \nto submit a report to Congress each year detailing Centennial Fund \naccounting, results, and Park Service staffing levels.\n  The National Park Centennial Fund Act bill proposes to pay for the \nCentennial Fund by establishing a new conservation royalty from \nunanticipated off-shore oil and gas revenues in the Gulf of Mexico that \nthe Federal Government is now collecting. In 2008, off-shore oil and \ngas lease sales have already generated more than $4 billion in revenue \nabove Department of Interior projections. Rather than returning all \nthese revenues--which were generated from the depletion of a natural \nresource--to the Federal treasury, the National Park Centennial Fund \nAct reinvests up to $1 billion in the Centennial Fund and the permanent \nprotection of our national treasures.\n  Moreover, the bill supplements the funding from this conservation \nroyalty with revenues that would be generated through the sale of a new \npostage stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park \nSystem.\n  I want to again thank my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Coleman, and Senator Tester, for their support and for their \nwork on this\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nbill. This is an effort that is worthy of broad, bipartisan support, \nand it is a bill which I hope we will pass this year.\n  Finally, I would like to note that I see another bill that I have \nintroduced, S. 2194, as complementary to this effort. The National Park \nRanger School Partnership Act, which I introduced with Senator Conrad, \nwould provide greater opportunities for our kids to experience and \nlearn from the tremendous resources in our national parks by \nestablishing partnerships between NPS and local schools under the No \nChild Left Behind Act. The bill would also create a pilot grant program \naimed at getting more school children into the national parks.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass both of these \nbills.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Salazar in \nintroducing the National Park Centennial Fund Act. This bill celebrates \nthe 100th anniversary of the National Park System by infusing our parks \nwith $1 billion over 10 years, which will be matched by an additional \n$1 billion in private donations. This challenge fund adds to efforts to \nincrease the operations budget of the National Park Service by $1 \nbillion over the next decade.\n  We Americans love our National Parks. In fact, in a December 2007 \nHarris Interactive Poll, the National Park Service ranked as the most \npopular Federal Government service.\n  In 1872, Congress designated Yellowstone as the world's first \nnational park, and in 1916 the National Park Service formally was \ncreated to manage what had become a 6 million acre system of national \nprotected areas.\n  Today the National Park System protects more than 84 million acres. \nNational Parks conserve our culture and our places of natural beauty \nand value. They also provide recreation opportunities for more than 270 \nmillion visitors each year.\n  My State of Maine is home to the first National Park east of the \nMississippi River, Acadia National Park, a true gem on Maine's rocky \ncoast. Visitors enjoy granite mountain tops, sparkling lakes, forested \nvalleys, meadows, marshes, and a spectacular coastline. They can hike \nup Cadillac Mountain, the tallest mountain on the east coast, which \noffers amazing views of Porcupine Islands and Frenchman Bay.\n  The National Park Centennial Fund Act will maintain and improve all \nof our parks for the next century of enjoyment. The bill establishes a \nmandatory annual fund of $100 million, which will be matched by private \ndonations for projects in parks around the country.\n  Eligible projects will be prioritized through input from both the \npublic and a broad cross-section of National Park Service employees. \nCentennial challenge projects may fall into one of these categories: \neducation, diversity, supporting park professionals, environmental \nleadership, natural resource protection, cultural resources protection \nor visitor enjoyment and health.\n  For example, at Acadia National Park, officials are undertaking an \nenvironmental leadership project to make Acadia virtually car-free by \nproviding a variety of public transportation options within the park. \nThis partnership with the local community will include providing a \ncentral parking and bus boarding area for park visitors to use the \nIsland Explore bus system. Since 1999, these low-emissions propane \nvehicles have carried more than 1.5 million riders. In doing so, they \nremoved 424,000 vehicles from the park and reduced pollution by 24 \ntons.\n  We propose two offsets in the National Park Centennial Fund Act. The \nfirst is a postal stamp for National Parks, estimated to raise about \n$10 million annually.\n  The second offset is from unanticipated revenues from offshore oil \nand gas leases. Thus far for fiscal year 2008, bids and royalties from \noffshore oil and gas leases are $4.2 billion higher than CBO \nanticipated. The National Park Centennial Fund Act bill would take \nthese revenues that were not anticipated each year and dedicate them \ninto the centennial fund until the total in the fund reaches $1 \nbillion. If we are depleting one natural resource, I believe we should \nreturn part of the revenues to the protection of other natural \nresources like our National Parks.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Salazar for his leadership on this \nbill and Senators Baucus, Coleman and Tester for their support. I urge \nall my colleagues to consider joining us on this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2819. A bill to preserve access to Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program during an economic downturn, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my esteemed \ncolleagues--Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine and Senator Edward Kennedy \nof Massachusetts--to introduce a timely and vital piece of legislation, \nthe Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008. This bill will \npreserve access to health care for our most vulnerable citizens during \nthis time of economic uncertainty.\n  Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke confirmed \nwhat we have all long-suspected--that the U.S. economy could be headed \nfor a protracted recession. The tell-tale warning signs of recession \nhave been visible in the states for at least a full quarter now. \nAccording to the National Governors Association, the recent economic \ndownturn has left 18 States with budget shortfalls totaling $14 million \nin 2008, and 21 States project shortfalls totaling more than $32 \nmillion in 2009. If the current downturn follows the path of most \nrecessions, between 35 and 40 States will face severe budget shortfalls \nin 2009.\n  As a former Governor, who survived the tough times of the 1980s, I \ncan attest to the enormous budget pressures States face when the \neconomy slows. State revenues often evaporate rapidly during an \neconomic downturn. Unlike the Federal Government, States cannot borrow \ninfinite amounts of debt from China and other countries. By law, 49 \nStates--including West Virginia--are required to balance their budgets \nand, in times of economic downturn, this task becomes significantly \nmore difficult.\n  Some of my colleagues may be wondering why health care is such a big \ndeal when we have all these other problems to worry about--the mortgage \ncrisis, the credit crunch, and a weak dollar. Well, I would say to my \ncolleagues that we don't have to look very far for an answer to this \nvery question. As we saw during the economic downturn of 2001-2003, \ndecreased access to health care coverage was a huge crisis for working \nfamilies.\n  There was a huge loss in private health care coverage. Data from the \nCenter for Studying Health System Change indicates that the proportion \nof the under-65 population with employer-sponsored coverage fell from \n67 percent in 2001 to 63.4 percent in 2003. After adjusting for \npopulation growth, this means that nearly 9 million fewer people were \ncovered by employer-sponsored health insurance during the recession \nthan would have been the case if coverage rates remained unchanged.\n  Medicaid also didn't fare very well during the last recession. It is \nconsistently the first program slated for cuts during a state budget \nsqueeze. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the \nUninsured, between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, the loss of revenue led \nall 50 States to reduce Medicaid provider payment rates and implement \nprescription drug cost controls, 38 States to reduce Medicaid \neligibility and 34 States to reduce benefits.\n  These cuts placed a huge burden on Medicaid providers and the working \nfamilies who depend on Medicaid to meet their health care needs. While \nCongress did ultimately respond to the last economic downturn by \nproviding $20 billion in State fiscal relief in 2003, and this relief \nwent a long way to preserve health care coverage for millions of \nworking families, we cannot discount the fact that one million low-\nincome people had already lost Medicaid coverage because we waited two \nyears into the recession to act.\n  In response to this current downturn, state legislatures are already \nbeginning to limit access to Medicaid and CHIP in preparation for the \nharsh economic times ahead. According to the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, at least 10 states have implemented or are \nconsidering budget cuts that will reduce access to Medicaid or CHIP for \nworking families. For example, Nevada has capped the State's CHIP \nprogram\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nat its approximate current number of enrollees. As a result, hundreds \nof children will be denied coverage. California has proposed increasing \nco-payments and premiums for children enrolled in CHIP and reducing \nCHIP dental services. I want to remind my colleagues that it was only 1 \nyear ago that millions across the country mourned the death of 12-year-\nold Deamonte Driver, whose lack of dental care led to fatal brain \ninfection.\n  At least four States are cutting or proposing to cut Medicaid \nservices for the elderly or disabled, or significantly increasing the \ncost of these services. For example, Maine has proposed cuts that will \nremove 7,000 mentally ill and poor adults from Medicaid; and Rhode \nIsland is requiring low-income elderly people to pay more for adult \ndaycare.\n  Several States have proposed reductions in or delayed payments to \nproviders. For example, New Jersey has proposed a reduction in funding \nfor hospital charity of 15 percent, which will impact hospitals' \nability to care for some of the State's most vulnerable residents.\n  There is no question that our States are in economic peril. However, \nchildren don't stop getting sick just because the economy slows. \nSeniors don't suddenly stop needing long-term care services simply \nbecause the economy slows. Instead, the need for access to Medicaid and \nCHIP grows during times of economic uncertainty, and we must act to \nensure that Medicaid and CHIP coverage is available when families need \nit the most.\n  The Economic Recovery in Health Care Act provides the timely, \ntargeted, and temporary Federal response necessary to avoid a health \ncare crisis during this current economic slowdown. Our legislation \naccomplishes this objective in two ways.\n  First, our bill responds to the Medicaid administrative regulations \nrecently proposed by the administration, which, if allowed to go into \neffect, would further aggravate the impact of the economic downturn on \nStates and working families. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat these regulations would reduce Federal Medicaid matching payments \nby approximately $18 billion over 5 years and $42 billion over 10 \nyears. However, State reports to the House Oversight Committee indicate \nthat the cost shift to States could be far greater.\n  Now is a time when States need greater financial support from the \nFederal Government, not less financial support and more restrictions \nthat make providing quality care to those most in need nearly \nimpossible.\n  Our bill will preserve access to Medicaid for seniors, pregnant \nwomen, individuals with disabilities, and children during the economic \ndownturn by temporarily extending--through April 1, 2009--the Medicaid \nmoratoria on payments to public providers, graduate medical education, \nschool-based services, and rehabilitative services that Congress has \nalready enacted. The Economic Recovery in Health Care Act would also \npreserve access to Medicaid by delaying--through April 1, 2009--\nimplementation of the following additional Medicaid regulations, which \nare already in effect or scheduled to go into effect in the near \nfuture: targeted case management, allowable provider taxes, outpatient \nclinic and hospital services, and the Departmental Appeals Board rule. \nOur bill would also preserve access to CHIP for low-income children by \nimplementing a 1-year moratorium on the August 17 CHIP guidance.\n  The second major component of our legislation is targeted State \nfiscal relief. Leading economists have found that targeted State aid \nwould generate increased economic activity of $1.36 for each dollar of \ncost. Our legislation provides approximately $12 billion in targeted \nState fiscal relief, equally divided between an increase in Federal \nMedicaid matching payments and targeted grants to States.\n  Unlike the State fiscal relief provided in 2003 and previous fiscal \nrelief proposals offered this year, each State must meet certain \ncriteria in order to qualify for an increase in federal matching \npayments and the targeted grants. The criteria would be based on the \naverage of State ranks in unemployment, food stamp participation, and \nforeclosures. These three economic indicators closely align with State \nbudget deficits and would allow us to more appropriately target State \nfiscal relief to the States with the most need.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support this important legislation. \nMedicaid is a Federal-State partnership, and the Federal Government \nbears the primary responsibility for ensuring that the Federal \nguarantee of health benefits is not denied to eligible working \nfamilies, particularly during an economic downturn. With all the \nworries that working American families are currently facing, they \nshould not have to add health care to their growing list of concerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Recovery in Health \n     Care Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) State and local governments are an integral part of our \n     national economic engine. They provide health care and a \n     wealth of social services to millions of Americans, \n     particularly when the economy is weak.\n       (2) During the last economic downturn, the number of \n     uninsured Americans would have been millions more if Medicaid \n     and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) had \n     not responded to the twin challenges of an economic downturn \n     and a sharp drop-off in private health insurance coverage.\n       (3) In the last year, our unemployment rate has increased \n     to 5.0 percent with nearly 900,000 more Americans without \n     jobs. Because the majority of Americans get their health \n     insurance through their jobs, the loss of a job often results \n     in a simultaneous loss of health insurance coverage.\n       (4) Medicaid fills the gap for working families when they \n     lose access to private coverage. For every 1 percent increase \n     in the unemployment rate, Medicaid enrollment increases by \n     2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people.\n       (5) States experience enormous budget pressures when the \n     economy slows. By law, 49 States are required to balance \n     their budgets and, in times of economic downturn, this task \n     becomes significantly more difficult.\n       (6) According to the National Governors Association, 18 \n     States already face budget shortfalls totaling \n     $14,000,000,000 in 2008, and 21 States project shortfalls \n     totaling more than $32,000,000,000 in 2009. If the current \n     downturn follows the path of most recessions, between 35 and \n     40 States will face severe budget shortfalls in 2009.\n       (7) A critical factor in helping States sustain Medicaid \n     enrollment during the last economic downturn was the \n     $20,000,000,000 in State fiscal relief that Congress enacted \n     in 2003.\n       (8) Not only should Congress enact a similar State fiscal \n     relief provision in 2008, but Congress should also delay the \n     implementation of administrative regulations that would \n     reduce Federal Medicaid matching payments at a time when \n     States need greater Federal resources.\n       (9) There is no question that health care is economic \n     stimulus.\n       (10) Keeping Medicaid and CHIP whole shores up the safety \n     net for vulnerable working families. People who are able to \n     get the health services they need are more likely to be able \n     to continue working and contribute to the economy as it \n     recovers.\n       (11) Leading economists have found that targeted State aid \n     would generate increased economic activity of $1.36 for each \n     dollar of cost. The increase in Federal dollars to States \n     generates business activity, jobs, and wages that States \n     would not otherwise see.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to extend and expand the number of States qualifying for \nsupplemental grants under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nbipartisan reauthorization and expansion for the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families, TANF, Supplemental Grants with my colleague, \nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n  The TANF Supplemental Grants will expire this year without action. \nCurrently 17 States depend on these grants, but our legislation would \nexpand and improve on the grants. Welfare reform was passed in 1996, \nand since then neither the basic TANF Block Grant nor the TANF \nSupplemental Grant has been increased. This means that the value of the \nTANF funding in constant dollars has declined by almost 20 percent.\n  In 2010, Congress will need to review the entire TANF program, but \nbetween now and then our legislation seeks to provide modest help for \nStates that are struggling to serve vulnerable children in needy \nfamilies. Our legislation would provide a modest increase for any State \nwhich spends less than the national average per underprivileged child \non TANF activities of Federal and State resources. This would help \nStates that cannot meet the average ``catch up,'' and provide more \nservices to underprivileged children. To be reasonable, the increase is \ncapped at $10 million or 10 percent of their existing TANF grant for \nStates that have never received a TANF Supplemental Grant. For States \nthat are receiving a TANF Supplemental Grant, they could qualify for up \nto $2.5 million in additional funding or 2.5 percent of their existing \nTANF grant.\n  This is a modest but important effort to help every state provide for \nvulnerable children who are receiving less\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nthan that national average for an underprivileged child. This proposal \nshould help the most vulnerable at a time when the economic slowdown is \ncreating more obstacles for families to make a successful transition \nfrom welfare to work.\n  In West Virginia, our neediest children are not even receiving the \naverage amount spent on America's underprivileged children, and that is \ntrue in too many States. Our children and families are struggling to \nmeet the bold goals of welfare reform with fewer resources and tougher \nstandards. This reauthorization is a chance to help those States that \nare struggling to achieve the national average for funding. It would be \nbase funding for underprivileged children rather than population \ngrowth. It will target resources to vulnerable children.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the reauthorization \nof the TANF Supplemental Grant program. Today Senator Rockefeller and I \nintroduced legislation that would reauthorize these grants and more \naccurately ensure that the dollars spent on this program are directed \nto poor children in the States that need it most.\n  I am committed to ensuring that Federal dollars spent on welfare \nservices and benefits are spent efficiently and provided to our \ncitizens in a way that encourages self-sufficiency. In South Carolina, \nI am pleased that our Department of Social Services continues to work \ntoward that end. Currently, less than half of States' TANF block grants \nare spent on welfare checks, and the majority of funding is spent on \nmoving welfare recipients into the workforce. More and more States are \nusing TANF dollars to help beneficiaries purchase services such as \nchildcare, transportation and job training.\n  However, the neediest States continue to struggle to provide welfare-\nto-work services to poor families with children. South Carolina can \nonly afford to spend 29 percent of the national average per poor child \non TANF services compared to some States that spend well over the \nnational average. It is important that this discrepancy be addressed.\n  The TANF Supplemental Grant program was created in 1996 to provide \nadditional assistance to States that spend less money per poor person \non TANF services. However, many States, like South Carolina, spend well \nbelow the national average and do not qualify for this assistance. To \ndate, South Carolina has the lowest spending per poor person of any \nState in the country that does not receive a supplemental grant. Many \nStates that do receive supplemental grants spend more than twice the \nTANF funds per poor person than South Carolina.\n  The Supplemental Grant program will expire on September 30, 2008. \nReauthorizing this program is an opportunity to provide assistance, \nbased on updated statistics, to States, like South Carolina, that \ncannot afford to spend the national average per poor child on TANF \nservices. Especially during economically challenging times, providing \nthis assistance to States can help our neediest families with children \nto get back on their feet and back to work.\n  In working to pass this legislation, I look forward to collaborating \nwith the Senate Finance Committee and Senator Rockefeller on \nidentifying an appropriate mechanism to offset the costs of this \nproposal. I am hopeful that the Senate will consider this legislation \nin a timely manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2449-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2449-S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 499--URGING PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT MAHMOUD \nABBAS, WHO IS ALSO THE HEAD OF THE FATAH PARTY, TO OFFICIALLY ABROGATE \n   THE 10 ARTICLES IN THE FATAH CONSTITUTION THAT CALL FOR ISRAEL'S \n    DESTRUCTION AND TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL, OPPOSE ANY POLITICAL \n                 SOLUTION, AND LABEL ZIONISM AS RACISM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Casey) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 499\n\n       Whereas, on October 3, 2006, President Mahmoud Abbas of the \n     Palestinian Authority said, ``It is not required of Hamas, or \n     of Fatah, or of the Popular Front to recognize Israel'';\n       Whereas, on February 8, 2007, President Mahmoud Abbas \n     openly signed the Mecca Agreement with Hamas, which does not \n     recognize Israel and calls ``for confronting the [Israeli] \n     occupation'';\n       Whereas, in 2007, there continue to exist 10 specific \n     articles out of 27 articles in Chapter 1 of the Fatah \n     Constitution that call for Israel's destruction, call for the \n     armed struggle and armed revolution against Israel to \n     continue, call for the prevention of Jewish immigration to \n     Israel, oppose any political solution, and label Zionism as \n     racism;\n       Whereas the 10 articles of the Fatah Constitution that \n     oppose Israel and Zionism are: (1) ``Article (4): The \n     Palestinian struggle is part and parcel of the world-wide \n     struggle against Zionism, colonialism and international \n     imperialism.''; (2) ``Article (7): The Zionist Movement is \n     racial, colonial and aggressive in ideology, goals, \n     organization and method.''; (3) ``Article (8): The Israeli \n     existence in Palestine is a Zionist invasion with a colonial \n     expansive base, and it is a natural ally to colonialism and \n     international imperialism.''; (4) ``Article (12): Complete \n     liberation of Palestine, and eradication of Zionist economic, \n     political, military and cultural existence.''; (5) ``Article \n     (17): Armed public revolution is the inevitable method to \n     liberating Palestine.''; (6) ``Article (19): Armed struggle \n     is a strategy and not a tactic, and the Palestinian Arab \n     People's armed revolution is a decisive factor in the \n     liberation fight and in uprooting the Zionist existence, and \n     this struggle will not cease unless the Zionist state is \n     demolished and Palestine is completely liberated.''; (7) \n     ``Article (22): Opposing any political solution offered as an \n     alternative to demolishing the Zionist occupation in \n     Palestine, as well as any project intended to liquidate the \n     Palestinian case or impose any international mandate on its \n     people.''; (8) ``Article (23): Maintaining relations with \n     Arab countries . . . with the proviso that the armed struggle \n     is not negatively affected''; (9) ``Article (24): Maintaining \n     relations with all liberal forces supporting our just \n     struggle in order to resist Zionism and imperialism''; and \n     (10) ``Article (25): Convincing concerned countries in the \n     world to prevent Jewish immigration to Palestine as a method \n     of solving the problem.'': Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian \n     Authority, who is also head of the Fatah Party, to officially \n     abrogate the 10 articles from the Fatah Constitution that \n     call for the destruction of Israel and terrorism against \n     Israel, oppose any political solution, and label Zionism as \n     racism; and\n       (2) condemns the continuing existence of these articles as \n     part of the Fatah Constitution.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation to encourage Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, \nwho is also the chairman of the Fatah Party, to officially abrogate the \n10 articles in the Fatah Constitution that call for Israel's \ndestruction and terrorism against Israel, oppose any political \nsolution, and label Zionism as racism.\n  In order to move the Middle East peace process forward, it is \nnecessary that the Fatah Party recognize Israel's legitimacy. The Fatah \nConstitution makes this impossible. At present, 10 articles in the \nconstitution oppose Israel and Zionism. They read as follows:\n\n       (1) ``Article [4]: The Palestinian struggle is part and \n     parcel of the world-wide struggle against Zionism, \n     colonialism and international imperialism.''\n       (2) ``Article [7]: The Zionist Movement is racial, colonial \n     and aggressive in ideology, goals, organization and method.''\n       (3) ``Article [8]: The Israeli existence in Palestine is a \n     Zionist invasion with a colonial expansive base, and it is a \n     natural ally to colonialism and international imperialism.''\n       (4) ``Article [12]: Complete liberation of Palestine, and \n     eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and \n     cultural existence.''\n       (5) ``Article [17]: Armed public revolution is the \n     inevitable method to liberating Palestine.''\n       (6) ``Article [19]: Armed struggle is a strategy and not a \n     tactic, and the Palestinian Arab People's armed revolution is \n     a decisive factor in the liberation fight and in uprooting \n     the Zionist existence, and this struggle will not cease \n     unless the Zionist state is demolished and Palestine is \n     completely liberated.''\n       (7) ``Article [22]: Opposing any political solution offered \n     as an alternative to demolishing the Zionist occupation in \n     Palestine, as well as any project intended to liquidate the \n     Palestinian case or impose any international mandate on its \n     people.''\n       (8) ``Article [23]: Maintaining relations with Arab \n     countries . . . with the proviso that the armed struggle is \n     not negatively affected.''\n       (9) ``Article [24]: Maintaining relations with all liberal \n     forces supporting our just struggle in order to resist \n     Zionism and imperialism.''\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n       (10) ``Article [25]: Convincing concerned countries in the \n     world to prevent Jewish immigration to Palestine as a method \n     of solving the problem.''\n\n  The issue of the Mideast peace process has been tortuous. There have \nbeen so many developments since Israel emerged as a state in 1949. The \nenmity, which has existed for thousands of years, has meant senseless \nkilling, terrorism in Israel, and Hezbollah firing rockets into \nnorthern Israel, prompting the justified retaliation by Israel as a \nmatter of self-defense.\n  Much has changed since the Fatah Constitution was written in 1964. \nWhile some question the relevance of the document with respect to the \nday-to-day operations of the Palestinian Government, the fact remains \nthat the language is incendiary. By striking the polemical language \nfrom its constitution, Fatah would be setting an example for the Arab \nworld. It would demonstrate that the Palestinian leadership understands \nthe importance of words and perceptions in the peace process.\n  This is not the first time I have addressed such an issue. In 1994, \nthe U.S. Congress adopted an amendment put forward by Senator Shelby \nand myself, which conditioned U.S. aid on the Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization's elimination of provisions in its charter that called for \nthe destruction of Israel. The amendment was accepted by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The problem of the institutionalization of inflammatory language in \nthe Middle East extends beyond the Fatah Constitution. The Center for \nReligious Freedom, formerly affiliated with Freedom House, in a 2006 \nreport entitled ``Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerance,'' stated \nthat despite 2005 statements by the Saudi Foreign Minister that their \neducational curricula have been reformed, this is ``simply not the \ncase.'' On the contrary, religious textbooks continue to advocate the \ndestruction of any non-Wahhabi Muslim. Saudi Arabia has established \nWahhabism, an extreme form of Islam, as the official state doctrine, \nand about 5 million children are instructed each year in Islamic \nstudies using Saudi Ministry of Education textbooks.\n  My intent in bringing the Fatah Constitution into focus now is not to \nundermine the Presidency of Mahmoud Abbas. Rather, my intent is to \nensure that these problems of perception are addressed now so that all \nparties can take further steps towards peace.\n  The November 27, 2007, Joint Israeli-Palestinian Declaration at \nAnnapolis stated, ``We express our determination to bring an end to \nbloodshed, suffering and decades of conflict between our peoples; to \nusher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, \ndignity, respect and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of \npeace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether \ncommitted by Palestinians or Israelis.''\n  As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on October 15, 2007, in \nRamallah, ``If you're going to have a two-state solution, you have to \naccept the right of the other party to exist. If you're going to have a \ntwo-state solution that is born of negotiation, you're going to have to \nrenounce violence.'' I urge President Abbas to take action, not only in \nwords, but with deeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2450-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 500--HONORING MILITARY CHILDREN DURING ``NATIONAL \n                     MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the Space \nFoundation's 25th anniversary. Throughout this time, space has become \nan integral part of our national security and everyday life. The Space \nFoundation has been instrumental in our advancements in space, and I am \nproud to recognize their 25th anniversary.\n   The Space Foundation is a nonprofit organization which was founded \nin 1983 by a small group of innovative individuals in Colorado Springs, \nCO. It began as an organization ``to foster, develop and promote, among \nthe citizens of the U.S. and among other people of the world, a greater \nunderstanding and awareness of the practical and theoretical \nutilization of space for the benefit of civilization and the fostering \nof a peaceful and prosperous world.'' They have certainly lived up to \nthis creed and have more than excelled in their promotion and \nedification of space.\n   The Space Foundation is a leader in exploration and development. \nThey work with all components of space including commercial, civil, and \nnational security. The Foundation is regarded internationally as a \nleading space advocacy organization, and is a member of the U.S. \nDelegation to the United Nation's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space.\n   The Space Foundation has recognized the need for increased attention \nto space education. Their one-of-a-kind program allocates resources and \nhelps prepare teachers to not only teach children about space, but to \nexcite them about space. They have connected with teachers in all 50 \nStates as well as countries in Europe and Asia. Beyond the classroom, \nthe Space Foundation seeks to raise awareness and involvement in \ncommunity programs. They hold two of the three top conferences for \nspace professionals in the world: Strategic Space and Defense and the \nNational Space Symposium. The National Space Symposium is the premier \nspace policy and program forum in the world. It is a unique opportunity \nfor interaction and discussion among the world's space community.\n   There is no question that space will continue to play an \nincreasingly important strategic role in both technological advancement \nand national security. The Space Foundation will undoubtedly continue \nto play a major role in this arena.

Johnson and \n     commonly known as the Kerner Commission, found in 1968 that \n     ``[o]ur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one \n     white--separate and unequal'';\n       Whereas Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-284; 82 Stat. 73), \n     and President Johnson signed the Act into law on April 11, \n     1968, one week after the assassination of Dr. King;\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in \n     housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of \n     race, color, national origin, and religion;\n       Whereas, in section 808 of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-383; 88 Stat. 728), \n     Congress amended the Fair Housing Act to include protection \n     on the basis of sex;\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Public Law \n     100-430; 102 Stat. 1619), passed by overwhelming margins in \n     Congress, included protection on the basis of familial status \n     and disability and expanded the definition of \n     ``discriminatory housing practices'' to include interference \n     and intimidation;\n       Whereas Congress's intent in passing the Fair Housing Act \n     was broad and inclusive, to advance equal opportunity in \n     housing and achieve racial integration for the benefit of all \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas housing integration affects other dimensions of \n     life, including educational attainment, employment \n     opportunities, access to health care, and home equity;\n       Whereas the majority of people in the United States support \n     neighborhood integration and numerous studies have shown the \n     universal benefits of residential integration;\n       Whereas the National Fair Housing Alliance estimates that \n     3,700,000 violations of fair housing laws still occur each \n     year against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and \n     American Indians, and that number does not include violations \n     that occur on the basis of other national origins, religion, \n     sex, or familial status or against persons with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     estimates that only 1 percent of individuals who believe they \n     are victims of housing discrimination report those violations \n     of fair housing laws to the government, and this \n     underreporting is a major obstacle to achieving equal \n     opportunity in housing;\n       Whereas testing of the enforcement of fair housing laws \n     continues to uncover a high rate of discrimination in the \n     rental, sales, mortgage lending, and insurance markets; and\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Act is an essential component of \n     our Nation's civil rights legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 40th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) \n     and the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Fair Housing \n     Amendments Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-430; 102 Stat. 1619);\n       (2) supports activities to recognize and celebrate the \n     historical milestone represented by the anniversaries of the \n     enactment of the Fair Housing Act and the enactment of the \n     Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988; and\n       (3) encourages all levels of government to rededicate \n     themselves to the enforcement and the ideals of fair housing \n     laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2485-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2485-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--EXPRESSING CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR \n       THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL HEALTH CARE DECISIONS DAY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Brown, and Mr. \nWhitehouse) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 73\n\n       Whereas National Health Care Decisions Day is designed to \n     raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for health \n     care decisions related to end-of-life care and medical \n     decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for \n     themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance \n     directives to communicate these important decisions;\n       Whereas the Patient Self-Determination Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395cc(f) et seq.) guarantees patients the right to \n     information about their rights under State law regarding \n     accepting or refusing medical treatment;\n       Whereas it is estimated that only a minority of Americans \n     have executed advance directives, including those who are \n     terminally ill or living with life-threatening or life-\n     limiting illnesses;\n       Whereas advance directives offer individuals the \n     opportunity to discuss with loved ones in advance of a health \n     care crisis and decide what measures would be appropriate for \n     them when it comes to end-of-life care;\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\n       Whereas the preparation of an advance directive would \n     advise family members, health care providers, and other \n     persons as to how an individual would want to be treated with \n     respect to health care;\n       Whereas to avoid any legal or medical confusion due to the \n     emotions involved in end-of-life decisions, it is in the best \n     interest of all Americans that each person over the age of 18 \n     communicate his or her wishes by creating an advance \n     directive;\n       Whereas the Conditions of Participation in Medicare and \n     Medicaid, section 489.102 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     resolution), require all participating facilities to provide \n     information to patients and the public on the topic of \n     advance directives;\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     recognized that the use of advance directives is tied to \n     quality health care and has included discussions of advance \n     directives in the criteria of the Physician Quality Reporting \n     Initiative;\n       Whereas establishing National Health Care Decisions Day \n     will encourage health care facilities and professionals as \n     well as chaplains, attorneys, and others to participate in a \n     collective, nationwide effort to provide clear, concise, and \n     consistent information to the public about health care \n     decision-making, particularly advance directives; and\n       Whereas as a result of National Health Care Decisions Day, \n     recognized on April 16, 2008, more Americans will have \n     conversations about their health care decisions, more \n     Americans will execute advance directives to make their \n     wishes known, and fewer families and health care providers \n     will have to struggle with making difficult health care \n     decisions in the absence of guidance from the patient: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Health Care \n     Decisions Day;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of advance care planning \n     for all adult Americans;\n       (3) encourages each person in the United States who is over \n     the age of 18 to prepare an advance directive to assist his \n     or her loved ones, health care providers, and others as they \n     honor his or her wishes;\n       (4) calls upon all members of Congress to execute such \n     documents and discussions for themselves; and\n       (5) encourages health care, civic, educational, religious, \n     and for- and non-profit organizations to encourage \n     individuals to prepare advance directives to ensure that \n     their wishes and rights with respect to health care are \n     protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2486-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2486-S2487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4387.

ENFORCEMENT UNDER HUD BACKUP LICENSING SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Summons Authority.--The Secretary may--\n       (1) examine any books, papers, records, or other data of \n     any loan originator operating in any State which is subject \n     to a licensing system established by the Secretary under \n     section 708; and\n       (2) summon any loan originator referred to in paragraph (1) \n     or any person having possession, custody, or care of the \n     reports and records relating to such loan originator, to \n     appear before the Secretary or any delegate of the Secretary \n     at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such \n     books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony, \n     under oath, as may be relevant or material to an \n     investigation of such loan originator for compliance with the \n     requirements of this title.\n       (b) Examination Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary establishes a licensing \n     system under section 708 for any State, the Secretary shall \n     appoint examiners for the purposes of administering such \n     section.\n       (2) Power to examine.--Any examiner appointed under \n     paragraph (1) shall have power, on behalf of the Secretary, \n     to make any examination of any loan originator operating in \n     any State which is subject to a licensing system established \n     by the Secretary under section 708 whenever the Secretary \n     determines an examination of any loan originator is necessary \n     to determine the compliance by the originator with this \n     title.\n       (3) Report of examination.--Each examiner appointed under \n     paragraph (1) shall make a full and detailed report of \n     examination of any loan originator examined to the Secretary.\n       (4) Administration of oaths and affirmations; evidence.--In \n     connection with examinations of loan originators operating in \n     any State which is subject to a licensing system established \n     by the Secretary under section 708, or with other types of \n     investigations to determine compliance with applicable law \n     and regulations, the Secretary and examiners appointed by the \n     Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations and examine \n     and take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter \n     in respect to the affairs of any such loan originator.\n       (5) Assessments.--The cost of conducting any examination of \n     any loan originator operating in any State which is subject \n     to a licensing system established by the Secretary under \n     section 708 shall be assessed by the Secretary against the \n     loan originator to meet the Secretary's expenses in carrying \n     out such examination.\n       (c) Cease and Desist Proceeding.--\n       (1) Authority of secretary.--If the Secretary finds, after \n     notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is \n     violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision \n     of this title, or any regulation thereunder, with respect to \n     a State which is subject to a licensing system established by \n     the Secretary under section 708, the Secretary may publish \n     such findings and enter an order requiring such person, and \n     any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the \n     violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or \n     should have known would contribute to such violation, to \n     cease and desist from committing or causing such violation \n     and any future violation of the same provision, rule, or \n     regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a person \n     to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, \n     require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect \n     compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such \n     terms and conditions and within such time as the Secretary \n     may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate, require future compliance or \n     steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for \n     such period of time as the Secretary may specify, with such \n     provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.\n       (2) Hearing.--The notice instituting proceedings pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30 \n     days nor later than 60 days after service of the notice \n     unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Secretary \n     with the consent of any respondent so served.\n       (3) Temporary order.--Whenever the Secretary determines \n     that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified \n     in the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to paragraph \n     (1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in \n     significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant \n     harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest \n     prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Secretary may \n     enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and \n     desist from the violation or threatened violation and to take \n     such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation \n     and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, \n     significant harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the \n     public interest as the Secretary deems appropriate pending \n     completion of such proceedings. Such an order shall be \n     entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, \n     unless the Secretary determines that notice and hearing prior \n     to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public \n     interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon \n     service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, \n     or suspended by the Secretary or a court of competent \n     jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending \n     the completion of the proceedings.\n       (4) Review of temporary orders.--\n       (A) Review by secretary.--At any time after the respondent \n     has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order \n     pursuant to paragraph (3), the respondent may apply to the \n     Secretary to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended. \n     If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-\n     desist order entered without a prior hearing before the \n     Secretary, the respondent may, within 10 days after the date \n     on which the order was served, request a hearing on such \n     application and the Secretary shall hold a hearing and render \n     a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.\n       (B) Judicial review.--Within--\n       (i) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a \n     temporary cease-and-desist order entered with a prior hearing \n     before the Secretary; or\n       (ii) 10 days after the Secretary renders a decision on an \n     application and hearing under paragraph (1), with respect to \n     any temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior \n     hearing before the Secretary,\n     the respondent may apply to the United States district court \n     for the district in which the respondent resides or has its \n     principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia, \n     for an order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the \n     effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court \n     shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent \n     served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered \n     without a prior hearing before the Secretary may not apply to \n     the court except after hearing and decision by the Secretary \n     on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).\n       (C) No automatic stay of temporary order.--The commencement \n     of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall not, unless \n     specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (5) Authority of the secretary to prohibit persons from \n     serving as loan originators.--In any cease-and-desist \n     proceeding under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\n     an order to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and \n     permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary shall \n     determine, any person who has violated this title or \n     regulations thereunder, from acting as a loan originator if \n     the conduct of that person demonstrates unfitness to serve as \n     a loan originator.\n       (d) Authority of the Secretary To Assess Money Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may impose a civil penalty \n     on a loan originator operating in any State which is subject \n     to licensing system established by the Secretary under \n     section 708, if the Secretary finds, on the record after \n     notice and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator \n     has violated or failed to comply with any requirement of this \n     title or any regulation prescribed by the Secretary under \n     this title or order issued under subsection (c).\n       (2) Maximum amount of penalty.--The maximum amount of \n     penalty for each act or omission described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be $5,000 for each day the violation continues.\n\n     SEC. 715.

A respondent \n     served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered \n     without a prior hearing before the Secretary may not apply to \n     the court except after hearing and decision by the Secretary \n     on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).\n       (C) No automatic stay of temporary order.--The commencement \n     of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall not, unless \n     specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (5) Authority of the secretary to prohibit persons from \n     serving as loan originators.--In any cease-and-desist \n     proceeding under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue an \n     order to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and \n     permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary shall \n     determine, any person who has violated this title or \n     regulations thereunder, from acting as a loan originator if \n     the conduct of that person demonstrates unfitness to serve as \n     a loan originator.\n       (d) Authority of the Secretary To Assess Money Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may impose a civil penalty \n     on a loan originator operating in any State which is subject \n     to licensing system established by the Secretary under \n     section 708, if the Secretary finds, on the record after \n     notice and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator \n     has violated or failed to comply with any requirement of this \n     title or any regulation prescribed by the Secretary under \n     this title or order issued under subsection (c).\n       (2) Maximum amount of penalty.--The maximum amount of \n     penalty for each act or omission described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be $5,000 for each day the violation continues.\n\n     SEC. 715. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title may be construed to preempt the law \n     of any State, to the extent that such State law provides \n     greater protection to consumers than is provided under this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 716.

If any \n     employee elects to give up membership in a health insurance \n     program or the health insurance program is not continued by \n     such Director, the employee shall be permitted to select an \n     alternate Federal health insurance program within 30 days \n     after such election or notice, without regard to any other \n     regularly scheduled open season.\n\n     SEC. 344.

Res. 73\n\n       Whereas National Health Care Decisions Day is designed to \n     raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for health \n     care decisions related to end-of-life care and medical \n     decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for \n     themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance \n     directives to communicate these important decisions;\n       Whereas the Patient Self-Determination Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395cc(f) et seq.) guarantees patients the right to \n     information about their rights under State law regarding \n     accepting or refusing medical treatment;\n       Whereas it is estimated that only a minority of Americans \n     have executed advance directives, including those who are \n     terminally ill or living with life-threatening or life-\n     limiting illnesses;\n       Whereas advance directives offer individuals the \n     opportunity to discuss with loved ones in advance of a health \n     care crisis and decide what measures would be appropriate for \n     them when it comes to end-of-life care;\n       Whereas the preparation of an advance directive would \n     advise family members, health care providers, and other \n     persons as to how an individual would want to be treated with \n     respect to health care;\n       Whereas to avoid any legal or medical confusion due to the \n     emotions involved in end-of-life decisions, it is in the best \n     interest of all Americans that each person over the age of 18 \n     communicate his or her wishes by creating an advance \n     directive;\n       Whereas the Conditions of Participation in Medicare and \n     Medicaid, section 489.102 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     resolution), require all participating facilities to\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n     provide information to patients and the public on the topic \n     of advance directives;\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     recognized that the use of advance directives is tied to \n     quality health care and has included discussions of advance \n     directives in the criteria of the Physician Quality Reporting \n     Initiative;\n       Whereas establishing National Health Care Decisions Day \n     will encourage health care facilities and professionals as \n     well as chaplains, attorneys, and others to participate in a \n     collective, nationwide effort to provide clear, concise, and \n     consistent information to the public about health care \n     decision-making, particularly advance directives; and\n       Whereas as a result of National Health Care Decisions Day, \n     recognized on April 16, 2008, more Americans will have \n     conversations about their health care decisions, more \n     Americans will execute advance directives to make their \n     wishes known, and fewer families and health care providers \n     will have to struggle with making difficult health care \n     decisions in the absence of guidance from the patient: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Health Care \n     Decisions Day;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of advance care planning \n     for all adult Americans;\n       (3) encourages each person in the United States who is over \n     the age of 18 to prepare an advance directive to assist his \n     or her loved ones, health care providers, and others as they \n     honor his or her wishes;\n       (4) calls upon all members of Congress to execute such \n     documents and discussions for themselves; and\n       (5) encourages health care, civic, educational, religious, \n     and for- and non-profit organizations to encourage \n     individuals to prepare advance directives to ensure that \n     their wishes and rights with respect to health care are \n     protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2589-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2589-S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING AND HONORING 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIR HOUSING ACT AND 20TH \n           ANNIVERSARY OF FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1988\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 503, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 503) recognizing and honoring the \n     40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act and the 20th \n     anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise to support this resolution \nhonoring the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act and the 20th \nanniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act.\n  But first I want to honor a man whose work helped pave the way for \nthis landmark civil rights legislation. Forty years ago, the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. lost his life to a sniper's bullet. Today, \nwe remember him as one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our \ncountry. We know his dream. We are intimately familiar with it. It is a \ndream conceived in the founding of our country and enshrined in the \nwords of the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, a \ndream that lives today in our values, our identities, our highest \nideals as Americans.\n  This is the dream: that all men are created equal, and that in a just \nsociety all are afforded the same opportunities.\n  A week after Dr. King's assassination, and in a step closer to the \nfulfillment of this dream, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Fair Housing Act prohibits \ndiscrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, \nand religion. In 1974, Congress added protection on the basis of sex. \nIn 1988, thanks to the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator \nSpecter, Congress included protection on the basis of familial status \nand disability.\n  We have made a lot of progress since the summer of 1966, when Dr. \nKing led a movement to protest housing discrimination and slum \nconditions for African Americans in Chicago. But if he were alive \ntoday, he would be the first to say--we aren't there yet. Segregation \npersists in our schools and neighborhoods. We are in the middle of a \nhousing crisis that is hitting African-American and Hispanic families \nand communities particularly hard. In Chicago, African-American \nborrowers were 14 times more likely to have a higher cost loan from \nWells Fargo than were White borrowers. This is a pattern that repeats \nall across the country. African-American and Latino families were \ndramatically more likely to have subprime loans than White families. \nRight now, millions face the possibility of foreclosure. And when they \nlose their homes, they lose their assets. They lose their plans for \nfinancing their kids' education, for building a better life for \nthemselves in the future, for closing the income and education gaps.\n  For too many Americans, the dream is still just that--a dream, with \nlittle chance of becoming reality. We may have all been created equal, \nbut since then we have been treated very differently. We are treated \ndifferently because of the color of our skin, the faith we practice, \nwhether we are a man or a woman, single or with children, or use a \nwheelchair and a ramp to enter our apartment.\n  The irony is that we have fair housing laws that make this kind of \ntreatment not only unfair but illegal--and we have had them for 40 \nyears. Yet 3.7 million violations of these laws occur each year against \nAfrican Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Indian Americans. This \ndoesn't even include the number of violations that occur on the basis \nof other protected classes. Only 1 percent of people who believe they \nare victims of fair housing violations report it to the Government. \nTesting on the enforcement of fair housing laws shows a high rate of \ndiscrimination in the rental, sales, mortgage lending, and insurance \nmarkets. More than four decades after Dr. King and his supporters \nmarched through the streets of Chicago to fight housing discrimination, \nAfrican Americans and Latinos in Cook County report substantial levels \nof unfair--and illegal--treatment in the housing industry.\n  The intent of the Fair Housing Act was broad and inclusive: to \nadvance equal opportunity in housing and achieve racial integration for \nthe benefit of all Americans. But enforcement of this law has been \nnarrow and incomplete. Where you live profoundly affects where you \nwork, what you do, where you send your kids to school, whether they \ngrow up healthy and safe. As long as our commitment to fair housing \nlaws--to civil rights--remains timid, we will never end segregation. We \nwill never declare victory over poverty. We will never build a truly \njust society.\n  As we honor Dr. King, former Senator Walter Mondale and former \nSenator Edward Brooke, who cosponsored the original Fair Housing Act, \nand others who made possible fair housing laws, we need to remember \nthat it is not enough to pass laws. We have to enforce them. The dream \nof equality is our Nation's moral compass. Our duty as legislators and \nas citizens is to make sure the needle points in the right direction.\n  I thank Senators Specter, Kennedy, Dodd, Brown, and Voinovich for \njoining me today in honoring the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing \nAct and the 20th anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act, and I \nurge my colleagues in Congress to renew their dedication to upholding \nthese laws. These laws may be 40 years old, but the dream they seek to \nmake real is as old as our country.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 503) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 503\n\n       Whereas 2008 marks the 40th anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.);\n       Whereas 2008 also marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Public \n     Law 100-430; 102 Stat. 1619);\n       Whereas the Chicago Freedom Movement, which took place from \n     1965 to 1967 and was led by the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther \n     King, Jr., raised the national consciousness about housing \n     discrimination and shaped the debate that led to landmark \n     fair housing legislation;\n       Whereas the National Advisory Commission on Civil \n     Disorders, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and \n     commonly\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\n     known as the Kerner Commission, found in 1968 that ``[o]ur \n     nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white--\n     separate and unequal'';\n       Whereas Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-284; 82 Stat. 73), \n     and President Johnson signed the Act into law on April 11, \n     1968, one week after the assassination of Dr. King;\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in \n     housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of \n     race, color, national origin, and religion;\n       Whereas, in section 808 of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-383; 88 Stat. 728), \n     Congress amended the Fair Housing Act to include protection \n     on the basis of sex;\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Public Law \n     100-430; 102 Stat. 1619), passed by overwhelming margins in \n     Congress, included protection on the basis of familial status \n     and disability and expanded the definition of \n     ``discriminatory housing practices'' to include interference \n     and intimidation;\n       Whereas Congress's intent in passing the Fair Housing Act \n     was broad and inclusive, to advance equal opportunity in \n     housing and achieve racial integration for the benefit of all \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas housing integration affects other dimensions of \n     life, including educational attainment, employment \n     opportunities, access to health care, and home equity;\n       Whereas the majority of people in the United States support \n     neighborhood integration and numerous studies have shown the \n     universal benefits of residential integration;\n       Whereas the National Fair Housing Alliance estimates that \n     3,700,000 violations of fair housing laws still occur each \n     year against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and \n     American Indians, and that number does not include violations \n     that occur on the basis of other national origins, religion, \n     sex, or familial status or against persons with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     estimates that only 1 percent of individuals who believe they \n     are victims of housing discrimination report those violations \n     of fair housing laws to the government, and this \n     underreporting is a major obstacle to achieving equal \n     opportunity in housing;\n       Whereas testing of the enforcement of fair housing laws \n     continues to uncover a high rate of discrimination in the \n     rental, sales, mortgage lending, and insurance markets; and\n       Whereas the Fair Housing Act is an essential component of \n     our Nation's civil rights legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 40th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) \n     and the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Fair Housing \n     Amendments Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-430; 102 Stat. 1619);\n       (2) supports activities to recognize and celebrate the \n     historical milestone represented by the anniversaries of the \n     enactment of the Fair Housing Act and the enactment of the \n     Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988; and\n       (3) encourages all levels of government to rededicate \n     themselves to the enforcement and the ideals of fair housing \n     laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/03/senate-section/article/S2590-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL\n\n  Mr. DODD.
