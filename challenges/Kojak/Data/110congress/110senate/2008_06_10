Mr. President, last Friday, I spoke of the high energy \nprices--I have done that on a number of occasions recently--and the \nneed for the Senate to pass the Consumer-First Energy Act. That will be \nthe first vote we will have.\n  When I came to the Senate floor Friday, we had already had a very \ndifficult day. We got up and saw in the newspaper that day that the \nmarket had crashed and gas prices were spiraling up to $132 a barrel. \nThere were other things that were not good from an economic \nperspective. I did not have any idea that the price of oil would go up \nto almost $140 a barrel. Actually, it did that during the remarks I was \nmaking.\n  The massive spike in oil prices we saw on Friday and the \ncorresponding 400-point drop in the Dow only compounded the crisis that \nhas been growing for months and even years. When President Bush took \noffice, a barrel of oil cost $32 and a gallon of gasoline cost less \nthan $1.50. Of course, now, the average price in our country is more \nthan $4 a gallon, for the first time in the history of our country.\n  The President took us to war--a war of choice--and Vice President \nCheney invited oil executives to the White House to secretly write our \nnational energy legislation. It was secret, so people went to court--it \nwent all the way to the Supreme Court--to try to find out whom he met \nwith, what he talked about, and what arrangements he made with the big \noil companies. He was able to keep it secret. It is still secret. All \nwe know is that the oil companies made $250 billion in net profit last \nyear. So we have a pretty good idea what went on in the White House. \nThey never asked the oil executives, obviously, to build new refineries \nor to invest in clean, renewable alternative fuels. They apparently \nfailed to consider the national security implications of our addiction \nto oil and never\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\nasked the oil companies to invest in clean energy.\n  You can take all the oil in the world--100 percent of it--and you can \nadd in ANWR and all of the offshore we have in America today, and we \nhave less than 3 percent of the oil in the world. We cannot produce our \nway out of the problems we have. Can we do more with production? Of \ncourse. That is the reason Democrats led the charge last year to bring \ninto fruition more drilling off the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  We know we have to do something to wean ourselves from the 21 million \nbarrels of oil we use every day--and 65 percent of that we import. But \nthe Bush administration has failed to address these concerns. Sadly, \nthe Republican Members of Congress stood by his side cheering him on \nand cheering on the oil companies to make more money.\n  The American people are suffering the consequences of the Bush \nadministration's recklessness. As we speak, our airlines are on the \nverge of bankruptcy. What they have made a decision on last week--even \nthough the airplanes were filled with passengers--is they have cut 20 \npercent of the flights around the country. Why? Because with every \nairplane load of passengers they haul, they lose money. They want to \nhave airplanes that use less fuel, so even though the airlines are \nfilled with passengers, they are saying they are losing more money at \nthat airline that is going to Missoula, MT, or Kansas City, and \ntherefore they are going to stop the flight--even though it is full--\nbecause that airline used more fuel than one taking somebody the same \ndistance to someplace else. That sounds pretty crazy, but the airline \nindustry is on the verge of not being able to continue. We cannot \ncompete at this stage with the European airline industry. Here, we pay \n$1.40 for a gallon of aviation fuel; they pay 75 to 80 cents there. We \ncannot compete. The cost of fuel is exceeding half of the cost of an \nairline, and they simply cannot make it.\n  It wasn't until Democrats won the majority that we finally were able \nto pass an energy bill last year that did some things. For the first \ntime in 30 years, we increased the fuel economy standards and did a \nlittle bit to promote clean, American-made alternative fuels. We \ncontinued offering responsible solutions to reverse the energy crisis--\nand there is an energy cries.\n  All this time, out there every day, we have the Sun shining, the wind \nblowing, and steam coming from the Earth, and we are doing nothing to \ncapture that--virtually nothing. Why? Because we cannot get our \nRepublican colleagues to join us in passing tax incentives to allow the \ngreat entrepreneurial spirit of America to invest in renewable fuels. \nWe want to reverse the energy cries. Yet our Republican colleagues \ninexplicably are refusing to work with us and prefer to simply continue \nto feed our addiction to oil. Some Republicans propose drilling in \nANWR, but experts agree that we cannot drill our way out of this \ncrisis. The ANWR thing won't pass. It has been decided that is not \nsomething we need to do.\n  Last week, Republicans took to the floor and talked about high gas \nprices. We got their memo saying they want this global warming thing to \nbe ``global warming and gas prices.'' When they had the chance to vote \non that, they walked away from it. Mr. President, they have the \nopportunity today to vote to bring us to the point where we can start \nlegislating on gas prices. I hope their rhetoric last week is an \nindication that they are going to allow us to proceed.\n\n  This morning, we will vote to invoke cloture so we can move to pass \nthe Consumer-First Energy Act. They have blocked this responsible \nlegislation, or something similar to it, in the past. Maybe this time \nit will be different.\n  Observers have said that now that gas is over $4 per gallon, it might \nbe a tipping point for the American people. I hope it will be a tipping \npoint for the Republicans in the Senate. We have SUVs that are now not \nbeing bought, which are manufactured by our manufacturers. We have \nhybrids coming into being, and that is good. Some people are abandoning \ntheir SUVs and cars--because they have no alternative--for public \ntransportation. In States such as Montana or Nevada, where you have \nlarge areas of rural roads, people have to drive. There is no public \ntransportation available. So public transportation is not an option for \neverybody, especially Americans living in rural areas and commuting \nlong distances--areas not served by public transportation. No matter \nwhere we live or what our transportation options are, we all deserve a \ncleaner, safer, more affordable future.\n  Following the lead of the American people, perhaps Republican \nSenators have reached their own tipping point and are now ready to \nembrace change with us. We hope so. The choice today is simple: They \ncan continue to stand with the Bush-Cheney administration and the \nmodern-day oil barons or they can join us on the side of the struggling \nAmerican families who deserve better.\n  I urge all of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to support \nallowing us to proceed on this legislation. This is responsible \nlegislation. We will end billions of dollars of tax breaks for these \nhuge oil companies and executives who have been hauling in record \nsalaries while the profits of the companies are skyrocketing. Second, \nwe force the oil companies in this legislation to do their part by \ninvesting some of their profits in clean, affordable alternative \nenergy. We protect the American people from price gouging. We stand up \nto OPEC and countries that are colluding together to keep oil prices \nhigh. We look at these margins. Many people believe the high cost of \noil is sheer speculation.\n  This legislation, I acknowledge, is not a silver bullet that will \nsolve the energy crisis, but it will take a nip out of it. After 7\\1/2\\ \nyears of the Bush-Cheney energy policy, there are no quick fixes. The \nroad ahead won't be easy. This is a start to help lower prices and to \nhelp working families make ends meet. It is one small step on a long \nand uphill road to a cleaner, more affordable energy future and to \nrestoring the affordability of the American dream to families all over \nour country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the weekend, as we all know, the \naverage U.S. gas prices hit an alltime high of more than $4 a gallon. I \nonly point this out because it seems our friends on the other side \naren't aware of it. In the middle of what some are calling the biggest \nenergy shock in a generation, they seem baffled. Faced with a national \noutrage over gas prices, they propose as a solution, of all things, a \nwindfall profits tax. If the idea had any merit at all, Republicans \nwould consider it. But, of course, it doesn't.\n  We know from experience that Jimmy Carter tried a tax hike in 1980, \nand it was a miserable failure.\n  The Congressional Research Service says its only effect--its only \neffect--was to depress domestic production, thus significantly \nincreasing our reliance on foreign oil and, in the end, less domestic \nproduction led to significantly less revenue from the tax that was \nexpected. The same thing, of course, would happen again.\n  The biggest hit would not be to the energy companies, it would be to \nthe American consumer who now dreads pulling his or her car into the \ngas station. Hitting the gas companies might make for good campaign \nliterature or evening news clips, but it will not address the problem. \nThis bill is not a serious response to high gas prices. It is just a \ngimmick. Don't take my word for it. The Democrats themselves said as \nmuch when their leadership proposed this sham solution last month.\n  Americans have lost patience with Democratic inaction on gas prices. \nAmericans understand supply and demand. They know the only way to drive \nprices down is to drive production up at home by reducing demand \nthrough the kind of sensible action we took last year on fuel \nefficiency and renewable fuels. With gas now at $4 a gallon, recent \npolls show that an increasing number of Americans are calling on us to \nexercise the option of exploring for energy at home.\n  What is the Democratic response to all this? Last week, the majority \nproposed a climate change tax that would have raised gas prices $1.40 a \ngallon higher than they already are. They are hoping the idea of going \nafter energy\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\ncompanies will create the illusion of action, after a week in which \nthey themselves fought for a bill that would make the problem worse. \nWhat a political charade.\n  This bill is not a serious approach to lowering gas prices. Our \nfriends proposed the same one last month. It went nowhere. They didn't \neven bring it up because their own committee chairman opposed it. The \nDemocratic chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the \njunior Senator from New Mexico, called the windfall profits tax \n``arbitrary.'' The senior Senator from New York cautioned that another \nkey provision of the bill would drive jobs overseas.\n  If the Democrats themselves don't like the bill and oppose its \nprovisions, why are they reviving it?\n  Democrats will claim this bill will bring gas prices down, but in \ndoing so they are counting on Americans to forget a basic law of \neconomics: raising taxes on those who produce something leads to an \nincrease in the price of products they sell. This was true in Adam \nSmith's pin factory. It is true for energy companies today. More taxes \nmean higher prices.\n  The rational response to high gas prices is to propose a policy that \nwould actually lower them, and that is what Republicans have done. Last \nmonth, we proposed a bill that would allow us to access the 14 billion \nbarrels of known recoverable oil on the Outer Continental Shelf in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. We have also tried to open the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for very limited and safe exploration. We have \nbeen blocked by our friends on the other side at every turn.\n  When Bill Clinton first vetoed the idea in 1995, the price at the \npump was $1.06 a gallon. Gas costs nearly four times as much as it did \nthen. How high does it have to go before our friends on the other side \nallow limited and environmentally sensitive exploration of these giant \nU.S. reserves? Evidently, $4 a gallon isn't high enough for them.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a better plan for addressing gas prices, \none that respects the laws of supply and demand. In addition to the two \nprovisions I already mentioned, our bill mandates that billions of \ncoal-derived fuels be produced through clean coal technologies as a way \nof further reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  Our bill repeals the 1-year moratorium on oil shale production in \nColorado, Wyoming, and Utah, and it would accelerate the construction \nof refineries in the United States, as well as development of advanced \nbatteries for plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n  Republicans are determined to lower gas prices the only way we can \nand strengthen our energy security for the long term--by increasing \nsupply. We have tried to do so repeatedly, and every time we have tried \nwe have been blocked by our friends on the other side.\n  Just last month, 48 Democrats blocked consideration of our energy \nsupply bill. Last week, they blocked consideration of an amendment I \nsponsored that would have prevented the increase in gas taxes that the \nBoxer climate tax bill would have caused. Now, 2 days after we have \nseen the highest recorded gas price in history, they are proposing an \nidea that has already failed once and which will do nothing to ease the \npain Americans are feeling at the pump.\n  Our friends on the other side have no serious plan to address gas \nprices. They have demonstrated this in the past, and they are \ndemonstrating it today.\n  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal highlighted the kind of situation \nthat has become typical over the past several months. In a story about \nhigh gas prices, the Journal quoted a self-employed handy man in Dallas \nwho is paying twice as much money to fill his tank than he did a few \nyears ago. This is what he had to say:\n\n       I feel like I am being held at knifepoint. If they charge \n     $10 a gallon, I'm going to pay it.\n\n  It is time we got serious about helping guys such as this. It is time \nwe did something about supply to go along with our previous efforts to \naffect demand. But as long as our friends on the other side refuse, we \nwill get nowhere in this debate, and that is why gas prices have gone \nup $1.71 since the Democrats took over Congress.\n  I will vote against proceeding to this totally irresponsible bill and \nadvise my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5399-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchison be the leadoff speaker and she be allowed 7 minutes, and that \nI follow her with 15 minutes, and then we will see where it goes from \nthere.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we all know that gas prices and the high \nprice of oil and all oil products is the No. 1 issue in America. \nEverywhere we go--Legion halls, parades, weddings--this is all people \nbring up, and they demand action.\n  Today, we in the Democratic majority are stepping to the plate with \ntwo comprehensive bills--one dealing immediately with the issue of gas \nprices and the oil companies and the speculation in the market and the \nsecond dealing with changing our tax policies so that we encourage \nalternative fuels. We are stepping to the plate because we know the \nproblem America faces: $4-a-gallon gasoline. That is 267 percent higher \nthan it was when President Bush took office in 2001. And we cannot pass \nany legislation?\n  We want to debate this legislation now. We have our ideas. The other \nside has its ideas. But we wish to move forward and debate the issue \nand finally get something done, and the other side, the minority leader \nsaid vote no. He is telling the American people that he and his party \nwant to do nothing. They don't even want to debate it. That is an \nincredible statement at a time when America is crying out for action.\n  The bottom line is, we have had a White House, we have had a \nRepublican minority that has taken zero proactive steps to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil for 7 years. If it wasn't for this new \nDemocratic Congress to pass along an overdue small increase in fuel \nefficiency standards, President Bush would leave the White House with a \nrecord he would consider spotless, committing no sins against big oil \nor against OPEC.\n  We on this side are not afraid to go after big oil when they are not \ndoing the right thing, and we are not afraid to go after OPEC because \nthey are a cartel that squeezes us. We are not afraid to do some \nstrong, tough things that will, some in the short run and some in the \nlonger run, bring down the price, the all-too-high price of gasoline.\n  We are hurting as a country. We are hurting individually as \nAmericans. We are hurting as an economy, as people do not have the \nability to spend on other things. We are hurting in our foreign policy \nas every day we send over $1 billion to people we do not like, such as \nleaders of Iran, Venezuela, and other places. And we are hurting as a \nglobe as we continue to send carbon dioxide into the air. And the other \nside says: Do nothing. Don't even debate the issue.\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\n  I have heard some people talk about some things on that side. What \nabout ANWR, Alaskan oil, which was defeated in a bipartisan way a while \nago? We will debate ANWR. Nobody thinks it is going to do anything for \n7 years. I, for one, and many of us on this side supported drilling in \nthe east gulf. It is beginning to happen because it would produce more \noil and gas more quickly and do something about the price.\n  So we are not against any domestic oil production or exploration or \ngas production or exploration if it is going to make some sense. But we \ncannot drill our way out of the problem. If we do not do conservation, \nif we do not do alternative energy, and if we do not tell the big oil \ncompanies they can no longer run energy policy in America, we will not \nsucceed; plain and simple. We are finally telling them.\n  There are many provisions in this bill, but there are four major \nprovisions. One goes after OPEC, one goes after speculation, but the \none that I helped write, along with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, goes after the windfall profits of oil companies. They are \nmaking record profits, and we say take some of those record profits and \nrequire them to be placed into alternative energy.\n  When the head of ExxonMobil came before the Judiciary Committee a \ncouple of years ago, he said he didn't believe in alternative energy. \nWell, most Americans do. And unlike my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, we don't believe ExxonMobil should dictate our energy \npolicy. They are doing great, but we, the American people, are not.\n  If you want to get immediate production, do something about Saudi \nArabia. They could in a minute increase supply by 1 million, 2 million \nbarrels a day. This is not Alaska. A lot of people on the far right are \nsaying: How can Schumer say increase Saudi production when he is not \nfor Alaska production? Hello. One would pump oil into the system \nimmediately and do something immediately if we could force the Saudis \nto do it. Some of us advocate not giving them arms until they do. One \nwould take 7 years and, by many estimates, not do much to change the \nprice because it is so long into the future.\n  It is appalling. I am profoundly surprised by the other side seeking \nto block this bill. I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  Might I ask the Chair how much time I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The windfall profits tax part of this bill, which I \nhelped write, is a different windfall profits tax. It says when the \nlevel of profitability is very high, take that money and require that \nit be used for alternative energy. That is not too much to ask of \nExxonMobil or of Chevron, Texaco, or any of these newly merged oil \nfirms. It will not do all the things my colleague from Kentucky said \nbut instead will force the oil companies that are not sacrosanct to \nstart doing something to help get us out of this mess instead of just \nprofiting from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill before us is, pure and \nsimple, a pathetic attempt to even call itself an energy plan. The \nAmerican people are looking for leadership from the Congress. They are \nlooking for something that will help small businesses not be eaten up \nwith energy costs, the American family not be eaten up with the cost of \ngasoline at the pump, and what do they get in response? They get a bill \nthat does not produce one ounce of energy. Not one ounce.\n  This bill does three things: It enacts a windfall profits tax, it \nsuggests that we sue OPEC, and it forms a commission to investigate \nprice gouging. What the American people are looking for is lower \ngasoline prices at the pump and lower electricity costs in their small \nbusinesses.\n  The Republican plan that was put forward so well by Senator Domenici, \nthe ranking member of the Energy Committee, is a balanced plan that \nwill produce results. What it does is what we have done in America for \nthe last 200 years when we had a problem and that is use our ingenuity, \nuse our natural resources, use our creativity, and come together to \nmeet and beat our problems. That is what the Domenici plan does.\n  We have passed legislation that gives incentives for renewable \nenergy--wind energy and solar power--and those are great things. They \nare small, but they are great things. We wish to continue that. We wish \nto promote conservation, which we have done in past Energy bills. We \nwish to also expand nuclear power. We haven't had a nuclear powerplant \nopen in this country in 25 years. So the Energy bill we passed under \nSenator Domenici's leadership does have incentives for investment in \nnuclear power because we know it can be done clean, it can be done \nefficiently, and it will bring down the cost of electricity.\n  We have expansion of refineries in the bill that was passed 2 years \nago, again under the leadership of Senator Domenici. We have to have \nexpanded refineries because the problem in this country today is we \ndon't have enough supply. Our refineries are running at full capacity, \nbut we have not had expansion of our refineries because the regulatory \nenvironment has kept any sound management and business plan from being \noperative for an expanded facility. But we did pass legislation to \nexpand facilities, again with environmental safeguards to do it right \nand expand the amount of energy we would have in our country.\n  Our plan also creates a State option, so States will have the ability \nto explore off their Outer Continental Shelf and get a reward for it, \nget a royalty. That could produce as much as we import from Venezuela, \nand that is a modest suggestion of what we might be able to get. It \ncould be much more.\n  ANWR. Senator Reid said: Forget ANWR, we are not going to do that. It \nis not going to pass here. Well, no, it is not going to pass. As long \nas we have no leadership from the majority in the Senate, it would not \npass. But it did pass. It did pass in 1995. If President Clinton hadn't \nvetoed it, we would be pumping almost the same amount of oil that we \nimport from Saudi Arabia every day, and we would not have $4-a-gallon \ngasoline at the pump for hard-working Americans. So it can pass with \nleadership.\n  We are talking about ANWR. In an area the size of the State of South \nCarolina, the area that would be drilled is 2,000 acres, the size of \nWashington National Airport. It is a grassy plain. It gets to 70 \ndegrees below zero in the wintertime. It is not part of the beautiful, \npristine wilderness of ANWR. Yet it could bring gasoline prices down at \nthe pump. Oil shale in Colorado and Wyoming. We have a balanced \napproach that will produce energy.\n  What does the bill before us do today? Well, let us talk about the \nwindfall profits tax. In 1980, Congress passed one. What happened? It \nincreased imports, it increased our reliance on foreign oil for our \nenergy needs, and it made America more reliant on foreign sources of \nenergy for our country. That is wrong for our national security, and it \nis wrong for our economy. It exported jobs overseas. It was such an \nabject failure that Congress repealed it. Why would we be going \nbackward to something that has been proven to take jobs from America \nand increase our dependence on foreign sources?\n  OPEC. They say OPEC should be increasing its output. This is \nludicrous. First, it ignores that OPEC could retaliate; that they are \nnot going to abide by American law. At the same time the Democrats are \nsaying we should sue OPEC for not producing more, they do not pass \nanything that would produce more of our own energy in our own country. \nDoes anyone think OPEC is going to think that is a credible position \nfor the Congress to take? Yet that is the position that is in the bill \nbefore us today.\n  It is almost laughable that every proposal we put forward that would \nincrease our output is defeated by Congress. Yet they want to sue OPEC \nfor not increasing their supply. You cannot have it both ways. We don't \nwant to drill here, but we want to drill there. It is the old ``you do \nit, we will talk about it'' mentality that will not work.\n  What about forming another commission to investigate price gouging? \nWe have had commissions on price\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\ngouging, and they have turned up nothing. This is a bad bill. We should \nreject it, and we should look for leadership, bipartisan leadership, to \nsolve this problem with our ingenuity.\n  I yield floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes \nfrom the Democratic side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, do we need a windfall profits tax? You \nbet we do. The American people are sick and tired of paying $4 for a \ngallon of gas. In the Northeast, we are worried about how people are \ngoing to stay warm in the winter, while at the same time ExxonMobil has \nmade more profits than any company in the history of the world for the \npast 2 consecutive years, making $42 billion last year alone.\n  But ExxonMobil is not alone. In the first quarter of this year, BP \nannounced a 63-percent increase in their profits. Shell's first-quarter \nprofits jumped by 25 percent, to over $9 billion, and ConocoPhillips' \nprofits increased by over 16 percent in the first quarter, to over $4 \nbillion. As a matter of fact, the five largest oil companies in this \ncountry have made over $600 billion in profits since George W. Bush has \nbeen President. Do we need a windfall profits tax? You bet we do.\n  Let me say a word about what some of these oil companies are doing \nwith these outrageous profits. In 2005, Lee Raymond, the former CEO of \nExxonMobil, received a total retirement package of at least $398 \nmillion. Yes, you heard that right, $398 million in a retirement \npackage for the former CEO of ExxonMobil. But he is not alone. Let us \nnot just pick on ExxonMobil. In 2006, Ray Irani, the CEO of Occidental \nPetroleum, received over $400 million in total compensation. Oh, yes, \nwe don't need to do a windfall profits tax. These guys are just \ninvesting their money ever so significantly.\n  The situation is so absurd and the greed is so outrageous that oil \ncompany executives are not only giving themselves huge compensation \npackages in their lifetimes, but they have created a situation, if you \ncan believe it, where they have carved out huge corporate payouts to \ntheir heirs if they die in office. I am not making this up. According \nto the Wall Street Journal, the family of Ray Irani, the CEO of \nOccidental Petroleum, will get over $115 million if he dies while he is \nthe CEO. The family of the CEO of Neighbors Industries, another oil \ncompany, will receive $288 million if he dies while he is the CEO.\n  If this were not so pathetic, if so many people all over our country \nwere not hurting, it would be funny. But it is not funny, it is tragic, \nand we have to deal with this reality. Let me be clear, however. I \nbelieve oil companies should be allowed to make a reasonable profit, \nbut they should not be allowed to rip off the American people at the \ngas pump, and that is why we need to pass a windfall profits tax, which \nis included in this legislation.\n  We should understand that a windfall profits tax alone is not going \nto solve all our problems. Since 1988, the oil and gas industry has \nspent over $616 million on lobbying, and since 1990, they have made \nover $213 million in campaign contributions. In other words, if this \nCongress is going to stand up to the oil companies, it is going to take \na lot of courage. These people have enormous power, and they have spent \nan enormous amount of money on lobbying and campaign contributions. But \nI think we owe it to the American people to represent their interests \nrather than just the interests of big money.\n  Imposing a windfall profits tax is not the only thing we should be \ndoing. We must address the growing reality that Wall Street investment \nbanks, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase, and \nmany hedge fund companies as well, are driving up the price of oil in \nthe unregulated energy futures market. There are estimates that 25 to \n50 percent of the $134-a-barrel cost of oil is attributable not to \nsupply and demand, not to the cost of production, not to the decline in \nthe dollar but to the unregulated speculation which is currently taking \nplace on oil futures. That is an issue we must address as well, and \nthis legislation begins to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains and who has time before the vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has secured 15 minutes \nfor his own use, which would consume all the minority's time at this \npoint, except for the leader's balance of that time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So that means I would use the remaining time, and there \nwould be no time for anyone else before the first vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority still has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That was my question. I didn't pose it right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Plus, the majority leader or his \ndesignee's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes and see how it \nworks out. The Senator from Pennsylvania wanted some of my time. I \ndon't know if I have enough to give him, but I will try, and I thank \nhim for coming down so early in the morning.\n  First of all, let me say to my fellow Senators but most of all to the \nAmerican people that the Senate has a bill before us today we will call \nthe Reid bill, named after the majority leader, and I think it deserves \na simple little nickname. It should be the Democratic Party's ``No \nEnergy Energy bill.'' It doesn't produce one ounce of energy. Clearly, \nthe American people are looking to us to see how we can suggest that \nthe price of oil might be stabilized or brought down.\n  We are told by most experts we are going to be using crude oil for 30 \nor 40 years to come, and we call that the bridge, the bridge between \nnow and the future, where we are going to have to use crude oil. If we \nare going to have to use crude oil, then America should look to itself \nand see where and how can we produce oil that belongs to us so this \nbridge, this 30 or 40 years when we are going to have to use crude oil \nto get by, that we will have as much of ours as possible.\n  It is a shame the majority party in the Senate is not looking to \nAmerican resources, does not have a bill, will not let us vote on a \nbill, will not let us amend a bill that would produce more energy from \nthe coastal waters off the shores of the United States, upon which we \nhave put a moratorium. That moratorium says we cannot drill. Everybody \nknows there are literally billions of barrels of oil that belong to us. \nWe could do whatever we would like. We could say 50 miles out is where \nwe start, so it will harm no one, but let's open it and explore for \nAmerican oil where there is an abundance.\n\n  In addition, let's go ahead and convert coal to crude oil, coal to \ndiesel. We know how to do that. Let's get on with it so we can send the \nright signal to the world.\n  Let's take the moratorium off oil shale and get on with a 5- or 10-\nyear program to produce oil from those properties that belong to \nAmericans that are laden with oil and are in the States of Colorado, \nUtah, and Wyoming.\n  That is what we are looking for, not a bill that attempts to levy a \nwindfall profits tax which everybody associated with that tax--\nincluding those who helped put it on during the regime of President \nCarter--now comes over and joins us, saying: Don't do that. It will do \nnothing but raise the price of crude oil.\n  Why do we want to pass a tax increasing the cost of crude oil when \nthe American people are asking us to do the opposite? The majority here \nin the Senate believes the major oil companies--there are not very many \nleft that are American oil companies. There are just a few of them \nleft, and all the rest of the oil is owned by countries--not companies, \nby countries. They own it. We have five or six American companies. We \nought to be grateful we have them. They are the only ones out there \ncapable of competing with these countries to get oil and produce more. \nYet the Democrats would like to make life onerous for those companies, \nwould like to make it harder for them to produce oil, and try to let \nthe American people think that if we tax them enough, somehow or \nanother that will produce more oil.\n  From my standpoint, this is a very simple debate. The Democrats have \nno\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nenergy bill before us, in terms of producing energy. So they have a \n``no energy'' bill. We ought to say we don't want to debate that \nbecause it doesn't amount to anything. Then the House sent us a bill \nthat imposes taxes. That is all it is. They impose taxes in order to \nput on a kind of energy stimulus for wind and the like. They want to \ntax in order to pay for it. We have never paid for it before. We have \nimposed those various incentives. They are good. We passed them 88 to 8 \none time. We are for doing that again, but we are not for doing that in \nthe manner suggested by the legislation from the House which came over \nhere. It is our second vote. We ought to just say no to that and say we \nare ready to extend those tax credits and we are ready to do that in \nexactly the way we have done it before, with no taxes added to the \nAmerican people or to anyone--just go ahead and do those tax extenders, \nwhich we desperately need.\n  Let me repeat. One of the most important things we need is an \nextension of those tax extenders. We do not need a tax bill that will \npay for those extenders because we have already done it without taxes. \nWe ought to do that again, nice and clean and quick. That would be a \nvery good start toward an alternative energy policy or a continuation \nof one.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania at this point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  I have sought recognition to state my reasons for opposing the motion \nto proceed to cloture because this bill has too many facets. It was my \nhope that the majority leader would have separated this bill into the \ncomponent parts. I cannot support legislation which would impede \nexploration for oil, which is what part of this bill is. But there are \nparts of this bill which are very important, and they ought to be taken \nup separately--for example, the legislation that defines and \nestablishes penalties for price gouging by the oil and gas industry. It \nincreases regulation of oil futures markets, and it includes the \nprovision to eliminate the antitrust exemption for OPEC countries.\n  It does not have to be said on the floor of the Senate that \nenormously serious problems exist today with the price of oil and with \nthe price of gasoline at the pump. The newspapers are full of it. It is \nan atrocious situation that is happening, and we desperately need \nrelief.\n  There are very substantial indicators that a good bit of this problem \nis caused by price gouging. The legislation ought to be separated out \nso that we act on that. There are significant indicators that the oil \nfutures market is causing speculators to jack up the price of oil. \nThere ought to be regulation on that. We ought to take it up \nseparately. When it comes to the antitrust exemption for the OPEC \ncountries, it is atrocious. A few of these countries get together in a \nroom, they lower production, and that increases prices. That bill was \npassed by the Senate with 70 votes. It has been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. We ought to be taking that up separately. If we took \nup these measures separately, we would have an opportunity to give some \nrelief to the American people.\n  Candidly, it is incomprehensible to me why we are not taking up the \ncost of oil and the cost of gas at the pump, to try to alleviate the \npressure on the American people--and for that matter, worldwide. If we \nwere to eliminate the OPEC antitrust exemption--to which they are not \nentitled; it is not a sovereign immunity issue, it is a commercial \ntransaction--we have the authority to do that. One Federal judge has \nalready upheld that approach. If we worked on the approach, if we \nworked on what the traders are doing on speculation, we would have some \nreal effect. We are not too busy to take up this issue, aside from a \nfew minutes on the Senate floor. There is no reason it has to be joined \nwith what is obviously a poison pill, where you talk about acting \nagainst the oil and gas industry to discourage exploration. We know \nexploration is vitally necessary, so I cannot support this legislation \nin its present form, but it ought to be divided. We ought to take up \nthe antitrust exemption separately.\n  We ought to move ahead on a matter of pressing importance. There is \nnothing more important for the American people, for the people of the \nworld. I urge the majority leader, who sets the schedule, to reconsider \nand separate these bill so we can act in a meaningful and important \nway.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, every day Americans are watching the \nprice of oil and gas shoot up higher and higher, and are watching as it \ngets harder and harder to make ends meet.\n  This week, the national average price of gasoline broke the $4 per \ngallon mark. When George Bush took office, gas cost just $1.46 a \ngallon. This dramatic increase in oil prices has brought prices for \nfood up along with it, and American families are faced with a painful \nfinancial choice when it comes time to fill-up--do they fill up their \ngas tank or do they forgo a gallon of gas to buy a gallon of milk?\n  Businesses are cutting jobs. Families have already eliminated \nnonessentials and are now cutting back on meals. Some Americans are \neven contemplating quitting their jobs because they can't afford the \ngas to get there. It has become painfully clear: We are in an oil \ncrisis. And we had better start taking action to get out of this mess.\n  Fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and mass transit are the long-\nterm answers that I will soon discuss, but consumers need immediate \nhelp, and the Consumer-First Energy Act will provide that relief.\n  The first thing the Democratic bill will do is make sure that our \ncommodities markets are functioning fairly. The supply and demand \nequation is roughly the same as it was 2 years ago and yet we have seen \nprices go through the roof.\n  We all remember the damage Enron did to our Nation's economy by \nmanipulating unregulated electricity markets. The Consumer-First Energy \nAct will make sure that oil is traded on well-regulated, transparent \nmarkets which are free from manipulation. It requires Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission oversight, sensible margin requirements, and \nstandard participant disclosures.\n  By making the oil futures market conform to usual standards and \npractices, we can combat excessive speculation and insure that the \nmarkets are free from manipulation.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act also makes sure that oil companies are \nnot taking advantage of American consumers. The Bush energy policy was \nwritten by energy companies for energy companies. And while it has \nworked well for energy companies, it has completely failed the American \npublic. The major oil companies made $124 billion in profits last year \nand will earn even higher profits this year.\n  Are the oil companies using these enormous profits to give consumers \na break at the pump? No. Are they using those profits to invest in new \nrefineries or develop alternative fuels? No. Despite what my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle might claim, big oil is not looking out for \nthe American driver. Big oil is looking out for itself. Our colleagues \non the other side offer more of the same.\n  Yet, despite the fact that big oil is doing all it can to reap record \nprofits at the expense of our economy, big oil is in line to receive \nover $17 billion in tax breaks.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act will fix this problem and make sure \nthat big oil is paying its fair share of taxes, and isn't profiteering \nat the expense of American consumers. It includes a windfall profits \ntax which would raise revenue to invest in sustainable, domestic \nsources of energy and to provide relief to consumers suffering under \nhigh energy prices.\n  We must act now to provide immediate relief to American families. But \nin addition to relief and protections included in the Consumer-First \nEnergy Act, we also need to think about what we can do to reduce \nconsumption and rein in costs in the long term.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to address this \noil crisis. Indeed, they want to exploit it to try to provide even more \nGovernment help for their big oil supporters. They tell their \nconstituents that the answer to our oil addiction is to drill,\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\ndrill, drill. But feeding the addiction by tapping another vein just \ndrills us into a deeper hole.\n  The fact is that the world's largest remaining oil reserves are in \nthe hands of foreign governments. That means it is difficult if not \nimpossible for us to control our supply of oil. But the one thing we \ncan control is our demand. In the long term, we need to invest in \nalternative energy, mass transit, and increasing fuel efficiency.\n  While we work to make alternative fuel technologies more affordable \nwe need to drastically improve fuel economy. If we had increased fuel \neconomy a modest 2 percent per year since 1981, our fleet would now \naverage 34 miles per gallon. This alone would have cut our demand for \noil by 30 percent while saving over 30 billion barrels of oil. 30 \nbillion barrels of oil. According to the Energy Information Agency that \nis more than the proven oil reserves remaining in the United States. It \nis commendable that we finally raised CAFE standards this year, but we \nare going to have to make our vehicles a lot more efficient to make up \nfor lost time.\n  We also need tax incentives for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, and need \nto support advanced battery research. Once our transportation \ninfrastructure can run on alternative fuels like electricity or \ncellulosic ethanol, consumers will finally have a choice. We will be \nable to choose not to buy oil, and that will force gas prices back to \nEarth.\n  The last, but perhaps most important, long-term solution to our \ncurrent oil crisis is an immediate and substantial investment in mass \ntransit. More people are taking commuter trains, buses, and even \nferries now than in the past 50 years.\n  For millions, having the option to use alternative transportation \nmodes has been essential to getting to work affordably. It is time we \nfinally fully funded mass transit at the level it deserves.\n  It is time for a real cure, not the tired old policies of the past. \nThis bill gives the American people what they need right now, to get \nthrough the immediate problem and start us down the path to real, \nsustainable, long-term solutions to our energy crisis.\n  I hope our colleagues seize the moment, vote for the motion, and move \nus to the type of relief Americans are looking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, am I correct in assuming that I have 2 \nminutes, plus the leader's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes and will reserve the \nremainder.\n  Mr. President, the American people are clamoring for relief at the \npump. In 1 year we have seen a 16-point increase in the percentage of \nAmericans who seek more exploration and production of oil and gas in \nthis country.\n  Today, according to a recent Gallup poll, 57 percent of Americans are \nseeking more exploration and production of oil and gas here at home. I \ndo not know what percentage of Americans would like to see higher \ntaxes, increased prices, and greater imports, but I suspect it would be \nvery low. But according to the independent Congressional Research \nService, that is what the people will get if the Reid tax increase is \nenacted into law. They will get exactly what they do not want, because \nthe bill will raise taxes, increase imports, and contribute to a \npattern of sending more than half a trillion dollars overseas to \nhostile regions.\n  I will oppose the motion to proceed this morning. I wish to start by \nlooking at the windfall profits tax contained in this bill. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service found a windfall profits tax \ncould have several adverse effects and could be expected to reduce \ndomestic oil production and increase the level of imports. This group \nis not alone in their estimate. The Wall Street Journal predicts a \nwindfall profit tax is a sure formula ``to keep the future price of gas \nhigher.''\n  It is not simply these two views that warn against a windfall profits \ntax. Former officials from both the Carter and Clinton administrations \nhave spoken. The Under Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton \nadministration recently said:\n\n       A new windfall profits tax, however emotionally satisfying \n     it may seem, also harms most people saving for their \n     retirement or living on retirement savings. More than 40 \n     percent of that cost would fall on tens of millions of \n     seniors and retirees who own oil stock directly or indirectly \n     through their pension plans and retirement accounts.\n\n  An individual named Phil Verleger, the individual responsible for \nimplementing the tax during the Carter years, recently called a \nwindfall profits tax ``a terrible idea today.''\n  There seems to be a consensus everywhere that the windfall profits \ntax is a bad idea, except in the halls of Congress and within the \nChavez administration in Venezuela. It is not only conjecture that \nleads us to the conclusion that this is a bad idea but, rather, an \nunderstanding of history. Between 1980 and 1986 when the last windfall \nprofits tax was in place, domestic oil production was reduced by as \nmuch as 8 percent and our imports rose from 32 percent to 38 percent. \nRevenues for the tax came in well below what was originally estimated, \nand the tax came to be called an administrative nightmare that stunted \neconomic growth. It was a bad idea then and it is a bad idea now, and \nit should be rejected. About that I am certain.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the time I yielded to myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to try to raise a concept and see if we can get \nthis where more people would begin to discuss this idea. In a hearing \nabout 8 days ago, a crude oil expert made the statement that we would \nbe using oil as a bridge to the future for more than 30 years. Let me \nrepeat. We will be using crude oil as a bridge to the future for more \nthan 30 years, this expert said, perhaps 40 years or more.\n  That is kind of common sense. Crude oil is used to make gasoline and \nthings such as gasoline, and those are used in the importation \nindustry. We cannot get rid of that quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is now using leadership time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 1 minute and then I will sit down. Let me \nrepeat so everybody will get this. For something like 40 years, we will \nbe using crude oil, our own or others, because we cannot get rid of the \ncurrent mode of transportation any quicker. Cars will be cars, and we \nwill be using them because we cannot wean them off the scene. As we \nmove to a better era of a better life where we do not have to use crude \noil in our daily lives so much, we will have to use the bridge which \nwill be crude oil.\n  Now, why do I talk about this? I do because it is important we \nunderstand that if we have any cards, playing poker, if we have any \naces in our hands, we better go ahead and play them, and the aces are \ncrude oil we might produce some way that is ours. We ought to go ahead \nand play the card. I submit that we do have a lot of aces. We have got \na huge amount of crude oil that is in the Outer Continental Shelf that \nwe ought to be exploring for forthwith. We ought to take the moratoria \noff and start at 50 miles out across this land. If we did that and sent \nthat message for starters, it would be received in a terrific way. Take \nthe moratoria that were put in the bill that has been referred to as \nthe Domenici bill for production, and believe it or not, we would send \na signal that America is coming back to life, and during that bridge \ntime we are going to produce more oil on our own.\n  Nothing will help us more in reducing the price and cost to our \nconsumers than that idea we implemented. We must try to do it even if \nthe Democrats do not want us to. We have got to try to force a vote so \nthat people understand what we are trying to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking to preserve the \nleader's time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I assume the Chair is telling me that I \ncannot reserve any of the leader's time, so\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nI can sit down and take it at a later time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That requires consent. Consent was not \ngranted. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. I will use it now.\n  Now, Senators today should have been--under anyone's understanding of \nthe dilemma we are in with the price of oil scaring the American people \nto death, the amount of money we are sending out of our country to meet \nour energy needs, it is going to reach $600 billion a year. With the \nescalating price of crude oil, that is what it looks like next year. It \nwill be what a full year will cost us, $600 billion. I would think with \nthat in mind, there would be on the floor of the Senate some real \nproposals by the Democratic leadership and the majority party.\n  Instead, what do we get? We get what I call a ``no-energy energy \nbill.'' It is a no-energy energy bill because it does not produce an \nounce of energy; it raises the cost instead of lowering the cost of \ncrude oil; it produces less rather than more crude oil. That is why \nthere is nothing going on on the floor, because there is nothing \nexciting. The Democrats have offered nothing.\n  We are begging them to try something. We are begging them to try \nsomething that would produce more American oil or oil substitutes. We \nknow what they are. The distinguished Senator from Colorado knows what \nthey are. We know that offshore, deepwater exploration around the \nshores of America could be put in effect by raising the moratorium, and \nwe would have literally billions of reserves of oil and trillions of \ncubic feet of natural gas readily made available.\n  We need to take off the moratorium that we put on ourselves, take it \noff and say to the people: Let's produce it. It would take a few years. \nBut the signal would be positive. We would have the oil shale in your \nState and Utah, your sister State, if we said we are ready to set the \nfinal guidelines so the oil companies can invest. Someone down here \nprior to my speech said the oil companies will not do anything to help. \nYes, indeed they will. One of them is investing $8.5 billion in oil \nshale and tar sands up in our neighboring country of Canada. Some \npeople think that is terrible, because they did not want them to \nproduce that kind of oil. But I do not think it is terrible, because it \neliminates the potential for gouging, for prices being too high. \nBecause if you have these great inventories of resources and they are \nyours and you can use them, you ameliorate the increasing price of oil, \nand we ought to be doing that.\n  Instead of that, we are down here talking about a second bill. The \nsecond bill is a bill passed by the House, sent over here to us that is \nfull of tax increases to pay for a series of tax incentives that we \nshould pass without the tax increases. We have done it before, we ought \nto do it.\n  That bill ought to be defeated, no question about it, because we \nought to pass it. We need the incentives, but we do not need the tax \nincreases. We have done it without tax increases twice before, and \nsomehow or other the House keeps getting it put in their head if they \nsend it over here with other tax increases, different ones, we will go \nfor it. I think it is pretty clear we will not.\n  So it is an interesting day. Instead of being here with some positive \nthings we are going to do, we will be here defending some old ideas \nthat are not going to help one bit, and we are saying, let's try them \nanyway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, day after day record-high oil and gasoline \nprices are causing immense harm to millions of American consumers and \nbusinesses. Unless something is done to make energy more affordable, \nthese record-high prices will continue to damage our economy, \nincreasing the prices of transportation, food, manufacturing, and \neverything in between. Skyrocketing energy prices are a threat to our \neconomic and national security, and the time is long past for action.\n  My Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has conducted four \nseparate investigations into how our energy markets can be made to work \nbetter. Most recently, last December, we had a joint hearing with the \nSenate Energy Subcommittee on the role of speculation in rising energy \nprices. As a result of these investigations and hearings, I have been \nadvocating a variety of measures to address the rampant speculation and \nlack of regulation of energy markets which have contributed to sky high \nenergy prices:\n  First, put a cop--a regulatory agency--back on the beat in the energy \nmarkets to prevent excessive speculation and manipulation. That \nincludes closing the Enron loophole and the London loophole and taking \nother steps to strengthen market oversight.\n  Second, develop alternatives to fossil fuels to reduce our dependence \non oil.\n  Third, impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies that have \nprofited from the massive price runup and use the money to help \nconsumers, boost domestic energy supplies, improve energy technologies, \nand strengthen our energy markets.\n  One of the major causes of our energy crisis is the failed policies \nof the current administration. The chickens have come home to roost on \n7 years of a business-as-usual energy policy, paired with fiscal and \nforeign policies that have pushed our growing energy problem close to a \nbreaking point. Because the administration has proved itself unable and \nunwilling to take the necessary steps to provide affordable energy \nsupplies to the American people, it is up to the Congress to try to \njump-start a comprehensive solution to skyrocketing energy prices. \nCongress already has taken two important steps this year--we have \nclosed the Enron loophole and we have stopped the administration's \nmisguided program to keep on filling the SPR despite record-high \nprices--but more can and should be done. That is why I support \nenactment of the Consumer-First Energy Act now before us and will be \nvoting for cloture on this bill.\n  Last week the price of crude oil reached a record high price of about \n$139 per barrel. Sky-high crude oil prices have led to record highs in \nthe price of other fuels produced from crude oil, including gasoline, \nheating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. The national average price of \ngasoline is at a record high of just over $4 per gallon. The price of \ndiesel fuel, which is normally less expensive than gasoline, has soared \nto a record high of nearly $4.60 per gallon.\n  Rising energy prices increase the cost of getting to work and taking \nour children to school, traveling by car, truck, air and rail, and \ngrowing the food we eat and transporting it to market. Rising energy \nprices increase the cost of producing the medicines we need for our \nhealth, heating our homes and offices, generating electricity, and \nmanufacturing countless industrial and consumer products. The \nrelentless increase in jet fuel prices, which have added nearly $75 \nbillion to our airlines' annual fuel costs, has contributed to airline \nbankruptcies, mergers, fare increases, and service cuts. ``If fuel \ncontinues to go up, this industry cannot survive in current form,'' the \npresident of the Air Transport Association said recently. Rising diesel \nprices have placed a crushing burden upon our Nation's truckers, \nfarmers, manufacturers, and other industries. To make matters worse, \nour energy costs are rising much more quickly than energy costs in \nother countries, directly threatening our global competitiveness.\n  In January 2001, when President Bush took office, the price of oil \nwas about $30 per barrel. The average price for a gallon of gasoline \nwas about $1.50. Since President Bush took office, crude oil prices \nhave more than quadrupled, natural gas prices to heat our homes have \nalmost doubled, gasoline prices have nearly tripled, and diesel fuel \nprices have more than tripled.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Just 7 years ago, at the end of the \nClinton Administration, energy supplies were plentiful, and gasoline \nand other forms of energy were affordable. Once the Bush administration \ntook office, however, it didn't take them long to eliminate the budget \nsurplus by cutting taxes mainly for the wealthiest among us, creating a \nhuge annual budget deficit, and driving up the national debt. This \nfiscal mismanagement has contributed significantly to a steep decline \nin the value of the dollar and soaring commodity prices. Because \nAmerican currency is worth less, it takes more of them to buy the same \nbarrel of oil. American consumers and businesses are forced to spend \nmore and more of their hard-earned dollars to buy the same amount of \nenergy.\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\n  During the last years of the Clinton administration, the United \nStates ran a budget surplus, totaling nearly $560 billion. But over the \npast 6 years of the Bush administration the annual deficits have \ntotaled nearly $1.7 trillion, not counting the amount by which the Bush \nadministration has been draining the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds. When this is counted, under this administration the total \noutstanding debt has increased by a whopping $3.2 trillion.\n  When President Clinton left office, the dollar was worth more than \nthe Euro. In January 2001, it took only about 90 cents to buy one Euro. \nToday, it takes about $1.60 to buy one Euro--a record low for the \ndollar. The fall in the value of the dollar is a result of a weakened \nU.S. economy, a high trade deficit and a worldwide lack of confidence \nin the Bush administration's ability to manage our Nation's economy and \nforeign policy.\n  As long as this administration continues to insist on irresponsible \nfiscal practices--including tax cuts for people with the highest income \nand an open-ended conflict in Iraq that is costing $12 billion a \nmonth--the dollar will likely continue to decline in value. The \nmarketplace has rendered a clear ``no confidence'' in this \nadministration's fiscal competence.\n  Besides the weak dollar, there are other factors at work that account \nfor soaring energy prices. Some are beyond our control; others we can \ndo something about. In global markets, for example, the combination of \nincreasing demand from developing countries, coupled with a variety of \npolitical problems in supplier countries, has contributed to price \nincreases. Growing demand for oil and gas in China, India, and other \ndeveloping countries is contributing to an overall increase in global \ndemand for crude oil. On the supply side, many oil producing countries \nare politically unstable and have not been fully reliable suppliers. \nFor example, in Nigeria, which is a major oil-producing country, for \nseveral years tribal gangs have been sabotaging production and \npipelines.\n  While we can't do much about growing demand in China and India, other \ncauses of high prices can be addressed. For example, one key factor in \nenergy price spikes is rampant speculation in the energy markets. \nTraders are trading contracts for future delivery of oil in record \namounts, creating a paper demand that is driving up prices and \nincreasing price volatility solely to take a profit. Overall, the \namount of trading of futures and options in oil on the New York \nMercantile Exchange has risen sixfold in recent years, from 500,000 \noutstanding contracts in 2001, to about 3 million contracts now.\n  Much of this increase in trading of futures has been due to \nspeculation. Speculators in the oil market do not intend to use crude \noil; instead they buy and sell contracts for crude oil just to make a \nprofit from the changing prices. The number of futures and options \ncontracts held by speculators has gone from around 100,000 contracts in \n2001, which was 20 percent of the total number of outstanding \ncontracts, to 1.2 million contracts currently held by speculators, \nwhich represents almost 40 percent of the outstanding futures and \noptions contracts in oil on NYMEX .\n  There are now 12 times as many speculative holdings as there was in \n2001, while holdings of nonspeculative futures and options are up but 3 \ntimes.\n  Not surprisingly, this massive speculation that the price of oil will \nincrease has, in fact, helped fuel the actual increase in the price of \noil to a level far above the price that is justified by the traditional \nforces of supply and demand.\n  The president and CEO of Marathon Oil recently said, ``$100 oil isn't \njustified by the physical demand in the market. It has to be \nspeculation on the futures market that is fueling this.'' Mr. Fadel \nGheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer and Company, describes the oil \nmarket as ``a farce.'' ``The speculators have seized control and it's \nbasically a free-for-all, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut \ndown unless and until responsible governments step in.'' In January of \nthis year, as oil hit $100 barrel, Mr. Tim Evans, oil analyst for \nCitigroup, wrote ``the larger supply and demand fundamentals do not \nsupport a further rise and are, in fact, more consistent with lower \nprice levels.'' At the joint hearing on the effects of speculation held \nby my subcommittee last December, Dr. Edward Krapels, a financial \nmarket analyst, testified, ``Of course financial trading, speculation \naffects the price of oil because it affects the price of everything we \ntrade. . . . It would be amazing if oil somehow escaped this effect.'' \nDr. Krapels added that as a result of this speculation, ``There is a \nbubble in oil prices.''\n\n  A fair price for a commodity is a price that accurately reflects the \nforces of supply and demand for the commodity, not the trading \nstrategies of speculators who only are in the market to make a profit \nby the buying and selling of paper contracts with no intent to actually \npurchase, deliver, or transfer the commodity. As we have all too often \nseen in recent years, when speculation grows so large that it has a \nmajor impact on the market, prices get distorted and stop reflecting \ntrue supply and demand.\n  Last month, Senator Jack Reed and I wrote a letter asking President \nBush to appoint a high-level task force to evaluate how speculators are \ndriving up prices through manipulative or deceptive devices. The task \nforce should also evaluate whether there are adequate regulatory tools \nto control market speculation and prevent manipulation. Hopefully the \nPresident will act quickly to convene this task force.\n  Excessive market speculation is a factor that we can and should do a \nbetter job of controlling. There are other long overdue actions as well \nthat, if taken as part of a comprehensive plan, can combat rising \nenergy prices.\n  As to reining in speculation, the first step to take is to put a cop \nback on the beat in all our energy markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation, price manipulation, and trading abuses. In 2001, my Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations began investigating our energy \nmarkets. At the time, the price of a gallon of gasoline had spiked \nupwards by about 25 cents over the course of the Memorial Day holiday. \nWe subpoenaed records from major oil companies and interviewed oil \nindustry experts, gas station dealers, antitrust experts, gasoline \nwholesalers and distributors, and oil company executives. We examined \nthousands of prices at gas stations in Michigan, Ohio, California, and \nother States. In the spring of 2002, I released a 400-page report and \nheld 2 days of hearings on the results of the investigation.\n  The investigation found that increasing concentration in the gasoline \nrefining industry, due to a large number of recent mergers and \nacquisitions, was one of the causes of the increasing number of \ngasoline price spikes. Another factor causing price spikes was the \nincreasing tendency of refiners to keep lower inventories of gasoline. \nWe also found a number of instances in which the increasing \nconcentration in the refining industry was also leading to higher \nprices in general. Limitations on the pipeline that brings gasoline \ninto my home State of Michigan were another cause of price increases \nand spikes in Michigan. The report recommended that the Federal Trade \nCommission carefully investigate proposed mergers, particularly with \nrespect to the effect of mergers on inventories of gasoline.\n  The investigation discovered one instance in which a major oil \ncompany was considering ways to prevent other refiners from supplying \ngasoline to the Midwest so that supply would be constricted and prices \nwould increase.\n  In March 2003, my subcommittee released a second report detailing how \nthe operation of crude oil markets affects the price of not only \ngasoline but also key commodities like home heating oil, jet fuel, and \ndiesel fuel. The report warned that U.S. energy markets were vulnerable \nto price manipulation due to a lack of comprehensive regulation and \nmarket oversight.\n  Following this report, I worked with Senator Feinstein on legislation \nto put the cop back on the beat in those energy markets that had been \nexempted from regulation pursuant to an ``Enron loophole'' that was \nsnuck into other legislation in December 2000. For 2 years we attempted \nto close the Enron loophole, but efforts to put the cop back on the \nbeat in these markets were unsuccessful, due to opposition from the \nBush administration, large energy companies, and large financial \ninstitutions that trade energy commodities.\n  In June 2006, I released another Subcommittee report, ``The Role of \nMarket\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nSpeculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop on the \nBeat.'' This report found that the traditional forces of supply and \ndemand no longer accounted for sustained price increases and price \nvolatility in the oil and gasoline markets. The report determined that, \nin 2006, that a growing number of energy trades occurred without \nregulatory oversight and that market speculation had contributed to \nrising oil and gasoline prices, perhaps accounting for $20 out of a \nthen-priced $70 barrel of oil.\n  The subcommittee report I released in June 2006 again recommended new \nlaws to increase market oversight and stop market manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. I again coauthored legislation with Senator \nFeinstein to improve oversight of the unregulated energy markets. Once \nagain, opposition from the Bush administration, large energy traders, \nand the financial industry prevented the full Senate from considering \nthis legislation.\n  In 2007, my Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations addressed the \nsharp rise in natural gas prices over the previous year and released a \nfourth report, entitled ``Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas \nMarket.'' Our investigation showed that speculation by a single hedge \nfund named Amaranth had distorted natural gas prices during the summer \nof 2006 and drove up prices for average consumers. The report also \ndemonstrated how Amaranth had traded in unregulated markets to avoid \nthe restrictions and oversight in the regulated markets and how the \nprice increases caused by Amaranth could have been prevented if there \nhad been the same type of oversight in the unregulated markets as in \nthe regulated markets.\n  Following this investigation, I introduced a new bill, S. 2058, to \nclose the Enron loophole and regulate the unregulated electronic energy \nmarkets. Working again with Senators Feinstein and Snowe and with the \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan effort, we finally \nmanaged to include an amendment to close the Enron loophole in the farm \nbill that was then being considered by the Senate. The Senate \nunanimously passed this amendment to close the Enron loophole last \nDecember. The final farm bill that was passed by the House and Senate \nlast month included language nearly identical to what the Senate had \npassed. Although President Bush vetoed the entire farm bill, both the \nHouse and Senate have overridden his veto. Our 5-year quest to close \nthe Enron Loophole has finally been successful.\n  The CFTC is now in the process of implementing the close-the-Enron-\nloophole law. Among other steps, it is charged with reviewing the \ncontracts on previously unregulated energy markets, like the \nIntercontinental Exchange or ICE, to determine which contracts have a \nsignificant effect on energy prices and must undergo daily oversight. \nOnce that process is complete, the cop will be back on the beat in \nthose markets for the first time since 2000.\n  Closing the Enron loophole is vitally important for energy market \noversight as a whole, and for our natural gas markets in particular, \nbut it is not enough. Because over the last 2 years, energy traders \nhave moved a significant amount of U.S. crude oil and gasoline trading \nto the United Kingdom, beyond the direct reach of U.S. regulators, we \nhave to address that second loophole too. I call it closing the London \nloophole.\n  There are currently two key energy commodity markets for U.S. crude \noil and gasoline trading. The first is the New York Mercantile Exchange \nor NYMEX, located in New York City. The second is the ICE Futures \nEurope exchange, located in London and regulated by the British agency \ncalled the Financial Services Authority.\n  The British regulators, however, do not oversee their energy markets \nthe same way we do; they don't place limits on speculation like we do, \nand they don't make public the same type of trading data that we do. \nThat means that traders can avoid the limits on speculation in crude \noil imposed on the New York exchange by trading on the London exchange. \nIt also makes the London exchange less transparent than the New York \nexchange. My original legislation to close the Enron loophole would \nhave required U.S. traders on the London exchange to provide U.S. \nregulators with the same type of trading information that they are \nalready required to provide when they trade on the New York Mercantile \nExchange. Unfortunately, this provision was dropped from the close-the-\nEnron-loophole legislation in the farm bill.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act, S. 3044, which the majority leader and \nothers introduced recently to address high prices and reduce \nspeculation, includes at my request a provision to curb rampant \nspeculation, increase our access to foreign exchange trading data, and \nstrengthen oversight of the trading of U.S. energy commodities no \nmatter where that trading occurs. This provision would require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, prior to allowing a foreign \nexchange to establish direct trading terminals located in this country, \nto obtain an agreement from the that foreign exchange, such as the \nLondon exchange, to impose speculative limits and reporting \nrequirements on traders of U.S. energy commodities that are comparable \nto the requirements imposed by the CFTC on U.S. exchanges. I believe \nthis issue is so important that I have introduced this section of the \npackage as a separate bill, which is numbered S. 2995. Senator \nFeinstein is a cosponsor of that bill.\n\n  Following the introduction of our legislation, the CFTC finally moved \nto address some of the gaps in its ability to oversee foreign exchanges \noperating in the United States. Specifically, the CFTC, working with \nthe United Kingdom Financial Services Authority and the ICE Futures \nEurope exchange, announced that it will now obtain the following \ninformation about the trading of U.S. crude oil contracts on the London \nexchange:\n\n       Daily large trader reports on positions in West Texas \n     Intermediate or WTI contracts traded on the London exchange; \n     information on those large trader positions for all futures \n     contracts, not just a limited set of contracts due to expire \n     in the near future; enhanced trader information to permit \n     more detailed identification of end users; improved data \n     formatting to facilitate integration of the data with other \n     CFTC data systems; and notification to the CFTC of when a \n     trader on ICE Futures Europe exceeds the position \n     accountability levels established by NYMEX for the trading of \n     WTI crude oil contracts.\n\n  These new steps will strengthen the CFTC's ability to detect and \nprevent manipulation and excessive speculation in the oil and gasoline \nmarkets. It will ensure that the CFTC has the same type of information \nit receives from U.S. exchanges in order to detect and prevent \nmanipulation and excessive speculation.\n  However, in order to fully close the London loophole, better \ninformation is not enough. The CFTC must also have clear authority to \nact upon this information to stop manipulation and excessive \nspeculation.\n  That is why I have been working with the sponsors of the Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act to include additional language to ensure that the CFTC \nhas the authority to act upon the information it will obtain from the \nLondon exchange, in order to prevent price manipulation and excessive \nspeculation. This new provision, which I helped author, would make it \nclear that the CFTC has the authority to prosecute and punish \nmanipulation of the price of a commodity, regardless of whether the \ntrader within the United States is trading on a U.S. or on a foreign \nexchange. It would also make it clear that the CFTC has the authority \nto require traders in the United States to reduce their positions, no \nmatter where the trading occurs--on a U.S. or foreign exchange--to \nprevent price manipulation or excessive speculation. Finally, it would \nclarify that the CFTC has the authority to require all U.S. traders to \nkeep records of their trades, regardless of which exchange the trader \nis using.\n  It is my understanding that this new provision will be included in a \nsubstitute amendment that will be offered today or in a future debate \non this bill, if cloture is not invoked today. I thank the bill \nsponsors for accepting this language to ensure that the CFTC has full \nenforcement authority over traders within the United States who are \ntrading on a foreign exchange, just as the CFTC has over traders who \nare trading on a U.S. exchange. This clarification of the CFTC's \nenforcement authority over traders in the United States, together with \nthe earlier provision setting standards for foreign boards of\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\ntrade wishing to place trading terminals in the United States, will \nfully close the London loophole.\n  There is another problem with our energy markets that Congress has \nfinally acted on. In 2003, a report issued by my Subcommittee staff \nfound that the Bush administration's large deposits of oil into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, were increasing crude oil prices \nwithout improving overall U.S. energy security. We found that in 2002, \nthe Bush administration, over the repeated objections of its own \nexperts in the Department of Energy, had changed its policy and decided \nto put oil into the SPR regardless of the price of oil or market \nconditions. By placing oil into the SPR while oil prices were high and \noil supplies were tight, the administration's deposits into the SPR \nwere reducing market supplies and boosting prices, with almost no \nbenefit to national security, given the fact that the SPR is more than \n95 percent filled. The DOE experts believed that in a tight market, we \nare better off with keeping the oil on the market rather than putting \nit into the ground where it cannot be used.\n  Following the issuance of this report, in early 2003, I asked the \nDepartment of Energy to suspend its filling of the SPR until prices had \nabated and supplies were more plentiful. DOE refused to change course \nand continued the SPR fill without regard to market supplies or prices.\n  After DOE denied my request, I offered a bipartisan amendment with \nSenator Collins to the Interior appropriations bill, which provides \nfunding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program, to require DOE to \nminimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing oil \ninto the SPR. The Senate unanimously adopted our amendment, but it was \ndropped from the conference report due to the Bush Administration's \ncontinued opposition.\n  The next spring, I offered another amendment, also with Senator \nCollins, to the budget resolution, expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat the administration should postpone deliveries into the SPR and use \nthe savings from the postponement to increase funding for national \nsecurity programs. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 52 to \n43. That fall, we attempted to attach a similar amendment to the \nhomeland security appropriations bill that would have postponed the SPR \nfill and used the savings for homeland security programs, but the \namendment was defeated by a procedural vote, even though the majority \nof Senators voted in favor of the amendment, 48 to 47.\n  The next year, the Senate passed the Levin-Collins amendment to the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 to require the DOE to consider price impacts \nand minimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing \noil into the SPR. The Levin-Collins amendment was agreed to by the \nconferees and is now law.\n  Unfortunately, passage of this provision has had no effect upon DOE's \nactions. DOE continued to fill the SPR regardless of the market effects \nof buying oil, thereby taking oil off the market and reducing supply by \nplacing it into the SPR. In the past year, no matter what the price of \noil or market conditions, DOE consistently found that the market \neffects are negligible and no reason to delay filling the SPR.\n  Most recently, at the same time the President was urging OPEC to put \nmore oil on the market to reduce supplies, the administration was \ncontinuing to take oil off the market and place it into the SPR. Until \nrecently, the DOE was depositing about 70,000 barrels of crude oil per \nday into the SPR, much of it high-quality crude oil ideal for refining \ninto gasoline. It defies common sense for the U.S. Government to be \nacquiring oil at $120 or $130 per barrel, in a time of tight supply, \ntaking that oil off the market, and putting it in the SPR. That is why \nI cosponsored Senator Dorgan's bill to suspend the SPR fill, as well as \na similar provision in the Consumer-First Energy Act.\n  Finally, Congress had had enough of this senseless policy. The \nprovision to stop the continuous filing of the SPR was pulled from the \nConsumer-First Energy Act and offered in the House and Senate as a \nstand alone bill. Congress enacted into law by an overwhelming vote. In \nresponse, the President finally called a halt to his policy and stopped \nfilling the SPR. It is about time.\n  The SPR fill policy, by the way, exacerbated yet another problem in \nour oil markets--the fact that the standard NYMEX futures contract that \nsets the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil requires a particular type \nof high quality crude oil known as West Texas Intermediate, WTI, to be \ndelivered at a particular location, Cushing, OK. The standard NYMEX \ncontract price, in turn, has a major influence on the price of fuels \nrefined from crude oil such as gasoline, heating oil, and diesel.\n  Because the price of the standard contract depends upon the supply of \nWTI at Cushing, OK, the supply and demand conditions in Oklahoma have a \ndisproportionate influence on the price of NYMEX futures contracts. \nThat means when the WTI price is no longer representative of the price \nof U.S. crude oil in general, the prices of other energy commodities \nare also thrown out of whack. In other words, we have an oil futures \nmarket that reflects the supply and demand conditions in Cushing, OK, \nbut not necessarily the overall supply and demand situation in the \nUnited States as a whole.\n  I have long called for reform of this outdated feature of the \nstandard NYMEX crude oil contract. In 2003, the PSI report recommended \nthe CFTC and NYMEX to work together to revise the standard NYMEX crude \noil futures contract to reduce its susceptibility to local imbalances \nin the market for WTI crude oil. The subcommittee report suggested that \nallowing for delivery at other locations could reduce the volatility of \nthe contract. It is truly disappointing that since our report was \nissued no progress has been made for allowing for delivery at other \nplaces than Cushing, OK. As the price of oil has increased, the \ndistortions and imbalances caused by the atypical nature of the \nstandard contract have gotten worse. It is essential NYMEX repair its \ncrude oil contract.\n\n  Putting the cop on the beat in our energy markets, strengthening \noversight of U.S. energy commodities traded on foreign exchanges, \nstopping the SPR fill, and fixing the NYMEX crude oil contract all \nfocus on problems caused by rising energy prices. These consistently \nrising gas prices also underscore the need to develop advanced vehicle \ntechnologies and alternative energy sources that will significantly \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I have long advocated advanced automotive technologies such as hybrid \nelectric, advanced batteries, hydrogen and fuel cells and promoted \ndevelopment of these technologies through Federal research and \ndevelopment and through joint government-industry partnerships. We need \na significant infusion of Federal dollars into these efforts to make \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technologies. Such an \ninvestment will make technologies such as plug-in hybrid vehicles \naffordable to the American public and reduce our dependence on oil and \nreduce prices at the pump.\n  We need an equally strong investment in development of alternative \nfuels that can replace gasoline. I have strongly supported efforts to \nincrease our production of renewable fuels and to do that in a way that \nwill also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We need a strong push \ntoward biofuels produced from cellulosic materials, which requires a \nsignificantly greater Federal investment in biofuels technologies. \nCellulosic ethanol has enormous potential for significant reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, but additional Federal support is required to \nmake this technology financially viable. We need expanded Federal \nresearch and development grants as well as increased tax incentives and \nFederal loan guarantees to make cellulosic ethanol a viable replacement \nfor gasoline. The Federal Government must do its part first to develop \nthese technologies so that they will then in turn be within reach of \nthe American public.\n  One more point. The burden of higher energy prices is not being \nshared equally. To the contrary, it is falling hardest upon those who \ncan least afford it. Large oil companies are reaping record profits at \nthe expense of the average American who ultimately bears the full \nburden of these price increases. At the same time that average \nAmericans are having to devote a greater and greater portion of their \nincome to pay for basic necessities, such as gasoline, household \nutilities, and food, the major oil companies are reporting record \nprofits and\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\ntheir executives are taking home annual paychecks of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. Many of these profits have been generated without \nany additional investments into energy production. Rather, these \ncompanies have seen their profits rise with the flood of speculation. \nWhat is a high tide of profits for the oil companies, though, is a \ntsunami that is overwhelming millions of Americans.\n  And what are these oil companies doing with these record profits? Are \nthey investing in new technologies? The answer is that the oil \ncompanies are not increasing their exploration and development \ninvestments by nearly as much as their profits are increasing. Instead, \nthey are devoting large amounts of their profits to acquiring other \ncompanies and buying back their own shares. On May 1 of this year, the \nWall Street Journal reported that in the first quarter of 2008 \nExxonMobil spent $8 billion to buy back company shares, which ``boosted \nper-share earnings to stratospheric levels,'' whereas it spent less on \nexploration and actually reduced oil production.\n  For these reasons, we need to institute a windfall profits tax on the \noil companies. We should incentivize big oil companies to invest their \nwindfall profits into things that will increase our own domestic energy \nproduction by reducing the amount of the tax for such investments. If \nthey don't make these investments, a portion of that profit should be \nrecouped by the public to help offset the outrageous prices they are \nfacing at the pump.\n  I have supported a windfall profits tax numerous times when we have \nvoted on it in the Senate. The Consumer-First Energy Act, imposes a 25 \npercent tax on windfall profits of the major oil companies. Windfall \nprofits invested to boost domestic energy supplies would be exempt from \nthe tax, which would encourage investments in renewable facilities and \nthe production of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. It \nwould also encourage oil companies to increase their domestic refinery \ncapacity. Proceeds from the tax would be put toward measures to reduce \nthe burdens of rising energy costs and increase our energy independence \nand security.\n  Sky-high energy prices are causing immense financial pain to working \nfamilies and businesses throughout this country and tying our already \nweak economy in knots. Congress cannot just stand by; we must act now \nto stop the pain. Immediate steps include putting the cop on the beat \nin all of our energy markets to prevent price manipulation and \nexcessive speculation, strengthening oversight of U.S. energy \ncommodities traded in London, fixing the key NYMEX crude oil contract, \ninvesting in advanced vehicle technologies and alternative energy \nsources, and imposing a windfall profits tax on the oil companies. \nLonger range steps include fixing the fiscal policies undermining the \nstrength of the U.S. dollar, including by eliminating tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us, reducing the $12 billion a month spending bill in \nIraq, and closing outrageous tax loopholes than enable tax dodgers to \nuse offshore tax havens to avoid payment of taxes in the range of $100 \nbillion each year.\n  We can fight back against exorbitantly high energy prices. But it \nwill take all our energy--and determination--to do it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that a minority \nof Senators blocked the Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008, which puts \nAmerican consumers ahead of big oil companies and other corporate \ninterests.\n  This bill would prevent price gouging and market manipulation from \ndriving up the price of gas. The anti-price gouging language, based on \nSenator Cantwell's bill that I cosponsored, would protect consumers \nfrom price gouging by sellers and distributors of oil, gasoline, or \npetroleum distillates during natural disasters and abnormal market \ndisruptions. As a cosponsor of the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act, I \nalso strongly support closing loopholes that allow traders using \noverseas markets to secretively bid up the price of oil and saddle \nAmericans with the price at the gas pump.\n  Today's vote on the Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008 was an \nopportunity to stand up to the OPEC cartel and force big oil to pay \ntheir fair share. I have long supported the efforts of the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin to make oil-producing and exporting cartels \nillegal and make colluding oil-producing nations liable in U.S. court \nfor violations of antitrust law. Our oil companies can also be part of \nthe solution. This bill would have encouraged them to invest in clean, \naffordable, and domestically produced renewable alternative fuels, \nexpanded refinery capacity and utilization, and renewable electricity \nproduction.\n  Last year's Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy \nEfficiency Act of 2007 put our Nation's energy policy on a new path: \none that encourages renewable energy, conservation of the resources we \nhave, and American innovation. But we have more work to do, and today's \nvote is a step back in those efforts.\n  I will continue to support both short- and long-term solutions to our \nNation's energy needs that protect American consumers while working to \ninvest in renewable and alternative energies and break our addiction to \noil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I will speak for 5 minutes. I would appreciate it if \nyou would let me know when I have 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, you know this is not complicated. You would have to \nnot be walking around in the United States of America to not feel \nincredible pressure at this moment. I feel so lucky to be in the \nSenate, and I feel such a responsibility to communicate the pressure we \nare all feeling from people who are hurting.\n\n  Let me run through a few facts.\n  Since 2002, profits for the five largest oil companies have \nquadrupled. Let me say that again. Since 2002, profits have quadrupled. \nLast year, ExxonMobil made $83,000 a minute in profit--$83,000 a \nminute.\n  Now, are they using all this profit to invest in alternative fuels? \nHow about increasing refinery capacity? Oh, no, no. They have their \nhand out to us. This is the nerve. Insanity is doing the same thing \nover and over and thinking you are going to get a different result.\n  We are paying oil companies right now. This is the largest package of \ncorporate welfare this country has ever delivered. What nerve does it \ntake for us to give oil companies $17 billion in taxpayer money with \nthose kinds of profits?\n  This is like the ``twilight zone.'' This cannot be real. We cannot \nhonestly be standing here and saying to the American people: It is a \ngreat idea for us to keep giving them your money when they are making \n$83,000 a minute.\n  I was reading the paper this morning, and nothing is more expensive \nthan ads in the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent to show an ad \nin the New York Times this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. OK. This is it: a two-page spread. Do you know what \nthis costs you? A half a million dollars. A half a million dollars \nExxon spent this morning. And guess what. They spent it yesterday \nmorning, and they are going to spend it tomorrow morning. It is a \nseries--all about what a great job they are doing for the American \npeople.\n  They are spending $2.5 million in the New York Times this week, while \nMissourians in rural Missouri are scared they cannot go to work \nanymore. They have no bus they can take. They have no metro they can \ntake. They are trying to figure out how they can drive to and from \nwork, how they can put food on the table, and these guys are spending \n$2.5 million on PR. It is unbelievable.\n  We have given big oil, in 2004 and 2005, tax breaks worth over $17 \nbillion over the next decade. What does the other side say? We need to \ngive them more. We have to pay them to increase refinery capacity. \nExcuse me? We have to pay them--the taxpayers of this country? I do not \nknow how out of touch we could be. We are not asking for a lot. Just \ntake away the taxpayer money. We do not begrudge people profit.\n  Now, here is what is unbelievable. I do not know how this bill would \nturn out if we debated it----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That Senator has used 4 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I do not know how this bill would turn out if we debated it honestly, \nbut I do know one thing. We have a choice in about 5 minutes. We can do \nnothing or we can work as hard as we know how to do something. If the \nchoice--if the choice--is to do nothing, then I hope the people of this \ncountry rise up and scream like they have never screamed before. How \ndare us do nothing.\n  That is what they are about getting ready to vote on. They are going \nto say: We are not going to even let you proceed to try to do something \nabout this problem. It takes a lot of nerve. It takes a lot of nerve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for her comments. They were right \non.\n  I rise today to call for action by the Senate on an urgent problem \nfacing this country, facing the State of Montana: gas prices.\n  The national average now, we just found out last weekend, is $4 a \ngallon. I remember when gas was $1.46. It was not that long ago. It was \nbefore the Bush administration took over. That was before the war in \nIraq, before speculators and market manipulators spiraled out of \ncontrol, before that $17 billion Bush tax cut for our Nation's biggest \noil companies.\n  These gas prices hurt. They especially hurt hard-working people in \nMontana and across rural America. In my State, nearly everybody has to \ndrive to work. There are not other options. We do not have a subway \nsystem. We do not have other means of mass transit. Whether it is on a \ntractor or behind the wheel of a truck, a lot of folks rely on \nhorsepower and the fuel to supply that horsepower to get their work \ndone.\n  Of course, high gas prices means high prices for consumer goods. It \nmeans fewer jobs. Middle-class families are getting pinched hard by \nthese high gas prices. For low-income folks, high gas prices are \nunbearable. They do not need to see headlines like in Newsweek this \nweek to know our economy is in trouble. People are already feeling it. \nYet we have seen no solutions from this administration.\n  I am not even convinced this administration considers rising gas \nprices a problem. Earlier this year, a reporter asked President Bush \nwhat advice he had to consumers facing $4 a gallon gas. He was visibly \nsurprised and asked the reporter where he had heard that.\n\n  Well, working folks and small businesses have felt the pain for some \ntime now. Our farmers all over rural America have known it for quite a \nwhile. Our trucking and transportation industry has felt it hard for a \nlong time. The cost of diesel fuel that powers our tractors, our \ncombines, and our trucks that take food to the grocery stores hit $4 \nback in April. It is closing in on $5. Every working family and small \nbusiness and farmer and trucker is taking a hit--a big hit--on these \nfuel prices.\n  That is why I am supporting these two packages today that go to the \nroot of the problems of high gas costs. They offer some solutions.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act will go after commodity speculators who \nare manipulating the market. It needs to be done. It will let the \nJustice Department go after the illegal OPEC oil cartel in court. It \nneeds to be done. It will put a stop to the big tax giveaways the last \nCongress gave to big oil, which needs to be done. It will protect \nconsumers from price colluders and price gougers. This needs to be \ndone.\n  This bill will immediately put a stop to the financial gimmicks that \nhave driven up the cost of oil past the laws of supply and demand. If \nyou do not think speculators are playing with the markets, and they are \nhaving a big impact, let me remind you of the Enron collapse, the dot-\ncom bust, and the demise of the housing market. It is all happening in \noil right now.\n  When Wall Street investment banks faced trouble a couple months ago, \nthe Bush administration swiftly took action. But when American \nconsumers have to tap into their savings or run up their credit card \ndebt just to pay the price at the pump, the administration is nowhere \nto be seen.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act is about solutions. They are solutions \nwe need to invest in right now. We have the opportunity in the United \nStates to drill for oil in places that make sense--eastern Montana, the \nwestern Dakotas, the Bakken field. And wouldn't you know, it is the \nsmaller companies--not the big companies--that are going after those \nreserves. It is the smaller companies innovating, investing in the \nfuture, boosting domestic oil production right now, working with the \nfolks in those regions, boosting rural economies.\n  My colleague, Senator Baucus, has again brought forward an energy tax \npackage that will help extend some of the most successful and effective \ntax credits that are driving alternative energy development. He brought \na similar package forward last year, only to have it narrowly defeated.\n  I hope we have a different outcome this time because our future \nenergy system depends on new solutions, not old solutions. We have the \nideas and the ambition, but we need to get on with new innovations in \nthe marketplace.\n  It is time to resolve these energy costs and take a step toward \nsolving our energy problems. We have to work together, and I am \nconfident we can work together to find solutions to bring the costs \nback down.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 3044, the Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Charles E.

Hopefully, \nthe first business we will conduct will be the votes on the other two \ndistrict court judges. We won't have time to do them this morning. I \nwill work with the Republican leader and we will come up with a time \nand give everybody ample notice about when the next vote will occur.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have the vote on the first judge, the \njudge from Virginia, now, and that we then have the vote on the two \nsubsequent judges at a time to be determined by the majority leader in \nconsultation with the Republican leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This \nlegislation represents a fiscally responsible and balanced approach to \nensure that necessary tax provisions for hardworking American families \nand indispensable small businesses do not expire.\n  At a time when our economy teeters on the brink of recession--when \nunemployment increased 5.5 percent last month--the biggest monthly jump \nin 12 years--when gasoline at the pump is more than $4 a gallon and \nclimbing, when the cost of a dozen eggs has risen 38 percent in the \nlast year alone, when oil costs are set to reach $140 per barrel and \nanalysts are predicting a rise to $150 by July 4th, and when \nforeclosures have hit historic levels--is there any question that the \nAmerican people expect--even demand, not just action but action leading \nto results. We must forge together the results that address these \ncentral issues facing the U.S.\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\neconomy and the millions of Americans who are anxiously awaiting action \nfrom leaders. And while Congress will be forced to make difficult \nchoices on some of these issues in the coming months, this issue--\nwhether to extend critical tax incentives right now should be, frankly, \na straightforward decision.\n  And now before us is legislation that would extend critical energy \ntax credits--including the catalyst that caused a 45-percent growth in \nwind energy last year and energy efficiency tax credits that creates an \nincentive to reduce energy demand. And we are really debating this \nquestion when we saw oil rise by $11 per barrel in a single day to \n$139? To be blunt, this country must wake up and recognize the \nramifications of an energy crisis that we have not addressed for 30 \nyears--and counting. Dr. Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America \nhas estimated that from 2002 to 2008 annual household expenditures on \nenergy increased from about $2,600 to an astonishing $5,300. The impact \nin Maine, where 80 percent of households use heating oil to get through \na winter, is even worse. Last year at this time, prices were at a \nchallenging $2.70 a gallon--for the average Mainer who goes through \n1,000 gallons of oil that is $2,700. The price now is $4.70 meaning \nthat it will cost a Mainer $4,700 just to stay warm not even \nconsidering gasoline costs. That is the difference between a burden and \na crisis.\n  Indeed, the energy efficiency tax incentives and the renewable \nproduction tax credit--critical vehicles for moving our country to self \nsufficiency--are set to expire at the end of this year and some have \nalready expired at the beginning of this year. This is the antithesis \nof the energy policy that our nation must be employing to address \nrising energy costs.\n  Energy efficiency is singlehandedly the most effective investment \nthat our country can make to address the calamity of our energy policy. \nIt is derelict that we would allow energy efficiency tax credits to \nexpire. In fact, some tax credits have already expired, and as a \nresult, there are currently no incentives to purchase efficient \nfurnaces. At a time when Americans are worried about heating bills in \nJune, we must provide the assistance to allow Americans to invest in \nenergy efficient products that will reduce our collective demand for \nenergy, and save Americans money.\n  For example, included in this package is a $300 tax credit to \npurchase a high efficiency oil furnace, which would save over $180 in \nannual savings for an average home--according to calculations based on \nDepartment of Energy data and recent home heating prices. In addition, \nthis includes an extension of a tax credit for highly efficient natural \ngas furnaces that saves an individual $100 per year. However, this tax \ncredit ended at the beginning of this year--right when oil prices began \ntheir historic climb.\n  For businesses that are competing against countries that subsidize \noil the situation is simply untenable. Two weeks ago, Katahdin Paper \nCompany announced that the cost of oil used to run its boilers has \ncaused the company to consider closing the mill's doors. Now, talks are \nunder way to find alternative solutions to preserve the mill's \noperations and its accompanying jobs, but make no mistake; we are at \nthe tipping point where our economy could well be in ruins directly as \na result of high energy costs.\n  With jobs being lost because of high energy costs, it is crucial that \nwe invest in renewable energy jobs--that will put our economy back to \nwork and invest in secure energy future. Indeed over one hundred \nthousand Americans could be put to work in 2008 if clean energy \nproduction tax credits were extended. However, because the incentives \nare set to expire this year, renewable energy companies are already \nreporting a precipitous decrease in investment due to uncertainty. \nProjects currently underway may soon be mothballed. Clean energy \nincentives for energy efficient buildings, appliances and other \ntechnologies, as well as additional funding for weatherizing homes, \nwould similarly serve to stimulate 2008 economic consumption, lower \nresidential energy costs, and generate new manufacturing and \nconstruction jobs. It is irresponsible to allow a bright spot in our \neconomy, the renewable energy industry and energy efficiency \nindustries, to falter, when the product of these industries are so \nessential to the future of this country.\n  Failing to act on these crucial incentives could choke off promising \nbusiness investment in 2008 and miss an opportunity to address high \nenergy costs, a critical contributor to sinking consumer confidence and \nour Nation's long-term economic challenges. Extending these expiring \nclean energy tax credits will help ensure a stronger, more stable \nenvironment for new investments and ensure continued robust growth in a \nbright spot in an otherwise slowing economy. This bill presents another \nopportunity to raise the bar for our future domestic energy systems and \nenergy efficiencies, benefitting our economy, our health, our \nenvironment, and our national security.\n\n  Not only does the legislation address these critical energy tax \nprovisions, but also extends relief for lower and middle-income \nAmericans, as well as small businesses. In particular, there are a \nnumber of provisions that I have championed that have been included by \nthe House legislation and Chairman Baucus' amendment.\n  Fed Chairman Bernanke testified before the House Budget Committee \nearlier this year that, ``a fiscal stimulus package should be \nimplemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate \nspending are felt as much as possible within the next twelve months or \nso.'' Without a doubt, one way to affect spending and help working \nAmericans meet the challenges ahead of us and provide for the families \nis providing a tax rebate. Another measure that Senator Lincoln and I \nhave long championed would enable more hard-working, low-income \nfamilies to receive the refundable child credit by reducing the income \nthreshold for the refundable credit to $10,000 and deindexing it from \ninflation just as it originally passed the Senate in 2001.\n  The consequences of inaction are serious for low-income Americans \nliving paycheck-to-paycheck, and our proposal will ensure that those \nlow-income, hard-working families that benefit from this credit the \nmost receive it. And, I am very pleased that the House included a \nversion of our proposal, one in which, I might add, would already be \nputting money in people's pockets had it already been enacted into law \nproviding further economic stimulus during these challenging times.\n  To ensure that much needed capital investment reaches all corners of \nthe country, the extenders package rightly includes an extension of the \nnew markets tax credit. This program has proven extremely successful in \nencouraging investment and spurring growth in impoverished areas all \nacross the country, both rural and urban. Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave championed extending this vital incentive with the New Markets Tax \nCredit Extension Act, S. 1239, a bill that enjoys the bipartisan \nsupport of 27 cosponsors.\n  To provide relief and equity to our Nation's 1.5 million retail \nestablishments, most of which have less than five employees, I have \nintroduced with Senators Lincoln, Kerry, and Hutchison. This provision \nwould reduce from 39 to 15 years the depreciable life of improvements \nthat are made to retail stores that are owned by the retailer. If the \nmotion to proceed passes, I believe that we will have an opportunity to \naddress this inequity given the support for this provision expressed by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  In 2004, I fought for the inclusion of incentives to stop the flow of \nfilm productions offshore into the FSC-ETI bill. Consequently, I was \nvery pleased to see the House include an extension of this vital \nincentive for film production companies planning whether and where to \nfilm. The House also included a critical modification to the incentive. \nSpecifically, it would remove the $15 million cap on film productions \neligible for the incentive and instead limiting the deduction to the \nfirst $15 million as the provision was originally passed in the Senate \nbefore being amended in conference. This is an issue that I have also \nworked on with my good friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, and am \nso pleased with this provisions inclusion.\n  So as we can see, this bill provides the Senate an opportunity to \nconsider a number of provisions that are vital in helping our economy \nweather the recent downturn it is experiencing. The provisions that I \nhave just outlined\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nwill unleash renewable energy projects creating jobs, provided targeted \ntax relief to low-income working families struggling to pay for the \nhigh cost of food and fuel, encourage an infusion of capital into rural \nand urban communities, provide tax incentives for retail businesses \nlooking to grow their business, and help keep the jobs associated with \nfilm production within our borders. Not to mention, the tax extenders \nbill also includes provisions such as the R tax credit, the tuition \ndeduction and the teachers classroom expenses deduction that are widely \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  Clearly, this tax extenders package is critical to Congress's ongoing \nefforts to reverse the economic slowdown that our Nation is facing. For \nthe fifth month this year, U.S. employers have cut jobs including \n49,000 in the month of May alone. The number of Americans filing first-\ntime claims for unemployment benefits is at its highest level since \nOctober of 2004 and the increase in the rate was the largest since \n1986.\n  The Senate should move forward on extending expiring tax relief. \nThere are some aspects of the House bill that I believe should be \nimproved upon, such as providing an AMT patch to stop the expansion of \nthis mass tax. Some on the other side of the aisle believe we should at \nleast attempt to pay for tax relief, a position I happen to agree with. \nOthers on my side of the aisle believe that shouldn't continue to be a \nmaintenance Congress, continually passing short-term temporary tax \nrelief, a position that I also happen to agree with.\n  There are differences of opinion, but what is the Senate afraid of? \nWhat are we afraid of? To debate and to vote on various positions? Some \nof those issues and positions I would disagree with. But does that mean \nto say the Senate cannot withstand the conflicting views of various \nMembers of the Senate? It is not unheard of, that both sides of the \npolitical aisle will have differing views. So, I would urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the motion to proceed. If the \nmotion succeeds, I am hopeful that we can do what the Senate ought to \ndo--that is find some common ground on an amendment process and a way \nforward to finally dispose of the legislation and enact this \nlegislation sooner rather than later.\n\n  I came to this discussion to work on this issue, to debate, which is \nconsistent with the traditions and principles of this institution, \nwhich has been its hallmark. That is why it has been considered the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. Unfortunately, it is not \nliving up to that expectation or characterization, regrettably.\n  Let's have an open and unfettered debate, which is consistent with \nthis institution that is predicated on our Founding Fathers' vision of \nan institution based on accommodation and consensus. You have to get 60 \nvotes. So let's work it out. Let's clear this first hurdle and proceed \nto the bill. My side of the aisle will still have another 60 vote \nthreshold to ensure that their concerns are heard.\n  The Senate is based on consensus. It is based on compromise. It is \nbased on conciliation. It is based on the fact that you have to develop \ncooperation in order to get anything done. It is not unusual. If \nhistorically we took the position: You missed your chance because there \nare disparate views, so that there would be no opportunity to further \ndiscuss or negotiate--we missed our chance? Are we talking about \nscoring political points? Are we talking about what is the best tax \npolicy for this country?\n  I am concerned we are taking a political U-turn away from the message \nin the last election. I was in that last election. I heard loudly and \nclearly. I don't blame the people of Maine or across this country for \ntheir deep-seated frustration. They are right. There was too much \npartisanship and too much polarization.\n  What's required now is leadership. We need leadership for this \ncountry. They are thirsting for a strong leadership, an honorable \nleadership that leads us to a common goal. No one expected unanimity in \nthe Senate but we would give integrity to this process to allow it to \nwork and not cynically say who is winning and who is losing today \npolitically. We are not shedding the political past. We have made a \npolitical U-turn. We are returning to it.\n  This isn't about party labels. This isn't whether it is good for \nRepublicans or good for Democrats. It is what is good for America. It \nis not about red States and blue States. It is about the red, white, \nand blue. Fact is that with every day that we delay, there are millions \nof taxpayers in all 50 States who literally will pay the price for our \ninaction.\n  I hope we can find a way. What could be of higher priority than to be \nable to debate and to vote on our respective positions, to give a vote \non AMT relief and expiring tax provisions that is so important that a \nmajority of Senators support? Is there anyone in this Chamber who does \nnot think we should extend expiring tax relief?? I know we can build \nthe threshold for the 60. It is imperative we do it. It is inexcusable, \nfrankly, that on the process for debating, we cannot reach an \nagreement. We are failing the American people on a colossal scale. We \nare held up by arcane procedural measures that could be worked out, if \nonly we reached across the political aisle.\n  If my remarks sound familiar, then well they should because \nregrettably I said much the same thing in February of last year at the \nstart of this Congress on another pressing issue of our time. Sadly as \nwe now approach the end of the first session of the 110th Congress, \nthings seemed to have not changed very much. I would hope when we \nfinally adjourn after hopefully extending this critical tax relief that \neach and every one of us will return to our homes and when the clock \nstrikes midnight on December 31, that we all make a New Years \nresolution to make the next Congress a more productive session with \nMembers reaching across the aisle looking for consensus. If we do not, \nthere is one thing that is for certain; the American public is \nwatching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5412-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5412-S5417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MARK STEVEN DAVIS TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                    THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my thanks to the committee leaders for \nbringing forward the nominations to the Senate of Judge Greg Kays and \nStephen Limbaugh to be Federal district court judges for the Western \nand Eastern District Courts of Missouri. Both Judge Kays and Judge \nLimbaugh are outstanding nominees for the Federal bench. They share \nbipartisan support, have fine legal minds, long records of public \nservice, and represent the values and character of my Missouri \nconstituents.\n  Both men's modesty matches the modest size of their Midwestern \nhometowns. But as we have seen so many times in our history, great men, \nmen of learning, men of intellect and excellence, come from modest \nplaces.\n  One should not doubt this to be the case. Values of fairness, \nservice, kindness, community, learning, self-reliance, and personal \nresponsibility are those that we value in our constituents, in our \nsmall-town communities, and we should value in our judges. I think this \nconfirmation process has succeeded in producing two such men.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my ranking member, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

So there will be one vote on or \nabout 3:30 this afternoon.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of an outstanding \nVirginian, the Honorable Mark S. Davis, who has been nominated by the \nPresident to serve as an article III judge on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia. I am pleased to note that Judge \nDavis also enjoys the strong support of my colleague, Senator Webb.\n  Judge Davis has been nominated to fill the seat that was vacated by \nJudge T. S. Ellis, III, who has served as an active judge in the \nEastern District of Virginia for more than 19 years.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Mark Davis for more than two \ndecades. He worked as an intern in my office while attending the \nUniversity of Virginia, and then later, in 1984, he began his \nprofessional career as a staff assistant in my office before he went to \nlaw school. After earning his J. D. from the Washington & Lee \nUniversity School of Law in 1988, he served as a law clerk for the \nHonorable John MacKenzie on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.\n  Subsequent to his clerkship, he entered private legal practice, as a \nlitigation attorney on cases before both Federal and State courts in \nseveral areas, including tort, maritime, and municipal and employment \nlaw. In 2003, the Virginia General Assembly unanimously confirmed him \nto serve as a judge on the Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia in \nPortsmouth, VA; today, he serves as chief judge of this five-judge \ncircuit.\n  In my view, Judge Davis is eminently qualified to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In addition to \nhaving the support of his home state Senators, he also received the \nhighest recommendation of the Virginia State bar and the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee for favorably reporting this \nexemplary nominee to the full Senate, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nto confirm him.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today it is my distinct pleasure to offer my \nsupport along with my colleague Senator Warner for the nomination of \nJudge Mark Davis to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Virginia.\n  The career of this nominee is impressive. Judge Davis is regarded as \na patient, thoughtful individual who exhibits the highest degree of \nethical conduct and professionalism. After graduating law school, Judge \nDavis began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge John A. MacKenzie \nwho served as judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Virginia, 1988-1989. In 1989, Judge Davis joined McGuire Woods, LLP, \nwhere he worked as a partner from 1996 until 1998. Judge Davis has also \nworked as partner at Carr & Porter LLC, 1998-2003. Since 2003, Judge \nDavis has served on the Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia, and has \nbeen the chief judge since 2006.\n  The Virginia Bar Association rated Judge Davis as ``highly \nqualified.'' Judge Davis's written opinions reflect his keen intellect, \nand the extent to which he values communicating his reasoning to \ncounsel and litigants. Further, Judge Davis is active in myriad \ncommunity and civic organizations. Judge Davis received his B.A. in \ngovernment from the University of Virginia in 1984, and his J.D. from \nWashington and Lee University School of Law in 1988.\n  The Constitution assigns a critically important role to the Senate in \nthe advice and consent process related to\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nnominations for the Federal judiciary. These judgeships are lifetime \nappointments, and Virginians expect me and Senator Warner to take very \nseriously our constitutional duties. It is essential that the nominee \nbe respectful of the Constitution, impartial, and balanced toward those \nappearing before him or her.\n  In light of these criteria, Senator Warner and I undertook a careful \nand deliberative process to find the most qualified judicial nominees. \nOur collaboration involved a thorough records review and rigorous \ninterviews. We are of the opinion that Judge Davis meets these high \nstandards. He was on the joint list of recommended judicial nominees \nsubmitted to President Bush last year. We are pleased that President \nBush has chosen to respect our diligent bipartisan work.\n  I want to thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to make these \nremarks about this outstanding Virginian. In particular, I want to \nexpress my gratitude for the expeditious way the Senate has moved the \nnomination of Judge Davis through the process during the 110th \nCongress. Again, it is with pride that I join Senator Warner in \ncommending Judge Mark Davis to each of my colleagues in the Senate; and \nI ask my fellow Senators to vote to confirm his nomination to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to use the balance of my time to \ntalk about the procedures on the Energy bill.\n  I spoke yesterday about the problem created by the so-called \nprocedure of filling the tree. It is my hope that we will return to the \nEnergy bill and we will have an opportunity to offer amendments on the \nbill--the global warming bill, I should specify. Last week, I filed a \nseries of amendments, and I hope we will return to the bill and will \nnot have the procedure of filling the tree thwart the opportunity for \nSenators to offer amendments.\n  As I spoke at some length yesterday, we have devolved in this body \ninto a procedure where the trademark of the Senate--that is, where a \nSenator is able to offer virtually any amendment on any matter at any \ntime--has been undercut. This has been a practice which has been \ngrowing but was used not at all in bygone years. Senator Mitchell then \nused it 9 times, Senator Lott matched him with 9, Senator Frist matched \nhim with 9, and Senator Reid has now used it 12 times.\n  Regrettably, when the tree is filled--an arcane practice not \nunderstood very broadly--and then cloture is not invoked, people think \nthat Republicans are opposed to considering global warming. The fact is \nthat some 32 Republicans voted for cloture on the motion to proceed. So \nit is my hope we will have an opportunity to debate this very important \nsubject and that there will be procedural steps taken so amendments can \nbe offered. The tradition of the Senate in the past has been to have \nlegislation offered, to debate, and if people are opposed, to \nfilibuster, and to have the issues considered. But we have found in \nmodern days that bills involving very important matters, such as the \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, Senate bill 1843, got very short shrift indeed. \nSo it is my hope we will change the procedures.\n  I filed a resolution with the Rules Committee in February of 2007 to \nhave a change in the rules, but in the interim I hope we can alter our \nprocedures to take up these very important amendments.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm three more \nnominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.\n\n  The first nomination we consider is that of Mark Davis of Virginia to \nfill a vacancy in the Eastern District of Virginia, and I commend the \nVirginia Senators on this nomination. After years of controversial \nnominations, Senators Warner and Webb have worked successfully with the \nWhite House on a series of recent nominations for district and circuit \ncourt seats, including that of Judge G. Steven Agee of Virginia, who \nwas confirmed to a seat on the Fourth Circuit last month.\n  I was pleased to accommodate Senator Bond's request that we proceed \npromptly in committee to consider the nominations of David Kays and \nStephen Limbaugh to vacancies in the Western and Eastern Districts of \nMissouri. Both nominees have the support of Senator McCaskill. I wish \nJustice Ronnie White, who went on to become Missouri's first African-\nAmerican chief justice, had received similar consideration when \nPresident Clinton nominated him to the Eastern District of Missouri. \nInstead, more than 2 years after he was nominated, and 2\\1/2\\ months \nafter he was reported out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time, \nhis nomination was voted down on a party line vote, not a single \nRepublican Senator voting to confirm him. I also recall many of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees who were stalled because of \nanonymous Republican objections to their politics or their practice \narea. One of the two nominees from Missouri that we consider today is \nRush Limbaugh's cousin. A similar lineage would have resulted in a \npocket filibuster when the Senate was controlled by a Republican \nmajority during the Clinton administration. So today, in contrast to \nthe treatment of President Clinton's nominees, we proceed to consider \nthese two nominations.\n  I noted last week the sudden concern of the minority leader for \ndistrict court nominations. Perhaps he did not have a chance to see my \nstatement from earlier in the week in which I noted that with \nRepublican cooperation, we have the opportunity this work period \nconfirm five nominees already reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee? Of course, today we would have more than those five \nnominations on the Senate's Executive Calendar had Republicans not \nstalled this President's nominations of Judge Helene White and Ray \nKethledge to the Sixth Circuit, and the nomination of Stephen Murphy to \nthe Eastern District of Michigan. As I said last week, with cooperation \nfrom across the aisle, the Senate is poised to have confirmed four \ncircuit court judges and 11 district court judges before the Fourth of \nJuly recess, confirming a total of 15 lifetime appointments.\n  I recall Senator Specter's frustration when he was chairman with a \nRepublican majority at the end of the last Congress, and Republican \nholds prevented the confirmation of 14 district court nominations. \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee had worked hard to expedite the \nnominations at the end of the last Congress. Many of them were for \nvacancies deemed judicial emergencies, including three in one Federal \ndistrict in Michigan where several judges of senior status--one over 90 \nyears old--continued to carry heavy caseloads to ensure that justice \nwas administered in that district. Now, after the successful efforts of \nthe Senators from Michigan in conjunction with the White House, I hope \nRepublicans will not object to filling three more judicial emergency \nvacancies in Michigan.\n  The complaints by the minority leader and his party about district \ncourt nominations ring as hollow as their complaints that Senate \nDemocrats did not make best efforts to meet the goal he and the \nmajority leader set of moving three circuit court nominations by \nMemorial Day. As at the end of the last Congress with those 14 district \ncourt nominations, Republicans resisted expediting the committee's \nconsideration of the Michigan nominations before Memorial Day. They \nbadgered the nominees, and sent scores of written follow up questions. \nAt the May 7 hearing, the Republicans chose to complain that the \ncommittee was moving too fast, before the committee had received \nupdated ABA ratings on the nominations. They pressed Judge White with \nscores of questions, failing to pose those same questions to Mr. \nKethledge, a candidate for the same circuit. They demanded an extremely \nrare closed hearing to further question Judge White. Given their \nactions and their resistance to the White House's package of \nnominations--nominations made by this President--they made it \nimpossible for the Committee to consider and report the Michigan \nnominations before the Memorial Day recess.\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\n  We have now received the updated ABA rating for Judge White's \nnomination. She received a well qualified rating. That did not come as \nany surprise. She has served ably on the Michigan state appellate \ncourts and acquired additional experience in the decade since she was \nnominated by President Clinton and the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider her nomination.\n  Ultimately, the Republican-led Senate left open five vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit and four on the Sixth Circuit. With the Agee \nconfirmation last month, we have already reduced vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit to less than there were at the end of the Clinton \nadministration, when a Republican-controlled Senate had refused to \nconsider any nominees to that circuit during the last 2 years of the \nClinton Presidency. If Republicans cooperate in considering the \nMichigan nominees, we will have filled every vacancy in the Sixth \nCircuit. Overall, when Republicans ran the Senate and were stalling \nconsideration of President Clinton's nominees, circuit vacancies rose \nfrom 11 to 26, and it reached 32 during the transition to President \nBush. We are in position to reduce circuit vacancies by three-quarters, \nto an historic low.\n  In contrast to the Republican Senate majority that used the Clinton \nyears to more than double circuit court vacancies around the country, \nthe Senate has already reduced circuit court vacancies by almost two-\nthirds, We are poised to complete Senate consideration of the two Sixth \nCircuit nominations. If the Republican minority allows that progress, \nyet another circuit will be without any vacancies. In fact, we would \nreduce the total number of circuit court vacancies across the Nation to \nsingle digits for the first time in decades.\n  If instead we focus on the controversial nominations as the \nRepublicans want, we run the risk of embroiling the committee and the \nSenate in months of debate, foreclosing the opportunity to make \nprogress where we can. We saw what happened with our last contentious \nnomination--that of Leslie Southwick. It took 5\\1/2\\ months from the \ntime of the hearing to his confirmation.\n  The minority leader and the Wall Street Journal continue to point to \nthe confirmation of 15 circuit judges in 1999 and 2000. Sometimes, the \nnumber is 17. Of course, their mythical ``statistical average'' of \nselected years ignores the crises the Republicans had created by not \nconsidering circuit nominees in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the fact that they \nrefused to confirm a single circuit nominee during the entire 1996 \nsession, the fact that they returned 17 circuit court nominees without \naction to the White House in 2000, the public criticism of Chief \nJustice Rehnquist that helped moderate their stalling and the fact that \nthey more than doubled circuit court vacancies while pocket \nfilibustering Clinton nominees.\n  The minority leader only reaches this mythical statistical by taking \nadvantage of the high confirmation numbers of Democratic-led Senates \nconfirming the nominees of President Reagan and the first President \nBush. They ignore their own record of doubling vacancies during the \nClinton administration. They do not like to recall that during the 1996 \nsession, when a Republican majority controlled the Senate during a \nPresidential election year, they refused to confirm any circuit court \njudges at all--not one. Their practice of pocket filibustering \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees led Chief Justice Rehnquist, \nhardly a Democratic partisan, to criticize them publicly. Even he was \nappalled by the actions of the Republican Senate majority. In his 1996 \nYear-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, he wrote:\n\n       Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in \n     comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the \n     vacancy rate is beginning to climb. When the 104th Congress \n     adjourned in 1996, 17 new judges had been appointed and 28 \n     nominations had not been acted upon. Fortunately, a \n     dependable corps of senior judges contributes significantly \n     to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships. It is hoped that \n     the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize \n     that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and \n     effective administration of justice.\n\n  When that shot across the bow did not lead the Republican Senate \nmajority to reverse course, Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke up, again, in \nhis 1997 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary. It was a salvo from \na Republican Chief Justice critical of the Republican Senate \nleadership:\n\n       Currently, 82 of the 846 Article III judicial offices in \n     the Federal Judiciary--almost one out of every ten--are \n     vacant. Twenty-six of the vacancies have been in existence \n     for 18 months or longer and on that basis constitute what are \n     called ``judicial emergencies.'' In the Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit, the percentage of vacancies is \n     particularly troubling, with over one-third of its seats \n     empty.\n       Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, \n     undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift \n     judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies \n     cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \n     eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been \n     associated with the Federal Judiciary. Fortunately for the \n     Judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has \n     contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled \n     judgeships.\n\n  It was only after the scorching criticism by a Republican Chief \nJustice that the Republican Senate majority modified its approach in \norder to allow some of the nominations that had been held back for \nyears to finally proceed. Having built up scores of vacancies, some \nwere allowed to be filled while the Republican Senate majority \ncarefully kept vacant circuit court positions to be filled by President \nClinton's successor. It is in that context that Republican claims of \nmagnanimity must be seen for what it was. It is in that context that \nthe eight circuit confirmations in 2000 must be evaluated while the \nRepublican Senate majority returned 17 circuit nominations to President \nClinton at the end of that session without action.\n  In stark contrast, the Democratic Senate majority has worked steadily \nand steadfastly to lower vacancies and make progress, and we have.\n  I have placed the two Michigan Sixth Circuit nominations on the \nagenda for the committee's business meeting this week. With cooperation \nfrom the Republicans, we can consider and vote on these nominations at \nthat time. That should provide the Senate with the opportunity to \nconsider them before the Fourth of July recess, bringing to four the \nnumber of circuit court nominees confirmed this year. Four would meet \nthe Republican average for 1996 and 2000, and beat their total in the \n1996 session by four.\n  The history is clear. On June 1, 2000, when a Republican Senate \nmajority was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic \nPresident in a Presidential election year, there were 66 judicial \nvacancies. Twenty were circuit court vacancies, and 46 were district \ncourt vacancies. Those vacancies were the result of years of Republican \npocket filibusters of judicial nominations. This year, by comparison \nthere are just 47 total vacancies with only 11 circuit vacancies and 36 \ndistrict court vacancies. After today, there will be just 44 total \nvacancies. If we can continue to make progress this month, the current \nvacancies could be reduced to fewer than 40, with only 9 circuit court \nvacancies and 30 district court vacancies.\n  When Republicans were busy pocket filibustering Clinton nominees, \nFederal judicial vacancies grew to more than 100, with more than 30 \ncircuit vacancies.\n  When I became Chairman in the summer of 2001, we quickly--and \ndramatically--lowered vacancies. The 100 nominations we confirmed in \nonly 17 months, while working with a most uncooperative White House, \nreduced vacancies by 45 percent.\n  After the four intervening years of a Republican Senate majority, \nvacancies remained about level.\n  It is the Democratic Senate majority that has again worked hard to \nlower them in this Congress. We have gone from more than 110 vacancies \nto less than 50 and are heading to less than 40. With respect to \nFederal circuit court vacancies, we have reversed course from the days \nduring which the Republican Senate majority more than doubled circuit \nvacancies. It bears repeating--circuit vacancies have been reduced by \nalmost two-thirds and have not been this low since 1996, when the \nRepublican tactics to slow judicial confirmations began in earnest.\n  Consider for a moment the numbers: After another productive month, \njust 9 of the 178 authorized circuit court judgeships will remain \nvacant--just 9--a vacancy rate down from 18 percent to just 5 percent. \nWith 168 active appellate judges and 104 senior status judges serving \non the Federal Courts of Appeals, there are 272 circuit court judges. I \nexpect that is the most in our history.\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n  The President has not nominated anyone to 16 of the current judicial \nvacancies. He has refused since 2004 to work with the California \nSenators on a successor to Judge Trott on the Ninth Circuit. The \ndistrict court vacancies without nominees span from those that arose in \nMississippi and Michigan in 2006, to several from 2007 in Pennsylvania, \nMichigan, Indiana and the District of Columbia, to others that arose \nearlier this year in Kansas, Virginia, Washington, and several in \nColorado and Pennsylvania.\n  Disputes over a handful of controversial judicial nominations have \nwasted valuable time that could be spent on the real priorities of \nevery American. I have sought, instead, to make progress where we can. \nThe result is the significant reduction in judicial vacancies.\n  In fact, our work has led to a reduction in vacancies in nearly ever \ncircuit. Both the Second and Fifth Circuits had circuit-wide \nemergencies due to the multiple simultaneous vacancies during the \nClinton years with Republicans in control of the Senate. Both the \nSecond Circuit and the Fifth Circuit now are without a single vacancy. \nWe have already succeeded in lowering vacancies in the Second Circuit, \nthe Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth \nCircuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, \nthe DC Circuit, and the Federal Circuit. Circuits with no current \nvacancies include the Seventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth \nCircuit, the Eleventh Circuit and the Federal Circuit. When we are \nallowed to proceed with President Bush's nominations of Judge White and \nRay Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit, it will join that list of Federal \ncircuits without a single vacancy.\n  My approach has been consistent throughout my chairmanships during \nthe Bush Presidency. The results have been positive. Last year, the \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported 40 judicial nominations to the \nSenate and all 40 were confirmed. That was more than had been confirmed \nin any of the three preceding years when a Republican chairman and \nRepublican Senate majority managed the process.\n  Despite this progress, of course, some partisans seem determined to \nprovoke an election year fight over nominations. The press accounts are \nfilled with threats of Republican reprisals. The May 14 issue of Roll \nCall boasted the following headline: ``GOP Itching for Fight Over \nJudges; Reid's Pledge to Move Three Before Recess Fails to Appease \nMinority.'' Then in a recent article in The Washington Times, we read \nthat the Republican fixation on judges is part of an effort to bolster \nSenator McCain's standing among conservatives. There seem to be no \nsteps we could take to satisfy Senate Republicans on nominations, \nbecause they are using it as a partisan issue to rev up their partisan \npolitical base.\n  The Republican effort to create an issue over judicial confirmations \nis sorely misplaced. Last month we experienced the greatest rise in \nunemployment in a single month in over two decades, bringing the total \njob losses for the first 5 consecutive months of this year to over \n325,000. Americans are now facing increasing burdens from the soaring \nprice of gas, high food prices, rising unemployment and a home mortgage \nforeclosure and credit crisis.\n  This year we have seen the worst plunge in new homes sales in two \ndecades. The press reported that new home sales fell 8.5 percent in \nMarch, the slowest sales pace since October 1991, and the median price \nof a home sold dropped 13.3 percent compared to the previous year. That \nwas the biggest year-over-year price decline in four decades. You would \nhave to go back to July 1970 to find a larger decline.\n  Unfortunately, this bad economic news for hard-working Americans is \nnothing new under the Bush administration. During the Bush \nadministration, unemployment is up more than 20 percent and trillions \nof dollars in budget surplus have been turned into trillions of dollars \nof debt, with an annual budget deficit of hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Last week, the price of oil soared to nearly $139 a barrel, \nnearly twice what it was at this time last year. When President Bush \ntook office, the price of gas was $1.42 a gallon. Today, it is at an \nall-time high of over $4.00 a gallon.\n  According to a recent poll, 81 percent of Americans today believe \nthat our country is headed in the wrong direction. It costs more than \n$1 billion a day--$1 billion a day--just to pay down the interest on \nthe national debt and the massive costs generated by the disastrous war \nin Iraq. That's $365 billion this year that would be better spent on \npriorities like health care for all Americans, better schools, fighting \ncrime, and treating diseases at home and abroad.\n  In contrast, one of the few numbers actually going down as the \nPresident winds down his tenure is that of judicial vacancies. Senate \nDemocrats have worked hard to make progress on judicial nominations, \nlowering circuit court vacancies by almost two-thirds from the level to \nwhich the Republican Senate majority had built them. Any effort to turn \nattention from the real issues facing Americans to win political points \nwith judicial nominations is neither prudent, nor productive.\n  Today we confirm three nominations for lifetime appointments. The \nfirst, Mark S. Davis, currently serves as Chief Judge of the Portsmouth \nCircuit Court, Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia. Prior to his \nappointment to the bench in 2003, Judge Davis worked in private \npractice at several Virginia law firms.\n  David Gregory Kays currently serves as the presiding circuit court \njudge for the Twenty-Sixth Judicial Circuit for the State of Missouri, \nwhere he has served since his first election in 2005. Previously, Judge \nKays served as an associate circuit judge for Laclede County Circuit \nCourt in Missouri and as chief assistant prosecuting attorney in \nLaclede County.\n  Stephen N. Limbaugh is a supreme court judge and former chief justice \non the Supreme Court of Missouri. Previously, Judge Limbaugh was \nappointed and then elected Circuit Judge for the 32nd Judicial Circuit \nof Missouri. Before his career on the State bench, Judge Limbaugh was \nan elected prosecuting attorney and also worked in private practice.\n  So today we make progress, and the Senate is likely to confirm three \nadditional lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. I congratulate \nthe nominees and their families on their confirmation today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes twenty seconds for the \nSenator from Virginia, and 33 seconds to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 1 minute \nto the Senator from Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was very privileged to submit the name \nof Mr. Davis to the President of the United States, and I am greatly \nappreciative to the Senate to now come to the question of his \nconfirmation. But I think it would be interesting if I were to point \nout to all those following it that this individual was a former member \nof my staff.\n  I think it shows the incentive of those many staff persons all \nthroughout our system who contribute so much to the work of our \nindividual Senators that they too can, through their service, lay the \nfoundation to someday achieve this recognition by the Senate in which \nthey worked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to Senator Webb on my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I very quickly wish to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the senior Senator from Virginia and to emphasize that \nwe jointly examined a whole array of nominees for this position. This \nindividual, perhaps because of and perhaps in spite of the fact he \nworked for the senior Senator from Virginia, is considered highly \nqualified by Members on this side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would commend one more time the two \nSenators from Virginia, both dear friends of mine, for the fact we \nworked as one\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\nDemocrat, one Republican with the White House to get us past this \nimpasse. And I commend President Bush for withdrawing controversial \nnominees and working toward consensus nominees. That is why this \nnominee will go through, I suspect unanimously, in this body.\n  I also commend the two Senators from Missouri, Senators Bond and \nMcCaskill, for working together.\n  Has all time been yielded back?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, it has.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Mark Steven Davis, of Virginia, to be a United States district judge \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leader, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the objection of my good friend \nfrom Mississippi. He was not objecting on his own but for someone else.\n  The hearing we were going to conduct was a hearing entitled \n``Coercive Interrogation Techniques: Do They Work, Are They Reliable, \nand What Did the FBI Know About Them?''\n  This morning, Senator Feinstein, as chair of the subcommittee, began \nchairing a very important hearing on interrogation tactics. The hearing \nfeatured a report by the Department of Justice inspector general on \ntactics at Guantanamo that amounted to torture. The hearing was \ninterrupted by three floor votes, and the chair recessed the hearing \nuntil 2 p.m.\n  As you know, we have our weekly caucuses starting at 12:30. But now \nthe minority is objecting to the committee meeting by invoking the 2-\nhour rule. What this means is that 2 hours after we come into session, \nthere has to be consent to conduct hearings; otherwise, you have to do \nthem during the first 2 hours we are in session. It is very rare there \nis an objection, but there is today. So I have no alternative but to \nrecess the Senate this afternoon to allow the hearing to continue.\n  The Republicans may not want these abuses to come to light, but I \nthink the American people have a right to know. This is part of a \npattern of obstructionism by my friends on the Republican side.\n  I want the Senate to debate a bill to reduce gas prices and I want \nthe Senate to debate a bill to extend tax credits for renewable energy, \nand now they do not want the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing \nabout coercive interrogation tactics. They can try to use Senate rules \nto silence these debates, but I will use the rules at this time to \nallow the Judiciary Committee to continue the hearing. As soon as the \nhearing is over, we are going to be out here to talk about gas prices.\n  I would hope this is framed with a picture that there is a \nPresidential election going on. We have one Presidential candidate who \nwants to do something about these high gas prices, wants to do \nsomething about the bill to extend tax credits for renewable energy, \nand we have another candidate who is opposed to this. We know who that \ncandidate is: it is the Senator from the State of Arizona. And I would \nthink that my friend, the Senator from Arizona, who is the Republican \nnominee, would be concerned about this delaying tactic not to allow the \nJudiciary Committee to hold a hearing on torture. That is what it \namounts to.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5418-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Renewable Energy and Jobs Creation Act\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my strong support \nto the Renewable Energy and Jobs Creation Act. I wish to applaud the \nincredibly hard work that was put into this package by the Finance \nCommittee and particularly Chairman Baucus. I also wish to congratulate \nour counterparts in the House Ways and Means Committee for their \nefforts in putting together this important piece of legislation.\n  I am so very disappointed--as we tried early this morning--that our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle chose to block progress on this \nbill. It would have provided much needed tax relief to individual \ntaxpayers and to businesses alike. I don't know about other Senators, \nbut when I travel home people look to me and say: What are you doing to \nhelp us with this economy? We are paying $4 a gallon for gasoline to \nget to our jobs, to get to school, to get to all of the things we need \nto tend to. We are concerned about the jobs we have lost in our State. \nWe are concerned about the increase in unemployment. We have to do \nsomething about this economy. We have to do something about stimulating \nthe economy of our country to grow on behalf of all of the millions of \nAmericans out there who need us to help them.\n  This bill on which we were trying to proceed this morning could have \ndone just that. It could have provided just the stimulus we needed to \njump-start our economy. It would have been a good start. I think it is \nparticularly frustrating not to be able to move on it in light of all \nof our current economic downturns. Taxpayers need this relief and they \nneed it right now. We need to provide them every opportunity to keep \nthis economy turning.\n  One of the things I think that comes from our businesses and \nindividuals across my State--and certainly across this country--is the \nconcern of the unknown. We try to create in our Tax Code the types of \nincentives that will incentivize different cultural activities, such as \nthe purchasing of a home and home ownership, but we also want to \nincentivize businesses to be able to grow and be competitive. If they \ndon't know they are going to have that same tax treatment for more than \n6 months, or in 6 months it is going to expire, how are they going to \nbe able to make the reasonable business decisions to take the capital, \nwhich right now is very hard to come by, and invest in certain areas of \ntheir industry, to grow those jobs, and to grow those businesses that \nare out there in this great country?\n  This package would have done just that. It provides businesses that \nmake investments in research and development with a tax credit. We are \nfalling behind every year. Other countries across the globe are working \nhard to provide the kind of research and development they need to move \ninto new industries for multiple reasons: job creation, obviously, as \nwell as our environment. Look at nations, such as Brazil, which have \nlessened their dependence on foreign oil from 80 percent to 11 percent. \nThey have invested in research. They have invested in developing \nrenewable fuels. We have to do that too. This is the bill that would \nhave started us moving on that pathway to investing in companies that \ncannot only provide us the good types of industries that would help us \nclean our environment but would have created the jobs that would have \nmade the difference.\n  It also encourages infrastructure investment. One of the ways it does \nthat is through the extension of the short-line rail credit which \nprovides an incentive for the maintenance and expansion of our short \nline rail systems. When you come from a rural State as I do--we are \nvery fortunate to have the major lines that come through our State to \nreach out to all of those small communities where we desperately need \nto create jobs--we need those short line rails that can connect to the \nmajor main line rails to take our goods and our services all across \nthis great country into the ports that will take it to other countries \nwith which we can compete. We need to give them the incentive to invest \nin themselves.\n  In talking to one of my short line rails, they said to me: You \nwouldn't believe the number of jobs we could create, the investment we \ncould make, if we just simply knew that Congress was supporting us, \nthat they are going to help us with that incentive we have had in the \npast and we want to continue.\n  The unknown is very frightening to businesses in this world we live \nin and in the economic times in which we are living. The margins right \nnow are so slim, limiting their ability to compete with other modes of \ntransportation, but without a doubt they can provide a service to \nindustries that are competing with industries across the globe.\n  This bill would have kept jobs at home through incentives to \nencourage domestic production of films, as one particular example. We \nare seeing our films being sent overseas and offshore because other \ncountries are offering greater incentives. When you look at rural \nAmerica, one of the strongest ways--and the quickest ways too--to see \nthe investment and the revitalization of these small communities and \ntheir little downtown Main Streets is when somebody comes in to produce \na film. They come in to produce a film, and they put a good picture on \nredoing that Main Street area. They bring in jobs; not only jobs with \nfilmmaking, but they also come and eat in our cafes, and they use the \nshops and the other amenities that are there, keeping businesses at \nhome.\n  But we can't do that if those film companies don't know that they are \ngoing to get good treatment, at least as good as they get in other \ncountries. They have a bottom line to meet too. They take their film \ncrews and all the dollars they are spending in making those films, and \nthey go into other countries. We need to keep them at home. Those are \ngood jobs for electricians and contractors, plumbers, and a whole host \nof other people.\n  I have a retired man at home, and they did a film--a made-for-TV \nmovie--in my former Congressional District on the eastern side of my \nState, and he had two antique cars. You wouldn't have believed the \ndifference it made in his life to be able to rent those two cars, those \ntwo antique cars to be featured in a vintage film and what it meant to \nhis pocketbook as well.\n  The bill we have been trying to bring forward and were prevented this \nmorning from bringing forward allows our financial services businesses \nto remain competitive globally through the extension of the subpart F \nexceptions for the active financing income. It provides access to \ncapital to our communities that need it the most--our rural and low-\nincome communities--through an extension of the new market tax credit, \nenabling our businesses to be viable overseas, and also making sure \nthat the new and innovative businesses we want to see in our small and \nrural communities can actually happen, that they can be a part of this \nglobal community, and that they will have the same kind of advantages \nthat other industries and other businesses in bigger parts of our \nNation may have. All of these provisions provide a huge benefit to our \nAmerican businesses and would most definitely help to stimulate our \nslowing economy.\n  In addition, the bill we were trying to bring up this morning \nprovides very important relief for individual taxpayers. It includes \ntax cuts for college students, their families, and our teachers. With \ntwin boys who are finishing\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nthe sixth grade and starting the seventh grade, right now in my mind I \nhave a tremendous appreciation for our teachers and what they give day \nin and day out, being able to offer them the opportunity of a Tax Code \nthat is going to reward them for this incredible job they do.\n  I ask my colleagues--just as was my experience in the public schools \nof Arkansas--to look back and think of those wonderful teachers who \nhave affected their lives. There are great teachers out there right \nnow, and they need us because it is an institution and a business that, \nunfortunately, we are not seeing enough. We are hitting a brick wall. \nWe are seeing more teachers who are retiring than we are seeing new \nteachers. What a great way for us in this country to show how much we \nbelieve in those teachers.\n  It includes an incentive for our senior citizens who want to take \npart in charitable giving. That is the IRA rollover. Every week I get a \ncall in my office from the same gentleman. He took advantage of the IRA \nrollover to be able to give to his church. Every Sunday morning he goes \nto his Sunday school and talks to the people in his Sunday school class \nabout this great opportunity of being able to give through these IRA \nrollovers. Well, all of his friends in his Sunday school class want to \nknow if this is going to be the law. Can we do this? Should we do this? \nIs this something that is going to continue?\n  We can't even tell them that. We are being held back from doing so \nmany productive things that would encourage not only individual \ninvolvement in being able to generate our economy and put the emphasis \nback on our economy from individuals, but also our businesses who need \nour help.\n  The bill also includes an AMT patch to ensure more middle-income \ntaxpayers aren't going to be hit by the AMT this year.\n  It also has tremendous incentives for green jobs that we can grow in \nthis country and looking at renewable fuels and all the many things we \ncan do with those renewable fuels but also things such as wind--and we \nhave had tremendous tornadoes in Arkansas--and wind mills, and energy \nfrom wind is not something we are really noted for doing. Our \ntopography is not necessarily meant for that, like some other States. \nBut we produce the blades for the windmills. That is hundreds of jobs \nin my State. Let me tell you, do you think those industries are going \nto want to continue to make the capital investment in the manufacturing \nof something that may or may not be used, because those other \nindustries that are building and making that energy from wind don't \nknow if they can depend on the tax credit--a tax incentive in the code \nthat encourages the behavior of moving to a renewable energy source?\n  Mr. President, we have to move forward. We cannot keep standing here \nfighting and bickering over whether we are going to proceed to talk \nabout these things. We have to move forward and talk about them.\n  Most important is an issue I have worked on for years which includes \na provision very near and dear to my heart, and that is a patch to the \nrefundable child tax credit, to ensure that thousands of hard-working \nlow-\nincome families aren't locked out of this credit. I wish to take a few \nminutes to explain the child tax credit provision, which I have worked \non with my good friend and colleague, Olympia Snowe.\n  As some colleagues may be aware, to be eligible for the refundable \nchild tax credit, working families must meet an income threshold. If \nthey don't earn enough, they don't qualify for the credit. The problem \nis, some of our working parents are working full time, but they still \ndon't earn enough to meet the current income threshold to qualify for \nthis tax credit, much less to receive a meaningful refund from it.\n  When first enacted, the income threshold for the refundable child tax \ncredit was set at $10,000. The threshold is indexed for inflation and \nthus has increased every year. For 2008, it is going to be $12,050. \nUnfortunately, as many of us are aware, wages are not increasing at \nthat same pace. For example, a single mother who earns the current \nminimum wage and works a 35-hour-a-week job, 50 weeks out of the year, \nfails to qualify for the refundable portion of the child tax credit. \nEven after the minimum wage increases next month, that mother still \nwill not meet the income threshold.\n  That is what we want to encourage. We want to encourage people to \nwork, to be able to change the cycle of poverty that exists for welfare \ntoday. We want to make sure individuals are encouraged to go to work, \nso that they can still take care of their children. Our children are \nour greatest resource. Why would parents who want to care for their \nkids not want to incentivize that.\n  It is absolutely wrong to provide this credit to some hard-working \nAmericans while leaving others behind. The single working parent who is \nstocking shelves in a local grocery score is every bit as deserving as \nthe teacher, accountant, or insurance salesman who qualifies for the \ncredit in its current form. It is imperative that we address this \ninequity, and we must ensure our Tax Code works for all Americans, \nespecially those working parents who are forced to get by on minimum \nwage.\n  I am extremely frustrated that our friends across the aisle chose to \nblock action on this bill. I hope that we will reconsider this \nposition, that we will look at the important value in all of these \npieces of this legislation, and that we will come back again and go \nback to the drawing board and figure out how we can make this bill a \nreality.\n  Again, I applaud our committee chairman for putting this package \ntogether and trying to move it through the Senate in a timely fashion. \nThere is absolutely no reason we should not see this package. It is a \ncommonsense package. It makes sense for everybody concerned. We owe it \nto our American businesses that are trying to remain competitive. We \nowe it to our teachers, students, and the families paying college \ntuition. We owe it to our communities that are desperately in need of \ninfrastructure and jobs. We owe it to our working families with \nchildren. No one should stand in the way of this package that truly \nwill bring relief to so many Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak today--as many of us have \nbeen doing--not just about the high price of gasoline but all of the \npressures on American families that come with that. When I say \n``families,'' I mean in the broadest sense of the word. The Presiding \nOfficer has advocated on behalf of people who are suffering under the \nweight of high gasoline prices. He has been an articulate and forceful \nadvocate for action. We are finally at the point where we are at least \ndebating the action we should be taking.\n  I wanted to talk about prices. When the average American family goes \nto the grocery store or they go to fill up their tank or they try to \npay for college or health care--just fill in the blank--it seems as if \neverything in their lives is going up when their wages are flattening \nout or sometimes actually going down. The price of everything is going \nthrough the roof, and at the same time we have record job losses. I \ndon't know the exact number to date, but we have had tens of thousands \nevery month, month after month after month. Some believe the most \nrecent monthly job loss number is a record. But even if it is not a \nrecord or if we are off by a couple thousand, it is still far too high.\n  In Pennsylvania, this is not just a problem in inner cities where a \nlot of people's incomes are low; this is a problem across a State such \nas Pennsylvania. We have a State that has some large cities and bigger \ncommunities population-wise, but we have a very rural State. We have \nmillions of people in Pennsylvania who live in so-called rural areas by \nthe demographics. They have to travel great distances to get to the \ngrocery store or to make transactions for business or to get their \nfamilies to where they have to go. So gas prices, in some ways, \ndisproportionately adversely affect those who live in rural areas or in \nsmall towns.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have--more than maybe any other State and \nsometimes as many States as you can talk about combined--a lot of two-\nlane roads. So the distance between one place and another isn't just \nthe mileage but it is the roads you take. On a two-lane road, you \ncannot go as fast, and that adds to the difficulty and the reality of \ngas prices.\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\n  We also have a State that has a tremendous agricultural economy. All \nof those costs--the cost of energy and the cost of transportation and \ndistribution--are going up for our farm families.\n  While all this is happening--and we know there are no easy \nsolutions--we also see that, lo and behold, the big oil companies--in \nthe last 5 years, the profits of the five largest oil companies--in \n2002, the profits of the five largest oil companies was a measly $29 \nbillion. Last year, 2007, big oil had profits of $124 billion. So it \nwent from $29 billion to $124 billion in just 5 years. I think there \nare very few, if any, American families--especially middle and lower \nincome families--who are under the weight of these costs I just talked \nabout who have had their incomes go up three, four, or five times.\n  The reality is that big oil has gotten too much. Over and over again, \ntheir profits are going through the roof. This Government gave them tax \nbreaks a couple of years ago to the tune of $17 billion. So just at the \ntime when their profits were taking off in a record way, this \nGovernment gave them, back in 2004 and 2005, $17 billion in breaks. We \nhave talked about taking away those breaks and allowing us as a \ngovernment, as a family, to be able to say there is another part of the \nfamily over here that is hurting and we want to help them. I will do it \nvery briefly in terms of our approach.\n\n  Basically, what Democrats have tried to do is to say: Look, we don't \nhave to pretend we are helpless and sit back and say there is nothing \nwe can do. We don't have a magic wand and there is no easy solution, \nbut the idea of doing nothing and saying it is OK for oil companies to \nget these profits at a time when we could use that revenue for \nsomething else is ridiculous. Everybody out there knows it. They know, \nfor example, that we can say we should have an excess profits tax. That \nmakes sense. Now, if a big oil company comes in the door and says: You \nknow what, we are going to do our best to reduce our country's \ndependence on foreign oil, we are going to be more efficient and put \nmore into research and development and do the right thing for the \nAmerican consumers, we are going to say: OK, then maybe your excess \nprofits tax--the hit against an oil company--is not going to be as \nhigh. That is reasonable.\n  At the same time, a lot of people know that a high percentage of the \nincrease in the price of a barrel of oil is from speculation by people \non Wall Street who have money, power, influence, and the ability to get \ninformation like that and make a huge financial profit. We should crack \ndown on speculation. We can do that. The Federal Government can do \nthat. We should give the Federal Government the authority to do that. \nWe should give the President--any President--the authority to crack \ndown on price gouging.\n  So there is much we can do. Listening to the other side of the aisle, \ntheir solution is that we can drill our way out of that situation. \nNobody believes that. There is no evidence that we can drill our way \nout of this. If anything, that keeps us dependent on oil--not just \nforeign oil.\n  I think this idea that we sit back and do nothing is really not \nworthy of a long argument. We have to end our addiction to oil. We have \nto take specific, targeted steps to not just reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil but to provide equity here for the American families.\n  I believe a lot of the solutions Democrats have talked about have \nbeen very practical--an excess profits tax, taking away those \ntremendous billions in breaks oil companies have had, and also getting \ntough on the speculators, the people making a lot of money in the \nmarket, is another very practical way. Democrats have offered a \npractical set of solutions. We are waiting for the other side to come \nup with their solution to the pressure felt by the American family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to come to the Senate floor \nand join my colleagues in talking about the unfortunate votes that were \ncast this morning--one to go ahead and consider legislation to try to \ndeal with the price of gasoline. That was the first vote where, \nunfortunately, we rejected the effort to proceed to that bill. The \nmajority of Republican Members chose not to proceed to that bill, which \nwas unfortunate. The second vote was to proceed to a bill that has the \neffect of extending the provisions that are currently in the Tax Code \nand particularly to extend tax provisions that are intended to \nencourage clean energy development. I wish to talk about that second \nbill in particular because it is one I have been involved in and have \nfollowed and supported for some time now.\n  The incentives we have in current law to encourage alternative energy \ndevelopment--wind energy, wind energy farms, wind turbine farms, solar \nenergy developments in this country--most of those incentives were put \ninto place in the current form in 2005 when we passed the Energy bill. \nThere was great fanfare and rejoicing when we passed that. The \nPresident signed that bill in my home State of New Mexico, in \nAlbuquerque. He rightfully took credit for the fact that this was being \nenacted, and he talked about the importance of these energy tax \nprovisions.\n  I did not realize when we did that in 2005 that it was the \nadministration's intent to allow those tax provisions to expire at the \nend of 2008. I thought the idea was that we would keep those in place \nlong enough that we would provide incentives for people to pursue these \nalternative options.\n  We have now tried three times in this Congress to extend those energy \ntax provisions, and we have failed three times. So I rise to express \ndeep disappointment and frustration with that vote. The implications of \nthe vote are profound if we cannot persuade our colleagues to change \ntheir position. Clearly, if it is going to be our national policy that \nwe are not extending these tax provisions, then we are going to suffer \nenvironmental consequences from continued reliance on power generated \nfrom fossil fuels; our efforts to reduce America's dependence on \nforeign oil will be cut short; our ability to create high-paying green \njobs in these new energy sectors will come to nought; and our effort to \npromote research and development in these new industries will certainly \nnot materialize. It is a sad day for us in the Senate; we are not able \nto move ahead and do this.\n  The first time this issue came up, the first time we tried to extend \nthese tax provisions, the argument was that the offsets are the \nproblem; you folks are trying to reduce the tax benefits enjoyed by the \noil and gas industry in order to provide revenue to pay for these \nalternative energy tax provisions, and that is the objectionable part.\n  I did not agree with that argument. I voted to extend the alternative \nenergy tax provisions and pay for it in that way, but I think the House \nof Representatives has heard that message and the House of \nRepresentatives has now sent us a bill, which is the bill we were \ntrying to proceed to today, which does not try to pay for these \nextensions of alternative energy tax provisions by reducing tax \nbenefits for the oil and gas industry. It leaves the oil and gas \nindustry alone, and it finds some alternative ways to make up that lost \nrevenue. The alternatives are ones which, to my mind, are very \nmeritorious.\n  Of course, under our rules in the Senate that we have adopted in the \nCongress, we have to find a way to make up the revenue being lost. That \nis why we are pushing to do so, and it is the responsible thing to do. \nThe alternative, of course, is to borrow more money from our friends \noverseas, to run up the deficit and let our grandchildren worry about \nit at some point down the road. That is not a responsible course.\n  One of the bill's offsets that we were trying to proceed to today \nwould delay a tax benefit known as the worldwide interest allocation. \nThat is a tax benefit that has not gone into effect. We would delay the \neffective date of it, again, for some period. There are a lot of \ncorporations that have indicated to us they would support going ahead \nand delaying that benefit. This is not a tax increase from current law; \nthis is keeping current law where it is.\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n  The other offset would be to close a loophole that enables hedge fund \nmanagers to defer compensation by investing wages in offshore \ninvestment funds. This proposal would end that deferral, would require \nthe hedge fund managers recognize the compensation that they receive as \nincome when it is paid. This proposal does not increase taxes; it \nsimply changes the timing of tax liabilities.\n  Describing this loophole, the New York Times says:\n\n       Many hedge fund managers are enjoying not only \n     extraordinary profits, but the extra benefit of a system \n     almost encouraging them to set up offshore accounts.\n\n  What we were trying to do in this legislation is to say let's not \nencourage them to set up offshore accounts by giving them tax \nincentives to do so. That is a reasonable position, and it is one that \nwe should definitely be enacting into law. I know 44 Members of this \nChamber voted ``no'' in our effort to proceed to consider this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I do not see additional colleagues \nhere. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate it. As I said, 44 Members of the Senate \nvoted not to proceed to consider this bill and instead, I gather, to \nprotect a handful of hedge fund managers from having to pay the normal \ntax that ought to be levied on each American when they get compensated.\n  Clearly, I think we have lost sight of our priorities. I know this is \nan election year. I know there are powerful special interests that are \nalways saying just vote no, always resist whatever is proposed. The \nsimple fact is, if we are going to turn the page, if we are going to \nturn the corner on our future energy needs, we are going to have to \nmove ahead and put in place some policies that will encourage \nalternative energy development. We have fallen short in doing that now \nthree times in this Congress. I hope we do not continue to fall short. \nI urge my colleagues to reconsider this, and I hope the majority leader \nwill find a way to bring this issue back to the full Senate, even this \nweek, if possible, so we can get a positive vote to proceed with this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to warn the American \npeople. There is a Trojan horse riding across our country and onto the \nSenate floor. Its creators want everyone to believe that their climate \ntax proposal will clean the planet while causing minimum impact on our \nlives. They want us to believe that everyone will live happily ever \nafter. However, this is not a legend or a fairy tale. Hiding inside \nthis Trojan horse is a monster of a tax increase to pay for the largest \nexpansion of the Federal Government since FDR's New Deal.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that this \nproposal will cost the American taxpayer $1.2 trillion dollars in taxes \nover just the first 10 years of this bill. And that tax bill is only \nexpected to rise with time. With the hefty price tag and a huge \nexpansion of bureaucracy, the legislation actually does very little, if \nanything, to improve the environment. The American people cannot afford \nto pay for this reckless attempt at energy policy. Instead, we should \nlet American ingenuity lead the way toward exploration of American \nenergy, expansion of renewable energy, and increased conservation.\n  This Climate Tax bill imposes a cap on greenhouse gas emissions that \ncan be released into the environment by certain businesses, and this \ncap will gradually reduce every year until 2050. The bill creates \nallowances that gives companies the right to emit specific amounts of \nthese greenhouse gases.\n  Some of the allowances will be distributed for free to various \nentities. The rest of the allowances will be auctioned to the highest \nbidder. These allowances can then be sold, traded, or transferred. The \ncost incurred by businesses to obtain these allowances will be passed \non to consumers, hitting low-income households the hardest. But before \nwe talk about the revenue windfall for the Government and about the \npeople celebrating this legislation, let's discuss the victims.\n  First and foremost, this Climate Tax bill will cost our economy and \nour working families greatly. Restricting carbon dioxide emissions \ndrives our energy supply down. Just as the bill hopes to do, the price \nof energy would increase. With gasoline prices already over 4 dollars a \ngallon and predicted to continue rising, we will all be hurting.\n  According to the EPA, this bill will increase the price of gas by at \nleast 53 cents a gallon. 53 cents. In my home State of Nevada, this \nwould translate currently into about $4.68 a gallon at today's average \nprice for regular gasoline. And gas prices aren't the only thing that \nwill go up. Electricity bills will increase by 44 percent or more.\n  And the cost to our overall economy would be devastating. By 2030, \nthe annual loss to the United States' gross domestic product could \nreach nearly a trillion dollars. The proposal is called America's \nClimate Security Act, but with millions of jobs being destroyed because \nof this bill, not many Americans are going to be feeling secure. Many \nof the jobs lost are going to be in the manufacturing and mining \nindustries that support so many of our smaller and rural communities. \nThese valuable jobs will be forced to move overseas to countries like \nChina and India, where companies will continue to emit greenhouse gases \nfreely and without constraint. In case you haven't noticed, we all \noccupy the same big greenhouse--the planet Earth. So Americans lose \ntheir jobs, but our air on our planet is still polluted.\n  In fact, this bill makes such a minor impact on the worldwide \ngreenhouse gas emissions that any reduction in the United States is \nswallowed up by the uncontrolled and rapidly growing emissions of \nChina, India, and other developing nations.\n  If emissions continue to increase in these countries, the problems \nresulting from the global warming predicted by many scientists may \nstill occur.\n  It just does not make sense for us to dramatically restrict our \ngreenhouse gas emissions if China and India do not do the same.\n  If this bill isn't good for our families, our economy, our workers or \nour environment, who is it good for? The special interests and \nWashington lobbyists. By auctioning off carbon emission allowances and \ngiving away even more for free, there will be more than $6 trillion \ndollars worth of allowances and offsets and funds to dole out to a \nhungry and a fierce pack of special interests. It's being called \n``environmental pork,'' and the wolves are going to be ready to pounce. \nHundreds of billions of dollars of that pork won't even stay here in \nAmerica. Instead, it will be given away to foreign governments and \ncompanies.\n  So do we stand by as the proponents trot around this plan that means \nnew taxes, higher gas prices, higher electricity bills, and more \nbureaucracy? In fact, the only thing this proposal reduces are the jobs \nof hard-working Americans and our standard of living.\n  Now, don't get me wrong, we absolutely need comprehensive energy \nreform. Americans are hurting at the pump and their budgets are being \nbusted by rising cooling and heating bills. As a Nation, we are too \ndependent on Middle Eastern oil--a resource that is too often in the \nhands of brutal dictatorships.\n  But as is often the case in our Nation's history, we must look \nforward to a policy that unleashes the innovative spirit of Americans, \ntakes a commonsense approach to our challenges, and rallies everyone to \nthe cause.\n  We do this by encouraging conservation, efficiency, and renewable \nenergy expansion through incentives, not by imposing unworkable \nmandates and impossible timelines.\n  As we spend time debating this legislation today, crucial tax credits \nthat encourage innovation in solar, geothermal, wind, hydropower, and \nother alternative energy technologies are scheduled to expire. \nAmerica's energy security needs those tax credits, and Congress should \nact to extend them immediately without offsets. The Senate\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\ntook an important step toward that objective by voting 88 to 8--to \ninclude the bipartisan Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act, which I sponsored \nas part of the Senate-passed housing bill. Now the House must act so we \ncan send a bill to the President that can be signed into law as soon as \npossible.\n  With exciting energy technology on the horizon, we can't afford to \nlet these tax credits expire. In Nevada, some innovative projects have \nalready begun harnessing the power of the Sun and to provide energy to \nour residents.\n  Nevada Solar One in Boulder City is one of the largest capacity solar \nplants built in the world and generates enough electricity to power at \nleast 14,000 households a year.\n  Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas has the Nation's biggest \nphotovoltaic solar power system, which supplies 30 percent of the \nenergy needs at that base.\n  Henderson has Nevada's first solar home community, where each home \nhas a rooftop solar electric system that generates 4,400 kilowatts \nhours per year. And late last year, Ausra, Inc., selected Las Vegas as \nthe site of the first U.S. manufacturing plant for solar thermal power \nsystems.\n  The world's largest geothermal power producer is headquartered in \nReno.\n  And Nevada is home to the only associate degree program in the Nation \nin energy efficiency.\n  This is the innovative spirit that has powered American progress for \ncenturies and will continue to drive us toward energy security for the \n21st century and beyond. Renewable energy is a large part of that \nsecurity, and my renewable energy bill encourages further investment in \nall these technological advances.\n  I believe that energy efficiency is the key to increasing \nconservation of our nation's energy resources. For this reason, my \nbipartisan Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act contains a number of \nmeaningful incentives to put us on the path to greater energy \nefficiency and independence. My bill encourages Americans to make \nenergy efficiency improvements to their homes and businesses. This bill \nalso encourages appliance manufacturers to produce more energy-\nefficient appliances.\n  But we also need to grow America's energy supply so that our economy \nand our wallets are not in the hands of unpredictable and unyielding \nhostile nations. What can we do? We can open a new frontier in American \nenergy. I'm talking about responsible exploration in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, recoverable oil in deep-sea \nresources, opportunities with oil shale, a new era of nuclear energy, \nand a push toward clean coal.\n  I know these projects are controversial. When I first started \nconsidering exploration of ANWR, I had serious concerns. Proponents and \nopponents have been very vocal on this issue. I sought out neutral \ninformation so that I could make an informed decision. When you really \nget to the bottom of the debate over ANWR, you learn a few things.\n  Exploration of ANWR, which would not impact habitat and wildlife, \nwould be limited to a tiny area, roughly the size of a postage stamp on \na football field. With such a limited environmental impact, the benefit \nwould be great. ANWR could generate more than 10 billion barrels of \noil, enough to replace decades' worth of oil imports from Saudi Arabia. \nANWR alone could save the United States $40 billion dollars annually in \nmoney now spent buying oil from overseas. It would also create hundreds \nof thousands of jobs. Thirteen years ago, President Clinton vetoed \nlegislation that would have opened ANWR for exploration. If he had \nsigned it into law instead, 1 million barrels of domestic oil would be \nflowing into the United States every single day.\n\n  This is American oil that would create American jobs. I'd say that is \na much better investment than filling the coffers of countries that \ndespise America and use our money to further that hate.\n  And we can access more American energy through deep-sea exploration \nin the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This doesn't mean we set up oil \nrigs on our beaches and our shores. Development would take place at \nleast 50 miles offshore, well beyond the visibility from land and at \nthe discretion of coastal State Governors. Again, with very limited \nenvironmental impact, the benefit would be great.\n  There are about 8\\1/2\\ billion barrels of recoverable oil and 29.3 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas available through such deep-sea \nexploration.\n  Oil shale is another promising supply of American energy that could \nmake us more self-reliant and less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Oil \nshale can be mined and processed to generate oil. By far the largest \ndeposits of oil shale in the world are found in the United States in \nthe Green River Formation, which includes portions of Colorado, Utah, \nand Wyoming. If we estimate there are about 1.8 trillion barrels of oil \nfrom oil shale in the Green River Formation, it is three times greater \nthan the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. It is also important to \nnote that more than 70 percent of oil shale acreage in the Green River \nFormation is under federally owned land. Another positive attribute of \noil shale resources.\n  America has more than a 230-year supply also of coal. Making us the \nSaudi Arabia of coal. It would be irresponsible for us to ignore this \nvaluable resource that is abundant and affordable. With the progress \nbeing made in clean coal technology, we need coal to balance our energy \nportfolio and make us less dependent on Middle Eastern oil.\n  Another energy supply that we can take advantage of right here on \nAmerican soil is nuclear energy. America was once the leader in this \ntechnology, but we are so far behind today that if we don't make \ndrastic changes in our policy, we may never catch up.\n  Nuclear energy is clean and safe. It causes no air pollution, no \nwater pollution, and no ground pollution. Nuclear energy in the United \nStates has never caused a single injury or death. Unfortunately, only \n20 percent of our electricity is coming from nuclear reactors. Doesn't \nmake a whole lot of sense, does it?\n  We have several challenges when it comes to nuclear energy. President \nCarter outlawed nuclear recycling back in 1977. Another terrible blow \ncame with the requirement that all radioactive byproducts be disposed \nof in a nuclear waste repository. Today, Britain, France, and Russia \nare recycling their nuclear waste, negating the need for a \ncontroversial repository, like Yucca Mountain. France has actually used \nnuclear power to produce 80 percent of its electricity for the last 25 \nyears. France also manages to store all its high-level nuclear waste in \na single room.\n  On the other hand, lawmakers in the United States have been throwing \nbillions of dollars at a mountain in Nevada that is unsafe and unfit \nfor nuclear waste storage. And why on Earth would we bury material that \ncould be recycled into more energy? I also believe we must create \nincentives for the private sector to tackle the challenge of spent fuel \nstorage. We know that Yucca mountain is not an option. For this reason, \nI plan to introduce a bill to establish monetary prizes for \nachievements in the research, development, demonstration, and \ncommercial application of spent fuel storage alternatives. In the past, \nprized competitions have been very effective ways of encouraging \ncreative solutions to address difficult technological challenges.\n  Technology has led to tremendous progress when it comes to nuclear \nenergy, coal, and many other energy fronts. As ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee's Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and \nInnovation, I have had the opportunity to delve into the latest \nadvances, and they are exciting. I can tell you technology and \ninnovation will be keys to overcoming our energy challenges into the \nfuture. No other single road--renewable energy, conservation, domestic \nsupply--can get us there. But technology, together with these American \nenergy resources, will help lift us from the control of unconscionable \nnations.\n  These are the answers to our energy challenges, not some ill-\nconceived fantasy legislation called America's Climate Security Act, \nthat will only drive us into greater energy insecurity. We can, \nhowever, learn from history and if we open this Trojan horse, we \nshouldn't be surprised to be engulfed by hidden tax hikes, $5 dollar-a-\ngallon gasoline, and an army of new Washington bureaucrats.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n  Instead, let us put our resources into American ingenuity. The \ninnovation that has always come out of our inventors, scientists, and \nentrepreneurs will fuel our quest for energy security in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Preservation of our environment is not liberal or \n     conservative challenge, it's common sense.\n\n  We need to come together to address this issue because it impacts \nevery facet of our lives. I know that we can be champions of a \ncommonsense energy policy that is environmentally responsible as well \nas economically responsible. Let's not look back on another 13 years \nand wish we had acted today. The price for inaction is clearly too \nsteep.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding we have the floor \nuntil 4:36, if I am correct, which means I would not have time to make \na presentation I wish to make on the bill that was pending, the one \nthat we, fortunately, voted against cloture on earlier today. But let \nme make a couple comments, since I would not have time to do that.\n  First of all, I believe strongly that something wonderful happened \nlast Friday. We have been fighting this battle for so long. People have \nbeen saying manmade gases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, and \nmethane--were the major causes of climate change. I have to say, I \nbelieved that back 7 years ago, when I became chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. At that time we found out how \nmuch it would cost if we were to ratify the Kyoto treaty and live by \nits requirements. Fortunately, that amount we did not ratify.\n\n  As time went by, I noticed in 2005 we had the McCain-Lieberman bill, \nalso a cap-and-trade bill, which also tried to pin the problem on \nmanmade gases--CO2. I remember standing down here on the \nfloor and some of the proponents of the bill were down here. In 5 days, \nonly two Republicans from the Senate came down and joined me in this \nfight. It was lonely for 5 days. We explained to people, No. 1, the \nscience wasn't there; and, No. 2, the cost to the average American \nwould be comparable to a $330 billion tax increase.\n  Then I went back and looked at the tax increase of 1993. It was \ncalled the Clinton-Gore tax increase that was, at that time, the \nlargest tax increase in the last 20 years. That was only $32 billion, \nso this would have been 10 times greater than that tax increase.\n  Then of course we came up with the bill in 2005. After 5 days we \ndefeated it, but only two Republicans came down and joined me. I am so \ngratified that last week when we defeated the Lieberman-Warner bill, 25 \nMembers came down and showed that they were not afraid to stand and \ntell the truth about the causes of global warming--the accusation of \nglobal warming, because global warming has not been taking place now \nsince 2001. It never took place in the southern hemisphere. Last time I \nchecked, that was part of the globe.\n  The problem was that no one would come down, but last week they came \ndown, 25, and we defeated it. That would not have been comparable to an \nannual tax increase or cost to the public of $330 billion, as the Kyoto \ntreaty would have, it would have been some $471 billion--a huge tax \nincrease. But we did in our wisdom reject that. I feel very good about \nthat.\n  There is something that has not been said that I think is necessary \nto talk about and that is we knew this was coming. The Senator from \nNevada, Senator Ensign, talked about President Clinton's veto of the \nANWR opening, the bill that was in December of 1995. What he didn't say \nwas that we had voted in both October and November of 1995. The Senate \nvoted to implement a competitive leasing program for oil and gas \nexploration and the development and production within the coastal plain \nof ANWR. That was actually passed. It was passed again on November 17, \n1995. I will always remember that date because that is my birthday. It \nwas voted on. Then of course a month later the President vetoed it.\n  Right down on party lines, in both November and in October of 1995, \nthe Democrats voted against it, the Republicans all voted for it. \nRepublicans want to increase the supply of energy in America. Those \nwere three votes that show it. Again, in 2005--fast forward 10 more \nyears: on March 16, 2005, the Senate voted on an amendment to the \nbudget to strike expanding exploration on ANWR. The amendment to strike \nfailed, 49 to 51. All the Republicans voted for the exploration, all \nDemocrats voted against it.\n  Again, on November 3, 2005, 7 or 8 months later, the Senate voted on \nan amendment to prohibit oil and gas leasing on the coastal plain. The \namendment failed 48 to 51; 48 Republicans voted against it and 40 \nDemocrats voted for it.\n  June 2007--2 years later--the Senate voted on the Gas Price Act as an \namendment. That was mine. You could have all the exploration you want, \nall the oil and gas you want, but if you cannot refine it, you are not \ngoing to be able to use it, so the Gas Price Act, I thought, was pretty \ningenious. What we did was take those ailing communities that were \nadjacent to military communities, military bases that had been shut \ndown by the BRAC process, the Base Realignment and Closing process, and \nwould allow them to change that vacated area into refineries. It would \nsave a lot of money because the Federal Government wouldn't have to \nclean them up to the standards of playgrounds; they could just be to \nthe standards of refineries. It also provided that the Economic \nDevelopment Administration would provide grants so people would be able \nto start up refineries. It was killed right down party lines. Again \nthat was 2007.\n  Then in 2008, May 13 of 2008, the Senate voted on an amendment to \nexpand exploration in ANWR and to authorize drilling in offshore \ncoastal waters. Again, it failed down party lines. I could go on.\n  The next one I had was 2 days after that the Senate voted on a motion \nto instruct the budget conferees concerning increased exploration on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf.\n  What I am saying is this: The first thing we learn when we go to \nschool is that at least American symbols are very strong. They help us \nto understand that supply and demand is still alive and well in this \ncountry. It still means something. If we do not expand the supply of \nenergy in America, then the price is not going to go down, it is going \nto go up. That is exactly what the Democrats have done by refusing to \nlet us explore for oil and gas as well as nuclear, clean coal \ntechnology, and the other forms we need to use.\n  When it gets down to it, we know the cause of it. We know also we do \nnot want to use the Energy bill. I am very glad the Democrats' energy \nbill--which didn't have any energy in it, zero, none--went down. Now we \nwant an opportunity to introduce an amendment we have that does allow \nus to increase the availability and the amount of energy in America--\neither oil and gas, nuclear, or clean coal technology, and all the \nrest, wind, and all the renewables also. We need to do that. It is a \nsimple thing. We need to quit blaming each other. We know how we got to \nthis position. Now we need to change our behavioral pattern.\n  Americans right now realize--gas is $4 a gallon. I can assure you--I \nam not sure how it is in California and other States--in Oklahoma that \nis the No. 1 issue. In Oklahoma they understand supply and demand. We \nneed to understand it in this Chamber too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it my understanding the Democrats now have 30 minutes \nreserved? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I was interested to hear my friend from \nOklahoma, the ranking member on my Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, talk about how much the Republicans care about gas prices \nafter they just tanked our effort to deal with them. It is \nextraordinary what we are seeing here, right before the eyes of the \nAmerican people.\n  Last week they said ``no'' to global warming legislation. Global \nwarming is real. The Senator from Oklahoma reminds me of the people who \nkept saying: No, the Earth is flat. No, cigarettes don't cause cancer. \nHe is lining up with those people.\n  The vast majority of scientists tell us global warming is real. He \nbragged\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nabout how he beat us last week. Let me take a look at that. He said it \nwas a wonderful thing that happened on Friday, when the Senate didn't \nget 60 votes to continue the debate on global warming and address it. \nHe said it was a wonderful thing. I want to say to the 89 percent of \nthe American people, who believe global warming must be addressed, \nbecause it is a moral issue that is facing us, because we have to \nprotect this planet for our grandkids, because we need to get off \nforeign oil, have alternatives to foreign gas--and yes, in my State it \nis well over $4--we have to address it. He is celebrating the fact that \nwe fell short.\n  Let me tell you we fell short by only six votes. We fell short by six \nvotes. We had 46 Democrats for dealing with global warming now, plus 8 \nRepublicans--54. We needed 60. He is celebrating.\n  We are going to be celebrating come November because we are going to \nhave a President who is going to work with us on global warming \nlegislation and we are going to have six more votes here in the Senate, \nI can predict. Because my friends on the other side of the aisle--with \na few exceptions, very few--are fierce defenders of the status quo.\n  Let me repeat that. The leadership in the Republican Party and the \nvast majority of Republicans, save a handful, are fierce defenders of \nthe status quo. They say no to global warming legislation which will \nget us off foreign oil, which will get us off big oil. They say no, \ntoday, to going after the speculators, going after big oil, making them \ndisgorge some of that money so we can invest it in alternatives; going \nafter OPEC and saying: If you are colluding, you are going to be held \naccountable.\n  They said: No, no, no. Yes, to the status quo; no to positive change \nfor the American people.\n  They come down to the floor and they are happy about it. It is \nunbelievable to me.\n  The wonderful thing that did happen on Friday is we reached a high \nwater mark. We reached 54 votes. The last vote on the global warming \nbill, it was 38.\n  The even more wonderful part is out of the people who were absent, \nwho sent in letters who said they were with us, were the two \nPresidential candidates. So all that talk about celebrating the fact \nthat we stopped global warming legislation is kind of a death rattle, \nin my opinion, for those people who do not believe they have to address \nthis challenge of our generation.\n  I am looking at the young people here today, their beautiful faces. \nThey deserve to have a good life in the future. I want to say to them \ntoday: You are here in an historic time because the window is closing \nfor action. With global warming, if you don't act, you lose valuable \ntime, because the carbon stays in the atmosphere for so long it becomes \nmore difficult to get it out of the atmosphere.\n  Last week we came up six votes short even though we reached a high \nwater mark on the bill. At the end of the day we now have a roadmap for \nchange--46 Democrats voted yes to tackle global warming, 8 Republicans \nvoted yes. What does that tell you about the two parties?\n  When I took the gavel in January after the Democrats took back this \nmajority by only the slimmest of margins, I said I wanted to put global \nwarming on the map because under the leadership of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle we did nothing to address it. The President has \nbasically--and we know this for sure--interfered with the scientists in \nhis own administration and not allowed the facts to be told. So we had \n25 hearings.\n  The second thing I wanted to do is make it bipartisan. John Warner \nsaid, ``I am with you. I care about my grandkids. I care about national \nsecurity.'' The Naval Academy did a very important study that this is \ngoing to be the No. 1 cause of wars in the future as we have desperate \nrefugees running away from droughts and famine and flooding and all the \nrest, and rising sea levels. When John Warner came across, I knew I had \naccomplished that. He did it for me. He made it bipartisan.\n  Then we got the strong bill out of the committee, we improved it, we \ngot it to the floor, and we knew it had a lot of work. We got a letter \nfrom 10 people who voted for it who said: Look, Senator, and Harry \nReid, we need to work on it. We understand that is what we have to do \nwhen our next President says let's go, let's get a bill through. So I \nthink it is appalling that my ranking member of the Environment \nCommittee would come down here and celebrate the fact that we were not \nable to move forward on global warming legislation, and furthermore \nsaid it is not real. He brought that out again.\n  I do thank those who engaged in the debate, both pro and con. It was \na landmark debate. I only regret that the Republicans filibustered and \nwe had to take the bill off the floor because we could have gotten a \nvery good bill. It was a very good bill to start with and we could have \nworked on it and made it even better.\n  But, come November, we will see whether I am right or wrong. I think \nI will be right. One of the reasons I am right, and I believe we will \nhave Senators here who are going to be hospitable to global warming \nlegislation, is because we also need Senators who are hospitable to \ndoing something about gas prices.\n  This is an amazing chart. Since George Bush got into office--do we \nremember this? He and Dick Cheney were oil men. One of the reasons they \nurged for getting elected is: We know how to deal with the oil \ncompanies; leave it to us. We know how to deal with the Saudi Arabian \nprinces; leave it to us. We will deal with it.\n  They dealt with it. There was a 250-percent increase in the price of \ngas--$3.94. This is old. It is now $4. This I used last week. It is \nalready old; today it is $4. In my State it is about $4.40. You can't \nkeep up with the increases in the price of gas. This is what we are \nfacing.\n  So in the Senate today we said: All right, they said no to global \nwarming legislation--which was a long-term answer to big oil.\n  What we would have done is we would have had a cap-and-trade system \nthat would have put a price on carbon, gone between the free \nmarketplace, and that would have led to trillions of dollars, I say to \nmy friend, trillions of dollars in investments by the private sector, \ncellulosic fuel, automobiles that get 150 miles per gallon, electric \ncars, all the rest. That is the long-term solution pushing down demand. \nWe all know that. Pushing down demand.\n  Now, the other side will say if you drill in a wildlife refuge it \nwill solve your problems. No, it is false. Put aside that Dwight \nEisenhower, a Republican President, set aside the Alaskan Wildlife \nRefuge and said this is a precious gift from God; set it aside. What \nare you going to do to God's creatures by drilling over there? Forget \nit.\n  Put it aside for the moment and talk about what you get. You get 6 \nmonths' worth of oil. You cannot drill your way out of this. Someone \nsaid--I think it was Senator Menendez who made a great analogy. He \nsaid: Everybody says we are addicted to oil. Even our own President \nsays we are addicted to oil. Let's say someone was addicted to drugs. \nIs the way to get them off drugs to give them 6 months' more worth of \ndrugs? Does that help? No. No. No.\n  We need to figure out a way to get off of foreign oil, get away from \nbig oil, because we know the developing nations are gobbling it up. And \nwe also know we have done so little, so little to address the issue of \nenergy efficiency, fuel technology. It is a sad thing. We have lost so \nmuch time.\n  Today at gas stations across the Nation, the American people are \nsuffering. They are facing sticker shock. They are having to choose, \nchoose between something they might buy at the store for dinner and \nfilling up the tank. That is a fact. That is a fact.\n  I will never forget when Vice President Cheney first sat down for his \nclosed-door meetings with oil executives and energy industry lobbyists, \nand we said: We want to know what you are talking about, Mr. Vice \nPresident. What is going on behind those closed doors?\n  And he said: Oh, I am working to make energy affordable.\n  You know what gas was? It was $1.50. That is when he sat down with \nhis friends in oil companies. We cannot find out what they talked \nabout, but I can tell you this: Whatever they talked about was good for \nthem, was good for the oil companies, was good for big oil. Gas is \n$4.40 a gallon in many California locations. I have seen gas prices as \nhigh as $5 in my State. So we have secret meetings with Dick Cheney \nwith\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\nthe energy people, and gas went up 250 percent.\n  Again, these are old numbers. It is even worse. Gas went up 82 cents \nsince January--82 cents since January. Again, it is even more than that \nnow. It is way more than that, close to 90 cents.\n  In every case, you see the Bush administration saying they are going \nto do something. They never did anything. A lot of talk, a lot of yack, \na lot of visits with Saudi Arabia, a lot of kissing on the cheek with \nthe princes, holding hands. We saw the picture. What happened? This. \nStraight up. Two oil men in the White House. Is it any wonder?\n  Many of us said at the time, other people said: It is terrific, two \noil men at the White House. They will know how to deal with the oil \ncompanies. Well, they sure knew how to deal with the oil companies. The \noil companies never had it so good. And my Republican friends right \nhere, with few exceptions, have fallen all over themselves to give \nthose very same companies huge tax breaks, even as they are making \nrecord profits.\n  Listen to this: Last year the oil companies pocketed $124 billion in \nprofits, up from $29 billion in 2002. That means they have quadrupled \ntheir profits since 2002, four times. Let's think about it, America. \nWhat happened to your salary? Did your salary quadruple? I think we \nknow the answer to that.\n  We know Americans are losing ground. The average family is losing \nground, thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Their salaries are not \nkeeping up with inflation. The price of gas is out of sight. It is hard \nfor them to get health care. Health care costs are out of sight. Food \nprices are going up. Everything is going up--tuition.\n  But what do my friends on the other side say? They want to give oil \ncompanies these great big tax breaks. They did in 2004 and 2005. \nBelieve it or not, they gave them tax breaks worth over $17 billion \nover the next decade. And these tax breaks are free and clear. We did \nnot even say--they did not say in the legislation oil companies have to \ninvest in renewables, improving infrastructure, increasing capacity. \nNo. You know what they did with the money? They spent $185 billion on \nstock buybacks instead of investing in clean, alternative fuels or new \nrefinery utilization.\n  And as my friend in the chair said today, they are spending more on \npublic relations than the average family spends in a lifetime because \nthey know, when the American people really understand this, what the \nAmerican people will think. Have you seen those beautiful commercials \nby the oil companies? We really care. We are doing so much.\n  Do you think they are doing all of these wonderful things? No, most \nof the money is spent on buying back their stock.\n  Unchecked speculation. I have heard some experts say that about one-\nthird of the price of oil a barrel is due to speculation. We tried to \npass a bill today that, first of all, said to the oil companies: That \nis the end of your break. You need to either invest your profits in the \nfuture, in other technologies, or give it back to us, and we will do it \non behalf of the American people.\n  They said no. They will protect big oil until they have to pay the \npolitical price. Protect big oil, protect foreign oil. They protect \nforeign oil, OPEC. We said the Attorney General should be able to sue a \nforeign company or foreign country if they colluded on the price of \noil. Oh, no, they could not do that to big oil either. They are in love \nwith big oil over there. They are in love with foreign oil.\n\n  My people are saying: Enough is enough is enough is enough. It is no \nwonder that the American people want change, and they are going to get \nchange. They are going to get it in November. They are going to bring \nit to us. They are going to bring us change.\n  The former oil men in the Bush administration have been uninterested \nin taking on the unchecked speculation. This vote reflects the \nadministration. That is it. They all marched together.\n  Well, I think they are marching off a plank. The American people are \nsmart and getting smarter every day. They know the pain they are \nfeeling at the pump has a cost. They understand the speculation on \nfutures. We address that. We address that in the legislation on which \nthey voted no.\n  We said: You cannot take money and speculate on futures in an out-of-\ntown market, an out-of-country market. You have to have transparency. \nOh, no, they do not want transparency. That would be bad for the oil \ncompanies.\n  If anyone ever says to you: There is no difference between Democrats \nand Republicans, look at the debate we had on global warming, look at \nthe vote on global warming, and look at the vote we had today. There is \nan enormous difference. And it has to do with whose side you are on. In \nthe case today, it was are you on the side of big oil and foreign oil \nor are you on the side of the American people? It is pretty clear.\n  You have to look at Iraq. We have been in Iraq more than 5 long \nyears. Do you remember what President Bush said when he went in? He \nsaid Iraqi oil would pay for the reconstruction of Iraq. He did. And \nlook at what we have spent on this war. We are going broke on this war. \nWe are into it longer than we were in World War II.\n  We are looking at trillions of dollars at the end of the day in the \nactual cost of the war, the cost of the reconstruction, the cost of \ntaking care of our beautiful, brave, courageous, and incomparable men \nand women who are coming home in desperate shape.\n  What happened to George Bush's promise? They stand up, we stand down. \nWell, I think they are standing up. Why are we not standing down? And \nwhy did the oil not work out? Why were we not able to pay for \nreconstruction from the price of the oil?\n  It is very simple: We have had a destabilization in the region \nbecause of the war, and that contributed to these high oil prices. What \na disaster--a disaster, a disaster, a disaster.\n  We would have today, had we had the opportunity to move forward on \nour legislation, not only sent a signal which could have done \nsomething, we could have investigated these companies for the kinds of \nillegal actions I believe some of them are taking. We could have gone \nafter companies and countries for collusion. We could have gone after \nthese excess profits and said: Look, we want everyone to do well, but \nlet's have some fairness. I will tell you, the American people are not \ngoing to stand for it.\n  So we have had a very interesting few days. And my friend, the \nranking member from Oklahoma, says how he is so excited. Friday was his \nbest day--his best day--his best day--when a majority of the Senate \nsaid, yes, let's take up global warming legislation, and he opposed it.\n  His days are numbered on this point. All we need is six more Senators \nwho are different than the many on the other side, and we are going to \nget that. People want this. We know 89 percent of the people want us to \naddress global warming.\n  When we do it in the right way, we will send a signal that America is \nready to lead. America is ready to work with the world so that we get \noff of foreign oil. We are not dependent on countries we do not want to \nbe dependent on; we are not dependent on big companies that can care \nless about our families. They do not care one whit about our families. \nThe executives are making millions and millions and millions of dollars \nevery year on salaries, on bonuses, on expense accounts.\n  Well, the average family in America is struggling. So I hope the \nAmerican people are watching. Last week we had a monumental vote, the \nhigh water mark. But they stopped us. Today, we had a good vote also, \nbut they stopped us. They stopped us from doing anything about gas \nprices, and their answer is drill in a wildlife reserve which, at most, \ngives us 6 months of oil, and, by the way, destroys a gift from God \nthat a Republican President said is not an answer.\n  That is feeding the addiction. Are there places in America we could \ndrill? Yes, there are. But what we need is a whole different long-term \nstrategy. And that long-term strategy and fighting global warming will \nthrow us off this dependance. That will make us a leader in the world. \nThat will create green jobs, technologies we can export, and we will \nhave an economic renaissance in the Nation.\n  We will be the leader the world again when it comes to the \nenvironment and the good-paying jobs. In the short\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nterm, we need to go after the speculators like we wanted to do today. \nWe need to go after companies and countries who are colluding. These \nare the things we need to do.\n  We were ready, willing, and able to do it today. In closing I will \nsay this: Whose side are you on? That is a question that every one of \nus has to ask ourselves. It ought to be: I am on the side of the \nAmerican people, of America's families, of America's middle class, who \nis getting squeezed.\n  It ought not be: I am on the side of big oil. And my Republican \nfriends on the other side again, on the vote last week and this vote, \nhave chosen sides. And the American people will decide who they want to \nhave leading the country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have had some unusual developments in \nthe Senate in recent days. No sooner had the majority in the Senate \nmoved to the cap-and-trade bill, for which they were demanding the \ndebate be limited and utilizing a procedure by the Democratic majority \nleader to basically fill the tree, which eliminates free debate of \namendments on the bill--this was a piece of legislation that was \nclaimed to be one of the most important to be offered in the Senate.\n  In the early 1990s, when the clean air act amendments were passed, \n131 amendments were disposed of during that debate, and it took 5 weeks \non the floor. This bill has more far-reaching and pernicious \nramifications than the Clean Air Act Amendments. Yet they were going to \nend the debate and begun to spin the issue as if the Republicans were \nfilibustering the bill. That is what they said repeatedly: Republicans \nwere filibustering the bill. But in truth we wished to talk about the \nbill. We asked to be able to do so and use the 30 hours which Senate \nrules allow to discuss the legislation, and our request was treated \nwith great horror, as if this were somehow a plan to reject a \ndiscussion of the legislation.\n  Well, no sooner had we done that and gotten through that, and the \nmajority leader filled the tree to limit real amendments on the bill--\namendments he did not approve--then, the majority leader came forward \nand moved to move off the bill, to move away from cap and trade--the \ncenterpiece of their philosophy about what is happening in energy in \nAmerica today--and he wanted to move to their Energy bill, which I \nthink can legitimately be referred to, in utilizing senatorial license, \nas a no-energy bill. I will talk about that in a minute.\n  It is not an energy bill. It is not going to produce any energy. It \nis weak to a degree that is breathtaking. It is not what the American \npeople are upset about. It would not come close to helping us deal with \nthe serious problems we face.\n  So I would say, this is a weird kind of event here. The no-energy \nbill I understand they would like to move to--and wanted to move to--\nwould authorize the U.S. Government to sue OPEC nations that are \nwithholding and reducing supplies of oil on the world market in the way \nwe would sue an American company that was manipulating the market by \nwithholding products or otherwise colluding to fix prices. Now, that is \nexactly what OPEC is doing. What they are doing is unacceptable, and it \nneeds sustained, relentless leadership by this administration and this \nCongress to stand up to OPEC and confront that because they are \neffectively raising the price of oil by restricting supply. I \nunderstand other nations are seeing declines in production as well, \nincluding Mexico and Russia. So we are creating shortages in the \nmarketplace, allowing people to make large amounts of money--\ncorporations and others--but the people who are primarily making the \nmoney are oil-producing nations. Go look at the skyscrapers they are \nbuilding in the desert, the billions and billions of dollars they are \nreceiving from us as a result of these high prices, as a result of \ntripling the price of oil on the world marketplace from the forties \njust a couple years ago to now over $130 a barrel. So you were getting \n$40 for each barrel of oil one year, and a couple years later you are \nnow getting $130 for each barrel in your small country. The bigger \ncountries, of course, make more money because they produce and sell \nmore oil.\n  We are sending overseas each year from our Nation $500 billion a year \nto purchase the oil that comes into our country. It is half the trade \ndeficit we have--half of it--just to purchase this oil. It is not \ngetting better, and we have no policy before us to legitimately do \nsomething about this other than the one Senator Domenici and Senator \nMcConnell and the Republican leadership offered a few weeks ago, which \nwas rejected.\n  Let me explain what this no-energy bill and its NOPEC provision would \ndo. We would sue OPEC nations for refusing to increase their \nproduction. Now, how you get jurisdiction over a sovereign nation--the \nPresiding Officer, a former attorney general, as I have been in a \nprevious life, knows jurisdiction may sound like a little thing. It is \nnot such a little thing to get jurisdiction over a sovereign nation to \norder them to produce more oil out of their ground.\n  But I would submit to you, the idea is so weak and so implausible and \nso unenforceable that it would be a laughable thing if it were not so \nserious because we do have a problem with OPEC nations and others who \nare fixing the price of oil.\n  See, oil production is an essential part, I would suggest--and I \nthink most any court would conclude--of sovereignty. A sovereign nation \ncan produce as much of its oil as it wants to produce. You cannot make \nthem produce more oil because you would like them to. They are not like \nan American corporation, subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Part \nof the protections of the laws of America, they become subject to \nlawsuits--but not a foreign nation.\n  We do not want them suing us to say: You ought to open ANWR--or \nperhaps we might. Open Alaska. Open offshore. Now, that has, perhaps, a \nlawsuit that might have some merit. Or maybe sue the Congress for \nvoting not to produce more oil and gas off our shores over the years. \nAt least you could get jurisdiction over Congress.\n  So this is not a serious response, I will say to you. It is not.\n  Now, in addition, they propose in this Energy bill to tax the oil \ncompanies, but taxing the oil companies will not produce more energy. \nYou can take this to the bank. It is a concept of universal acceptance. \nWhen you tax something, you get less of it. What we need in this \ncountry is more energy, not less. We need more cleanly produced, clean \nAmerican energy. That is what we need more of. That is what people are \ncomplaining to me about.\n  When I go back home and talk to my constituents, they are upset. They \nare outraged. According to the national reports that came out \nyesterday, the people in my home county in Alabama--the citizens \nthere--pay a larger percentage of their income to buy gasoline than any \nother county in America. It is because they are rural, they have low \nwages. They do not compete with the big-city wages, and they have to \ntravel so far to work.\n  That is a very painful thing. It brings it home to me personally. I \nfilled up our smaller car this weekend, and it cost $61. People have \nlarger cars. They bought them years ago. They cannot just go out and \nsell their SUV today--what price would they get?--sell it so they could \nbuy some Prius. Where are they going to get the money to do that? We \nwould like them to. We would like them to move to those kinds of \nvehicles in the future, but it is not possible today.\n  So the ``masters of the universe'' who think we can pass a bill and \nallow the price of energy to be exceedingly high and that the people \nwill adjust their habits so they can reduce the price of oil, are not \nin the real world. Let's get with it.\n  I tell you, my constituents are unhappy, and they want us to do \nsomething to confront, in a realistic way, the surge of prices that are \nimpacting their budgets very seriously. They also understand these \nrising prices that are taking money out of their budget are also \nimpacting the businesses they deal with and see and, perhaps, work for \nand it is making us less competitive in the\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nworld marketplace and it places us in a position to see our economy \nsink in general and it puts at risk their job. It affects how many \nhours they might work a week and whether they can get overtime or \nwhether they get a bonus. That is what people are worried about.\n  So what do we have before us? A cap-and-trade bill that is \nguaranteed, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, to drive \nup the cost of gasoline $1.40 a gallon to meet Kyoto-type agreements we \ndid not sign and we have not approved. That is not what people are \ntelling me they want us to do. They want us to produce more clean \nAmerican energy.\n  Well, I hate to be partisan about this, but I think we need to talk \nabout how we got here, what happened in this country to get us in as \nbad a shape as we are. The trends have not been good in terms of a \nrising demand for oil and energy and a not-rising-so-fast supply, but \nthere are things we could and should have done and some things we did 2 \nyears ago that are being reversed.\n\n  In 2005, for example, this Congress, when Senator Pete Domenici \nchaired the Energy Committee, recognized the potential of oil shale in \nthe Energy Policy Act that became law. The act identified oil from the \nshale rock out in the West as a strategically important asset and \ncalled for its development. Yet, last year, the Democratic-controlled \nCongress, led by the House of Representatives, put in language that \nblocked and reversed the development of this abundant resource despite \nthe surging price of oil and gasoline.\n  In the recently passed Energy Independence and Security Act, the \nHouse-sponsored section 526 prohibits any Federal agency from \ncontracting to procure any alternative or synthetic fuel that produces \ngreater life cycle greenhouse gas emissions than those produced from \ntraditional fuels. This language prohibits the Federal Government from \ncontracting to produce and use oil shale and coal-to-liquids. This \nprovision is misguided and should be repealed immediately.\n  Now, let me tell my colleagues--I know the Presiding Officer is \nfamiliar with a number of these issues--a representative of U.S. Air \nForce was in my office a few weeks ago discussing a contract they had \nwith a company that would take coal--we have 250 years of coal in \nAmerica. It is an American energy source. You can heat that coal and \noff comes a gas which can be converted through a known and proven \nprocess to a liquid, and they were going to use it in their airplanes \nto fly U.S. aircraft with it. But the Air Force representative told me \nthe language in section 526 had blocked them. Coal-to-liquids derived \nfuel is a fabulously clean fuel. It actually cleans the engine, so when \nyou use this fuel, the pollutants and waste products have been taken \nout, and it is a very pure fuel they burn, and the Air Force was \nexpecting to be able to bring this fuel into the U.S. Department of \nDefense for around $85 a barrel. That is well below the more-than-$130 \na barrel cost that is on the world marketplace today, and it is a \nsource of energy that does not leave the U.S. Air Force dependent on \nforeign sources of oil to fuel our Nation's aircraft in the defense of \nAmerica. But this effort has been blocked by the Democratic majority.\n  The 2005 Energy Policy Act, which Senator Domenici led when he was \nchairman of the Energy Committee, also directed the Bureau of Land \nManagement to lease Federal lands for oil shale research projects. \nThere are approximately 1.8 trillion barrels of oil in oil shale rock, \nbut it is hard to get out. It is not easy to get out. It takes some \neffort to produce that, but some major companies are prepared to invest \nbillions of dollars to prove that it can be brought out well below the \ncurrent world price of oil. I would have thought we would have been \ndelighted to see this go forward--at least in an experimental way--and \nsee how that would work out. But oh, no. This Congress, again with a \nDemocratic majority, acted to block the development and the carrying \nout of this provision that would promote oil shale. The Senate-\nsponsored section 433 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act--this was \nthe monumental appropriations bill that was about this thick. They \nslipped language in, in conference, to take care of that. It would \nprohibit funds from being used to implement any leasing program \ndirected to the Bureau of Land Management, as had been approved in \n2005, effectively stopping this program.\n  I will just say that is frustrating. We are sort of in a manner of \ndisconnect here to an extraordinary degree. The American people want us \nto do something. Oil shale: Well, it is not going to be easy, but this \nis not a dreamland idea. It absolutely can work. One company is using \nthe same technology that was used by the oil sands industry in Canada \nthat has proven to be quite commercially feasible. We need to be \ntesting this because 1.8 trillion barrels of oil in oil shale would be \nenough for 100 years of oil--actually, 200 years of oil at our current \nrate. So oil shale, if we could make that breakthrough, would make us \ncompletely independent of foreign oil. We have huge reserves offshore, \nas the Senator from Louisiana knows. He is out there. He is in \nLouisiana, and he sees the production that survived Hurricane Katrina, \nand as a result, we were able to get those systems back on line with no \noil spills or damage to the environment.\n  I thank the Chair for letting me share this frustration. I don't know \nwhere we are going now, but I know one thing: This Congress does not \nneed to leave this energy debate without creating some policies that \nallow for more production of clean American energy. We can do that. We \nare going to continue using oil and gas for many years to come. Why in \nthe world would we want 60-plus percent of it to be foreign oil? Why \nwouldn't we want to at least produce what we can at home--and really we \ncan produce quite a lot at home. It is very frustrating that attempts \nto do that have been blocked by persons whose thinking, I believe, on \nthis issue is confused and not in the public interest.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in the year 64 A.D., there was a \ntremendous fire in Rome, and legend has it that the Emperor Nero \nfiddled while Rome burned. Well, I am afraid that if we continue to \nfiddle in the Congress while gas prices continue to go up and up and \nhurt all of our constituents in a deep abiding way, Nero will outpace \nus in terms of his legendary action compared to our inaction.\n  We are truly fiddling while this enormous crisis of rising gasoline \nprices hits every family we purport to represent. We are doing nothing \nsignificant, nothing important to address this crisis.\n  Why do I say that? Well, when this new Democratically led Congress \ntook office a couple of Januaries ago, prices at the pump were about \n$2.33. That new leadership of the Congress--the Democratic leader in \nthe Senate as well as the Democratic leadership in the House--said that \nthis was unacceptable. They vowed that this was a major issue they \nwould address, that they would attack in a focused, meaningful way. \nWell, a year and a half later, things have changed. The price at the \npump is now about $4 a gallon. It has gone up and up, and this Congress \nhas done little to nothing.\n  To add insult to injury, the Democratic leadership in the Senate \nproposed legislation today that centered around major measures that can \nclearly change the price at the pump, such as a windfall profits tax \nand language to sue OPEC. I find this insulting, and I believe the \nAmerican people do, because that sort of political demagoguery and \nposturing is no substitute for real energy policy.\n  Yesterday, I was in my home State of Louisiana. I had two townhall \nmeetings. About a week before that, I was all around the State; I had \nnine others. Folks asked again and again: When is Congress going to \nact? When is Congress going to do something meaningful about these \nescalating gasoline prices? I laid out my ideas. They were reacted to \nin a very positive way, particularly the need for us to do more for \nourselves right here at home to produce more energy.\n  Certainly nobody in those audiences had very kind words to say about \nOPEC. Nobody was standing up and lauding the big oil companies. But by \nthe same token, they know the difference between political rhetoric and \nposturing and real energy policy. They certainly know that a bill to \nsue OPEC and try to impose a Carter-era windfall\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nprofits tax on big oil companies isn't going to do a darn thing, at \nleast on the positive side of the equation, to stabilize and lower \ngasoline prices at the pump. It is going to have no meaningful impact, \ncertainly, to produce more energy and bring those prices down.\n  So I come to the floor to urge all of us--Democrats and Republicans--\nto come together to get real and to act in the face of what is a true \neconomic crisis for millions upon millions of American families.\n  As I say, it is easy to agree that OPEC or big oil is a cheap \npolitical target. It is easy to agree that it may be popular \nsuperficially to kick them around and to politically bash those easy \ntargets. But I truly believe the American people are smarter than that \nand can distinguish between political posturing, political rhetoric, \nand a real energy policy. I think it is particularly true with the \nwindfall profits tax proposed by the Democratic leadership today.\n  Now, why do I say that is not a real energy policy and it won't lead \nto stabilizing and reducing prices? Well, there are three main reasons:\n  First, the entire notion of a windfall profits tax is a misnomer. Oil \ncompany profits are very big when you look at them in dollar terms. Why \nis that? Mostly for one simple reason: Oil company activity--\nexploration and production--is enormously expensive. As a result of \nthat, the major oil companies are enormously big companies--big \neconomic actors--so the dollar terms we bandy about having to do with \ntheir activity is enormous. But, of course, when you talk about profit, \nyou can't talk in simple dollar terms; you have to talk in percentages.\n  So what are those percentages? Are they, in fact, windfall profits? \nWell, the last year for which we have data is full calendar year 2007, \nand in that calendar year oil and gas companies' profits were, on \naverage, 8.3 percent. How does that compare to everybody else? Well, \nfor all of the U.S. manufacturing sector--a sector we always decry as \nin decline, being outsourced, being out-competed by competitors such as \nChina and India coming on line--that entire sector had a profit of \nabout 7.3 percent. If you take out U.S. auto companies, which have \nhistorically low profits, unfortunately, then the entire U.S. \nmanufacturing sector made a profit of 8.9 percent. So these outrageous \nwindfall profits folks talk about of the oil companies are, in fact, \nvery much in line with that: the whole manufacturing sector, 7.3 \npercent compared to 8.3 percent. Take out auto manufacturers, and, in \nfact, then the profit rate is higher, 8.9 percent compared to 8.3 \npercent.\n  The second reason this entire focus and argument is silly and not \nreal energy policy is when you look at whom you are hurting. Now, the \nproponents of these sorts of measures talk about going after windfall \nprofits as if oil company executives own it all. Well, they own some--\n1.5 percent of the companies we are talking about. Who owns the rest? \nWell, over half of oil company shares are owned by mutual fund \ncompanies which are widely owned by Americans. That manages to account \nfor nearly 55 million American households. Median income of these \nhouseholds, by the way, is $70,000 or less.\n  Pension funds, both public and private, hold 27 percent of the shares \nin the energy industry. That means 129 million pension fund \nparticipants, who have accounts worth an average of about $63,000, own \nthe companies we are talking about. Twenty-eight million of those \npension funds are for public employees, including teachers, police, \nfire personnel, soldiers, and government workers. So these are the \nfolks who own these companies that we are supposed to go after.\n  The final and most important and compelling reason this notion of a \nwindfall profits tax is a red herring is that it won't produce more \nenergy. It won't stabilize or lower prices at the pump. It won't help \nthe situation. It will, in fact, make it worse.\n  Why do I say this? Because we have historical experience to turn to \nto see what happened. Under President Carter, we tried this experiment. \nIn terms of boosting energy production, stabilizing or lowering prices, \nit was a miserable failure. From 1980 to 1988, we had a windfall \nprofits tax. That reduced domestic oil production by up to 8 percent, \nwhile dependence on foreign oil grew over that time up to 13 percent.\n  So instead of this sort of tax approach to the oil companies' tax \napproach to energy, we need to produce more energy, more supply, to \nstabilize and lessen prices. As my colleague from Alabama mentioned a \nfew minutes ago, one of the first rules of economics is, if you tax an \nactivity, you are going to drive it down, lessen that activity; you are \nnot going to drive it up.\n  If somehow this tax plan--windfall profits tax--or the myriad other \ntax proposals the Democratic leadership has brought to the floor would \nhelp solve our energy problems, I would be all for it. But it is going \nto make us produce less energy, not more. What will that do? That won't \nstabilize or lower gasoline prices at the pump. It will drive them up.\n  Let's get serious for once. As the American families we represent \nface a true crisis, let's put people ahead of politics. Let's put sound \npolicy ahead of political posturing. Let's focus on what can make a \npositive impact. We need to do much in this regard, on the supply side \nas well as the demand side--conservation, greater efficiency, more R, \nand new fuel sources. But at the same time we need to focus on the \ndemand side, on what can help us produce more safe, clean energy here \nat home. We have those resources here at home. We can access them \nsafely and in an environmentally friendly way. But in order to do that, \nCongress needs to get out of the way and allow States and private \nindustry to do just that.\n  Offshore is a big piece of that puzzle. That is why I have brought to \nthe Senate floor my proposal that says if these outrageous prices at \nthe pump actually hit $5 a gallon, then we will allow exploration and \nproduction in our ocean bottoms off our U.S. coast--but only if two \nthings apply: First, the host State involved would have to want this \nactivity. So the Governor and State legislature in that host State \nwould have to say, yes, we want this activity off of our coast, we want \nto be part of the solution to help meet the Nation's energy needs. \nSecondly, that host State would get a fair share of the royalty, or \nrevenue, from that ocean bottom production, 37\\1/2\\ percent, building \non the precedent, the policy we set 2 years ago in opening some limited \nnew areas in the Gulf of Mexico. That actually does something about \nenergy. That actually would increase supply right here at home, would \nlessen our dependence on dangerous foreign sources, would help \nstabilize and bring down prices at the pump--something the political \nposturing of suing OPEC or putting in a windfall profits tax, a Carter-\nera idea, on the big oil companies would not do.\n  Let's not fiddle while Rome burns. Let's get serious. Let's act \nrespectfully to the situation, the real crisis so many Americans face. \nLet's come together in a bipartisan way and act, not posture, and \ndebate and talk but act with real energy solutions. We need to do this, \nas I said, across the board, on the supply side and on the demand side \nto lessen demand through conservation, increased fuel efficiency, and \nnew energy sources.\n  We need to come together and act now, rather than simply giving \npolitical speeches and endlessly posturing and going after easy \npolitical targets.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about American \nenergy independence, energy self-sufficiency, and specifically to talk \nabout clean coal and clean coal technology.\n  I have introduced a number of constructive amendments to the \nLieberman-Warner climate change legislation. But one of the most \nimportant of those was the need to address the future of clean coal \ntechnology.\n  If this body chooses to pursue cap-and-trade legislation, we need to \nensure that the Senate includes provisions to bring about the energy \nsecurity our Nation needs. The so-called cap-and-trade legislation \nwould impose greenhouse gas emissions and mandates that are unrealistic \nin scope and in timing.\n  In a time of high energy prices, in a time of housing deflation, in a \ntime of food inflation, taxpayers cannot afford misguided policies that \nhamstring our economy. Our competitors--India and\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nChina--are not constraining their economies with carbon limits. Global \nissues deserve global responses. Blindly imposing Government \nregulations will force heavy burdens on utility consumers, on labor, \nand on American families.\n  Last week, the record was clearly laid out that this proposal raises \nconsumer prices through Government mandates. I believe most Americans \nfavor policy approaches that balance America's need for energy with \nenvironmental protection.\n  In order to avoid substantial economic fallout, Federal funding is \nnot only warranted to help American commerce meet this challenge, it is \nessential.\n  Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies, \nAmerica cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is \nabundant. Coal is affordable. Coal is reliable. Coal is secure as an \nenergy source. Coal can also become a very clean fuel.\n  As noted in the May 30 front-page article in the New York Times, \nAmerica will continue to rely heavily on coal-fired electric generation \nfor decades to come. The New York Times reporters are merely \nrecognizing what is abundantly evident from official Government \npredictions.\n  The article also aptly notes that coal-fired generation holds great \npromise for reduced carbon dioxide emissions. America's energy policy \nmust not simply deliver sustainable energy; America's energy future \nmust incorporate a vision for a safer, cleaner, and healthier \nenvironment. Clean, coal-fired electric generation must be an integral \npart.\n  The challenge before us is significant. Reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions from coal-fired powerplants will be possible through first \ncapturing carbon dioxide emissions and then sequestering them \nunderground. Both will take time and both will take money.\n  In order to achieve this challenge, the Federal Government and \nprivate industry must partner in funding research and technological \ninnovation. Timing is critical. America needs to make a serious and \nsubstantial investment in research and developing commercial \ntechnology.\n  In order to achieve energy security and a clean environment, the \nFederal Government must demonstrate its commitment with targeted, \nupfront financial support. We must show leadership, not merely dictate \nflawed policies and hope for the best.\n\n  What does this mean? If Congress mandates reduced emissions, it is \nincumbent upon us to also provide the policies to allow our own economy \nto succeed.\n  Proven, commercially available, cost-effective technologies must be \ndeveloped with respect to carbon capture and sequestration. These \ntechnologies must be efficient, effective, and allow America to \ncontinue to compete globally.\n  The amendment I have filed would direct $50 billion in revenue from \nemission allowances--$40 billion for the demonstration and deployment \nfor carbon capture technologies, and $10 billion for large-scale \ngeologic carbon storage demonstration projects.\n  This is an enormous investment, but it is also necessary. This \namendment is technology neutral. It would not rely on Government to \ndictate the favored type of carbon capture mechanism. Incentives would \nbe provided by the choice of the recipient as a loan guarantee, through \nincremental cost sharing, or in the form of electricity production \npayments for each kilowatt hour produced.\n  This amendment includes aggressive but achievable technological \nmilestones. It also establishes a timeline for new projects over the \nnext 7, 8, or 10 years. This amendment is reasonable, rational, \naggressive, and achievable.\n  Making this investment comes down to a choice between two things: \none, Congress taking responsibility for the mandates proposed; two, \nregulating the economy and turning its back on ratepayers, on \nmanufacturers, and on American families.\n  Without investment in coal, it will mean higher heating and higher \ncooling bills that will continue to ripple through the economy, picking \nwinners and losers.\n  Last week, some Members of this Chamber insisted upon policies that \nwould raise prices at the pump through regulation. Today, they tried to \naddress the runup in gasoline prices by raising taxes.\n  I will tell you that the rising prices of gasoline are hurting the \npeople of Wyoming and the people across this country--truckers, \nranchers, commuters, and all American families.\n  I adamantly disagree with the so-called ``solutions'' proposed by the \nmajority, which were higher taxes and more regulation. I urge my \ncolleagues to allow real solutions to today's energy prices, including \nAmerican exploration and investment in American technology. It is time \nto enact a prosperous path for the future of America's energy and \nAmerica's economy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \ncomments. He is well aware of the spirit of community in Wyoming, which \nrelies on jobs, like everywhere else. He makes points about how \nimportant all of the energy sources in Wyoming are, and particularly \ncoal, and the opportunities we have for the American people to make \ncoal even better, even the clean coal we have in Wyoming.\n\n\n             Tribute to David Trowbridge of Lingle, Wyoming\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about some of that \nspirit of community in Wyoming. It also has to do with the spirit of \ncommunity in Mississippi.\n  Shortly after Hurricane Katrina, I went to visit down there and see \nwhat had happened. I definitely had to admit that Louisiana had been \ndrowned. Then I got to see Mississippi, and I saw they not only were \ndrowned but they were blown away. I saw one place where there were oak \ntrees that were easily 2 feet in diameter that had been snapped off \nabout 6 feet above the ground from the wind. The devastation down there \nis almost impossible to imagine. I always say a picture is worth a \nthousand words, but being on the ground is worth a thousand pictures. \nWe got to see that. It still is an area that is in recovery.\n  Today, I wish to recognize the actions of one Wyoming man who left \nhis home out West to go help his fellow Americans down South. He has \ndone more than simply lend a hand to a small Mississippi town \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina. He lent his heart, and he is an \nexample for all of us to follow.\n  David Trowbridge of Lingle, WY--one of our small towns--is quite a \nhero. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the gulf coast in 2005, \nhe joined a group of volunteers from his church on a trip to Bay Saint \nLouis, MS, where they provided aid to storm victims. There, David \nwitnessed firsthand the utter destruction of the hurricane--the lost \nloved ones, the wrecked homes, and the destroyed livelihoods.\n  Upon returning to Wyoming, Mr. Trowbridge vowed to go back to \nMississippi and help as many people as possible. I have learned from \nmembers of his small church in Lingle that Mr. Trowbridge is a man of \nhis word. He did go back, and he is still there helping.\n  In June of 2006, he purchased a motor home, loaded his tools and \nmoved from Wyoming to Bay Saint Louis indefinitely. I have to tell you, \nwe hope he comes back before the census because Wyoming can use the \npopulation. Since then, Mr. Trowbridge has spent his time working with \nFirst Baptist Church to help others rebuild their homes and their \nlives.\n  In all, he has worked on 62 houses in the Bay Saint Louis area. From \nroofing and laying tile to painting and plumbing, Mr. Trowbridge has \nprovided critical building repair services to many grateful families. \nHe has also played an integral role in training the thousands of \nvolunteer teams that flocked to Bay Saint Louis to assist with the \nrebuilding process. He teaches the volunteers the skills they need to \nrepair homes. Then he works side by side with them, helping the \nvolunteers to finish their projects and achieve their goals.\n  Mr. Trowbridge has changed countless lives through the giving of his \ntime and labor, and he has done it all without asking anything in \nreturn. His work is completely volunteer. Aside from a few donations \nhere and there, Mr. Trowbridge has funded this journey through personal \nsavings. He has reached into his own pockets to give new hope to people \nwho lost theirs in\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nthe storm. That goes to show the depth of his selflessness.\n  Mr. Trowbridge represents the true spirit of giving that we in \nWyoming know so well, and I am proud he is sharing that Wyoming sense \nof community with those affected by Hurricane Katrina. He is an \ninspiration of hope and generosity, and his effort serves as a \ntestament to what just one man can accomplish when he sets out to make \na positive impact on other people's lives.\n  Mr. Trowbridge is a man of faith and heart, and we can all learn from \nthe example he set. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking \nhim for all the work he has done and the hope he has brought to Bay \nSaint Louis, MS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for bringing to the attention of the Senate the good works of a \nman who embodies compassion, sacrifice, and service.\n  A few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit the Mississippi gulf coast, \nDavid Trowbridge of Lingle, WY, traveled with a group of his fellow \nchurch members to Bay Saint Louis, MS, to help the victims of this \nterribly destructive disaster. Because of the extent of the destruction \nhe saw and the enormous challenges that confronted the storm victims, \nDavid Trowbridge purchased a motor home and moved to Bay Saint Louis so \nhe could devote full time to the recovery effort.\n  He helped rebuild properties that had been destroyed or seriously \ndamaged, including housing for other volunteers who needed a place to \nstay and help. His carpentry skills have been a valuable resource, not \nonly to help rebuild homes but which also enabled him to train hundreds \nof unskilled volunteers to assist in the rebuilding efforts. These \nvolunteer teams have worked on over 1,400 homes in the communities of \nBay Saint Louis and Waveland.\n  People in Bay Saint Louis refer to David as a fixture of the \ncommunity. They have praised him as a hero. In fact, he is on a first-\nname basis at homes and businesses all over town.\n  The Mississippi gulf coast was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and is \nstill struggling to recover. But were it not for the unselfish, hard \nwork and dedication of David Trowbridge, my State would not be as far \nalong as we are in the recovery process.\n  Thank you, David Trowbridge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \njoining me in this tribute today for David Trowbridge. We do this as a \nreminder that there are still problems that need to be fixed from \nAugust 2005. The people down there are very appreciative of the help \nthey get. Of course, we are reminded, as there are tornados hitting all \nover the United States, that there are people in other parts of the \ncountry who need help as well.\n  It is the American spirit to reach out and help other people. Often \nit is done without any kind of a call, any kind of notice. People hear \nabout these needs and they show up and they do the work. We need to \nkeep them all in our minds and our prayers and, when we get the \nopportunity, to give a little bit of special mention of somebody who \ngoes out of their way, takes money out of their own pocket to help out. \nThat is what America is about--people helping people. David Trowbridge \nis an outstanding example of that.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Dole pertaining to the introduction of S. 3108 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nwhatever time I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, to review where too many families are \ntoday in our great country, we have 324,000 people--324,000 people--who \nhave lost good-paying American jobs just since this January. Just this \nJanuary, not last January, not the January before or the January before \nbut just in the last few months, 324,000 more Americans--middle-class \nAmericans, working hard every day and trying to keep up with the gas \nprices, trying to keep up with the mortgage payment, pay for food, send \nthe kids to college, probably having a bigger health care bill--have \nlost their job and gone, probably, on unemployment compensation to be \nable to help their family to be able to continue. And, Mr. President, \n72,000 of those individuals and families impacted come from my great \nState of Michigan, with 49,000 jobs having been lost since May, 17,000 \nof those lost in Michigan since April.\n  At the same time, we all know gas prices are now at $4 and going up, \nforeclosures nationally are over 702,000 homes this year, with over \n31,000 of those in Michigan.\n  All of that is to say that we have a picture now of middle-class \nAmericans, of those who believe in America, who are and who have been \nworking hard every day, who want the American Dream for themselves and \ntheir families finding themselves being hit over and over again with \none cost after another. Even those who have not lost their jobs are \nconcerned that they may. Will the plant stay open? Will the employers \nkeep the same number of people on when their costs are going up? Too \nmany people have gone from $28 an hour to $14 an hour, or $30 an hour \nto $10 an hour.\n\n  What we are seeing across the country is people who are desperately \nconcerned about their ability to keep their standard of living and to \nremain in the middle class of this country. In many cases they are \ndesperately concerned about simply being able to put food on the table, \nbeing able to get the money to put the gas in the gas tank so they can \ngo look for the next job.\n  With this backdrop--and with millions of Americans saying: What about \nme? What about my family? What about some kind of action that will help \nmy family, and understand what we are going through right now? With all \nof that as a backdrop, what we have seen today, once again, is \nabsolutely outrageous. It is absolutely outrageous. Two very important \nbills were brought forward where we simply asked to be able to proceed \nto discuss them, and once again the Republican minority has said no. \nThey blocked everything, stopped everything. No. No.\n  There is no sense of urgency, no sense of urgency about gas prices, \nno sense of urgency about getting off of foreign oil and energy \nindependence. There is no sense of urgency about what is happening to \nfamilies every single day.\n  It is amazing to me, when we look at the numbers. We have in fact had \nso many Republican filibusters we have to Velcro the chart. In the \ninterests of conservation, in the interests of not having to print up \nmultiple charts a day and waste good old posterboard, we actually have \nhad to Velcro the numbers because they change so much. Twice today--we \nhave now well exceeded what was a 2-year high in previous Senates in \nthe over 200-year history of our great country. We did that last year.\n  What does that mean? This all sounds like insider process kinds of \nthings--it is just folks talking about partisan politics. The reality \nis we are talking about whether the Senate is going to be able to move \nforward to debate issues and solve problems that people care \ndesperately about. They do not care whether this is an election year or \nnot an election year. They don't want excuses. They want us to get \nsomething done because they are trying to figure out how in the world \nthey are going to be able to keep things going and make ends meet for \ntheir family in this great country we call America.\n  We have seen 75 different times that there have been filibusters that \nhave been blocking our ability to actually get something done. What was \nfilibustered today? What efforts were made to block us today? First, a \nvery important bill, the Consumer-First Energy Act, to take on what is \nhappening on gas\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nprices. I know, talking with my family, home this weekend--folks were \nlooking at me, saying: What in the world is going on? What can be done?\n  We have put together legislation multiple times to address it, short \nterm and long term, as it relates to gas prices which are so \noutrageously high. But over and over again we are blocked. Why? Because \nthe oil companies do not like it. That is what this is about. \nUnfortunately, the oil companies do not want to see us move in the \ndirection of being able to tackle issues of whether there is, in fact, \nprice gouging; whether there are in fact issues around speculation; \nwhether we are going to have competition with alternatives to oil. They \ndo not want us to do that. They do not want us to tackle the issue of \nthe tax subsidies they receive.\n  What we see instead of action, as we could have had today, we see \nthis past week oil prices at $140 a barrel, almost twice the price from \nlast year. It is almost twice the price from last year, and OPEC says \nit could be $200 this year. Think about that when you are trying to get \nto work, trying to maybe take the kids to camp for that week or maybe \ntrying to go to the grocery store or go looking for work or maybe take \nmom or dad or the kids to the doctor. We are talking about a huge \nburden that is building up and up.\n  Unfortunately, while gas prices now go over $4 a gallon, we are \nseeing an effort to, one more time, block commonsense efforts to do \nsomething about it for the families of America. Unfortunately, on the \nother side of the aisle, there has been a desire to make sure that we \ncontinue big oil tax breaks rather than addressing what our families \nneed. Last year the big oil companies pocketed $124 billion in profits. \nIt is fine to make a profit. We want companies to do well, to make a \nprofit. But we also want to make sure when that is happening they are \nreinvesting in the economy, reinvesting in creating more supply. We \nwant them to be reinvesting in new energy. Unfortunately, that is not \nhappening.\n  We also want to have tax policy that makes sense in terms of where we \nwant to invest in new technologies. The oil companies are doing pretty \nwell, I suggest, right now. I do not think my tax money or your tax \nmoney or the tax money of any of the folks here or any of the folks \naround the country needs to be used to incentivize big oil, which is \nexactly what is happening right now.\n  They are doing pretty well. We have been trying and we have been \nblocked through Republican filibusters, to take away subsidies, \ntaxpayer subsidies for oil companies and move them over to subsidize \nnew, growing industries, green options, alternative energy--wind, \nsolar, advanced battery technologies, consumer tax credits to buy the \nnext generation of vehicles, the next generation of appliances. Those \nare the kinds of tax credits that encourage people to focus on energy \nefficiency and conservation in their homes, those things that will move \nus in the right direction. That is what we have been trying to do. And \nwe have been blocked.\n  The bill that was stopped also creates a permanent tax on windfall \nprofits for the major oil companies. If they are not going to invest in \nAmerica and invest in our future and buy the next airplane or put it \ninto more big bonuses, then we need to have a windfall profits tax that \nwill redirect those dollars back so we can take them and invest in the \nfuture.\n  I see our distinguished leader on the floor and I am going to suspend \nfor a moment, if I might. I know he has some important business he \nneeds to do.\n  I yield to our leader and ask that I later be recognized to continue \nmy comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my friend from \nMichigan allowing me to do a little business here on the floor of the \nSenate. She is such a tremendous Senator. I had the good fortune to be \nable to be in Michigan this weekend with her and Senator Levin. What a \nteam they are. The people of Michigan realize that. It was a wonderful \nexperience, being there with these two Senators.\n  The State of Michigan has lots of problems. No one articulates it \nbetter than Senator Stabenow, talking about what is happening to our \ncountry with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Of course, sadly, Michigan \nis a poster State for what is happening in the loss of manufacturing \njobs. This is something we must stop, stop the hemorrhaging of these \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  I had the good fortune yesterday of meeting with the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. They recognize, although they have been a \nRepublican organization in years past, that they are going to have to \nstart working with us. That doesn't mean they will not keep working \nwith the Republicans--of course they will--but we have to start working \ntogether and realize the bad shape of our manufacturing sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5431-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MOTION TO PROCEED WITHDRAWN--S. 3044\n\n  Mr. REID.

The motion is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5431-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5431-S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONSUMER-FIRST ENERGY ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. I move to proceed to S. 3044.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before our leader leaves the floor, I \nthank him for his patience and tenacity to continue, despite objection \nafter objection, as we try to govern on behalf of the people of this \ncountry--whether it be addressing issues of global warming, whether it \nbe gas prices, whether it be what just happened, which is to bring \nforward a Medicare bill that will stop a large cut to physicians all \naround the country and affect our ability to have access to health \ncare. It is a bill that includes the ability to focus on rural health \ncare and telehealth and e-prescribing and a number of things that will \nincrease access to health care.\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\n  To emphasize what just happened one more time: There was an objection \nto moving ahead on something that is important to the American people: \nto expand, under Medicare, health care for communities and our seniors. \nThis goes back to my original point now: 75 Republican filibusters and \ncounting. It is going to continue and continue, unfortunately, because \nthere is not the willingness to work together to get things done.\n  Let me mention two other issues. I mentioned what is happening in \nterms of blocking our Consumer-First Energy Act, which focuses on a \nnumber of ways to go after price gouging. The bill would stop \nmanipulation by greedy oil traders and give the Attorney General the \npower to stand up to OPEC nations that are price fixing--a number of \ndifferent ways for us to immediately address what is happening to gas \nprices on behalf of the American people. That was blocked.\n  The second thing that was blocked was the Renewable Energy and Job \nCreation Act of 2008. This is about jobs. This is about jobs in my \ngreat State of Michigan, in New Jersey, all across this country, based \non the new green economy--production tax credits to build those wind \nturbines and solar panels and new vehicles and, again, the consumer tax \ncredits and investing in the ability for businesses that use the R \ntax credit to have that continue, to be able to invest in other \neconomic development tax credits. That is what was blocked--jobs \nfocused on alternative energy.\n  So we went after the oil companies. No. We want to put forward a \nproposal that will invest in new jobs. No. That is what we are hearing \nevery day. And every day that is happening, more and more people in my \ngreat State are finding themselves without a job, trying to keep the \nlights on, keep food on the table, trying to be able to put gas in \ntheir automobile. And they are looking and saying: What is going on \nhere? Each month, tens of thousands of people across the country, not \njust in Michigan--I mean, we were hit the hardest first, but this is \nacross the country--are losing their jobs. Hundreds of those are losing \nunemployment insurance benefits they paid into.\n  There seems to be a notion that somehow, if someone is required to go \non unemployment insurance benefits, they will not look for work. Well, \nthat is about 40 percent of what the average wage is for an individual. \nYou can barely keep things together. In many cases, you cannot keep \nthings together. I would suggest that the unemployment insurance \nbenefit is not a disincentive for folks to work. And obviously people \nin my State work hard. They work. They work very hard. Too many are \nworking two jobs, three jobs, four jobs, trying to piece it together.\n  But we have never had an economic situation like we have today under \na Republican or Democratic President where there has not been a \nwillingness in a difficult economic situation to extend unemployment \nbenefits. Yet President Bush has threatened to veto an extension of \nunemployment insurance which we have already passed here in the Senate.\n  As I indicated before, the numbers are high--324,000 good-paying \nAmerican jobs have been lost since January of this year. We also know \nthere are 8.5 million unemployed workers in America competing for 3.7 \nmillion jobs. That is why the bill that was blocked earlier that \ninvests in new taxation and new technologies, production tax credits to \nbuild new plants, to create new processes, is so important, because \nright now we have more than twice as many people looking for work as \nthere are jobs available. We as a Democratic majority understand that. \nWe understand that so much of what is happening right now for families \ngoes to the basic foundation of this economy, which is the ability to \nhave a good-paying job and to be able to pay those costs that come at \nfamilies day after day after day.\n  In May, the number of Americans who have been out of work for at \nleast 27 weeks--right now, unemployment goes to 26 weeks--rose to 1.6 \nmillion workers; 1.6 million middle-class workers as of May who saw \ntheir benefits exhausted and in most or many cases were not able to \nfind a job. What happened? What happens to those families? In the past \nyear, 2.75 million people who are unemployed have exhausted their \nbenefits.\n  American families are running out of time. They want us to take \naction. There needs to be a sense of urgency about what is going on for \nfamilies in this country. It is not that we do not have the ability to \nact; there is not the will to act, not the will to join with us in a \nbipartisan effort to act. We as Democrats come to the floor every day, \nour leader comes to the floor every day, multiple times a day, making \nmotions to proceed to solve problems through legislation that is \ncritical for our families. Time after time, all we hear is: I object. I \nobject. I object.\n  People in Michigan know what the pain of inaction is like and the \neffort to try to hold it together when help is not there. Over the last \nyear, more than 150,000 people have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits, over 10,000 people a month now looking for work but do not \nhave the support anymore to at least be able to keep things going a \nlittle bit.\n  But you know it is not just Michigan anymore. Unfortunately, other \nStates are now catching up. We heard as of last Friday that the \nnational unemployment rate is now 5.5 percent. When we first started \ntalking about this, it was 4.9. Now it is up to 5.5, and the experts \ntell us they expect it will reach 6.5 percent by January. Alaska, \nCalifornia, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Nevada, Missouri, Oregon, South \nCarolina, Kentucky, and Ohio all have unemployment rates at or above \n5.5 percent.\n  We need to act, not only because it is the right thing to do, the \nmoral thing to do for our families, but we know that for every $1 that \nis spent on unemployment benefits in the economy, the dollars turn over \nand the economy is stimulated by $1.64. So there is an opportunity to \nnot only do the right thing for Americans, which ought to be enough, \nbut it is also an opportunity to stimulate the economy and one of the \ntop ways we are told it can be stimulated. In other words, for every $1 \nwe invest to help struggling American families, we get a 64-percent \nreturn on our investment. I would take that. That is a deal worth \nmaking.\n  So I close by once again calling on the President to join with us at \nthis critical time in American history where families are being hit in \nso many different ways and to say yes to extending unemployment \nbenefits for those who are out of work but looking very hard to find a \njob and are counting on us to do the right thing.\n  I would love it if we did not have to stand up and change this Velcro \nanymore. I would love it if we could just frame this right here--75 \nRepublican filibusters--and stop. But that is not what is happening. We \ncan do better than that. Certainly, the people in Michigan expect us to \ndo better than that. I am going to do everything in my power--I know \nthe Chair will as well--to be able to make good on what people are \nasking of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like a lot of Members of the Senate, I also \nheard from my constituents last weekend about high energy prices. I do \nnot know how any Member of Congress can go back into their \ncongressional district and their State and not be inundated by people \nwho are very concerned about the impact high fuel prices are having on \ntheir pocketbooks and on our economy.\n  In fact, in my State of South Dakota, the studies bear this out. I \nthink it has a disproportionate impact because it is a rural area. In \nrural areas, we are very energy dependent. We drive long distances. We \nare very agriculturally dependent in terms of our economy. Tourism is a \nbig thing in our economy in rural areas. We also, in most cases, have \nlower incomes relative to the incomes of people in other parts of the \ncountry. In fact, there are some studies out that suggest that 15 \npercent, 16 percent on average of a person's income in a rural area is \nspent just paying the energy bill. Now, that is something that ought to \nconcern everybody across this country because even though it might \ndisproportionally impact rural areas today, it is clearly going to \nimpact all Americans and continue to impact our economic activities in \nthis country as time goes on if we do not get our arms around these \nescalating and daily increasing energy costs.\n  I had someone in my office today who said that he has a small \nrefinery. He\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nsaid if the cap-and-trade bill we debated last week had been enacted or \npassed, immediately they would have seen a 38-cent increase in the \nprice per gallon of gasoline.\n  There is a proposal to build a powerplant in my State of South \nDakota, a coal-fired powerplant. I was visiting with some folks last \nweek in my State who informed me that if, in fact, that cap-and-trade \nproposal had passed, it would have tripled the cost to construct that \npowerplant, something that is necessary to provide base load energy for \nthe energy demands and requirements we have in the upper Midwest.\n\n  So here we are talking about high energy prices, high fuel prices, \nand the only solutions our colleagues are putting on the floor are \nsolutions that would actually increase fuel costs. The cap-and-trade \nproposal last week, by any estimate--and there were 11 studies that \nwere done of the five cap-and-trade proposals put before or introduced \nin the Senate, one which was put before the Senate last week. All 11 \nstudies concluded that if enacted, that proposal would increase fuel \ncosts, it would increase electricity costs, and it would lead to \nnegative gross domestic product growth. The question was not if, it was \nhow much would it increase costs. By as much as a dollar a gallon for \ngasoline. There were a number of studies conducted that suggested that \nit would cost the economy up to $6 trillion in GDP, negative GDP, as a \nresult of that cap-and-trade proposal.\n  So here we are on the floor of the Senate. Everyone, I assume, is \nhearing the same thing I am hearing, when they go back to their \nrespective States, from their constituents: We have high energy prices; \nwe need some action; we need you to do something about that. And \neverything that has been put before the Senate last week and this week \nby the Democratic leadership does one thing: increases energy costs.\n  We had a vote today on an ``energy bill.'' What did it do? It imposed \nnew taxes on energy. That was tried. That was tried back in the 1980s, \nthe windfall profits tax. It led to reduced energy production in this \ncountry. The other thing that was talked about today was, well, let's \nsue OPEC, let's sue OPEC; that will somehow drive down the cost of \nenergy.\n  There is not anything in any of those proposals that does anything to \naddress the problem because you cannot address this problem, you cannot \nfix the energy crisis in this country unless you address the issue of \nsupply. There is not anything in any of those bills that have been put \nforward, that have been put forward by the other side, that addresses \nthe fundamental issue of supply. I believe the American people \nunderstand that. They understand full well that you do not raise taxes \nto get more of something; if you raise taxes, you are going to get less \nof something. They realize that we cannot just sort of unilaterally \ndecide to sue an oil cartel and expect that is going to lead to \nadditional energy supply in this country.\n  There is one thing and one thing only that we can do to lower \ngasoline prices for people in this country; that is, increase homegrown \ndomestic energy supplies so that we do not have to rely upon other \nnations around the world for our energy.\n  I wish to share a couple of statics that I think are important in \nthis debate. One is that 60 percent of our oil comes from outside the \nUnited States. That means that on any given day we are getting 60 \npercent of our energy to fuel our automobiles and to keep our economy \ngoing from countries around the world, many of which are run by petro-\ndictators who have nothing but hostile and ill intentions toward the \nUnited States. Sixty percent of our oil supply is coming from outside \nthe United States.\n  We use 140 billion gallons of gasoline every year in this country. I \npoint that out because I want to use that to get to another point; that \nis, we are generating about 8 billion gallons of renewable energy or \nethanol on an annual basis. At the end of this year, we will be \ngenerating 1 billion gallons in my State of South Dakota alone. But the \nstudies that have been done have suggested that that 8 billion gallons \nof ethanol, out of the 140 billion gallons of fuel we use in this \ncountry, of gasoline we use in this country, has reduced energy prices \nby about 15 percent--price per barrel of oil, price per gallon of \ngasoline reduced by about 15 percent by the contribution that 8 billion \ngallons of ethanol is making to our overall fuel supply.\n  In today's gasoline prices, 15 percent would be about 50 cents, 60 \ncents on the gallon. So we have lower fuel prices today than we would \notherwise have as a result of adding to our supply of energy, homegrown \nenergy, through the hard work and production of our farmers across the \ncountry who raise the corn that is converted into ethanol.\n  I suggest perhaps the way to address this problem, if, in fact, 8 \nbillion gallons of ethanol has helped reduce gasoline prices by 50 \ncents a gallon, maybe what we ought to be doing is looking at ways we \ncan grow additional energy supply. We don't need less biofuels, we need \nmore. We are going to be moving now from corn-based ethanol into \ncellulosic ethanol that can be made from other forms of biomass. We \nhope that technology will be progressing quickly enough that it will \nenable us to meet the targets we have of 36 billion gallons called for \nin the renewable fuels standard. That is what we are doing in the area \nof biofuels.\n  I say that because if we look at what we have in terms of domestic \nresources, whether that is biofuels or oil, if we could get some of \nthat oil into the pipeline, we could do a lot to impact prices people \nare paying for a gallon of gasoline. Back in 1995, President Clinton \nvetoed a bill passed by Congress that would have allowed for \nexploration on the North Slope of Alaska. We have somewhere between 6 \nand 16 billion barrels of oil on the North Slope underneath the ground. \nWith modern technology and in an environmentally friendly way, \ndirectional and horizontal drilling, with a minimal imprint on the \nsurface, we can get access to somewhere between 6 and 16 barrels of \noil. What does that translate into? That translates into 1 million \nbarrels a day coming into this country--1 million barrels a day. And \nyou figure a barrel translates into 42 gallons, and of that about half \ncan be refined into gasoline, a million barrels a day would translate \ninto about 7 billion gallons of gasoline a year or roughly equivalent \nto what we are generating in ethanol. And the 8 billion gallons in \nethanol is reducing the price of gas by about 50 cents a gallon. So if \nyou do the math, more energy, more supply at the margin is going to \nlead to lower cost. That is the fundamental economic rule of supply and \ndemand that most people understand.\n  Any of my constituents in South Dakota, if I went home and told them \nthat the Democratic leadership has put a bill on the floor that is \ngoing to allow us to file lawsuits against OPEC or that is going to \nimpose new taxes on oil exploration, a windfall profits tax, they would \nsay: What does that do to affect the law of supply and demand? Get more \nsupply in the marketplace so that we can do something about reducing \nthe price per gallon of gasoline?\n  This problem gets addressed when America gets serious about domestic \nenergy supplies. We have tried again and again to get a vote on \nexploration on the North Slope. We have tried again and again to get a \nvote on deep sea exploration for energy--all of which has been blocked \nin the Senate.\n  We have even tried to get legislation moved that would expedite the \npermitting process for new refineries because we have a shortage of \nrefining capacity. These are all things that we could be doing that \nwould help address the supply problem.\n  I suggest when we get to what we are focusing on that we can do, \nthere are pieces of legislation on which there is broad agreement. We \npassed a bill a couple weeks ago that Senators Ensign and Cantwell \noffered of tax extenders that would help promote more investment in \nrenewable energy. It passed out of the Senate by a vote of 88 to 8, \nbroad bipartisan support. Why are we not focusing on those things we \ncan do rather than spending our time having the Democrats throw out \nsolutions that impose new taxes, new regulations, new bailouts to trial \nlawyers, which was included in this bill, an earmark for the Senator \nfrom New York at $1.2 billion, all of which we know are not going to \npass?\n  We aren't going to get the votes to get that sort of thing through. \nBut there are things we can be doing, such as extending the production \ntax credit\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\nfor wind, which was included in the Energy bill to which I just \nreferred. Those are the things we ought to be looking at. What can we \ndo to add to the supply of electricity, to add to the supply of fuels \nso that we don't have to get 60 percent of our energy from outside the \nUnited States, so we are actually doing something that will in a \npositive way impact the price our constituents pay for a gallon of \ngasoline?\n  This impact is going to be felt all across the economy. Look at the \nstatistics on airlines. We are using actually less fuel on airlines \ntoday, if we look at this green line, than we were going back even to \n2000 and 2001. But look at the fuel costs of the airlines. They are \nexploding. We have airlines facing bankruptcy, making service cutbacks, \nnot serving smaller communities, laying off employees because of high \nfuel costs. There is no end in sight.\n  It is $4 today. What is to stop it from going to $5? If Ahmadinejad \nand Chavez decide they want to get $200 for a barrel of oil, what is to \nstop them, if we have no leverage? We need to be taking steps in the \nUnited States that will increase our domestic supply of energy so we \ndon't have to rely upon those other countries for our energy supply. We \nhave those resources here. We have oil. We have biofuels. We need new \nrefineries. We can build new nuclear plants. All are being blocked.\n  Let's focus on what we can do to affect the fundamental rule of \nsupply and demand that will lead to lower energy costs, that will \nincrease the amount of energy we have relative to demand. That is how \nwe can impact in a positive way the price our constituents are paying \nfor a gallon of gasoline. Until we get serious about that, all this \nother stuff done for optics because it is an election year and to gain \nsome political upper hand to go back to a constituency saying, we did \nthis or we are going to beat up the oil companies, raise taxes, \nregulations and lawsuits and litigation, those sorts of things don't \nsolve the fundamental problem. We don't have enough domestic supply. \nUntil we address that fundamental problem, we will continue to be held \nover a barrel and be at the mercy of these foreign countries telling us \nwhat the price per barrel of oil and price per gallon of gasoline is \ngoing to be.\n  I hope we can focus on that. We have some great solutions. My State \nis a good example of what we have done with renewables. The Senator \nfrom Iowa has a lot of great examples in his State of what we are doing \nwith renewable energy and wind. We have the resources to get this done. \nIt is high time we did it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South \nDakota. He is expressing a very simple law that everybody learns in \neconomics 101: If you increase supply, it reduces price; if you \nrestrict supply, price goes up. What we want to do is increase the \nsupply of energy.\n  For myself, I want to explain earlier today my vote to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed to S. 3044, the so-called Consumer-First \nEnergy Act or, another title, the antiprice-gouging bill. I want to \nexplain it because people might think that I am in support of \neverything in the legislation. I will explain why I wasn't, but why I \nthought we ought to move forward.\n  The legislation includes provisions that I have long supported, \nincluding the no oil producing and exporting cartels legislation. I am \nan original cosponsor of the NOPEC bill. This bill would authorize the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to bring \nlawsuits against oil cartel members for antitrust violation because it \nis a fact of American law, if oil companies were doing the price fixing \nthat OPEC countries do, these executives would be in jail. Yet we are \nfaced with the same anticompetitive environment from other countries.\n  As our gas prices continue to rise, it is time to say enough is \nenough to OPEC anticompetitive activities. It is past time to let OPEC \nknow that we are committed to stopping illegal pricing, the same \nillegal pricing that would put CEOs of major oil companies in jail.\n  This legislation also includes provisions aimed at reducing \nspeculation in oil markets. I support that. I can't say for certain \nwhether the provisions included in the bill will have the desired \neffect. I can say, however, that something needs to be done to address \nwhat seems to be out-of-control speculation in crude oil markets, and \nspeculation of crude oil tends to show up on the business pages of the \nnewspaper as a major cause of the increase in oil and, in turn, \ngasoline.\n\n  I am pleased that recently the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nhas taken steps in recent days and weeks to increase their access to \ndata and information that will hopefully allow them the proper \noversight and transparency of energy markets. Take a little bit of \nspeculation, take a little bit of unknown out of the market, more \ntransparency ought to help our markets work better.\n  In conjunction with what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is \nup to and my wanting to build on what they are doing, I asked Acting \nChairman Lukken and Commissioner Chilten very pointed questions during \na recent confirmation hearing in the Agriculture Committee on the \nCFTC's oversight responsibilities. In addition, I sent a letter to the \nCFTC today seeking more information about the CFTC's action to rein in \nspeculation by investment banks and traders on foreign exchanges.\n  I voted today as I did in a manner uncustomary of Republicans to \nproceed to the bill because I think we need to have a debate on the \ncritical issue of energy prices. However, that doesn't mean I support \neverything in S. 3044. The bill, for instance, included a windfall \nprofits tax on oil companies. I saw firsthand a couple decades ago the \nresult of a windfall profits tax the last time it was enacted. It \ndidn't do anything to produce more energy. Simple economics: You tax \nsomething, you get less of it. Why would those on the other side \nbelieve if you tax energy production, you would get more energy \nproduced? Of course, it is counterintuitive. Yet this bill doesn't \ninclude a single provision to increase the production or supply of \ntraditional energy resources. Why aren't we considering policies to \ndevelop the resources that God gave us at home? We have a huge supply \nof oil and gas in Alaska. We could be opening areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf to exploration. We could be looking at Federal lands \nonshore for energy production. These are things we could do this very \nday that would increase supply and drive down prices. Yet they have \nbeen blocked time after time by people on the other side.\n  If you think this is a partisan shot by a senior Republican, let me \nsuggest to you that I can show you rollcall after rollcall after \nrollcall, not just recently but over a long period, of opposition from \nthe other side to increasing the supply of fossil fuels and the use of \nfossil fuels we know. My constituents need to know why they are paying \n$4 at the gas pump. Yet we in Washington have done little to increase \nour own supplies.\n  Speaking from the grassroots of the State of Iowa, I want to remind \nmy colleagues of what I said last week on the floor of the Senate. Of \nat least 14 out of the 17 town meetings I have had, the question came \nup very simply: Why aren't we producing more oil? Why aren't we going \nwhere the oil exists, with $4 gas? I can give a simple answer, and I \ntell the people ahead of time in my town meetings. I try not to make \npartisan comments, but occasionally I think I can when it is \nintellectually honest to do it. I suggest to them that there is \nopposition in the other party to more exploration, where we know there \nis oil. We just don't have the votes to get the job done.\n  That could be considered a partisan shot, but I think I can back it \nup with rollcalls. It is a justification to my constituents when I am \nasked why we don't drill more where we know there is oil. Most of my \nconstituents expect you to do this in an environmentally sound way as \nwell. That doesn't, to me or my constituents, appear to be incompatible \nbecause the United States is dependent upon oil cartels and foreign \ncountries such as Iran and Venezuela, very unstable, yet we have done \nnothing to help ourselves. That is the way my constituents see it, as \nevidenced by 14 out of 17 town meetings I held during the week of \nMemorial Day. In the other three town meetings, it just did not happen \nto come up.\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n  I believe oil is trading today at around $135 a barrel. Yet there is \nan overwhelming aversion to environmentally sound resources developed \nat home. We ought to be developing our domestic resources. There is no \nrational reason not to, and at $4-a-gallon gas, consumers ought to be \noutraged they are not exploring for more domestic resources, and \nCongress making decisions to do that, and to do it so quickly that it \nis telling people why it is not being done. At the grassroots of \nAmerica, we ought to be having the same march on the Capitol as when \npeople are outraged about other things, which we do not seem to be \nhaving this time.\n  Maybe we will have this outraged expressed. It is a little bit of a \nquandary to me why, at the grassroots of America, when gas goes from \n$3.50 to $4, or from $3 to $4, it does not seem we are having as much \noutrage as we had when gasoline was going from $1.50 to $1.75 about 4 \nyears ago. Maybe it is because people have lost confidence in Congress. \nI do not know. I can understand why you can lose confidence in Congress \nwhen you have $4 gasoline and we know where there is 13 billion barrels \nof oil in this part of the country and 7 billion barrels of oil in \nother areas of the country and we are importing 10 to 15 million \nbarrels of oil a day and paying out to some foreign country money that \nif we drilled in the United States we would keep in the United States.\n  The bill I am explaining to you takes billions of dollars of \npermanent tax provisions and dumps them into a special piggy bank \ndesigned to let appropriators dole out special interests checks for \ntheir favorite spending projects. I know the rhetoric you have heard \ntoday is to make big oil pay to lower the price of gasoline. But I can \npromise you, there is absolutely nothing in this bill that accomplishes \nthat charge. This bill, flawed as it is, would have to be amended. Any \npermanent tax provisions on the backs of the energy industry should \nimmediately go back into tax benefits that expand conservation and \nclean energy tax provisions currently in the Internal Revenue Code.\n  We cannot put the cart before the horse. It is irresponsible to \nchange taxes for future undisclosed spending. It is even more \nirresponsible to do this before we make certain the current tax \nbenefits available for wind, solar, alternative fuels, and much needed \nconservation in buildings and homes.\n  It was wrong for the Democratic leadership to dump permanent tax \nprovisions into a slush fund for future appropriations. But those types \nof wrongs cannot be fixed if we never proceed to the bill, hence why \nthis Senator voted as I did today, contrary to what a lot of the \nmembers of my party did.\n\n\n                          House Extenders Bill\n\n  I turn now to the tax extenders bill. I voted today on the second \nrollcall along with 43 other Senators against invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 6049, the House extenders bill.\n  Earlier today, the Democrat leadership released a description of a \nsubstitute extenders bill that included many provisions that were not \nextenders.\n  As you know, I joined Senator McConnell in filing an extenders bill \nlast Friday that is not offset by increases in taxes elsewhere because \nit is our policy that if you extend existing tax policy, you should not \nhave to raise taxes on somebody else for an extension of tax policies \nthat in some instances have been in place for 20 years.\n  Here are some of the reasons, then, why I opposed the Democratic \nleadership bill and support the Republican leadership bill.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership bill contains numerous provisions \nthat do not either extend or make permanent expiring tax provisions. On \nthe other hand, the Republican bill really is an extenders bill, with \nall the provisions in the Senate bill extending or making permanent \nexpiring tax provisions.\n  Included in the Senate Democratic leadership bill is a proposal to \ngive $1.2 billion in tax credits to New York City, even though New York \nCity does not pay Federal tax. This proposal is widely reported to fund \nthe building of a train from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy Airport, \nthrough the use of New York Liberty Zone tax credits.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congress has \nnever--and I want to emphasize ``never''--before provided a limited tax \nbenefit such as this to a governmental unit.\n  In addition, the bill provides a new $1.6 billion tax benefit just \nfor trial lawyers. Now, think about that. We are trying to extend tax \npolicy to bring economic development and create jobs, and it has \nsomething in it for trial lawyers. It allows trial lawyers to deduct \ntheir upfront expenses in contingency fee cases, even though they \nexpect to recover them when they win or settle the case. And these \ntrial lawyers do expect to win or settle their case; otherwise, they \nwould not take the case on a contingency fee basis.\n  So why should trial lawyers get a deduction for something they expect \nto get back? We do not give lenders a current deduction when they make \na loan. Some would argue that this is a large chunk of pork that the \nDemocratic leadership bill is trying to feed to trial lawyers.\n  The Democratic leadership bill, for the first time in history, makes \ntax benefits directly conditioned on the Davis-Bacon Act. That is the \nprevailing wage requirement. It is added to a new provision called the \nNew Clean Renewable Energy Bonds.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership bill only extends provisions that \nexpire at the end of 2007 until the end of 2008, setting up another \nextenders fire drill early next year. In contrast, our bill on the \nRepublican side generally extends provisions that expired at the end of \n2007 until the end of 2009.\n  The Democratic leadership bill contains permanent tax provisions to \noffset temporary extensions of current law. Anonymous Democratic \nlobbyists are misstating the Republican position on offsetting expiring \ntax relief provisions. The lobbyists have been quoted in the Roll Call \nnewspaper and other publications stating that part of the Republican \ntheology is opposition to offsets.\n  Republicans will support offsets if they make sense on the policy \nmerits. If the revenue-raising proposals make policy sense and offset \nthe revenue loss for new tax policy--I want to emphasize ``new tax \npolicy'' as opposed to extending existing tax policy--then it will \nlikely garner majority support among Senate Republicans.\n  However, one of the revenue raisers in the Democratic leadership bill \nis a proposal to delay the effective date of the worldwide interest \nallocation rules. This provision was enacted in the American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004, with a delayed effective date for revenue \npurposes.\n  The decision to reform the interest allocation rules was bipartisan \nback then in 2004. The reform came out of the Finance Committee working \ngroup set up by Chairman Baucus in 2002 and passed the full Senate by a \nvote of 92 to 5. So after a vote of 92 to 5--bipartisan--why would they \ntry to undo a very important provision in it? The current rules \nactually penalize domestic manufacturers who compete in global markets \nby making it more likely they will be double taxed on their foreign \nincome.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership bill would delay the effective date \neven further--can you believe it--by 9 years, giving it an effective \ndate of 2018. This provision raises almost $29 billion over 10 years.\n  The President of the United States, aware of how important this \nprovision is that is going to take effect in 2009--that was actually \npassed in 2004 to make our manufacturing competitive with international \ncompetition--issued a statement of administration policy noting that \n``the Administration strongly opposes the provision in the bill that \nwould subject U.S. companies to continued double taxation by delaying \nthe effect of new rules for allocating worldwide interest for foreign \ntax credit purposes.''\n  Let's look at the Senate Republican alternative. I hope people \nlistening know that a minority in the Senate has a responsibility to \nhave alternatives, not just jab at the majority position. So we have \nthis responsible alternative. It contains alternative minimum tax \nrelief and extensions of individual and business tax provisions, but \nwith no offsets, following the philosophy we have that if you have had \ntax policy in place for decades that tends to sunset from time to \ntime--it has been on the books--you should not\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nhave to raise taxes on new people to extend it for a few more years. So \nthere are no offsets for the continuation of existing tax policy.\n  It also includes the Ensign-Cantwell energy tax incentives, an \nunoffset provision which was approved by the Senate by a vote of 88 to \n8. This means an overwhelming majority of this body were willing to \npass energy extenders without requiring offsets.\n  So why, if we have a vote of 88 to 8 to extend energy tax credits for \na few years, and we do not have to offset it--how does the other side \nget the idea that if you had other tax policies that maybe have been on \nthe books for decades and sunset, you have to have offsets for that? I \ndo not understand the inconsistency.\n  The bottom line is, we need a package that can garner 60 votes in the \nSenate and get a signature by the President of the United States. So \nSenate Republicans will seek to proceed to the Senate Republican \nleadership bill which contains a package of proposals that have \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and since I do not see other \nMembers ready to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this morning we had two more opportunities \nto address rising gas prices and do something immediately as the price \nof gas per gallon goes over $4 in Steubenville and almost $4 in Dayton \nand even higher in some places in my State and in the Presiding \nOfficer's State of New Jersey. We had two more opportunities to address \nrising gas prices immediately and longer term.\n  We need to start immediately to invest in renewable energy rather \nthan the other choice of continuing to line the pockets of big oil. We \ncould have helped to begin to create tens of thousands of good-paying, \ngreen-collar jobs right here at home. Once again, the Bush \nadministration opposed our efforts and Republican Senators joined the \nBush administration and refused to put middle-class families first.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act is a good first step in providing \nimmediate relief to drivers in Ohio and across the land who are faced \nwith soaring gasoline and diesel prices.\n  The other night I had a conference call with 20 truckers. Think about \nwhat this has done to them. Many of them have had to sell their trucks. \nThey are simply not able to afford the $4.50 and up per gallon price of \ndiesel. Oil prices are setting record highs, it seems, every week, and \nyesterday closed at over $136 a barrel.\n  This legislation will help in the short term and allow us to get \nthrough and offer some assistance to motorists to get through the \nsummer driving season. The policies that created this gas price crisis \ndidn't happen overnight. Before we attack the long-term problems, \nOhioans need help now to get through the summer to keep trucks running, \nto keep the economy moving, to keep food prices in check as the cost of \nenergy ripples through the whole economy and causes prices to go up \ngenerally.\n  Cities throughout Ohio are struggling to pay gas bills for the police \ncars, for EMS, for fire department vehicles, school buses, garbage \ntrucks, and mass transit services.\n  We need to roll back the massive tax breaks for oil companies which \nwould generate more than $17 billion to be used for green energy, for \nrenewable energy, and for energy efficiency. We will impose a 25-\npercent windfall profits tax on companies that fail to invest in \nincreased capacity and renewable energy sources. We will ensure \npurchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve do not resume, especially \nwhen we are paying $120, $130, $140, $150 a barrel to put oil in the \nreserve. We will provide protection for consumers from price gouging. \nWe call on the Justice Department again to be active and take on the \noil companies as they seem to price gouge. We will work to stop market \nspeculation, prevent traders of U.S. crude oil from routing \ntransmissions through offshore markets to evade speculative limits.\n  Ohioans play by the rules. Americans play by the rules. So should the \noil industry. So should the speculator. So should Wall Street.\n  There is so much we need to do. I call on my friends on that side of \nthe aisle to join with majority Democrats: no more filibusters and \nlet's get to work. Let's do the right thing short term to help American \nmotorists deal with these outrageously high prices, long term to, in \nfact, after 30 years become energy independent and create the kinds of \ngreen jobs a good energy policy can create.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Hunger \nAwareness Day. On this day, we focus on the more than 35 million people \nin the United States without enough to eat and reassert our commitment \nto assist those in need.\n  Millions of families live each day not knowing if they will have \nenough to eat. Rather than thinking about what the next meal will be, \nthese parents worry if there will be a next meal. Rather than \nconcentrate on homework, these children are trying not to think about \ntheir hunger pangs. In a nation as economically wealthy and \nagriculturally abundant as ours, this is inexcusable. If children--or \nadults--are hungry in America, that is a problem for all of us.\n  This administration has seen the number of people living in poverty \nrise from 31.6 million in 2000 to 36.5 million in 2006. The number of \npeople living in households facing food insecurity rose from 31 million \nin 1999 to 35.5 million in 2006. In Illinois, over 158,000 households \nexperienced hunger in 2005. If we include households that have had to \nstruggle to put food on the table or have had to skip meals to make \nsure the food would last through the week, it adds up to 500,000 \nhouseholds in Illinois living with food insecurity. These are working \nfamilies who just aren't able to make ends meet.\n  At a time when millions of middle class Americans are struggling to \nkeep up with higher gas prices, grocery bills, and health care costs, \nmore and more families are looking to Federal programs for assistance. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, applications for food \nstamps are on the rise at the same time recipients are making more \nfrequent use of food pantries to fill gaps in their grocery needs. Over \n26 million people nationwide are dependent on the Federal Food Stamp \nProgram. In April, 594,590 families in Illinois received food stamps, \nan increase of 5.84 percent from last year and the highest level ever \nin Illinois, equating to 1.3 million people. And since December, \nparticipation in the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, food \nassistance program has increased 4 percent to a total of 296,000. But \nfor the millions of people who don't have assistance, everything is \ndifferent.\n  We know hunger is a reality in our communities. We see long lines at \nour food pantries. We have heard from seniors forced to choose between \ngroceries and medication. And children are in our schools who have not \nhad a decent meal since the previous day's school lunch. We see \nfamilies showing up a day earlier than normal at the food pantry \nbecause the monthly pay is not stretching as far it once did. Parents \nare giving up their own meal to make sure their child has something to \neat at night.\n  In the Nation that prides itself as the land of plenty, we cannot \nhide the fact that we need to do a better job at making sure everybody \nhas at least enough to eat. The passage of this year's farm bill is a \nstrong first step toward better\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\naddressing hunger in our country. The farm bill provides 10 billion \nadditional dollars over 10 years for domestic nutrition programs that \nhelp lower income families put food on the table, including $7.8 \nbillion for the Food Stamp Program, $1.25 billion for the Emergency \nFood Assistance Program, and $1 billion for the fresh fruits and \nvegetables snack program. In Illinois, over the next 10 years, this \nbill will provide $373 million in additional funding to help families \nthat haven't been able to outrun hunger.\n  But with one hungry person in our Nation, hunger will be a problem \nfor all of us. I hope that we will continue to work together to fulfill \nour duty to end hunger in our Nation and the world.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the fact that today, June 10, 2008, is National Hunger \nAwareness Day.\n  As a founder of the bipartisan Senate Hunger caucus and an original \ncosponsor of the legislation establishing this commemoration, I believe \nhunger is an issue that deserves our full attention.\n  For the past 4 years, my fellow caucus cochairs Senator Smith, \nSenator Dole, as well as Senator Durbin and I have executed a food \ndrive in our Senate offices with donations helping those in need in the \nWashington area. The collection began last month and culminates today \nNational Hunger Awareness Day when we donate the collected goods to \nneedy organizations.\n  I have worked with my Senate colleagues to draw attention to this \nissue because hunger and poverty are not just global issues they are so \npervasive that we all have some experience with them in our local \ncommunities.\n  Worldwide, 3 billion people--nearly half the world's population--live \non merely $2 per day. In our Nation alone, almost 35.5 million \nAmericans struggle day in and day out to find adequate nutritious food. \nMore than 13 million children live in households that are food \ninsecure.\n  According to the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance in my home State, \napproximately 80 percent of supplemental nutrition assistance goes to \nhouseholds with children, many of them in working families, including \nmilitary families. Older Americans and those with disabilities also \ndepend on these benefits. Every month, nutrition assistance programs \nenable almost 385,000 Arkansans 13.7 percent of my State's population \nto purchase groceries for themselves and their families.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee, I worked to address this issue in the recently passed Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008, and I am proud the bill aims to \nreduce food insecurity among our children and our elderly, and others \nin need. This bill commits $10.36 billion to continue the fight against \nhunger. It represents the largest amount of funding for nutrition \nprograms in our Nation's history. One billion dollars is allocated to \nthe Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which provides free fresh fruits \nand vegetables to low-income children in schools nationwide. It also \nexpands the senior farmers' market program by $50 million to help them \npurchase fresh food at places like farmers' markets and roadside stands \nthroughout the country.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I encourage my colleagues to become \nmore aware, more educated, and more informed about the effects of \nhunger and poverty and to find out what impact you can have in your \nState and in your community. Government cannot do it alone, though.\n  It has been said: To those to whom much is given, much is required. \nWe must continue to work together to devote our time and resources to \norganizations in our communities committed to this cause and develop \npublic/private partnerships to combat food insecurity in this country. \nHunger is a disease that has a cure. It is our responsibility to strive \nhard each and every day to eliminate hunger in our country and around \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5437-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on May 21, 2008, the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent S. Res. 541, a resolution on Somalia introduced by \nSenator Feingold. As the new ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on African Affairs, I wholeheartedly support \nbringing about change in Somalia to allow for a viable government that \nwill benefit the people of Somalia as well as the entire region.\n  The United States has a critical interest in establishing a secure \nand stable government and society in Somalia. I support the U.S. \nstrategy in Somalia and believe that the only way to stabilize the \ncountry is through political reform, humanitarian assistance, \ndeployment of African Union forces, and to keep terrorists from seeking \nrefuge in Somalia. It is important that the Senate recognize that it is \nin the interest of the United States, as well as the entire region, \nthat the sustainable peace in Somalia we seek create a government that \ndoes not threaten or seek to destabilize its neighbors or provide safe \nhaven to known terrorists that are a threat to the U.S. and the Horn of \nAfrica.\n  I also wish to emphasize that it is equally important that the Senate \ntake great care in calling for a timeline for the withdrawal of \nEthiopia's troops from Somalia. The resolution calls on Ethiopia to \ndevelop a timeline for the ``responsible'' withdrawal of its armed \nforces from Somalia. I believe Ethiopia to be in full agreement with \nthis language and would like to withdraw its forces as soon as \npossible; however, a ``responsible withdrawal'' requires a replacement \nto maintain peace and stability and to stop terrorism. I would urge the \nAfrican Union to continue sending peacekeeping forces to Somalia so \nthat the Ethiopian forces can withdraw.\n  Furthermore, I strongly support all efforts that help convince \nEritrea to play a constructive role in helping to bring about a stable \nSomalia. I urge the African Union, the United Nations and other \npeacekeeping groups in the region to pressure Eritrea to work with its \nregional partners to bring about peace and stability in Somalia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5437-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CLIMATE SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a statement that \nSenator Pryor made on Friday, June 6. On that day, Senator Pryor rose \nto express his support for the basic approach that the Lieberman-Warner \nClimate Security Act takes to reducing emissions of certain greenhouse \ngases called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. Senator Pryor praised our \ndecision, in crafting the Climate Security Act, to subject HFCs to a \nseparate cap-and-trade system rather than including them under the same \ncap with less potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. He \nexpressed his hope that the initial level and reduction rate of the HFC \ncap could be revised before the bill becomes law. I welcome Senator \nPryor's focus on the Climate Security Act's HFC provisions, and I would \nlike to work with him on that portion of the bill as it moves through \nthe legislative process. I remain interested in increasing the \nspecificity of those provisions while simultaneously expanding the area \nof consensus among manufacturers of HFCs, distributors of HFCs, \nmanufacturers of equipment that uses HFCs, and the environmental \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5437-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5437-S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN LIONEL VAN DEERLIN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember former Member of \nthe House of Representatives Lionel Van Deerlin, who passed away on May \n18, 2008, at the age of 93.\n  Lionel Van Deerlin, affectionately known as ``Van,'' served in \nCongress for over 18 years, representing San Diego. His legislative \nlegacy includes a key role in revising the Federal laws to permit \nCalifornia to set tougher emission standards than the rest of the \nNation. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Communications, he \nactively worked to update the 1934 Federal Communications Act in order \nto keep up with changing technologies. A leader in ethics, he was among \nthe first congressional leaders to voluntarily disclose his personal \nfinances.\n  Lionel was born in Los Angeles, CA, on July 25, 1914, and grew up in \nnorth San Diego County. He attended the University of Southern \nCalifornia, where he was editor of the Daily Trojan, and graduated in \n1937. After graduation, he worked in journalism until World War II. \nLionel honorably served\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\nour Nation in the U.S. Army, returning to journalism and San Diego \nafter the war.\n  A gentleman, a statesman, and a friend to all, Van earned the respect \nof his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He tirelessly worked on \nbehalf of the people of San Diego. His legacy is substantial in San \nDiego--he helped to establish the Naval Medical Center San Diego as \nwell as a Veterans' Administration hospital. Lionel's spirit continues \nin the generations of leaders he mentored and counseled.\n  After leaving Congress in 1981, Van returned to journalism as a \npolitical columnist, first for the San Diego Tribune and later for the \nUnion-Tribune. His columns, which were eagerly read by San Diegans \nregardless of political party, were remarkable for the clarity and \ncommon sense they brought to the political process. As a writer, his \nchief targets were hypocrisy and vested interests, while his chief \npassions were American participatory democracy and the San Diego region \nhe knew and served so well.\n  Van is survived by three daughters: Mary Susan, Victoria, and \nElizabeth Louise; two sons: Jeff and John; and four grandchildren.\n  Our country has lost a remarkable public servant and tutor with the \npassing of Lionel Van Deerlin. His contributions to the people of San \nDiego, the State of California, and our Nation should be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5438-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LITIGATION COST DEDUCTIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on March 8, 2007, I introduced S. 814. \nThe bill has nine cosponsors: Senators Graham, Smith, Crapo, Martinez, \nLandrieu, Wyden, Leahy, Salazar, and Stabenow. It was included in the \nenergy/business tax extenders package, on which a vote on the motion to \nproceed failed today.\n  S. 814, would allow attorneys to deduct reimbursable court costs and \nexpenses--expert witness fees, copying and transcription costs, travel \nexpenses--in the same tax period in which they are paid or incurred. \nFor attorneys paid on a contingency fee basis, the Internal Revenue \nService treats these expenditures as ``loans'' that may be repaid from \nany award or settlement at the end of the case. For this reason, \ncurrently most attorneys may take a deduction only in the same period \nhe recognizes the income from the award--which may be years after the \nattorney has paid the expense/cost. This is a burden on, and often \nunfair to, solo practitioners and attorneys in small firms who may have \nto assume costly loans because they do not have the resources to carry \nthese expenses for multiple years.\n  In addition, the tax treatment of these expenses is not uniform in \nall jurisdictions--as some courts have disagreed with the IRS on the \ncurrent treatment. This is another reason the current rule is unfair \nand should be changed. Finally, I note that the IRS interpretation is \nbased on State legal ethics rules about advances to clients that have \nsince been changed.\n  I voted against cloture on the motion to proceed even though I \nobviously support S. 814, and although I also support the tax extenders \nthat expired at the end of 2007--including the R tax credit, teacher \nexpenses deduction, tuition deduction, and accelerated depreciation for \nleasehold and restaurant improvements. I also support some tax \nextenders that are set to expire at the end of 2008 --including \nrenewable energy tax incentives.\n  The main sticking point between Democrats and Republicans is whether \ntemporary extensions of tax relief should be offset with permanent tax \nincreases elsewhere. On April 23, 2008, I, along with 40 other \nRepublicans, wrote to Finance Chairman Baucus to support ``enacting a \n2008 AMT patch and extending the various expiring tax provision without \noffsetting tax increases.''\n  The vote was a demonstration by Republicans that they have numbers \nand that they need to be included in the process of drafting the bill. \nRepublican leadership had no expectation that any Republican amendments \nwould be allowed because of Leader Reid's standard operating procedure \nof filling the tree and filing cloture.\n  I am told that the leadership on both sides and the chairman and \nranking member of Finance will now sit down to discuss the next steps. \nI think this is a positive development and I will encourage the \ninclusion in a bipartisan bill of the proposed amendment to the \nInternal Revenue Code that is embodied in S. 814.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5438-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REQUEST TO BE NOTIFIED\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

It is \n     another thing to understand, in flesh and blood terms, what \n     that means in the lives of ordinary Americans. Yes, since \n     George W. Bush has been in office 5 million Americans have \n     slipped into poverty, 8 million have lost their health \n     insurance and 3 million have lost their pensions. Yes, in the \n     last 7 years median household income for working-age \n     Americans has declined by $2,500. Yes, our country, for the \n     first time since the Great Depression, now has a zero \n     personal savings rate and, all across the Nation, emergency \n     food shelves are being flooded with working families whose \n     inadequate wages prevent them from feeding their families.\n       Statistics are one thing, however, and real life is \n     another. The responses that I received describe the decline \n     of the American middle class from the perspective of those \n     people who are living that decline. They speak about families \n     who, not long ago, thought they were economically secure, but \n     now find themselves sinking into desperation and \n     hopelessness.\n       These e-mails tell the stories of working families unable \n     to keep their homes warm in the winter; workers worried about \n     whether they'll be able to fill their gas tank to get to \n     their jobs; and seniors, who spent their entire lives \n     working, now wondering how they'll survive in old age. They \n     describe the pain and disappointments that parents feel as \n     they are unable to save money for their kids' college \n     education, and the dread of people who live without health \n     insurance.\n       In order to try and break through the complacency and \n     isolation inside the Washington Beltway, I have read some of \n     these stories on the floor of the Senate. It is imperative \n     that Congress and the corporate media understand the painful \n     reality facing the middle class today so that we can develop \n     the appropriate public policy to address this crisis. We must \n     expand low income home heating assistance, stop oil \n     profiteering and price gouging, and support programs that \n     address the growing crisis of hunger in America. The National \n     Priorities Act (S. 818) that I introduced in this session of \n     Congress is one example of legislation that would address the \n     growing crisis.\n       Let me conclude by thanking all of those people who have so \n     kindly shared their lives with me through these letters. I \n     know that for many of you this was not an easy thing to do.\n                                                   Bernie Sanders,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n       Here are letters from two mothers in Vermont. The first is \n     from a woman in rural area; the second is a single mother in \n     a small city.\n\n     We have at times had to choose between baby food and heating \n         fuel.\n       My husband and I have lived in Vermont our whole lives. We \n     have two small children (a baby and a toddler) and felt \n     fortunate to own our own house and land but due to the \n     increasing fuel prices we have at times had to choose between \n     baby food/diapers and\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n     heating fuel. We've run out of heating fuel three times so \n     far and the baby has ended up in the hospital with pneumonia \n     two of the times. We try to keep the kids warm with an \n     electric space heater on those nights, but that just doesn't \n     do the trick.\n       My husband does what he can just to scrape enough money for \n     car fuel each week and we've gone from three vehicles to one \n     just to try and get by without going further into debt. We \n     were going to sell the house and rent, but the rent around \n     here is higher than what we pay for our monthly mortgage and \n     property taxes combined. Please help.\n     By February we ran out of wood and I burned my mother's \n         dining room furniture.\n       I am a single mother with a 9 year old boy. We lived this \n     past winter without any heat at all. Fortunately someone gave \n     me an old wood stove. I had to hook it up to an old/unused \n     chimney we had in the kitchen. I couldn't even afford a \n     chimney liner (the price of liners went up with the price of \n     fuel). To stay warm at night my son and I would pull off all \n     the pillows from the couch and pile them on the kitchen \n     floor. I'd hang a blanket from the kitchen doorway and we'd \n     sleep right there on the floor. By February we ran out of \n     wood and I burned my mother's dining room furniture. I have \n     no oil for hot water. We boil our water on the stove and pour \n     it in the tub. I'd like to order one of your flags and hang \n     it upside down at the capital building...we are certainly a \n     country in distress.\n\n       These two letters describe the pressures faced by \n     Vermonters on family life.\n     Not spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son \n         makes a big difference for all of us . . .\n       As a couple with one child, earning about $55,000/year, we \n     have been able to eat out a bit, buy groceries and health \n     insurance, contribute to our retirement funds and live a \n     relatively comfortable life financially. We've never \n     accumulated a lot of savings, but our bills were always paid \n     on time and we never had any interest on our credit card.\n       Over the last year, even though we've tightened our belts \n     (not eating out much, watching purchases at the grocery \n     store, not buying ``extras'' like a new TV, repairing the \n     washer instead of buying a new one...), and we find ourselves \n     with over $7,000 of credit card debt and trying to figure out \n     how to pay for braces for our son.\n       I work 50 hours per week to help earn extra money to catch \n     up, but that also takes a toll on the family life--not \n     spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son makes \n     a big difference for all of us. My husband hasn't had a raise \n     in 3 years, and his employer is looking to cut out any extra \n     benefits they can to lower their expenses, which will \n     increase ours.\n     I want to drop everything I am doing and go visit him.\n       My 90-year-old father in Connecticut has recently become \n     ill and asked me to visit him. I want to drop everything I am \n     doing and go visit him, however, I am finding it hard to save \n     enough money to add to the extra gas I'll need to get there. \n     I am self-employed, with my own commercial cleaning service \n     and money is tight, not only with gas prices, but with \n     everything. I make more than I did a year ago and I don't \n     have enough to pay my property taxes this quarter for the \n     first time in many years. They are due tomorrow.\n\n       These letters speak of retirement. One is from an older \n     Vermont couple who recently stopped working; the second is \n     from a woman in a small town in Vermont who is thinking about \n     the future she and her husband face.\n     We also only eat two meals a day to conserve.\n       My husband and I are retired and 65. We would have liked to \n     have worked longer but because of injuries caused at work and \n     the closing of our factory to go to Canada, we chose to \n     retire earlier.\n       Now with oil prices the way they are we cannot afford to \n     heat our home unless my husband cuts and splits wood, which \n     is a real hardship as he has had his back fused and should \n     not be working most of the day to keep up with the wood. Not \n     only that he has to get up two or three times each night to \n     keep the fire going.\n       We also have a 2003 car that we only get to drive to get \n     groceries or go to the doctor or to visit my mother in the \n     nursing home three miles away. It now costs us $80.00 a month \n     to go nowhere. We have 42,000 miles on a 5 year old car.\n       I have Medicare but I can't afford prescription coverage \n     unless I take my money out of an annuity, which is supposed \n     to cover the house payment when my husband's pension is gone.\n       We also only eat two meals a day to conserve.\n     My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to \n         us when we are old.\n       Yesterday I paid for our latest home heating fuel delivery: \n     $1,100. I also paid my $2,000+ credit-card balance, much of \n     which bought gas and groceries for the month.\n       My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to \n     us when we are old. Although we have three jobs between us \n     and participate in 403B retirement plans, we have not saved \n     enough for a realistic post-work life if we survive to our \n     life expectancy. As we approach the traditional retirement \n     age, we are slowly paying off our daughter's college tuition \n     loan and trying to keep our heads above water.\n       We have always lived frugally. We buy used cars and store \n     brand groceries, recycle everything, walk or carpool when \n     possible and plastic our windows each fall. Even so, if/when \n     our son decides to attend college, we will be in deep debt at \n     age 65.\n       P.S. Please don't use my name. I live in a small town, and \n     this is so embarrassing.\n       These letters speak about the emotional consequences of the \n     current economic situation and are from a man who lives in a \n     small town near the New Hampshire border, and from a woman \n     who lives in central Vermont.\n     The pennies have all but dried up . . . Today I am sad, \n         broken, and very discouraged.\n       I, too, have been struggling to overcome the increasing \n     costs of gas, heating oil, food, taxes, etc. I have to say \n     that this is the toughest year, financially, that I have ever \n     experienced in my 41 years on this earth. I have what used to \n     be considered a decent job, I work hard, pinch my pennies, \n     but the pennies have all but dried up. I am thankful that my \n     employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive \n     to work 5 days a week. Instead, I work three 15-hour days. I \n     have taken odd jobs to try to make ends meet.\n       This winter, after keeping the heat just high enough to \n     keep my pipes from bursting (the bedrooms are not heated and \n     never got above 30 degrees) I began selling off my \n     woodworking tools, snowblower, (pennies on the dollar) and \n     furniture that had been handed down in my family from the \n     early 1800s, just to keep the heat on.\n       Today I am sad, broken, and very discouraged. I am thankful \n     that the winter cold is behind us for a while, but now gas \n     prices are rising yet again. I just can't keep up.\n     I don't go to church many Sundays, because the gasoline is \n         too expensive to drive there.\n       As a single parent, I am struggling everyday to put food on \n     the table. Our clothes all come from thrift stores. I have a \n     5-year-old car that needs work. My son is gifted and \n     talented. I tried to sell my house to enroll him in a school \n     that had curriculum available for his special needs. After 2 \n     years on the market, my house never sold. The property taxes \n     have nearly doubled in 10 years and the oil to heat it is \n     prohibitive. To meet the needs of my son, I have left the \n     house sit and moved into an apartment near his high school. I \n     don't go to church many Sundays, because the gasoline is too \n     expensive to drive there. Every thought of an activity is \n     dependent on the cost. I can only purchase food from dented \n     can stores . . . I am stretched to the breaking point with no \n     help in sight.\n       More descriptions of what it feels like to be caught in the \n     American economy of the early years of the 21st century. \n     These letters are from a man in north central Vermont and \n     from a man in rural Pennsylvania.\n     At the rate we are going we will be destitute in just a few \n         years.\n       Due to illness my ability to work has been severely \n     limited. I am making $10 an hour and if I am lucky I get 35 \n     hours a week of work. At this time I am only getting 20 hours \n     as it is ``off season'' in Stowe. It does not take a \n     mathematician to do the figures. How are my wife and I \n     supposed to live on a monthly take-home income of less than \n     $800? We do it by spending our hard earned retirement \n     savings. I am 50 and my wife is 49. At the rate we are going \n     we will be destitute in just a few years. The situation is so \n     dire that it is all I can think about.\n       Soon I will have to start walking to work, an 8-mile round \n     trip because the price of energy is so high it is that or go \n     without heat.\n       As bad as our situation is, I know many in worse shape. We \n     try to donate food when we do our weekly shopping but now we \n     are not able to even afford to help our neighbors eat. What \n     has this country come to?\n     I am just tired . . . I work 12 to 14 hours daily and it just \n         doesn't help.\n       I am 55 years old and worse off than my adult children. I \n     have worked since age 16. I don't live from paycheck to \n     paycheck, I live day to day. I can only afford to fill my gas \n     tank on my payday thereafter, I put $5, $10 whatever that I \n     can. I cannot afford to buy the food items that I would. I am \n     riding around daily to and from work with a quarter of a tank \n     of gas. This is very scary as I can see myself working until \n     the day that I die. I do not have a savings, no credit cards \n     and my only resources are thru my employment. I have to drive \n     to work as there are no buses from my residence to work. I \n     don't know how much longer I can do this. . . . I am \n     concerned as gas prices climb daily. I am just tired, the \n     harder that I work the harder it gets, I work 12 to 14 hours \n     daily and it just doesn't help.\n       Two women, the first from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, \n     the second from a small city in Vermont, write about their \n     situation and their fears.\n     Now we find that instead of a feeling of comfort, we have a \n         feeling of dread.\n       I live in the beautiful Northeast Kingdom. There are only a \n     handful of decent jobs available, and the wages everywhere \n     else are not very good. My husband and I have done what we \n     had to in order to survive and to make a decent life for our \n     two children, aged 7 and 4. He has worked steadily at a local \n     plant for 15 years, and I have worked part-time in order to \n     pay the bills without having to rely on daycare. We live a \n     modest life and do not live beyond our means. We have no \n     flat-screen TV, no cell phones, no iPods, and have only one \n     vehicle payment. We thought that finally, maybe, we would be \n     able to get ahead.\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\n       Now we find that instead of a feeling of comfort, we have a \n     feeling of dread. It seems like every time we do the right \n     thing and try to move ahead for our family, something out of \n     our control happens in order to slap us back down. I have \n     always been a big pusher of ``if you can do something to \n     change your situation, do it.'' Now, even though we are doing \n     everything right, my husband and I find ourselves extremely \n     worried about this winter. I have no answers as to how to \n     make the oil prices lower.\n       My husband and I have tried, again, to do the right things \n     by limiting our driving and by setting the heat at 68 degrees \n     all winter. We even had our home made as energy efficient as \n     possible, yet we now find ourselves unsure if we will be able \n     to pay for both the mortgage and our oil next winter.\n     Some nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's \n         all I have.\n       I am a working mother of two young children. I currently \n     pay on average around $80.00 a week for gas so that I can go \n     to work. I see the effects of the gas increase at the grocery \n     stores and at the department stores. On average I spend \n     around $150.00 per week at the grocery store and trust me \n     when I say I don't buy prime rib--I buy just enough to get us \n     through the week and I can't afford to make sure we have \n     seven wholesome meals to eat every night of the week--some \n     nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's all \n     I have. My family has had to cancel our annual trip to the \n     zoo, and we make less trips to see our families in another \n     town due to the increase of gas. The price of gas has created \n     a hardship for most average Americans. We have less money to \n     pay to living expenses which have also increased. It seems as \n     if it's just a rippling effect. I am really scared of what \n     the future holds for me and my kids because I just simply \n     cannot afford to live from day to day. I am getting further \n     and further in credit card debt just trying to stay afloat.\n       Some letters are from people who work in health care and \n     report on what is happening in their towns. The first of \n     these is from a small town in north-central Vermont; the \n     second is from a small town in the state of Washington.\n     Insurance costs continue to rise causing some to forgo \n         insurance to pay for gasoline, heating fuel and \n         groceries.\n       As the chief of a small ambulance service, I have seen the \n     impact of rising costs.\n       As a service made up of primarily volunteers, we have seen \n     our numbers decline. When soliciting for volunteers from the \n     community, we have been told that they are unable to put the \n     time in due to the need to work more just to pay their bills.\n       Our costs associated with running an ambulance have also \n     risen in the last few years. When discussing with our \n     suppliers, fuel prices play a large part in the increase--\n     both to manufacture and to transport.\n       We are hearing from more and more Vermonters that insurance \n     costs continue to rise causing some to forgo insurance to pay \n     for gasoline, heating fuel and groceries.\n       In speaking with other ambulance services both volunteer \n     and paid, most including ours, are delaying purchases on \n     major equipment such as ambulance replacements, due to \n     limited funding. This means we have older equipment, and \n     higher maintenance costs.\n     Dentistry is expensive and people are opting not to come to \n         the dentist.\n       I live in Washington. I drive about 10 miles to work every \n     day. I drive an eight-year-old car that gets about 25 miles \n     per gallon. My husband is a contractor and drives a small \n     pickup truck that gets very poor mileage. Together I have \n     estimated that we spend about $300 a month on gas. This has a \n     tremendous effect on our budget. We are watching every penny \n     we spend.\n       I work in a dental clinic that is also seeing a slowdown. \n     Dentistry is expensive and people are opting not to come to \n     the dentist or not getting the optimal dentistry they need. I \n     spoke to the medical doctor across the hall from our office. \n     He was telling us that they too have seen a slowdown in their \n     practice. People are forgoing a trip to the doctor to save \n     money. One of my patients told me a story yesterday about a \n     food bank in town that is finding it difficult to keep its \n     shelves full. They had a realtor who was a regular \n     contributor. Now she was coming to get food for herself. The \n     cost of food is rising at a tremendous rate.\n       Rising gas prices have an effect on medical care as well, \n     as this letter from an oncology social worker in a Vermont \n     city reveals.\n     I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these folks \n         who need to travel great distances to get to/from their \n         cancer treatment.\n       My story involves my capacity as an oncology social worker \n     working with cancer patients in an outpatient clinic. I also \n     run an emergency fund through the Cancer Patient Support \n     Program which provides funds to cancer patients in need \n     during their cancer journey, including initial diagnosis, \n     surgery, and treatment period in which they experience a \n     significant decrease in income during a medical leave.\n       I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these \n     folks who need to travel great distances to get to/from their \n     cancer treatment and followup care with the way gas prices \n     have been!\n       Many of these folks need to travel on a daily basis to \n     radiation therapy for several weeks while others come from \n     surrounding counties every one to two weeks for chemotherapy. \n     It [the high price of gas] has had a tremendous impact on our \n     ability to provide the financial assistance through our \n     emergency fund to all those in need.\n       Someone with cancer who has to get treatment has no choice \n     in how many times they need to travel great distances. They \n     have to have reliable transportation, and thus need access to \n     gas for their cars, or another family member's car, to get to \n     their treatment and followup care.\n       This is becoming increasingly difficult as gas prices \n     continue to rise and our emergency fund cannot meet all the \n     financial needs of these patients.\n       This is the story of a woman who lives in a suburban \n     community near Burlington, Vermont. Following it is a short \n     letter from a senior citizen in a very small town in the \n     mountains of central Vermont.\n     I feel as though I am between a rock and a hard place no \n         matter how hard I try to adjust my budget for the month.\n       First of all, I am a single mother of a 16 year old \n     daughter. I own a condominium. I have worked at the hospital \n     for 16 years and make a very good salary, in the high $40,000 \n     range.\n       I own a 2005 Honda Civic. I filled up my gas tank \n     yesterday, April 1, and it cost me almost $43. That was at \n     $3.22 per gallon. If prices stay at that level, it will cost \n     me $160 per month to fill up my gas tank. A year ago it cost \n     me under $20 to fill up my tank. Which would have amounted to \n     approximately $80 per month. I now have to decide what \n     errands I really need to run and what things I can do over \n     the phone or on the Internet. But the other issue is if I use \n     my cell phone too much during the month my bill will increase \n     and that will cost me more money.\n       I feel as though I am between a rock and a hard place no \n     matter how hard I try to adjust my budget for the month. I am \n     watching my purchases in the grocery store and department \n     stores more closely because of increased prices. I am not \n     sure that I can afford to take a summer vacation this year. I \n     usually take a day off during my daughter's spring vacation \n     so we can go shopping in New Hampshire somewhere. I have \n     already cancelled those plans for this year. I am hoping that \n     I can take a few days off this summer to go to Maine. We will \n     see how the gas prices are this summer but I hear it is going \n     to get worse. Not much hope for someone on a tight budget.\n     I have been forced to go back to work.\n       I am a 71 year old man and have been retired since 2000. \n     With the price of fuel oil I have been forced to go back to \n     work just to heat my home and pay my property taxes.\n       These two women who live in small towns in central Vermont \n     write about their sense that their families are sinking, \n     economically.\n     We would like to not have to worry about where our next meal \n         will come from.\n       I am a registered school nurse in Vermont, and my husband \n     is a self-employed bread baker. We are in our mid 30's and \n     have two young children. We always thought that if we went to \n     college, earned 4-year degrees, and worked hard, that we \n     would be able to live a decent life. We have no desire to be \n     wealthy, but would like to not have to worry about where our \n     next meal will come from.\n       As you know, wheat prices are soaring. Over the last year, \n     he has seen his price per 50-pound bag of flour increase \n     about $10 or more (last week alone, price per bag went up \n     $2.75). We are feeling distraught that we may never ``get \n     ahead'' but will always be pedaling to just keep up . . . \n     Employed in Vermont since 1997, I will be paying back my \n     nursing loans for a long time--longer now that we just can't \n     keep up with the rising costs of oil and wheat.\n       My husband and I both work very, very hard to provide \n     needed services to our Vermont communities. Yet we scratch \n     our heads when trying to budget our income. How can it be \n     that two college-educated individuals with respectable \n     careers are in such a financial bind?\n     My husband and I followed all the rules . . . Slowly, though, \n         we have sunk back to the `poor' days.\n       My husband and I followed all the rules. He grew up in \n     urban projects and went into the military with Vietnam \n     service so he could get GI Bill benefits and go to college. I \n     grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker, but had a \n     mother who so pressed education that I was able to go to \n     college on scholarship and by working full time nights in a \n     mental hospital. My husband and I worked hard to buy a home, \n     maintain good credit, even taking government jobs because we \n     truly wanted to help others. I became disabled and unable to \n     work, but we managed to live a middle-class life on one \n     salary.\n       Slowly, though, we have sunk back to the `poor' days. Our \n     heating oil bill, gas prices, food prices--well, you know the \n     story. Even a pizza is a splurge now. The interest on our \n     meager savings doesn't seem worth keeping the money in the \n     bank. We're so much more fortunate than many others, since we \n     can still meet our bills, but we're scared that we'll drop \n     beneath that level soon. It doesn't seem right that after \n     working hard and following all the rules for our lives, now, \n     at 60, we're tumbling down.\n       These two letters, one from a man in a Chicago suburb, and \n     one from a teacher in Vermont's Connecticut River Valley, \n     also speak of the sense of falling behind in the 21st century \n     American economy.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n     It costs me so much money in gas that my wife and I live on \n         $6 per day to eat.\n       My job was transferred to China 8 years ago. No jobs were \n     available in my field. I tried to do everything I possibly \n     could do in finding another job outside of my field but \n     failed. My unemployment ran out. I lost everything: House, \n     cars and the will to live. My wife and I moved into my in-\n     law's basement after this catastrophe. I regained my never-\n     give-up outlook on life. I went back to school. I spent \n     $13,000 on my education to become a residential home \n     inspector. That market is in turmoil, and I can't make any \n     money in it these days. I am still self-employed now \n     performing various inspections on the commercial side within \n     the northern half of Illinois. I drive on average 250 miles \n     per day. It costs me so much money in gas that my wife and I \n     live on $6 per day to eat. I can't afford health insurance \n     for my wife and I because that money is in the gas tank every \n     week. The irony of it is my wife is a nurse. She's expecting \n     the doctor she works with to close his office any day now \n     because he's behind in his malpractice insurance. His \n     premiums are too high and he's 120 days past due on his \n     office lease payments because he's trying to keep the \n     malpractice insurance in effect. He stopped offering health \n     insurance to his employees 2 years ago with his increasing \n     costs. I still live in a basement. Do you need any more \n     evidence that our country and our leaders have failed me?\n     How much more of a hit can people take? The future looks \n         extremely bleak to me.\n       Bernie, I am so frightened for next year, as I struggle \n     daily this year. I drive past the gas stations and see the \n     price go up. Those prices are going up even 10 cents a gallon \n     in one day.\n       What about heating fuel next year? I spent this winter with \n     my heat turned down to 53 degrees, varying it only for a few \n     hours after I returned home from work. I have my master's \n     degree and am a teacher. I am struggling so hard in my new \n     home. It's a double wide and I've waited 50 years to get my \n     own home. Now, I am worried I won't be able to keep it as \n     everything else is going up, except my salary, which next \n     year will only go up slightly more than 1 percent.\n       The middle class is no longer the middle class...I've \n     slipped into the lower class after a winter of double heating \n     costs and now these new economic hits. How much more of a hit \n     can people take? The future looks extremely bleak to me. I \n     worry constantly about how I am going to pay my bills.\n       The first letter is from a young person in a small, rural, \n     college town in Vermont. The second was written by a woman \n     who lives in a city on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n     I am now living out of my car.\n       As a student and a part time employee working for just \n     above minimum wage I have found it more and more difficult to \n     survive under these conditions. The drive to school and work \n     require me to use roughly 30 percent of my paycheck just to \n     go where I need to, to make it through my day.\n       When school is in session I am lucky to get about 170 \n     dollars a week and with gas prices at their current all time \n     high I am continually finding myself under hardships because \n     of it. Recently I had to vacate my apartment because I could \n     not afford to pay rent and I am now living out of my car. \n     This too seems like it may not be able to last that much \n     longer because I am encountering difficulties in making my \n     car payment.\n       I can remember when gas prices were a little over a dollar \n     and I dream about life taking that turn once more. Because of \n     the gas prices I have found nothing but an extremely low \n     budget for food, I was forced out of my home and now I might \n     lose the one thing that is allowing me to continue my \n     schooling and keep going to work--my car.\n       I am struggling to understand why prices continue to rise \n     and I see no end in sight.\n     Our life style has drastically changed in the past 12 months.\n       I travel over 30 miles one way (60 miles roundtrip). My car \n     requires high test which is now $3.95/gal. I have approached \n     my company about doing a survey of its employees to see how \n     many co-workers travel over 20 miles one way, and suggested \n     that we start to work on a commuter policy. I suggested four \n     10-hour work days, telecommuting, setting up car pools, \n     setting up incentives for car poolers. I was turned down. I \n     was able to find another person who was interested in car \n     pooling & we have started to do that. I take breakfast, \n     coffee, lunch, and snacks to work daily. I do not go to the \n     hair dresser or nail salon as I used to. We stopped taking \n     weekend trips and plan to see our children in NJ only once \n     this year. Between the 30 percent credit card interest rates, \n     fuel cost, and food increases our life style has drastically \n     changed in the past 12 months.\n       Two women from Vermont write about what the economy is \n     doing to them and their families.\n     My mortgage is behind, we are at risk for foreclosure, and I \n         can't keep up with my car payments.\n       I am a 31 year old wife, mother of two. How has this \n     affected me? My husband drives 35 miles to work, that is a \n     one-way trip. He is putting an average of $80 a week into his \n     gas tank. No, he doesn't drive an SUV or a half-ton work \n     truck. It's a small pickup truck that he needs as he builds \n     houses. The kicker is that he never puts more than half a \n     tank in, because we can't afford to fill it. I drive 15 miles \n     one way, and put about $40 a week into my 30-miles-to-the-\n     gallon car. Again, I never fill the tank--ever. We have even \n     contemplated having my husband quit his job because he isn't \n     making much more money weekly than he spends on gas. We could \n     move to an area that is closer to our jobs, but because of \n     the market, we cannot sell our house fast enough, or for a \n     fair price.\n       Meanwhile, my mortgage is behind, we are at risk for \n     foreclosure, and I can't keep up with my car payments. My \n     parents, both in their 60's, are back to work so that they \n     can make ends meet, and struggle to come up with enough gas \n     money so they can get to doctor's appointments. They are \n     opting to close their house up for the winter, and stay with \n     my uncle so they don't have to put oil in their furnace. I \n     can't tell you how many times we had to fill our little gas \n     tanks with kerosene or diesel because we ran out of oil and \n     couldn't afford the $380 it would cost us to put a mere 100 \n     gallons in. Needless to say, we are way behind on all of our \n     bills, we are still playing catch up with our winter \n     expenses. People that I know that have never struggled with \n     money, are now frequenting our local food shelf so they can \n     feed their families staple foods. Please listen to our pleas \n     and put ethics first.\n     We are barely staying afloat.\n       My family has been hit so hard by this economy, we are \n     barely staying afloat. We have remortgaged the house 4 times \n     in the last three years to pay credit card debt. Now we are \n     trying to tap into our annuity to pay more credit card debt. \n     The debts on the credit cards are all for bills. Mostly \n     grocery, oil and the mere cost of living.\n       My husband is a union carpenter and they just changed our \n     fantastic insurance plan to a terrible one with barely any \n     coverage. I have none of my doctors on it and I suffer from \n     painful nerve damage. I am not eligible for social security \n     disability and I am unable to work.\n       We had a dream to own our own home, and that dream came \n     true seven years ago. I am afraid our dream is slipping \n     through our fingers and it won't be long before we lose our \n     home, the way things are going.\n       A young couple in Burlington, Vermont writes of their \n     situation and their concerns.\n     I wonder some times if we should try to follow our dreams--\n         decide to have children?\n       Even after we bought our house, there was a time when I \n     could save a little here and there and feel secure and \n     hopeful for the future.\n       Recently, I have been trying to stretch out time between \n     grocery trips and have chosen to postpone necessary repairs \n     to our house simply because we just don't have the money to \n     do so.\n       We are frugal people with simple spending habits, mainly \n     food and our house expenses. We ride bicycles, buy bulk foods \n     and used clothing, repair and mend before buying new, and we \n     love this life.\n       But if we can't fix our roof, or become malnourished from \n     food choices on a family income of $50,000 yr, then what does \n     the future hold for the next generation?\n       I wonder some times if we should try to follow our dreams--\n     decide to have children? Try to buy a farm? All of these \n     thoughts lead me to another emotion--sadness.\n       These letters, the first from a single mother in Vermont, \n     the second from a retired couple also in Vermont, ask \n     questions that we as a Nation should listen to.\n     People say, `Cut back.'\n       I am a single mother, owning a home, preparing to send a \n     son to college, and working two jobs most of the time. While \n     I am managing to keep my house (I think I'm upside down given \n     the slump in market value), I am falling behind on my bills \n     and have to use my credit card more often for necessities.\n       People say, `Cut back.'\n       When I look at my bank and credit card statements, I see; \n     gas, groceries, gas, fuel oil, gas, groceries, school-related \n     activities, car maintenance, gas, electricity. Cut back on \n     what? The occasional pizza between jobs and athletic events? \n     The trip to college to seek financial aid? Clothes for work \n     and school?\n     Does anybody have a solution? Does anybody in Washington \n         care?\n       Thanks for your invitation to talk with you. We are \n     retired, 70 and 65 and living on Social Security and some \n     savings.\n       Like most Vermonters we use wood to offset the price of \n     being warm. Our last oil fill up was nearly $700. How can we \n     continue to make ends meet? My gasoline cost $239 last month. \n     Food and everything else we buy is going up every week \n     because of gouging from oil companies. We are worried about \n     the national debt and the trade deficit. What can be done to \n     bring them down? Does anybody have a solution?

Mr. President, I, along with my Michigan colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, would like to congratulate Ron Mason on a long and \ndistinguished career at Michigan State University. He has been integral \nto the success of Michigan State's hockey program for more than 29 \nyears and has positively impacted the lives of many young people \nthroughout his tenure at MSU.\n  Ron Mason enjoys the distinction of being the winningest coach in \ncollege\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nhockey history. That is an impressive feat, one of which he, his family \nand the MSU community are proud. Ron spent 36 years as a college hockey \nhead coach, 23 of which were behind the bench at Michigan State \nUniversity. During his stellar career, he amassed 924 total wins and a \nrecord of 635-270-69 as head coach of the Spartans. Ron guided the \nSpartans to 17 CCHA regular season and playoff titles, and 23 \nappearances in the NCAA tournament, which stands as an all-time record. \nIn 1986, he led the Spartans to their second NCAA Hockey National \nChampionship in the school's history, and in 1972, he won a NAIA \nChampionship as head coach of Lake Superior State University.\n  After retiring as head coach of the Spartans, Ron accepted the job of \nathletic director at Michigan State, where he would continue to make \nimportant contributions to the success of the 25-sport athletic \ndepartment. Under his watch, the university won 11 conference \nchampionships and one national championship. Fittingly, the national \nchampionship was won by the ice hockey team, the program's third NCAA \nnational championship. Ron's legacy as athletic director also includes \nthe many contributions he has made in the lives of student-athletes at \nMSU off the field. These efforts include the PACT initiative which has \nenabled more than 300 student-athletes to participate in community \noutreach efforts, the establishment of the Student-Athlete \nMulticultural Center which provides leadership training to student-\nathletes, and his highly successful fundraising efforts for the \nathletic department.\n  One of the great privileges of coaching and working on the collegiate \nlevel is the impact an individual can have in shaping the lives of \nyoung men and women. Ron Mason accepted this responsibility and \nflourished. In the process, he has become an important figure in MSU's \nrich athletic tradition.\n  Ron's retirement will be aptly marked by a celebration on Thursday, \nJune 12 at MSU. We know our Senate colleagues join us in paying tribute \nto Ron Mason on his many accomplishments over the years and wish him \nand his family the very best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5442-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN REMEMBRANCE OF ALFRED WAGONER LOVELESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to Alfred Wagoner Loveless, a tireless and dedicated \ncommunity leader. Alfred was committed to serving the needs of his \ncommunity and served in various positions throughout his adult life in \nSaginaw. His contributions were many, and he will be missed by those \nwhose lives he touched.\n  Alfred Wagoner Loveless was born in Detroit, MI, on March 9, 1931, to \nClaude and Jesse Starr Loveless and moved shortly thereafter to \nSaginaw. He is a graduate of Saginaw High School. During his years at \nSaginaw High, he excelled athletically and would ultimately set several \nschool record in track and field. After his high school years, Alfred \nattended Bay City Junior College and Bishop College.\n  Alfred Wagoner Loveless was a man of great faith who was devoted to \nhis family and to his community, and he received numerous awards and \nrecognitions throughout his life as a result of his work. His community \nefforts focused on eradicating poverty, sickle cell prevention, along \nwith promoting self-determination and self-sufficiency. Alfred is \nmourned by his family, the members of Zion Baptist Church, and many in \nthe greater Saginaw community. Alfred is survived by his wife Gloria \nHill Loveless and his son, Wagoner T. Loveless, in addition to a large \nextended family.\n  This is, indeed, a great loss to all who knew him or for those who \nhave benefited from his work.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor Bill \nMcLaughlin, a man as renowned for his vision and leadership as for his \nsoft touch and utter humanity. Bill passed away on May 30, 2008, but \nhis legacy will live on for generations. Many remember Bill as a man \nwho turned the city of Wilmington into one of the financial capitals of \nthe world--I prefer to honor him as the truly decent, caring, and \nvisionary gentleman whom I have admired for my entire career.\n  To summarize Bill McLaughlin's life in a few words is beyond my \ncapabilities. It is impossible for me to speak of this brother, father, \nand grandfather in terms of his well-documented public accomplishments. \nTo me, Bill McLaughlin was a friend, and a man.\n  As Shakespeare wrote, ``His life was gentle, and the elements / So \nmixed in him that Nature might stand up / And say to all the world, / \nThis was a man!''\n  Bill McLaughlin was a man. As we Irish say when we want to pay the \nhighest compliment: Bill McLaughlin was a good man.\n  Bill was, at his core, a family man. He viewed everything through the \nprism of family. And he was a great city leader because he loved the \ncity of Wilmington. On any given Sunday, you were as likely to see him \nat an African-American church as you were at Catholic mass.\n  Of all Bill's wonderful qualities, perhaps the most unique--and most \nuseful--was his style of leadership. He had the insight to know what \nhad to be done and the wisdom to make other people think it was their \nidea.\n  He was one of the last men and women of the ``greatest generation,'' \nrecognizing that the values he was raised with--honor, decency, \nhumility and sacrifice--were universal values that defined who we are \nas a nation. He used those ideals as his guidance, which is why Bill's \ncourageous decisions as an elected official were both profound and \nsimple for him. They were not difficult for him because they were \nobvious to him; Bill always knew his true north.\n  Bill McLaughlin was a model for all of us, not just elected \nofficials. He lived his life, from beginning to end, by the same \nguiding principles upon which our Nation is built. Bill will be sorely \nmissed, but as long as we remember his lessons, the world will be \nbetter off.

Averill as he retires after almost 50 years \nof service in education.\n  This month, Dr. Donald Averill will retire as chancellor of the San \nBernardino Community College District, SBCCD. Prior to joining SBCCD, \nDr. Averill served as the CEO of Palo Verde College. Dr. Averill more \nthan doubled the enrollment of full-time students to provide increased \neducational opportunities throughout the region. His leadership enabled \nphysical and economic growth of academic infrastructure and enabled \nPalo Verde College to earn accreditation. During his tenure as the CEO \nfor the San Bernardino Community College District, he greatly improved \nthe economic capacities of the district and increased cooperation \nbetween colleges and secondary institutions, increasing enrollment in \nthe region by 45 percent.\n  Throughout his 47 years of service and commitment to improvements in \neducation, Dr. Donald Averill provided leadership both in California \nhigher education and in the San Bernardino community. He served as \nchairman of the Economic and Workforce Development Advisory Committee \nto the California Community College Board of Governors for 2 years and \nchaired the Human Resources Commission of the Association of California \nCommunity College Administrators for 5 years.

Despite recent health challenges, \nthis June she will celebrate her 82nd birthday and can look back on a \nproud career in public service.\n  A sixth-generation resident of the City of Pomona, Nell Soto has been \na lifelong member of the southern California community and has been a \nstrong advocate for its communities throughout her life. Before coming \nto the California Legislature, Nell Soto served 12 years on the city \ncouncil in Pomona. Her late husband Philip Soto served two terms in the \nstate legislature from 1962 to 1966. Nell was the first woman from the \nSan Gabriel Valley to serve on the South Coast Air Quality Management \nBoard. She served 10 years as a public affairs representative with the \nLos Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In 1998 she \nwas elected to the California Assembly and in March of 2000 won a \nspecial election to secure a seat in the California State senate, a \nseat that she held until 2006. She now serves once again in the \nCalifornia Assembly.\n  Throughout her tenure in the California Legislature, Nell has been an \nimpassioned advocate for stronger communities and an improved quality \nof life and has worked to make improvements throughout the California \neducational system.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \noutstanding advocate of small and rural business, Elton ``Mick'' \nRingsak, who will be concluding his time as Small Business \nAdministration Region VIII Administrator in July of 2008.\n  For nearly 8 years he has been a champion for small business in rural \nAmerica. He has recognized the important role they play in \nstrengthening the local and national economies of our country and I \nhave appreciated the excellent work he has done for the State of North \nDakota. Mick has worked hard to provide Federal assistance to small \nbusinesses so they can be productive and grow.\n  Not only is Mick Ringsak an advocate for small and rural businesses \nin America, he is also an outstanding person. He has never lost the \nvalues he gained growing up in Grafton, ND. During my years as Tax \nCommissioner for the State of ND, I had the opportunity to work closely \nwith his father, a legislator in the State Senate from the Grafton \narea.\n  Mick and his wife Claire are parents of three sons, Quint, Justin and \nZach. He is trustworthy, honest, and dedicated to making the economic \nenvironment friendlier to small and rural businesses. Prior to his \nappointment appointed as the SBA Region VIII Administrator in 2001, \nMick, a Vietnam veteran, owned and managed Miller's Boots and Shoes \nalong with his brother-in-law in Butte, MT.\n  I appreciate his work as SBA Region VIII Administrator, and I wish \nMick well in his future endeavors. I have enjoyed working with him in \ndeveloping North Dakota's small and rural businesses and he has also \nbeen a good friend. I wish him all the best in his upcoming retirement \nand look forward to his continuing leadership for small business for \nmany years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5443-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF AYR, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 21 \nand 22, the residents of Ayr will come together to celebrate their \ncommunity and its historic founding.\n  Ayr is located in Cass County. Although its population is small, Ayr \nholds an important place in our State's history. Originally founded in \nOctober 1883 as Dunlop, the town was officially renamed Ayr by \npostmaster Frank Dickinson. He chose to name the community Ayr in \nrecognition of Ayrshire, Scotland, the ancestral home of many of Ayr's \ncitizens at the time. Later, some residents tried to change the name of \nthe town again, but the territorial legislature took action to put an \nend to the renaming effort.\n  Ayr is a community dedicated to service, with many citizens serving \nboth in the government and military. Many in the community have also \nplayed a role in defining the preservation of North Dakotan history, \nwith community members such as Keith Johnson who was responsible for \nmuch of the restoration of historic buildings in the Cass County \n`Pioneer Village' project.\n  Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating Ayr, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary \nand in wishing them well for the future. By honoring Ayr and all other \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering, frontier spirit alive \nfor future generations. It is places such as Ayr that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Ayr has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5443-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5443-S5444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAGUE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 4 \nand 5, the residents of Hague will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  In 1882, a rural post office was established to serve the Grandin \nBrothers Bonanza Farm. In 1882, the Bonanza farm was 40,000 acres, \nwhich made it the largest wheat farm in the world. This Bonanza farm \nwas managed by a man named John A. Hague, and he eventually lent his \nname to the town of Hague.\n  Today, Hague is a small but vibrant community in south, central North \nDakota. Residents of the community are truly proud of the St. Mary's \nCatholic Church, a Gothic-style, brick building built in 1929 that is \non the National Register of Historic Places. St. Mary's Church \npossesses an iron cross cemetery that is a German-Russian tradition, \nwhich makes it a unique cultural gem.\n  To celebrate its 100th anniversary, the town of Hague will be having \na wide range of events. To start off the festivities, the residents \nwill be participating in a Tractor Trek. The town will also have a \nrodeo, parade, concerts, a magician, cloggers, and fireworks. Kristi \nGoblade, a local resident of Hague, will be performing cowgirl yodeling \nat the opening ceremony. A performance by Mylo Hatzenbuhler, a country \nhumorist, is also expected.\n  Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating Hague, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years \nand in wishing them well in the future. I believe that by honoring \nHague and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep \nthe frontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. On June 21-22, the residents of Kief will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Kief is a small town located in the center of North Dakota with a \npopulation of 16. The land upon which Kief was founded was first \nhomesteaded by a Ukrainian immigrant named Anton Bokovoy. In 1908, he \nsold half of his land to the Tri-State Land Company, which then sold \nthe land to other settlers from Scandinavia, Russia, and Germany, \neffectively establishing the town of Kief. It was customary to give the \nfirst settler the opportunity to name the town. Anton Bokovoy chose to \nname the settlement after his birthplace of Kiev, Ukraine.\n  Kief grew throughout the years. In 1910, the town was able to \nconstruct a schoolhouse, which served the community's students until it \nwas closed in 1959. Kief officially became a village in 1918. At that \ntime, the town had about 300 inhabitants. The many businesses that \nopened in Kief made the town a pleasant place to live. Multiple grain \nelevators and businesses related to agriculture offered a livelihood to \nmany of the town's residents. In their free time, residents of Kief \ncould be found enjoying themselves at the outdoor theater, pool hall, \nand bowling alley.\n  Today, Kief supports three businesses. Krueger's Standard Grocery has \nbeen in operation since 1982. Recently, a long haul trucking company \nand a truck freight brokerage have been established.\n  Current and former residents of Kief will gather to celebrate the \n100th anniversary. They will enjoy a parade, an ice cream social, and a \nstreet dance. Children and adults will play horseshoes, tug o' war, and \nother games throughout the weekend. Horse and buggy rides will remind \ncelebrants of the conveyances of yesteryear.\n  Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating Kief, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and \nin wishing them well through the next century. I believe that by \nhonoring Kief and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, \nwe keep the frontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. During \nthis year's July 4th celebration, the residents of Lakota will gather \nto celebrate their community's history and founding.\n  In 1882, Lakota, a Great Northern Railroad site, was founded. Lakota \nwas named by Gov. Nehemiah G. Ordway for the Sioux word meaning \n``allies.'' Lakota's post office was established in 1883, and it was \ndesignated as the county seat in 1883. Lakota officially became a city \nin 1889.\n  Today, Lakota remains a small, proud farming community. Lakota \nresidents enjoy many outdoor activities, from hunting to fishing in \nnearby Devils and Stump Lakes. Many residents take pride in the local \ngolf course, Lakota Rock Creek Golf Course, saying that it is the \n``best course around.'' The community is home to the A. M. Tofthagen \nLibrary and Museum, which was recognized in 1991 as a North Dakota \nhistorical site by the National Register of Historic Places.\n  To celebrate the 125th anniversary, the residents of Lakota will \ngather for a wide range of events. An All School Reunion will be held \nduring the same weekend of the anniversary celebration. Lakota will \nalso celebrate with a variety show, banquet, craft show, parade, BBQ, a \ndance, car and motorcycle show, and lots of activities for the kids.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Lakota, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 125 years and wishing them well in the future. \nBy honoring Lakota and all the other historic small towns of North \nDakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future \ngenerations.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in Eddy County, ND, that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. From July 3-6, the residents of New Rockford will gather \nto celebrate their community's history and founding.\n  The Eddy County region was populated mainly by settlers of \nScandinavian origin. The first pioneers followed the trail blazed by \nearlier Red River buffalo hunters. Later, they came by way of the \nNorthern Pacific Railway.\n  In 1882, Captain Walter G. Dunn established his merchandise store and \npost office just to the south of present-day New Rockford. As the \nrailroads stretched northward, townsite promoters appeared a year \nlater. These advocates sited the settlement along the James River and \ninitially called it Garrison. Since Garrison was the name of another \npost office, the settlers decided upon the name New Rockford, derived \nfrom the area's river crossing.\n  Today, New Rockford is a quiet, scenic place of 1,463 people. The \ntownship anchors a dynamic farm economy and contains a 117-acre \nindustrial park. New Rockford is renowned for holding the Central North \nDakota Steam Thresher's Reunion every third weekend of September, where \na unique collection of antique operational steam engines is displayed. \nIn addition, the community's rugged pioneering tradition persists and \nhas been passed on to hometown son James Buchli, an astronaut and \nAmerican hero.\n  New Rockford boasts a vibrant natural heritage and offers some of \nNorth Dakota's finest wildlife habitats. Blessed to be near the \nSheyenne and James Rivers, the town is a prime locale for fishing. New \nRockford is also a hub for hunters because of the waterfowl, whitetail \ndeer, and upland game that populate the area.\n  To celebrate their 125th anniversary, the people of New Rockford have \nplanned a number of events, including pitchfork fondues, dances, \nchildren's games, and a fireworks display.\n  Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating New Rockford, ND, and its residents on their first 125 \nyears and in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring \nNew Rockford and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we \nkeep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. \nIt is places such as North Rockford that have helped to shape this \ncountry into what it is today, which is why this fine community is \ndeserving of our recognition.\n  New Rockford has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5444-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5444-S5445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF REEDER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On \nJune 20-22, the residents of Reeder will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's founding and history.\n  Reeder is located in the scenic southwestern part of North Dakota \nwith a population of about 181. The town was named after E.O. Reeder, \nan assistant chief engineer with the Milwaukee Road Railroad, which \nestablished a station in Reeder in 1908. By the end of 1908, it was a \nthriving prairie town with numerous businesses.\n  In celebration of the community's centennial, there are many \nactivities planned for entertainment and to remember the town's \nhistory. Events will include a parade, variety show, bike races, \ndances, and plenty of food.\n  The centennial celebration will also serve as a high school reunion \nfor the graduates of Reeder High School. The school closed in 2000, but \nthe town has\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nturned it into the Dakota Prairie Enrichment Center. The community \ncenter is now used for receptions, basketball games, dances, and \nbenefits. It also provides lodging for those who travel to the area to \nhunt, a popular activity in Reeder.\n  Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating Reeder, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years \nand in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring Reeder \nand all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the \npioneering tradition alive for future generations.

Mr. President, today I highlight an innovative and \nincredible education program started by science teacher Brett Williams \nfrom Fredericksburg High School in Fredericksburg, TX. The SystemsGo \nAeroscience program promotes engineering, strong workforce skills, and \nimproved academic performance by teaching high school students how to \ndesign, develop and launch rockets.\n  The program is a 2-year, junior/senior program in which first-year \nstudents design and develop remotely operated vehicles and unmanned \naerial vehicles for research or industrial applications. Second-year \nstudents design and fabricate rockets for testing at altitudes from \n80,000 feet to 100,000 feet. Through successes and failures, students \npicked up valuable life skills such as problem solving, testing, \nanalysis, documentation, reporting, project management, teamwork, and \ncommunication.\n  We are facing shortages of high-skilled workers in our country. The \nS, Standard & Poor's, top 500 companies alone report over 140,000 \nvacancies for these positions. By developing workforce skills in tandem \nwith engineering studies, the SystemsGo Aeroscience programs is \ntraining the next generation of scientists that will keep our country \nglobally competitive.\n  More than a decade after Mr. Williams and his students launched their \nfirst rocket, Fredericksburg High School has received many accolades \nincluding being the first high school to design and develop rockets \nexceeding Mach 2. However, the statistic I find most impressive is that \n80 percent of students in the aeroscience program continue to pursue \ndegrees in engineering in college.\n  By inspiring the next generation of scientists, we are not only \ninvesting in individual students' success but also to the overall \nwellbeing of our economy. America's most valuable asset is her human \ncapital. It is critical that we continue to encourage exceptional \nteachers like Mr. Williams, and programs such as the SystemsGo \nAeroscience in order to maintain our global leadership in \ninnovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5445-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CARL KULCZYK\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the death \nof Carl Kulczyk last week.\n  I knew Carl the way many other Iowans did--through his passionate \ncommitment to the work of bringing hope and health care to underserved \ncommunities in our State. When Carl began his work with the Iowa \nDepartment of Public Health 14 years ago, there were just four \ncommunity health centers in Iowa; today there are three times as many \nhealth centers, a migrant program, and yet another community health \ncenter well on its way to getting permanent funding. Carl never cut a \nribbon or spoke at a groundbreaking, but let me say this: The expansion \nof affordable, accessible health care services across Iowa would not \nhave happened without Carl's hard work.\n  But that is not all. Carl worked to support Critical Access \nHospitals. He brought physicians from overseas to care for Iowa's sick \nand elderly. He nurtured the psychiatric physician assistant training \nprogram. And, in his final days, he was working to get Iowans better \naccess to dental care.\n  There is an old expression that we make a living by what we get, but \nwe make a life by what we give. By that measure, Carl lived a very good \nlife, indeed. He gave his time and talents to securing quality health \ncare for tens of thousands of Iowans, most of them children--people who \notherwise would have gone without any health care. And though he was \ndedicated to his work, his first priority was always his family.\n  In my book, the highest praise for Carl--for any person--is that he \nwas a good and decent man. He dedicated himself to serving others. He \nhad a mighty heart and was beloved by those of us who had the honor of \ncalling him friend, colleague, husband, father, brother, or uncle.\n  Carl had a very special blend of passion, humor, determination, high \nintelligence, and a sense of adventure. He worked miracles for people \nwho so desperately needed a miracle. He took care of the least among \nus, while never neglecting his family. I, for one, will always be in \nhis debt and grateful for his service to the people of Iowa.

A letter from a member of the South Carolina House \n     of Representatives relative to the economy; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n       POM-369. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Ohio urging Congress to enact \n     the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2007, and for \n     other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 100\n\n       Whereas, the National Center for Health Statistics at the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that \n     cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United \n     States, and its prevalence increases with age. Medicare \n     beneficiaries account for half of all cancer patients, and \n     more than 700,000 beneficiaries are newly diagnosed with some \n     form of cancer every year; and\n       Whereas, community cancer clinics, free-standing outpatient \n     facilities where cancer care is delivered in physician \n     offices, play an important role in winning the war on cancer. \n     According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, these \n     clinics treat over 80% of Americans with cancer, providing \n     patients with early diagnosis, effective cancer therapies, \n     and innovative supportive care that reduce fatigue, nausea \n     and vomiting, and pain; and\n       Whereas, while the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement \n     and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. No. 108-173) enacted \n     Medicare Part D, a welcomed drug benefit for America's \n     seniors, it created a severe reduction in Medicare's \n     reimbursement for oncology treatment. According to a July \n     2007 press release issued by Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), \n     one of the sponsors of the Senate version of the Community \n     Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2007 (S. 1750 of the 110th \n     Congress), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     (CMS) has reduced Medicare payments to community cancer care \n     clinics by approximately three to four hundred million \n     dollars since 2005. A 2007 analysis by the accounting firm, \n     PricewaterhouseCoopers, predicts reimbursement reductions of \n     $13.8 billion over ten years; and\n       Whereas, the Ohio/West Virginia Hematology Oncology Society \n     asserts that the reduction in Medicare reimbursements for \n     community cancer care clinics has resulted\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\n     in nearly all cancer treatments being reimbursed below cost, \n     crippling the nation's cancer care delivery system and \n     resulting in a serious access-to-care crisis. Nearly 40% of \n     states have reported a serious impact since January 1, 2006, \n     when the full impact of the reductions became effective, and \n     an attempt to save costs is actually leading to higher costs \n     as care shifts to more expensive inpatient settings because \n     clinics have to reduce staff and close offices; and\n       Whereas, the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2007 \n     (H.R. 1190 and S. 1750 of the 110th Congress) provides \n     critical assistance to community oncologists that are \n     disadvantaged by CMS reforms brought forth by the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act. These \n     bills require CMS to reimburse oncologists for the actual \n     price of drugs (rather than for the discounted price between \n     the pharmaceutical manufacturer and the wholesaler), increase \n     reimbursement for chemotherapy administration and storage and \n     care of oncology drugs, and institute reimbursement for \n     medical oncologists who provide treatment planning; now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the l27th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, memorialize Congress to enact \n     the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2007 to reform \n     the Medicare reimbursement methodology for cancer drugs and \n     their administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the President Pro Tempore and Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, to the members of the Ohio \n     Congressional delegation, and to the news media of Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 2607.

A bill to amend chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code \n(relating to the vessel hull design protection), to clarify the \ndefinitions of a hull and a deck; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am happy to join with Senators Cornyn, \nKohl, and Whitehouse as we introduce the Vessel Hull Design Protection \nAct Amendments of 2008. An earlier version of this small but important \npiece of legislation was passed unanimously by both the Judiciary \nCommittee and the full Senate last year. The updated version of the \nbill that we offer today reflects conversations we have had recently \nwith the Navy and gives the Department of Defense full assurance that \nGovernment and defense designs will not be subject to unwarranted \nrestrictions.\n  Congress passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act in 1998 to \nrecognize the significant time, effort, and innovation involved in ship \ndesign. Litigation under the bill, however, has made it clear that in \norder to be effective, this law needs to be clarified and refined. Our \nbill does exactly this, and no more, by clarifying the definition of \n``hull'' and ``deck.'' This ensures that the intellectual property \nrights of vessel hull designers will be protected. I hope the Senate \nwill move quickly to pass this revised, bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the payment of compensation to members of \nthe Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States who were \nforced to perform slave labor by the Imperial Government of Japan or by \ncorporations of Japan during World War II, or the surviving spouses of \nsuch members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nHatch to introduce legislation to acknowledge the heroic contributions \nof American ex-prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor by the \nImperial Government of Japan during the Second World War. The bill \nwould award a one-time compensation of $20,000 to each surviving \nveteran, government employee, or government contractor who was \nimprisoned by the Japanese during World War II and forced to perform \nslave labor to support Japan's war effort. The bill would also extend \nthat compensation to surviving spouses of such veterans or employees. \nWhile this compensation is only a small token of our Nation's \ngratitude, it is my hope that it serves as recognition of the vital \nmilitary contributions and sacrifices made by these individuals, \nparticularly as those Americans who sacrificed so much approach their \nfinal years.\n  From December 1941 to April 1942, American military forces stationed \nin the Philippines fought valiantly for almost 6 months against \noverwhelming Japanese military forces on the Bataan peninsula. As a \nresult of that prolonged conflict, U.S. forces prevented Japan from \nachieving its strategic objective of capturing Australia and thereby \ndooming Allied hopes in the Pacific theater from the outset of the war.\n  Once captured by the Japanese, American prisoners of war in the \nPhilippines endured the infamous ``Death March'' during which \napproximately 730 Americans died en route to the notorious Japanese \nprison camp north of Manila. Of the survivors of the March, more than \n5,000 more Americans perished during the first 6 months of captivity. \nThe Japanese forced many of those who survived captivity to embark on \n``hell ships''--unmarked merchant ships--to be transported to Japan to \nwork as slave laborers in company-owned mines, shipyards, and \nfactories. Tragically, many of our own men perished in those unmarked \nvessels, victims of attacks by American military aircraft and \nsubmarines who were unaware that American POWs were aboard those ships. \nThe stories of other American military and civilian employees captured \nby the Japanese at Wake Island, Java, Manchuria, Taiwan, and other \nlocations in the Pacific and\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\nenslaved to support the war effort are equally compelling.\n  The heroic performance of our soldiers at Bataan and during \nincarceration in POW camps earned them well-deserved citations \nfollowing the war. For example, the 200th and 515th Coastal Artillery \nunits from New Mexico that served to defend the retreating troops at \nBataan received three Presidential Unit Citations and the Philippine \nPresidential Unit Citation for their heroism. New Mexico is \nparticularly proud of these men whose heroism I seek to salute through \nthis legislation today.\n  Sadly, the Americans who were enslaved by Japan have never been \nadequately compensated for the excruciating sacrifices they made while \nin Japanese military and company prisons and labor camps. In the War \nClaims Acts of 1948 and 1952, our Government paid former U.S. prisoners \nof war $1.00 per day for ``missed meals'' during their captivity, and \nlater, $1.50 per day for ``forced labor, pain, and suffering.'' Even \nthose paltry compensations were not widely known about or received by \nall veterans who qualified for them. In addition, efforts to obtain \nappropriate compensation from the Government of Japan, or from Japanese \ncompanies through litigation, have been unsuccessful and are not likely \nto succeed in a timely enough manner to compensate surviving veterans \nor others who would be eligible.\n  Other Allied nations have already set international precedent to \nhonor their enslaved veterans. Allied governments, including Canada, \nNew Zealand, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom \nhave authorized compensation gratuities. For example, in 1998, the \nCanadian Government authorized the payment of $15,600, Canadian \ndollars, to veterans who were captured in Hong Kong and enslaved by the \nJapanese. And in 2000, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced a multi-\nmillion pound compensation fund for former enslaved Japanese prisoners \nof war in recognition of their heroic experiences. It is long overdue \nfor our own Nation to provide similar compensation to those who gave so \nmuch to defend and preserve our freedom.\n  Approximately 10 years have passed since I began advocating for \npassage of this type of compensation, and in that time, many of these \nbrave heroes who deserve recognition have already passed away. \nFortunately, Congress still has time to honor those individuals who are \nalive today to share their courageous and heartrending stories. For \nthis reason, I believe the Congress should avoid any further delay and \nact as soon as possible to enact this important legislation. I thank \nSenator Hatch for agreeing to cosponsor this legislation, and I urge my \nfellow Senators to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 3108. A bill to require the President to call a White House \nConference on Food and Nutrition; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, in 2003, I made my maiden floor speech on \nhunger issues and how we as a Nation can tackle them. I have continued \nmy strongest efforts to raise awareness that 1 in 10 U.S. households is \naffected by hunger and to advance legislation and programs that aid the \nhungry.\n  Today is Hunger Awareness Day, and as I have in years past, I welcome \nthe opportunity to speak about the food insecurity problems that \npersist throughout this country and the world. Most importantly, I come \nto offer ideas and invigorate the discussion about solutions.\n  With food and energy prices on the rise, we must be particularly \ncognizant of the hungry. Not only do hard economic times generate a \ngreater need for food assistance, but the very agencies and \norganizations that provide assistance are trying to meet growing \ndemands while food and gas grow more expensive.\n  In the past few months, I have read numerous stories in North \nCarolina newspapers about soup kitchens and food banks struggling to \nserve all those in need and even schools strapped for cash to pay for \ntheir lunch programs.\n  For example, last weekend, the Asheville Citizen-Times ran a letter \nto the editor from MANNA FoodBank which said:\n\n       In 2006, we estimated that 115,500 different North \n     Carolinians sought emergency food aid from MANNA partner \n     agencies in a single year--one in six of our neighbors. \n     However, that data has rapidly become outdated by shifting \n     economic tides. Surging energy and food prices combined with \n     stagnant economic growth have dramatically increased the \n     ranks of those seeking help from food banks.\n\n  In the May 29, 2008 Raleigh News & Observer, David Reese, the chief \noperating officer for food recovery and distribution at the Inter-Faith \nFood Shuttle, is quoted as saying:\n\n       A lot of people don't realize or don't take into account \n     the dramatic effect that high fuel prices have, that trickle-\n     down effect. . . . It doesn't only affect the regular \n     consumer who is driving to the store. It also affects the \n     distributor, also affects the retailer and then the end \n     result, it affects us as a food-rescue organization.\n\n  Unfortunately, we know too well high food prices and hunger problems \nare not unique to North Carolina or even just to the United States. \nIndeed, as food prices continue to soar, the impacts are felt around \nthe globe, especially among the poor in developing nations. The \nincrease in food costs has led to international shortfalls of food \nsupplies, resulting in food riots and civil unrest in many regions. In \nfact, the World Bank recently estimated that more than 100 million \npeople are being pushed into poverty as a result of the escalation of \nfood prices.\n  Congress needs to take action to ensure that policies are helping, \nnot hurting, global food supply. For example, I believe we must \nreconsider mandating the use of certain biofuels which is, in part, why \nfood prices are escalating. Last month, I joined several of my \ncolleagues in introducing legislation to freeze the corn-based ethanol \nmandate at this year's level, preventing the Environmental Protection \nAgency from increasing the corn-based ethanol mandate included in the \nEnergy Act of 2007 to the mandated 15 billion gallons. Instead, my \nlegislation maintains the current level at 9 billion gallons.\n  During consideration of the 2007 Energy bill, I tried to include a \nsafeguard in the renewable fuel standard which would have helped \nprevent a situation such as we face today. Mandates have led to more \nthan 25 percent of America's corn crop being diverted to make fuel. In \nthe last 2 years, the price of corn has nearly tripled, thereby \nresulting in feed price increases that impact the cost of items such as \nmilk, eggs, and meat. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food \ninflation rose by 4.9 percent last year, and studies suggest the cost \nof food will continue to escalate over the next few years.\n  While we continue to push for efforts to address rising food prices, \nwe can celebrate some hard-fought victories in the recently passed farm \nbill that will support healthy foods in schools and health food banks, \ncommunity kitchens, and other organizations that feed the hungry. For \ninstance, I am pleased the farm bill's nutrition title expands the \nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to all 50 States. In North Carolina, \nnearly 1.4 million children are enrolled in this program, which helps \nschools purchase locally farmed fruits and vegetables to provide \nhealthy meals and fight childhood obesity. The bill also includes $1.25 \nbillion for commodity purchases for food banks, including $50 million \nfor 2008 to immediately address shortages at these organizations.\n  The farm bill also implements the Food Employment Empowerment and \nDevelopment Program, the FEED Program, which I worked on with my \ncolleagues Senators Frank Lautenberg and Blanche Lincoln. This program \nhelps fight hunger by combining food rescue with job training and, \nthus, teaching unemployed and homeless adults the skills needed to work \nin the food service industry. It is a wonderful program.\n  Around the corner from the U.S. Capitol, students are hard at work in \nthe DC Central Kitchen's culinary job-training class. Earlier today, I \nvisited the kitchen which has a model FEED-type program that began in \n1990. It is always a privilege to visit the kitchen and meet with \nindividuals who faced adversity but who are now on track for a career \nin the food service industry. I look forward to the FEED Act supporting \nnumerous similar programs, such as the Community Culinary School in \nCharlotte, NC, and others around the Nation.\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n  In my ongoing efforts to stamp out hunger, today I am joining my \ncolleague, Senator John Kerry, to introduce legislation requiring a \nWhite House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health to be held by the \nend of 2010. It has been nearly 40 years since the first and only White \nHouse summit reviewed national nutrition policy. I actually helped \norganize that conference while working for the White House Office of \nConsumer Affairs.\n  Positive developments and effective policies came out of those \ndiscussions. With more than 35 million Americans today facing food \ninsecurity issues, it is high time we make ending hunger and improving \nhealth and nutrition national priorities. I encourage my colleagues to \nsign on to my bill.\n\n  This week, I also plan to offer an amendment to the tax extenders \nbill that addresses four tax issues which will encourage food donations \nand volunteering to help the hungry. This package was included in the \nSenate-passed farm bill but, unfortunately, was removed in conference. \nIt will extend for 2 years a provision from the Pension Protection Act \nthat allows any taxpayer to claim an enhanced deduction for donations \nof food. It allows restaurants to qualify for this deduction. It \nsimplifies the rules that allow farmers and ranchers to take advantage \nof this deduction for donating their products. And it allows volunteers \nto receive a tax deduction for mileage incurred while transporting food \ndonations.\n  Along these lines, I also have a bill that will provide a tax credit \nfor the cost of transporting food to assist the hunger relief efforts \nof charitable organizations. The hunger relief trucking tax credit will \nbenefit groups such as the Society of St. Andrew, which helps recover \nfood for the needy. The society is very active in the area of gleaning, \nMr. President, where excess crops that would otherwise be thrown out \nare taken from farms, packinghouses, and warehouses, and distributed to \nthe needy. Each year in this country, 696 billion pounds of good, \nnutritious food is left over or thrown away. Gleaning helps eliminate \nthis waste. It helps the farmer because he doesn't have to haul off or \nplow under crops that don't meet exact specifications of grocery \nchains, and it helps the hungry by giving them nutritious fresh foods. \nIt has been a joy to glean fields in North Carolina with the society's \ndedicated volunteers.\n  In addition to working closely with the Society of St. Andrew, I have \nbeen fortunate to meet with a number of organizations that are doing \ntremendous work to combat hunger in North Carolina--from our food banks \nto Meals on Wheels and others. These organizations rely on dedicated \nstaff and volunteers who truly live by the ideal of helping others in \ntheir time of need.\n  Before I close, let me share an experience I had as president of the \nAmerican Red Cross. I visited Somalia during the heart-wrenching \nfamine. In Baidoa, I came across a little boy lying under a gunnysack, \nand I thought he was dead. His brother pulled back that gunnysack and \nsat his little brother up, and I could see that he was severely \nmalnourished. There was no way that he could eat the rice and beans \nthat were in a bowl there beside him, and so I asked for camel's milk \nto feed him. And as I put my arm around that little boy to lift that \ncup to his mouth, it was incredible, the feeling of the little bones \nalmost piercing through his flesh. It is something I will never forget. \nThat is when the horror of starvation becomes real, when you can touch \nit.\n  Since I encountered that little boy in Somalia so many years ago, I \nhave been determined to do everything in my power to fight hunger, not \njust at home but also internationally. For example, I have been proud \nto work with Senator Dick Durbin in promoting the McGovern-Dole \nInternational Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. It has \nreduced hunger among school-aged children and improved literacy and \nprimary education enrollment in areas where conflict, hunger, poverty, \nand HIV/AIDS are prevalent.\n  While tackling hunger beyond our borders is a greater challenge, in \nthe United States, the land of plenty, no American--no American--should \nwake up wondering whether he or she will have enough to eat today. I \nfirmly believe with dedicated organizations, caring citizens, and a \nfocused government working together, ending hunger in America is \ncertainly a victory within reach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 3109. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a \nhazardous waste electronic manifest system; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill \nthat seeks to update the way in which the Federal Government tracks the \nshipment of hazardous waste. I am pleased that Senators Cardin and \nLautenberg have joined me in introducing this bill, which builds upon \nthe bipartisan legislation I introduced last Congress with Senator \nJeffords and Senator Inhofe when I served as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Waste \nManagement.\n  Simply put, our legislation would direct the Environmental Protection \nAgency to begin a much needed transformation of the tracking of \nhazardous wastes. While the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, \nRCRA, that Congress passed in 1976 has done a great deal to protect \nhuman health and the environment, the paper manifest process that is \nused to track federally-regulated hazardous wastes from ``cradle to \ngrave'' has turned into the single largest continuous paperwork burden \nimposed on regulated entities under Federal environmental law.\n  On an annual basis, roughly 139,000 regulated entities track anywhere \nbetween 2.5-5 million hazardous waste manifests. This paperwork burden \nhas been estimated to cost states and the regulated community between \n$200 million and $500 million annually. This is largely due to the fact \nthat each paper manifest is comprised of numerous carbon copies that \nmust be signed, mailed to waste generators and State agencies--and then \nultimately stored by each regulated entity. To underscore just how \ncumbersome this paper manifest is, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas noted that roughly 22 States don't even keep copies because it \nrepresents too large of a paperwork burden.\n  The benefits of using electronic manifests are numerous and each of \nthe witnesses who testified at the EPW Subcommittee hearing that I \nchaired on September 26, 2006 spoke to the benefits it would have--both \nin terms of improving federal oversight of hazardous waste transport \nand lessening the paperwork burden on regulated entities.\n  I would like to stress that this legislation builds upon the measure \nI introduced last Congress and incorporates a handful of changes made \nat the request of various stakeholders, including Senator Boxer who now \nchairs the EPW Committee.\n  Because of the broad support that this measure enjoys, I look forward \nto the long awaited mark-up of this bill before the EPW Committee. I \nwould like to thank both Senator Cardin and Senator Lautenberg for \ntheir support as we work to improve the arcane system currently \nutilized to track hazardous waste shipments. Transitioning to an \nelectronic system is long overdue and this legislation would be paid \nfor by the users of the system--the generators and waste companies that \nhandle hazardous waste.\n  In closing I would like to highlight just one of the statements of \nsupport I received for the legislation that I began working on over 2 \nyears ago. The following statement of support came from Terrence Gray, \nPresident of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste \nManagement Officials, who noted:\n\n       It is appropriate, many would say overdue, in the 21st \n     Century economy to have the capability of using electronic \n     reporting for such a tracking system, and we are supportive \n     of your efforts to initiate this process. It is our \n     understanding that [this bill] is the necessary first step in \n     designating the detailed system for electronic manifesting, \n     and for that reason we think it should go forward.\n\n  I trust that my colleagues will recognize the benefits of setting up \nan electronic manifest system as is envisioned under the Thune-Cardin \nbill we have introduced today.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from South Dakota, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nThune, in cosponsoring a bill to modernize the tracking of hazardous \nwaste. The Federal waste law requires the tracking of hazardous waste \nfrom ``cradle to grave.'' This tracking system is designed to provide \nan enforceable chain of custody for hazardous wastes. The law provides \na strong incentive for transporters to manage the waste in a \nresponsible fashion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \neconomic analysis estimates that over 139,000 regulated entities track \nbetween 2.4 and 5.1 million shipments a year.\n  This system provides for appropriate stewardship of the hazardous \nwaste products of our modem world. Unfortunately, the tracking system \nitself is in serious need of modernization.\n  Currently, the tracking is handled entirely through a paper manifest \nsystem. The paperwork burden is enormous. Each manifest form has 7 or 8 \ncopies, which currently must be manually filled out and signed with pen \nand ink signatures, physically carried with waste shipments, mailed to \ngenerators and state agencies, and finally stored among facility \nrecords.\n  The paperwork burden is so great that 22 States and the EPA do not \neven collect copies of the forms. Those that do so get their copies \nmonths after the waste has been shipped. In the vast majority of cases, \nthe only time regulators look at the manifests is during inspections or \nafter a disaster to identify the responsible parties.\n  Under the Thune-Cardin bill, the paper manifest will be replaced by \nan electronic manifest. The bill sets up a funding system for the \nmanifest paid for by the users of the system, the generators, and waste \ncompanies that handle hazardous waste.\n  An e-manifest system would remove a tremendous paperwork burden, \nassist the States in receiving data more readily in a format they can \nuse, improve the public's access to waste shipment information and save \nover $100 million every year. First responders could get data in real-\ntime. That is why groups as varied as Dow Chemical, Sierra Club and the \nAssociation of State, Territorial, Solid Waste Management Officials \nsupport this bill.\n  EPA does not have the funding to set up this system, so the bill uses \na unique way to contract for the work. Companies will ``bid'' to set up \nthe system at their cost and risk. They will be paid back on a per \nmanifest basis by the users, waste generators, and handlers. This puts \nthe burden on the private company or companies to meet the needs of the \nusers of the system. The legislation is needed so that the funds \ncollected go to the operation of the program rather than go to the \ngeneral treasury.\n  A hearing was held on this issue in 2006 on a similar bill, S. 3871 \nintroduced by Senators Thune, Jeffords, and Inhofe. No serious \nobjections were made at that time and strong support was expressed by \nall the witnesses including EPA.\n  This is legislation that is overdue. I ask Members to join us in \nsupporting this legislation which has garnered the backing of industry, \nStates, and environmental groups. It is time for the waste manifest \nsystem to move into the 21st Century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3110. A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \nArthur Mkoyan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, his wife, Asmik Karapetian and \ntheir son, Arthur Mkoyan. The Mkoian family are Armenian nationals who \nhave been living and working in Fresno, California for over a decade.\n  The story of the Mkoian family is compelling and I believe they merit \nCongress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Let me first start with how the Mkoian family arrived in the United \nStates. While in Armenia, Mr. Mkoian worked as a police sergeant at in \na division dealing with vehicle licensing. As a result of his position, \nhe was offered a bribe to register 20 stolen vehicles.\n  He refused the bribe and reported the incident to the police chief. \nHe later learned that his co-worker had registered the vehicles at the \nrequest of the chief.\n  After he reported the offense, Mr. Mkoian's supervisor informed him \nthat the department was to undergo an inspection. Mr. Mkoian was \ninstructed to take a vacation during this time period. Mr. Mkoian \nbelieved that the inspection was a result of the complaint that he had \nfiled with the higher authorities.\n  During the inspection, however, Mr. Mkoian worked at a store that he \nowned rather than taking a vacation. During that time, individuals kept \nentering his store and attempted to damage it and break merchandise. \nWhen he threatened to call the police, he received threatening phone \ncalls telling him to ``shut up'' or else he would ``regret it.'' Mr. \nMkoian believed that these threats were related to the illegal vehicle \nregistrations occurring in his department because he had nothing else \nto be silent about.\n  Later that same month, three men grabbed his wife and attempted to \nkidnap his child, Arthur, on the street. Mrs. Mkoian was told that her \nhusband should ``shut up.'' No one suffered any injuries from the \nincident. In October 1991, a bottle of gasoline was thrown into the \nMkoian's residence and their house was burned down. The final incident \noccurred on April 1, 1992, when four or five men assaulted Mr. Mkoian \nin his store. He was beaten and hospitalized for 22 days.\n  Following that experience, Mr. Mkoian left Armenia for Russia, and \nthen came to the United States on a visitor's visa in search of a \nbetter life. Two years later he brought his wife Asmik and his then 3-\nyear old son Arthur to the United States, also on visitor's visas. The \nfamily applied for political asylum, but the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals denied their request in January 2008. Thus, the family has no \nfurther legal recourse by which to remain in the country other than \nthis bill.\n  Since arriving in the United States, the family has thrived. Arthur \nis now 17 years old and the family has expanded to include Arsen, who \nis a U.S. citizen.\n  Both Arthur and Arsen are very special children. What is noteworthy \nabout Arthur, is that out of the 562 students graduating from Bullard \nHigh School he is one of three valedictorians for the Class of 2008. \nToday is his graduation day. He has long dreamed of attending the \nUniversity of California, Davis. He was accepted this past Spring and \nplans to complete a degree in chemistry. In addition to maintaining a \n4.0 grade point average and taking a rigorous academic course load, \nArthur also finds the time to volunteer at the St. Agnes Medical Center \nemergency room.\n  Arsen is following in his older brother's footsteps. At age 12, he \nstands out among his peers at Kratt Elementary School and has been \ninvited to apply to the magnet Computech Middle School next year.\n  In addition to raising two outstanding children, Mr. and Mrs. Mkoian \nhave maintained steady jobs and have devoted time and energy to the \ncommunity and their church. Mr. Mkoian has been employed for years at \nG.A.C. Trucking in Glendale, California. According to his supervisor, \nhe is one of their best employees, having earned a reputation for \ntrustworthiness and skill.\n  His wife, Asmik, has also been working part-time for 4 years at \nGottshalks department store. In addition, she has taken classes at \nFresno Community College and has completed their Medical Assistant \nProgram.\n  The family are active members of the St. Paul Armenian Church, and \nMr. Mkoian is a member of the PTA of the St. Paul Armenian Saturday \nSchool.\n  There has been an outpouring of support for this family from their \nchurch, the schools their children attend, and the community at large.\n  To date, we have received over 200 letters of support for the family \nin addition to numerous telephone calls. I also note that I have \nletters from both Congressman George Radanovich and Jim Costa, \nrequesting that I offer this bill for the Mkoian family.\n  I truly believe that this case warrants our compassion and our \nextraordinary consideration.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN, ASMIK \n                   KARAPETIAN, AND ARTHUR MKOYAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan \n     shall each be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa \n     or for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such \n     Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian, Asmik \n     Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan enters the United States before \n     the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben \n     Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan shall be \n     considered to have entered and remained lawfully in the \n     United States and shall be eligible for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for the issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed, with appropriate fees, not \n     later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an \n     immigrant visa or permanent residence to Ruben Mkoian, Asmik \n     Karapetian, and Arthur Mkoyan, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3, during the \n     current or next following fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \n     Arthur Mkoyan under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \n     Arthur Mkoyan under section 202(e) of such Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It was a pleasure speaking with you \n     today regarding the pending June 20 deportation of Arthur \n     Mkoyan and his family. I appreciate you taking the time to \n     discuss this issue with me.\n       From the limited details I have been provided, it appears \n     there is no feasible judicial remedy that would allow Mr. \n     Mkoyan to remain in the United States. Therefore, from what \n     my office has determined, the only immediate solution \n     requires Senate introduced private immigration legislation. \n     As you know, doing so can result in a stay of deportation for \n     the subject of the legislation.\n       Based on the information my office is currently privy to, \n     Mr. Mkoyan's case appears to be one that would merit \n     introduction of this type of legislation. Although this is \n     very unlikely to be effective in the House, previous \n     legislation of this nature has been successful in the Senate.\n       I am aware that you have been willing in the past to \n     sponsor bills for this purpose. To that end, I stand ready to \n     lend my support if after a thorough review of Mr. Mkoyan's \n     previous case history, you find such legislation appropriate.\n       I will continue to review the situation as it progresses \n     and look forward to working with you in our efforts to help \n     Mr. Mkoyan and his family. Thank you for your prompt \n     attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George Radanovich,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As you are well aware, Mr. Arthur \n     Mkoyan and his family are facing pending deportation back to \n     Armenia. From the limited details I have been provided, it \n     appears that there is no existing judicial remedy which would \n     allow Mr. Mkoyan to remain in the United States. Unless any \n     further steps are taken, Mr. Mkoyan and his mother will be \n     deported to Armenia.\n       Please know as this issue moves forward I am ready to \n     support you where I can, and work with you to assist Mr. \n     Mkoyan and his family.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jim Costa,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              G.A.C. Trucking,\n\n                                       Glendale, CA, June 2, 2008.\n       I, Ashot Gharibyan, the owner of GAC Trucking do hereby \n     certify that Ruben Mkoian was one of my best employees. After \n     his leave my business slowed down because I could not find \n     any other driver as trustworthy and knowledgeable in his work \n     as Ruben Mkoian. He knows his job and has never given me any \n     problems. I still need him to improve my business without him \n     it will be impossible to put my business back to normal.\n       Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.\n                                                  Ashot Gharibyan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of my son Arthur Mkoyan, \n     2008 Valedictorian of Fresno's magnet Bullard High School, I \n     write to explain why our family should be allowed to stay in \n     the United States. Time is of the essence as our deportation \n     is imminent, and Arthur has been accepted to begin UC Davis \n     this fall.\n       My husband Ruben Mkoian came to the United States in 1992 \n     and applied for political asylum. After two years I came with \n     Arthur, and we became part of Ruben's case. After seven years \n     Ruben was granted an interview with an immigration officer, \n     but was denied. As the law allows, we appealed our case in an \n     immigration court. Our case was denied again, but believing \n     in our situation, we appealed to the Ninth Circuit. \n     Unfortunately, this effort failed last March.\n       We entered this country legally, and worked hard from the \n     first day. None of us have any criminal record. We respect \n     the laws, pay taxes, and admire America deeply. It is in this \n     context of civic respect that our sons were raised, and in \n     which we appeal to you for support. Each of the four of us is \n     valuable to the United States. In addition to his academic \n     achievements, my son Arthur serves as an emergency room \n     volunteer at Saint Agnes Medical Center in Fresno. My younger \n     son Arsen, who was born in America, is a standout performer \n     at Kratt Elementary School, earning an invitation to apply to \n     the magnet Computech Middle School. I am proud to have put \n     myself through Fresno City Community College, completing the \n     Medical Assisting program. And my husband Ruben was so \n     valuable at his place of employment that the owner, suffering \n     a revenue loss due to Ruben's detention, writes in the \n     attached letter that Ruben's return is economically \n     necessary.\n       I implore you to introduce into the United States Senate a \n     Private Bill that would halt our deportation. Our Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement case number is A70-783-979. As a \n     mother, wife, and woman, I beg you to enable our sons to \n     fulfill their gift of intellect in the California they love, \n     and to enable our family to meaningfully contribute to the \n     America to which we so sincerely yearn to belong.\n           Yours most truly,\n     Asmik Karapetian,\n       Mother.\n     Arthur Mkoyan,\n       age 17.\n     Arsen Mkoian,\n       age 12.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bullard High School,\n\n                                         Fresno, CA, May 27, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Tulare,\n     Fresno, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Artur Mkoyan has asked me to write \n     a letter of reference, related to a problem with his and his \n     family's immigration status.\n       Artur has been my student at Bullard High School for two \n     years, last year in Honors Chemistry and this year in \n     Advanced Placement Chemistry. He is a fine student, achieving \n     A and B grades in my classes and maintaining a 3.50 GPA \n     overall, including five Advanced Placement classes. I have \n     found him to be a consistent and reliable student, willingly \n     attending the weekly evening lab sessions and conscientious \n     about getting all of his work done. I have complete \n     confidence in his integrity.\n       I think he found it difficult to ask me for this letter, \n     because he and his family seem very proud and self-\n     sufficient. I know he will be successful at college next year \n     and will be an asset to the community when he finishes his \n     education. If I can supply any further information, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me. I am including both my school and \n     home contact information, as the school year is drawing to a \n     close.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christine Lindley,\n     Science Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bullard High School,\n\n                                         Fresno, CA, May 29, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Tulare St.,\n     Tulare, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing this letter for Artur \n     Mkoyan--who has been my student for two years. He is a bright \n     young man with potential for an incredible future.\n       Artur was in my sophomore GATE English class, performing \n     well and contributing the learning environment. As an \n     Advanced Placement student, he continued to work hard and \n     excel. It was always interesting to read his writing and to \n     watch his literary performances. He continues to visit me \n     during this--his senior year. I know that he has high hopes \n     for a college education--the American Dream--In the United \n     States.\n       I know that Artie was an immigrant--however, I did not know \n     of his family's troubles until recently. Apparently, they \n     have lived and worked In the San Joaquin valley for fourteen \n     years. He told me that their citizenship application was \n     denied, and that the entire family may be deported.\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n       I was asked to write this letter to see if you could \n     intervene. I have the utmost respect for you as a politician, \n     as I have been an avid Democrat and a liberal and liberated \n     woman for many years. I hope that you can help this family in \n     their time of need.

During the course of business, the Arthur \n     Mkoyan situation was brought up.\n       By unanimous decision, the members wished to contact you \n     and to request your attention to this situation.\n       However, when I returned home and turned on the late news, \n     the report was that you have already intervened in this \n     situation.\n       I am certain that our members who have also heard this news \n     by now are very grateful and relieved.\n       The purpose of this letter now is changing from request to \n     intervene to appreciative thanks for your action.\n       Our League was established in the 1930's to help immigrant \n     Armenians. Even though our goal is still that and we have \n     come a long way, we still remain vigilant.\n       Thank you for your action. We will be eagerly awaiting the \n     final disposition--hopefully, a positive one.\n       Please contact us if there is anything else that we can do \n     to help the cause.\n           Verily,\n                                               Ms. Penny Mirigian,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Holy Trinity Armenian\n\n\n                                             Apostolic Church,\n\n                                         Fresno, CA, June 5, 2008.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Mr. \n     Arthur Mkoyan. As you know Mr. Mkoyan and his family have a \n     deportation judgment which is due end of June 2008. Arthur \n     Mkoyan was two years old when his family came to this great \n     country seeking freedom and justice and they have worked hard \n     to achieve the American Dream.\n       Arthur will be graduating on Tuesday June 10 from Bullard \n     High as a Valedictorian. He is hard working, honest and we \n     should be proud of him because he is a great asset to our \n     country. Arthur has already been accepted to begin his \n     College education at UC Davis next Fall with Chemistry as his \n     major.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein I urge you to intervene and \n     introduce the Private Bill this week so that our country \n     doesn't loose a brilliant future scientist.\n       Thank you for your consideration may God bless you for your \n     services to our Nation. GOD BLESS AMERICA.\n           Prayerfully,\n                                              Fr.

Mr. Mkoyan was born in Yerevan, Armenia on \n     December 14, 1961 and resettled in Fresno, CA in 1992 with \n     his family: his wife Asmik (nee Karapetian), and children \n     Arthur (b. October 17, 1990 in Yerevan, Armenia) and Arsen \n     (B. March 13, 1996 in Fresno, CA). The Mkoyan Family is very \n     active in the Armenian community of Fresno, and valuable \n     members of the St. Paul parish. They are much loved and \n     respected by everyone in the community.\n       Mr. Mkoyan has worked very hard to provide for his family \n     and is a model citizen with his work ethic and active \n     participation in the life of the community. He has served on \n     the PTA of St. Paul Armenian Saturday School and has \n     contributed his time and means in the service of others.\n       I am saddened to hear that after all these years his status \n     in the United States is in jeopardy. As his pastor and as a \n     person who knows the family I stand in support of Mr. Ruben \n     Mkoyan and his family to establish legal permanent residency \n     in the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n     (The Rev. Fr.) Arshen Aivazian.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Fresno Unified School District,\n\n                                          Fresno, CA, May 5, 2008.\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     One Post Street, San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, This letter is written on behalf of \n     Arsen Mkoian, a gifted sixth grade student at Kratt \n     elementary School in Fresno, California. Arsen and his family \n     are scheduled to be deported in approximately three weeks \n     from the United States unless a private bill is introduced in \n     the Senate to stop deportation. The Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement case number is I A70-7S3-979. Arsen is a model \n     student and citizen.\n       Arsen has consistently been a role model for student \n     behavior since he began attending Kratt in kindergarten. \n     Attendance and parent support have been excellent. Arsen \n     maintains a 3.8 grade point average in his sixth grade class \n     this year, a 4.0 in kindergarten, first, second, third and \n     fifth grades, and a 3.8 in fourth grade. In addition, he will \n     receive Kratt's hightest honor, the ``President's Education \n     Award'' which is signed by President Bush and accompanied \n     with a commendation letter from President Bush. This rare \n     Kratt honor is based on stringent academic and behavior \n     standards students must meet for three continuous years in \n     fourth, fifth and sixth grades.\n       Socially, Arsen is well liked and respected. He receives \n     our monthly ``Bulldog Award'' every year which recognizes him \n     as a model citizen in his classroom. In fact, Arsen was \n     chosen to support a fellow student in need by teaming up with \n     him as a ``buddy'' this year in his sixth grade classroom.\n       Kratt's top leaders are chosen to participate in our \n     Traffic Patrol Club. Arsen is not only a member but was also \n     elected as captain of the Traffic Club this year, a tribute \n     to his strong character. Arsen's name also shows up on the \n     Math Club list almost every semester, an honor difficult to \n     achieve. He has been invited to apply to the magnet Computech \n     Middle School in Fresno because he is a standout student,\n       Arsen and his family have set high standards and worked \n     hard in our educational setting to achieve them. Senator \n     Feinstein, please recognize Arsen's outstanding effort and \n     achievement by your timely intervention of introducing the \n     Private Bill this week so we can keep an intellectually \n     gifted young person and his family in our state. We \n     appreciate your considering this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Terri Bricker,\n       Kratt Elementary School Principal.\n     Randy Brown,\n       Kratt Elementary School Sixth Grade Teacher.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was acquainted with Asmik Karapetian in 1995. I met her \n     at the Armenian Saint Paul church, where we were teaching \n     children Armenian. We instantly became good friends mainly \n     because we both had similar purposes in life for our children \n     to raise well educated and responsible citizens for this \n     country.\n       Later I met her husband Ruben Mkoian, also a very noble \n     man. I remember when my husband and I visited them the first \n     time to entertain us Ruben played guitar while singing along \n     beautifully.\n       I will not forget how one day Asmik called me and gave me \n     the good news of their second son's arrival. She was thrilled \n     and so were we. I know their boys, Arthur and Arsen, both \n     very humble and nice boys. We admired Arthur's achievements \n     in school. He is graduating this year with an excellent GPA.\n       Recently Asmik called me in tears telling me her family \n     received a letter that they were to be deported. My family \n     and I were in utter shock. Why? Asmik and Ruben are two very \n     hard-working people with two wonderful children whose future \n     is very promising. It's tragic that after residing here for \n     more than ten years this would happen now.\n       I am humbly asking you to look the circumstances over and \n     allow Asmik and her family to live in this country. I have \n     faith that you will help this family to reach their American \n     dreams.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anahit Bagdasarian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Diane Feinstein, The family of Ruben Mkoian is very \n     dear to me. I have known them for over 10 years and I'd like \n     for you to get to know them a little as well. Their entire \n     family, including each and every member, is very kind and \n     treats all with respect and always keeps their dignity. I am \n     proud to have had a chance to get to know them and I have \n     come to be very fond of how this family coped with what has \n     been thrown to them. My son, who grew up and attended school \n     with their eldest, Arthur, always stated how he admired his \n     qualities and good behavior. Arthur, a very intelligent young \n     boy, had plans preceding his acceptance, to attend the \n     University of California, Davis, his dream school. He worked \n     very hard since grade school and his acceptance alone is \n     proof enough that Arthur meets any standards imposed upon \n     him. Arthur and I would like to say every individual of their \n     family is outgoing, loving, kind, hardworking, and fit \n     amongst the most intelligent. They do not get into the bad \n     habits that most amongst us keep hidden. We need people like \n     the Mkoians in our society. They keep peace and quiet and yet \n     have firmly established themselves into our working field, \n     schools, and have the most positive influence over our \n     friends and family. It would be a shame to lose such people \n     if they were leaving on their own, and nonetheless were \n     kicking them out. I wish you could know them the way I have. \n     They have truly grown into the most admirable U.S. \n     inhabitants.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration. We hope with all \n     our hearts that you make the right decision.\n     Karin Antikyan.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Our family is a great \n     family friend of the Mkoian Family. We have known them since \n     1993. They are a very friendly family. Our children grew up \n     with their children. Their children are amazing in school by \n     the grades they get Ruben and Hasmik are excellent parents.\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\n     They have been next to us on our good and bad days. We think \n     that they deserve to stay in the United States of America for \n     their children and the future of their lives. We can't \n     imagine how hard it will be not seeing, them, not only for us \n     but everyone else. In the future we will need this wonderful \n     family for a better community. Please keep all this in mind \n     because they are a great family and we wouldn't like to see \n     them out of our sight.

Res. 590\n\n       Whereas, from the first Continental Army under General \n     Washington at Yorktown to the beaches of Normandy, the city \n     streets of Iraq, and the mountains of Afghanistan, the Army \n     has protected and kept the flame of democracy burning \n     brightly;\n       Whereas the citizens of the United States continue to enjoy \n     the benefits of freedom and democracy because the men and \n     women of the Army have stood through adversity, remained \n     steadfast in the most difficult of circumstances, and bravely \n     fought against the enemies of peace throughout the world;\n       Whereas the sacrifices of the men and women of the Army \n     inspire and instill great pride in all citizens of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve \n     components of the Army protect the Nation from our enemies, \n     defend our vital national interests, provide support to civil \n     authorities in response to domestic emergencies, provide \n     ready forces and land force capabilities to the Combatant \n     Commanders in support of the National Security Strategy, and \n     support operations around the world, ranging from peace-time \n     military engagements to major combat operations;\n       Whereas the Army is successfully performing operations, \n     other than combat operations, including--\n       (1) supporting the defense of South Korea, Japan, and many \n     other friends, allies, and partners of the United States;\n       (2) conducting peacekeeping operations in the Sinai \n     Peninsula and the Balkans;\n       (3) conducting multinational exercises that reflect our \n     longstanding commitments to alliances;\n       (4) continuing engagements with foreign militaries to build \n     partnerships and preserve coalitions by training and advising \n     their military forces;\n       (5) participating, most notably by the Army National Guard, \n     in securing the borders of the United States and conducting \n     operations to counter the flow of illegal drugs;\n       (6) supporting civil authorities in responding to domestic \n     emergencies, including natural disasters and threats at home \n     and abroad;\n       (7) supporting interagency and multinational partnerships \n     with technical expertise, providing critical support after \n     natural disasters, and promoting regional stability; and\n       (8) supporting operations to protect against weapons of \n     mass destruction and block their proliferation;\n       Whereas the accomplishments of the Army are attributable to \n     the men and women of the Army who have demonstrated courage, \n     strength, and versatility and endured countless hardships and \n     made great sacrifices in performing diverse missions \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas the contributions of Army families should also be \n     recognized, as Army families provide the cornerstone of \n     strength and support for the Nation's Soldiers and display \n     tremendous commitment and sacrifice to the Nation by \n     providing critical support to their loved ones during \n     prolonged absences;\n       Whereas the Army has been continuously engaged in \n     persistent combat operations for more than 6 years, has \n     constantly and successfully adapted to ever-changing security \n     environments, has displayed courage, resourcefulness, and \n     resilience in the most grueling conditions, and, while \n     focused on preparing forces and building readiness for \n     counterinsurgency operations and providing stability, \n     security, and hope to the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     has taken significant steps toward restoring balance to the \n     all-volunteer, battle-hardened force; and\n       Whereas those and countless other great accomplishments add \n     to the longstanding tradition of the Army and attest to the \n     extraordinary capability of the men and women who serve the \n     United States in the Army: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 233rd birthday of the Army;\n       (2) salutes the men and women of the Army and their \n     families;\n       (3) commends the men and women of the Army as exceptional \n     individuals who live by the Army values of loyalty, duty, \n     respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal \n     courage; and\n       (4) recognizes that the great men and women of the Army are \n     the reason it continues to stand as the best army in the \n     world and continues to perform extraordinary tasks while \n     upholding its hallowed traditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5455-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5455-S5456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 88--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION'S (FDA) NEW POLICY RESTRICTING WOMEN'S \n  ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS CONTAINING ESTRIOL DOES NOT SERVE THE PUBLIC \n                                INTEREST\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Bunning) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution;

Mr President, today Senator Inhofe and I celebrate the \nArmy's 233rd birthday. For over two centuries, the Army has fought to \npreserve the principles of democracy not only here in the United States \nbut around the world.\n  Our Nation's Army soldiers have served this Nation with honesty, \ncourage, and dignity, and it is my privilege to take this opportunity \nto commemorate its birth. Both in times of peace, and in times of war, \nthe U.S. Army has answered the call of duty and responded to the \nchallenge of defending our Nation. All of our Army units, Active, Guard \nand Reserve, share the heritage of the first Continental Army which \nfought so valiantly to ensure the birth of a nation founded on the \nideals of justice and freedom.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the commitment and duty of the Army \nsoldiers who have risked their lives to preserve\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nour freedom have left an indelible mark on this Nation. During the \nArmy's 233-year history, tens of thousands of these brave men and women \nhave sacrificed their lives on distant battlefields to keep our Nation \nsafe. I salute them for their service to this country.\n  Mr. AKAKA. My colleague Senator Inhofe and I also want to pay tribute \nto the families of those soldiers who risk their lives for our Nation. \nToo often the important role that families play goes unacknowledged but \ntheir faith and devotion are vital to the Army's success. The families \nof our soldiers have my deepest appreciation for the sacrifices they \nmake and for the support they give our troops.\n  Mr. INHOFE. As this Nation continues to fight in the global war on \nterror, the Army has been key to providing the capabilities it needs to \npersist in its struggle for liberty and democracy. Through the efforts \nof the U.S. Armys the world has been made a more secure, prosperous, \nand better place for all of mankind. The courage and dedication of \nthese soldiers are an inspiration to us all, and may the rest of us \nendeavor to be ``Army strong'' in our own lives.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 590) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 590\n\n       Whereas, from the first Continental Army under General \n     Washington at Yorktown to the beaches of Normandy, the city \n     streets of Iraq, and the mountains of Afghanistan, the Army \n     has protected and kept the flame of democracy burning \n     brightly;\n       Whereas the citizens of the United States continue to enjoy \n     the benefits of freedom and democracy because the men and \n     women of the Army have stood through adversity, remained \n     steadfast in the most difficult of circumstances, and bravely \n     fought against the enemies of peace throughout the world;\n       Whereas the sacrifices of the men and women of the Army \n     inspire and instill great pride in all citizens of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve \n     components of the Army protect the Nation from our enemies, \n     defend our vital national interests, provide support to civil \n     authorities in response to domestic emergencies, provide \n     ready forces and land force capabilities to the Combatant \n     Commanders in support of the National Security Strategy, and \n     support operations around the world, ranging from peace-time \n     military engagements to major combat operations;\n       Whereas the Army is successfully performing operations, \n     other than combat operations, including--\n       (1) supporting the defense of South Korea, Japan, and many \n     other friends, allies, and partners of the United States;\n       (2) conducting peacekeeping operations in the Sinai \n     Peninsula and the Balkans;\n       (3) conducting multinational exercises that reflect our \n     longstanding commitments to alliances;\n       (4) continuing engagements with foreign militaries to build \n     partnerships and preserve coalitions by training and advising \n     their military forces;\n       (5) participating, most notably by the Army National Guard, \n     in securing the borders of the United States and conducting \n     operations to counter the flow of illegal drugs;\n       (6) supporting civil authorities in responding to domestic \n     emergencies, including natural disasters and threats at home \n     and abroad;\n       (7) supporting interagency and multinational partnerships \n     with technical expertise, providing critical support after \n     natural disasters, and promoting regional stability; and\n       (8) supporting operations to protect against weapons of \n     mass destruction and block their proliferation;\n       Whereas the accomplishments of the Army are attributable to \n     the men and women of the Army who have demonstrated courage, \n     strength, and versatility and endured countless hardships and \n     made great sacrifices in performing diverse missions \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas the contributions of Army families should also be \n     recognized, as Army families provide the cornerstone of \n     strength and support for the Nation's Soldiers and display \n     tremendous commitment and sacrifice to the Nation by \n     providing critical support to their loved ones during \n     prolonged absences;\n       Whereas the Army has been continuously engaged in \n     persistent combat operations for more than 6 years, has \n     constantly and successfully adapted to ever-changing security \n     environments, has displayed courage, resourcefulness, and \n     resilience in the most grueling conditions, and, while \n     focused on preparing forces and building readiness for \n     counterinsurgency operations and providing stability, \n     security, and hope to the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     has taken significant steps toward restoring balance to the \n     all-volunteer, battle-hardened force; and\n       Whereas those and countless other great accomplishments add \n     to the longstanding tradition of the Army and attest to the \n     extraordinary capability of the men and women who serve the \n     United States in the Army: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 233rd birthday of the Army;\n       (2) salutes the men and women of the Army and their \n     families;\n       (3) commends the men and women of the Army as exceptional \n     individuals who live by the Army values of loyalty, duty, \n     respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal \n     courage; and\n       (4) recognizes that the great men and women of the Army are \n     the reason it continues to stand as the best army in the \n     world and continues to perform extraordinary tasks while \n     upholding its hallowed traditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/10/senate-section/article/S5458-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
