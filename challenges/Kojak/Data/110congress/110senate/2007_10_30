Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 60 minutes, with the first half of the time \nunder the control of the Republicans and the second half controlled by \nthe majority.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  In the time that we have, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy have 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Amtrak legislation.\n  Yesterday, in a short period of time, the Senate considered and \nadopted nine amendments to the legislation. A number of other \namendments remain to be considered. I believe the managers share my \nview that action on this bill can, hopefully, be concluded during \ntoday's session. Therefore, it is estimated that the number of votes \nwith respect to amendments and the pending cloture motion could occur \nprior to the Senate recessing for the caucus meetings. Members have \nuntil 12 noon to file germane second-degree amendments to the bill.\n  Last evening, I had a conversation with my counterpart, the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and indicated to \nhim that we are going to move to and complete SCHIP this week in some \nform or fashion. That may require some time into the weekend. We can \nchange everything by unanimous consent. We will see what the mood of \nthe Senate is. Everybody should be alerted that unless Senator \nMcConnell and I and the other 98 Members can work something out, we may \nhave to be here this weekend.\n  We have been very fortunate that we have not had to have many weekend \nsessions this year. That is really good. If we can get our work done, \nthat is fine.\n  I have an obligation to move to the farm bill. Every 5 years, we have \nto complete that, and we are going to do our very best to do it in a \nway that makes a lot of sense. In the next 2 weeks, after this week, \nthere are other things we have to do. We have to send an appropriations \nbill to the President and get that conference started. Some say no \nmatter what we send him, he will veto it. That may be the case, but at \nleast we will get the process going to see if we can work out something \nrather than a number of short-term CRs to complete the funding of the \nGovernment. I hope we can do that.\n  We also have other things we need to work on that are extremely \nimportant to do. Some of that must be done before we leave on November \n16. We have a lot of work to do. I have had both Democrats and \nRepublicans talk to me, saying: My legislation is important, let's get \nit done.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to do. The rules have developed in the \nSenate over 230 years, and I think they have served the country well, \nas you look back. When you are right in the trenches trying to work \nthrough this, sometimes it is very difficult. We will try to be as fair \nand inclusive to everybody as we can during the next 2\\1/2\\ weeks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13532-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13532]]\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a lot of business in the Senate \ninvolves numbers. There are 100 Senators. The majority has 51, and this \nside of the aisle has 49. As the majority leader just indicated, it \ntakes 60 votes to pass most significant legislation. Senators are \nalways thinking about many different numbers. But today's number is \nquite simple. The number is 5--yes, just 5. It is 5 because this is the \nfifth week of the new fiscal year. But our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have yet to fulfill, as the majority whip puts it, ``the most \nfundamental job Congress is expected to do,'' and send a single \nappropriations bill to the President's desk.\n  Let me give just one example. The Senate passed the Military \nConstruction/Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, which provides \ncritical funds for wounded warriors, deserving veterans, and the base \ninstallations of servicemembers and their families, in a bipartisan 92-\nto-1 vote nearly 2 months ago. Yet that bill now sits idle as we wait \nfor the majority to call it up to conference.\n  Meanwhile, as early as today, the majority could proceed to take up \nanother version of the SCHIP bill, which is certain to be vetoed once \nagain by the President.\n  Republicans want to strengthen and secure the SCHIP program. The \nexact wrong way to do that is to lose focus on the low-income children \nit was designed to protect. So let's work together on a compromise that \nwill keep the focus where it belongs, on low-income children. But I \nsuspect I am going to have plenty of chances to come back to the Senate \nfloor and debate this issue very soon.\n  The point is, working on a bill that we know will be vetoed is not \nthe best way to use precious legislative time. Why do they insist that \nwe go through with this?\n  Further, Mr. President, I think we can all agree that we should do \neverything in our power to provide for our veterans and our troops. \nNovember 11 is Veterans Day. I think this Senate ought to honor our \nveterans and the brave men and women who serve under our country's flag \nby sending the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs and Defense \nappropriations bills to the President's desk by Veterans Day without \nany gimmicks and games. It is the least this Congress can do for those \nwho have worn the uniform, and it is the least this Congress can do to \nmeet the minimum threshold of conducting the Government's important \nbusiness.\n  Five weeks and counting, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13532-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Senate after \na brief absence due to some health issues. I am enormously appreciative \nto the people of Massachusetts, for all of their thoughts and good \nwishes and prayers that were extended to me. I am very thankful to so \nmany of our colleagues, on this side of the aisle and on the other side \nas well, who wished me well. As a matter of fact, there were a number \nof those on the other side of the aisle who urged me to take even \nadditional time, that the Senate could function very well without my \nattendance. I appreciate their good thoughts, but we are back in \nbusiness and ready to deal with the important issues at hand.\n  One of the very important issues at hand is reminding the country of \nthe extraordinary achievement and accomplishment by a magnificent \nsports team from my home city of Boston, MA. The country knows about \nit, but I know Senator Kerry joins with me in taking a moment to say \nhow much we are cheering them on, on this magnificent, beautiful day in \nBoston. Our greatest regret is missing what they call the ``rolling \nrally'' that will celebrate the World Series victory of our beloved Red \nSox. It is going to be an absolutely spectacular day in Boston.\n  Both of us, Senator Kerry and I, are very grateful to the Senate for \nlast night passing this wonderful resolution that expressed all of our \nfeelings about the Boston Red Sox and their success this year. It is an \nextraordinary record. For the millions of members of the Red Sox \nnation, this year has been a dream come true. We are proud of the team \nand what they have accomplished, especially the way they came back \nafter trailing the Cleveland Indians by some three games to one in the \nAmerican League Championship Series and went on to win seven straight \ngames.\n  It was an exciting season full of brilliant performances, but none of \nthem were as touching as the extraordinary--and it was extraordinary--\nperformance by Jon Lester, the great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, \nwho pitched 5\\2/3\\ shutout innings in game four on Sunday night, less \nthan 1 year after being treated with lymphoma. For thousands of \nfamilies struggling with cancer, his example is truly an inspiration.\n  I congratulate the Colorado Rockies as well. They showed us what can \nbe achieved when everyone pulls together, winning an incredible 21 out \nof 22 games to reach the World Series and making history in the \nprocess. I have no doubt their team will have a brilliant future.\n  So, congratulations, Red Sox, for a job brilliantly done in 2007. It \nis a wonderful year for baseball in Boston. We are enormously grateful \nto the whole team for an inspiring and exciting season and we look \nforward to another great year in 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13533-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13533-S13534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

I commend the bill's managers, Senators \nLautenberg and Lott, for their leadership on this issue, and I am proud \nto be an original sponsor of this important legislation.\n  Effective passenger rail service is more essential than ever at this \ntime when gas prices, the Nation's economy, and our environment are on \neveryone's mind.\n  For decades, Amtrak has given the Nation a safe, reliable and energy \nefficient alternative.\n  Now, we must make the necessary investments in passenger rail service \nto preserve this important transportation option.\n  The pending bill gives Amtrak the funds it needs to continue \noperating and make necessary repairs.\n  It couldn't be timelier, because more and more Americans are choosing \npassenger rail. Recently Amtrak reported its highest ridership ever--\nnearly 26 million passengers in 2007.\n  It is particularly gratifying that the bill gives special priority to \nthe overburdened Northeast Corridor, allowing it to return to a state \nof good repair by 2012.\n  Rail transit has long been an important part of Massachusetts' public \ntransportation system. Boston's Green Line--110 years old--is the \noldest subway system in North America. The Northeast Corridor is the \nbackbone of Amtrak today, serving 10 million passengers.\n  An excellent example of why this bill is so important is the \nDowneaster, which operates between Boston and Portland, ME. The \nDowneaster launched its service at the end of 2001, and it has already \ncarried over 1.5 million passengers. The line is so popular that it \nrecently added a fifth daily round trip to meet the demand.\n  We need to continue to expand these options for the good of our \neconomy and the environment. Public transportation creates thousands of \njobs and billions of dollars in revenue.\n  The number of light rail systems has tripled in the past 35 years, \nand heavy rail service has nearly doubled. We need to do much more, \nhowever, to make public transportation a viable option if we are going \nto end the Nation's addiction to oil and reduce the harm being done to \nour environment from greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Of the 20 million barrels of oil America consumes daily, more than 60 \npercent is consumed by the transportation sector. Public transportation \ntoday saves us 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline each year, which \ntranslates into 108 million fewer cars filling up.\n  Equally important, these investments relieve the growing congestion \non our roads. The Texas Transportation Institute's latest Urban \nMobility Report found that congestion is costing the Nation $78 billion \na year and forcing the average driver to waste 38 hours in traffic, \nwhile burning 26 gallons of gasoline. In the greater Boston area, \ntravelers face even longer traffic delays in a year--spending 46 hours \nstuck in traffic and wasting over 30 gallons of gasoline.\n  These delays help explain why more and more people are choosing \nAmtrak. Earlier this year, Amtrak reported that its Acela line--which \noperates between Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington--had an \non-time performance record of nearly 90 percent, and nearly a 25 \npercent increase in ridership.\n  Those are strong results. The pending bill will make the system even \nstronger, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, as I make these comments about the Amtrak legislation, \nI remember very well a former colleague of ours who is not here. He has \nhis own particular health challenges. He is a beloved figure--Senator \nClaiborne Pell of Rhode Island, author of the Pell grants, author of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, author of the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities, author of the Seabed Treaty that did so much in \nterms of arms control and the placement of weapons on the seabeds--\nthere is a whole legacy there.\n\n[[Page S13534]]\n\n  But President Kennedy said, during his Presidency, that as a student \nof history it was extremely rare that any individual Member of the \nSenate could come up with a new idea and then see a real downpayment on \nthat particular program. This is the case with regard to Amtrak. \nClaiborne Pell was the first voice in terms of rapid transportation \nbetween Boston and Washington. He struggled for that program, and \nduring the early 1960s he was actually able to get some resources--not \nvery great amounts--but for the study of it, for the feasibility of it, \nand for building a sense of inevitability about it.\n  He saw, long before others did, the importance of transportation, \nthis rapid transportation for our Nation as an energy saver, for the \nmovement of people. He anticipated our congestion and so many issues \nthat have been talked about by two of our colleagues and friends, \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Lott, who deserve great commendation for \ntheir efforts and for their leadership.\n  We are reminded--with the explosion of the costs of gasoline, \ncongestion, environmental issues--about the importance of this \nlegislation. Many times over the last 40-odd years, this legislation \nwas at risk. But now it is well established, not only for the corridors \nwhich are highly populated, but we are seeing, as has been pointed out \nat other times during the debate, other examples of this kind of rapid \nmovement of individuals between various population centers and the \ndifference it has made and contribution it has made in terms of not \nonly passenger service but also for our economy and the environment and \nthe use of energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13534-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13534-S13536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SCHIP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to comment on an issue about which \nI have spoken frequently over the last 10 years, but one which I feel \nimmensely strongly about, that will be before the Senate and on the \nnational agenda in these next several hours. I will draw attention to \nits importance to the future of our Nation and particularly to the \nchildren of this Nation.\n  I know there has been a good debate and a good discussion. I have \nspoken frequently about it, but I welcome the chance to once more, as \nAmericans are beginning once again to refocus on this issue. It takes \ntime. There are so many different issues that are before the Senate, \nand it does take time. We have to repeat and come back to these issues. \nIt does not surprise me. We have seen it other times.\n  I was here in 1964 when we failed to pass the Medicare Program. I can \nremember the whole stream of our colleagues going down to the radio and \ntelevision gallery issuing their press releases about their opposition \nto Medicare. And then, about 8 months later--I think it was about 8 \nmonths later--the Senate revisited the Medicare Program, and it passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  The one great difference, in that period of time, was the election of \n1964, when American people gave focus and attention to the issue of \nMedicare and made the judgment and decision we ought to go and move \nahead. I have heard all those arguments, ``socialized medicine,'' \n``Government-controlled program.'' We heard that when this program was \ninitially introduced.\n  Senator Hatch, myself, and others, we have heard those echoes time in \nand time out. But it was under the leadership of Senator Hatch, the \njudgment and decision, in terms of providing the help and assistance to \nthese children would not be replication of the Medicaid Program but \nwould be a program that would be basically run by the States, with an \noutline by the Congress about what would be included in terms of \nservices.\n  It was a program that was built upon the private companies in these \nvarious States. It was a program also that did not quite match the \nrange of different services that were in the Medicaid Program but, \nnonetheless, has been invaluable in terms of these children.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to speak about the health insurance, \nnot the health insurance available to Senators or Members of the House \nor the President and his Cabinet. As I was reminded again during my \nrecent experience, we have access to excellent insurance to pay the \ncost of whatever care we need. Our health coverage is never in \nquestion.\n  I speak of those who do not work in marbled halls or beneath vaulted \nceilings but of those who work at the local bakery or the repair shop \nor make their living stocking shelves or cleaning offices. This debate \nis about our commitment to millions of American men and women who work \nhard every day, pay taxes, care for their children but who stay awake \nat night worrying because they cannot afford the costs of sudden \nillness.\n  It used to be when we debated this issue, 10, 15, 20 years ago, we \nwould talk about the cost of an emergency room visit being $250 and \nwondering whether a child was $250 sick. That is the cost of going to \nan emergency room. And we used to debate about how do you measure the \npain, the anxiety, the anguish that parent has, wondering whether their \nchild is $250 sick; whether they will get better tomorrow, whether that \nearache will expand or be an indicator of a more serious illness or \nthat throat ailment may be the same or whether that child would get \nbetter.\n  Now it is a $475 average across this country. That is what this \nchildren's health insurance debate is all about: Healthy lives for \nchildren, peace of mind for parents, Congress acting for the common \ngood.\n  CHIP is not a Republican idea or a Democratic idea, it is not a State \nprogram or a Federal initiative, it is not public sector or private \nsector, it is all of those things and more. CHIP is an American success \nstory.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Over the past decade, since it was first enacted, we \nhave seen what it can do to transform young lives. Since then the \npercentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in \n1997 to 14 percent in 2005. This is a clear indication of what this \nprogram is about, from just below 25 percent uninsured for children--\nthis is 1997--look where it is now, 13 percent.\n  What we see in other charts, if you talk about what has been the \ngrowth to uninsured adults, it would be the opposite. It would be going \nthe other way. This is a success story.\n  There is an old saying familiar to every first-year law student:\n\n       If the law is against you, you pound the facts. If the \n     facts are against you, pound the law. If the law and the \n     facts are against you, you pound the table.\n\n  The President and his supporters in Congress have been pounding the \ntable hard and often on this issue in recent months. It is time to set \nthe record straight. They have pounded the table about all the families \nmaking $83,000 a year who are supposedly eligible for CHIP. Let me tell \nyou how many families making $83,000 a year are enrolled in CHIP: None.\n  None in Massachusetts, none in New York, none in New Jersey, none in \nCalifornia, nowhere, zero, not a single child in a family making \n$83,000 is eligible for CHIP.\n  The new bill approved by the House last Thursday goes even further \nthan current law. It makes it illegal to cover anyone in families \nmaking over $62,000 a year, or 300 percent of the poverty level.\n  There it is, in big black letters, on page 75 of the bill:\n\n       Denial of Payments for Children with Effective Family \n     Income that Exceeds 300 Percent of the Poverty Line.\n\n  Now, according to the Congressional Research Service, 91 percent of \nthe children covered by CHIP are in families with incomes below 200 \npercent of the poverty level, or $41,000 a year for a family of four. \nAlmost all of the 9 percent of families above this level pay premiums \nto defray the cost of coverage for their children. That was a key part \nof the CHIP program.\n  States will have a right to make judgments and decisions, to be able \nto vary the premiums, the deductibles, and the copays. We let the \nStates do that for those who would benefit from the program at this \nparticular level.\n  The need for genuine outreach to more of the low-income children is a \nserious problem. But it is a foolish solution to address it by denying \nCHIP to children who also need it.\n  Facts are stubborn things, and all the table pounding in the world \ncannot change them. The basic fact of CHIP is it began as a principled, \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S13535]]\n\ncompromise, and it remains so even now.\n  Nevertheless, the White House has called upon the supporters of CHIP \nto compromise and compromise and compromise. We have. But this much is \nclear: We will not compromise the future of a generation of American \nchildren because they come from the working poor. Surely, they are more \nimportant than multimillion-dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest \nindividuals or the largest corporations. They are more important than \nthe subsidies for the big oil companies. They are more important than \npreserving the obscene tax breaks for so-called carried interest.\n\n  These are America's deserving children and Democrats in Congress will \nstand up for them every time and courageous Republicans will too. We \nhave been more than willing to work with Republicans in Congress on \nreasonable and realistic compromises that still meet our obligations to \nthese children.\n  Many of us initially called for a much larger bill to properly serve \nthe needs of the Nation's children, but we accepted a less costly bill \nin order to obtain broad bipartisan support. Year after year, the \nadministration has granted waivers to cover adults under CHIP.\n  As of February of this year, the administration had granted waivers \nto 14 States to cover adults through CHIP. In August of 2002, they said \nyes to covering 40,000 adults in New Mexico. In October 2002, they said \nyes to over 334,000 in Oregon. In January of 2003, they said yes to \n12,000 more adults in New Jersey. In May of this year, amid statements \nfrom the President that CHIP should put kids first, his administration \nsaid yes to 39,000 adults in Wisconsin.\n  But now they want to say no. The White House is now shocked, shocked \nto discover adults are covered under CHIP. It actually cites the \nconsequences of their own decisions as a failing of our proposal.\n  The legislation the Senate approved last month reversed this policy \nby moving adults out of the program over the next 2 years. The bill now \nbefore us goes one step further. It removes childless adults from the \nprogram by the end of next year.\n  But that is still not enough. Still not enough. The requirement that \nchildren produce onerous documentation, listen to this, to prove their \ncitizenship has been shown to be a barrier to care for American \nchildren because they often had great difficulty meeting the burdensome \nrequirements of the policy.\n  These high barriers were imposed because of a fallacy, the myth that \nthey prevented children in America illegally from using these services.\n  Now, a recent letter from the Congressional Budget Office, not the \nDemocratic one, not the Republican office but the Congressional Budget \nOffice, refutes that claim saying:\n\n       Available evidence, based on State reports and other \n     information provided by State officials, suggests that \n     virtually all of those who have been unable to provide the \n     required documentation are U.S. citizens.\n\n  That statement could not be clearer. It was American children, \neligible for CHIP or Medicaid, who were denied services by these \nrequirements, not the undocumented.\n  The cost of this witch hunt has been high. According to a recent \nreport by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the six States \nthat have examined this issue in detail spent $17 million to administer \nthe requirement, have denied health insurance to tens of thousands of \nneedy children and parents as a result, and have identified a grand \ntotal of eight--eight--undocumented aliens, individuals.\n  The number of low-income children insured through Medicaid has \ndropped 11,000 in Virginia and 14,000 in Kansas due to the new \nrequirements. Each State identified one applicant, one applicant who \nincorrectly claimed to be a citizen.\n  Even now, we accepted a compromise by requiring the Social Security \nAdministration to verify the citizenship of any child seeking coverage \nunder CHIP. The time has come to stand up and be counted, to see who is \nfor children's health insurance and who is against it.\n  It's obvious to everyone that our bipartisan majority for an \neffective CHIP program has made compromise after compromise. The time \nhas come to stand up and be counted to see who is for children's health \ninsurance and who is against it.\n  We need to know who is for families like the Vega family in \nGreenfield, MA. CHIP helps Flor Vega, a working mother, buy an extra \ninhaler for her 5-year-old daughter, so she could have one at school \nand the other at home. CHIP also helped her afford a nebulizer, the \nsmall, portable device that pumps the asthma medicine into the lungs \nwhen an inhaler isn't effective. That means her daughter doesn't face \nsudden dangerous attacks of asthma that require her to go to the \nemergency room.\n  We need to know who is for families like the Lewis family in \nSpringfield, MA. I met Dedra Lewis and her daughter Alexsiana when they \ncame here to talk to me about the difference that CHIP has made in \ntheir lives. Alexsiana has a rare eye disease that requires expensive \ndrops every hour of every day. To take care of her daughter, her mother \nhad to cut back her hours at work, and she lost her insurance. Without \nCHIP, they would be choosing between paying the mortgage for their home \nor paying for medicine that Alexsiana needs to keep her vision.\n  Family after family from coast to coast could tell similar stories. \nThat's why families across America are calling on Congress to renew the \npromise of CHIP.\n  The task has not been easy, but we will not be deterred or deflected.\n  When Medicare was first proposed in the 1960s to allow the nation's \nsenior citizens to live their retirement years in dignity, its \nsupporters were attacked with much the same harsh rhetoric as we hear \nnow about CHIP--it's ``Socialized medicine.'' It's a ``Government \ntakeover.'' But Congress rejected that absurd rhetoric, and hundreds of \nmillions of senior citizens have benefited immensely ever since.\n  American families face real challenges--higher mortgages, soaring gas \nprices, the ever-increasing cost of health care, and many other \nburdens. They deserve real solutions, not empty slogans.\n  Our opponents failed to stop Medicare, and they won't stop CHIP now. \nMedicare didn't pass on the first attempt, but its supporters came back \nagain and again and again with the force of the American people behind \nthem to ask--to demand--that Congress act. And the 1964 election made \nit happen.\n  And that's just what we'll do with CHIP, even if it takes the 2008 \nelection to do it.\n  We'll keep at it until the children of America get the health care \nthat they deserve and that the American people are demanding.\n  We know what the President's priorities are. He is calling yet again \nfor more money, on top of more money, on top of yet more money to pay \nfor the war in Iraq.\n  The President has made his judgment. He has decided to pour even more \nof our national treasure into the sands of Iraq and to burden our \neconomy with the immense costs of the war for years to come.\n  Every day the war goes on, we spend what's needed to cover a quarter \nmillion children.\n  We have a military surge to help the people of Iraq. I say we need a \nhealth care surge to help the children of America.\n  This administration is quick to highlight their achievements on \nhealth care for the children of Iraq, but won't show the same \ncommitment to the health of our own children.\n  In Iraq, American money has renovated 52 primary care clinics and re-\nequipped 600 others. But in America, children are denied essential \nmedical services in the name of fiscal discipline.\n  In Iraq, our citizens have paid for 30 million doses of children's \nvaccine. But in America, we are told we can't afford basic preventive \ncare for 10 million children.\n  The Web site of the U.S. Agency for International Development proudly \nnotes a remarkable accomplishment, and I commend them for it. They have \nsuccessfully vaccinated 98 percent of all Iraqi children against \nmeasles, mumps and rubella. If only we could do as well for our own \nchildren.\n  According to the CDC, only 91 percent of American children had \nreceived the same vaccine by the recommended age. The administration \nshould be as concerned that children growing up in\n\n[[Page S13536]]\n\nBoston or Birmingham get their recommended vaccines as they are about \nthe children of Baghdad and Basra.\n  That same Web site proudly notes that USAID has ``improved the health \nof vulnerable populations in Iraq by increasing access to high quality, \ncommunity-based primary healthcare.'' That is just what we are trying \nto do for vulnerable populations in America.\n  In Iraq, it is an accomplishment. In America, it is a veto.\n  A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment, too. Our \njudgment is that we must make room for decent health care for America's \nchildren. We must stand up to the empty rhetoric and hollow slogans of \nthe White House, and give all children in America the healthy start in \nlife they deserve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to try to bring \nthe focus of the debate about Iraq back to Iraq, specifically the Iraqi \nGovernment's continuing failures to meet benchmarks for progress on \npolitical, military, and security matters.\n  For the past several weeks, the news out of Iraq has been consumed by \ncoverage of the Blackwater security transgressions. To be sure, the \nallegations against Blackwater are serious and need to be addressed. \nOversight needs to be tightened, actions should be taken to ensure that \nsecurity needs are being met, and force is used only when necessary.\n  By no means do I believe we should do anything but hold Blackwater \nand its Government overseers responsible for their actions. But what is \nhappening is the Iraqi Government has successfully shifted the focus of \nthe debate from their failures in meeting benchmarks for progress to \nthe Blackwater security matter.\n  We need to refocus. Everyone here remembers, and the American people \nremember, this past spring, during the debate on the supplemental, the \nU.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq \nAccountability Appropriations Act, that during the deliberations on \nthat debate, Congress codified into law 18 benchmarks that were \nidentified by the Iraqi Government and the Bush administration.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I pushed to \ninclude benchmarks in this bill. Since returning from Iraq, having \nspent Thanksgiving there with the troops in 2004, my second visit to \nour troops in Iraq, I began to call for the Iraqi Government and U.S. \nmilitary leaders to establish a method of measuring progress on the \nstated goals of standing up the military and security forces and \nestablish a functioning government.\n  During my third visit to our troops in Iraq, in April of this year, I \ndelivered a strong message to Iraqi leaders that they needed to show \nprogress on an oil agreement, quelling sectarian violence, and building \na functioning government very quickly or the United States would \ncontinue to lose patience with the war.\n  This supplemental presented an opportunity to send that message and \ncodify it into law. It was the hope of the Senate to provide measurable \nbenchmarks that could provide an outline on progress in Iraq. As part \nof the benchmarks requirement, Congress asked the White House to \nprovide an assessment in July and September. Congress also directed the \nGAO to provide its own assessment on the Iraqi benchmarks. In July, \nCongress received an assessment from the White House on the status of \nthe 18 benchmarks. At that time the White House indicated that \nsatisfactory progress on eight of the benchmarks had been made. On the \nremaining 10 benchmarks, the White House indicated that the Iraqi \nGovernment had failed to make satisfactory progress. In September, the \nGAO review indicated that 3 benchmarks had been met, 4 had been \npartially met, and 11 had not been met at all.\n  In September, the White House provided its final assessment of the 18 \nbenchmarks. Of the benchmarks, satisfactory progress had been made on \n10, 2 more than in July, and 8 benchmarks still received an \nunsatisfactory rating, 2 less than July.\n  Everyone remembers that this is an important issue because of the \nimportance of making positive gains by the Iraqi Government. I visited \nIraq for a fourth time in September, just after General Petraeus \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee but before the \nbenchmark reports were issued. Little had changed. Iraq's political \nleaders were still entrenched. There was still very little hope for \nprogress on the benchmarks. I delivered the message that time was \nrunning out on the blank check policy the administration seems to have \nimplemented in Iraq. At this critical juncture of U.S. policy toward \nIraq, the Iraqi policy toward the United States seems disjointed, \ndisconnected, and disassociated. The level of progress on the \nbenchmarks is debatable, but what is undeniable is the fact that \nprogress is needed on some of the most urgent issues to bring peace and \nstability in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi Government has failed to enact a debaathification law, a \nlaw on equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources and revenues--\nthat is essentially the oil and the revenues they have collected--and \nto provide three trained and ready brigades to support Baghdad \noperations and the disarmament of the militias. The level of progress \nis undebatable. The Iraqi Government has failed to deliver on these \nthree important benchmarks. These are fundamental failures by a \ngovernment that continues to expect the United States to invest in Iraq \nwith our soldiers and our dollars, and these failures are unacceptable. \nWe cannot continue on this path and cycle of Iraqi dependence on the \nUnited States.\n  As we prepare to deal with another supplemental, bringing the total \noff-budget additional war spending this year to just under $200 \nbillion, making total off-budget spending on the war in Iraq nearly \n$500 billion--off-budget spending in Iraq of nearly half a trillion \ndollars--we need to refocus on what is happening in Iraq. We need to \nreexamine these benchmarks and others. Those who called for another 6 \nmonths to allow more progress got what they wanted. The question is, \nwhen will we get what we want? When will Iraq step up and take over? \nWhen will we be able to bring most of our troops home? When will the \ncycle of dependence end?\n  The answers to these questions lie in the benchmarks we established. \nProgress on the benchmarks can give us a timeframe for the future. Lack \nof progress on the benchmarks could only extend our commitment \nindefinitely, if we allow it to continue.\n  Finally, we do need to focus on the Iraqi Government's progress on \nthe benchmarks and the lack thereof. If they had made more rapid \nprogress, we would not need private security outfits protecting \nAmerican assets and personnel. If they continue to fail to make \nprogress and meet the benchmarks, we will need to fundamentally \nreassess what our future role might be in Iraq. We can't sustain this \npace forever. Our soldiers deserve better. Our taxpayers deserve \nbetter. The Iraqi people deserve better from their own Government than \nthe failed leadership they have been shown to date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the\n\n[[Page S13537]]\n\nSenate will resume consideration of S. 294, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 294) to reauthorize Amtrak, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3467, to require Amtrak to \n     disclose the Federal subsidy of every ticket sold for \n     transportation on Amtrak.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3468, to increase \n     competition in the American rail system by allowing any \n     qualified rail operator or transportation company to compete \n     for passenger rail service.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3469, to clarify the level \n     of detail to be included in the modern financial accounting \n     and reporting system required under section 203.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3470, to require the \n     Performance Improvement Plan to address reaching financial \n     solvency by eliminating routes and services that do not make \n     a profit.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate is now back on the Amtrak \nbill that Senator Lott and I have been working on together for many \nyears. I am glad we are moving closer to passing this bipartisan \nlegislation. Our bill has had wide support with over 40 cosponsors. \nThis is our fifth day on the Amtrak bill, and we have made very good \nprogress. We have been able to work through most amendments. Some we \nwere able to agree to, while some required votes. We still have a few \namendments, however, we need to address. But we should be able to \nfinish this bill soon, hopefully today.\n  It is critical that we do so. When we think about how crowded our \nroads are, the high price of gasoline, airport delays as an \nalternative, the potential fuel savings and reduction in greenhouse \ngases from more people riding the trains, the need for multiple modes \nof transportation for evacuations during emergencies, rail is a \ncritical answer to our needs.\n  The need for multiple modes of transportation for evacuations during \nemergencies is a critical factor, and rail is one very important \nanswer.\n  We know people will ride the train when there is service available. \nAmtrak set a new company record of almost 26 million passengers in the \nlast fiscal year. We have seen successes in the Northeast corridor \nbetween Boston and New York and through New Jersey to Washington, but \nthere is no reason why we can't have world-class rail service in other \nregions of the country. Many States are ready to develop new rail \ncorridors, and our bill is going to meet this need by creating a new \nState grant program for rail projects. In all, it would authorize \nalmost $2 billion a year for Amtrak and for the States over the next 6 \nyears. Instead of barely giving Amtrak enough resources to survive, our \nbill paves the way for an improved, modern passenger rail network by \nproviding funding for Amtrak's capital and operating needs. Our \nlegislation will also reduce train delays by allowing the Federal \nSurface Transportation Board to issue fines to freight railroads when \ntheir trains delay Amtrak passenger trains.\n  When it comes to overseeing use of taxpayer funds, our bill requires \nthat Amtrak improve its efficiency and its management. Overall, we \nrequire a 40-percent reduction in Federal operating subsidies over 6 \nyears. We require a new financial accounting system to increase the \ntransparency of the company's financial management.\n  The last Congress, our bipartisan compromise bill plan was approved \nby the Senate 93 to 6. I hope we will see a similar showing of support \nin this Chamber later today. America's travelers have been through \nterrible inconveniences, missed appointments, total unreliability. Now \nthey are relying on us to provide practical and convenient travel \noptions and passenger rail service must be one of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New Jersey \nmay object to a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. I need to make it first.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Excuse the delay.\n  Mr. COBURN. My attempt is for a colleague, an amendment for Senator \nEnsign, amendment 3482. I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and we consider 3482.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I note that this amendment could be \nconsidered nongermane afterwards and could have been held after that. \nThe fact that we are not going to have a discussion on the amendment is \nsomewhat disconcerting, but we will honor the objection of my colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3474\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3474.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3474.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require Amtrak to regularly report to Congress on the \n   profits or losses relating to the provision of food and beverage \n   service and to limit such service on Amtrak rail lines that incur \n                                losses)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Quarterly Report.--The National Railroad Passenger \n     Corporation (referred to in this section as ``Amtrak'') shall \n     submit a quarterly report to Congress and to the Secretary of \n     Transportation that sets forth the profit or loss, as \n     applicable, relating to the provision of food and beverage \n     service on each rail line operated by Amtrak.\n       (b) Contract Renegotiation.--If the food and beverage \n     service on a specific Amtrak rail line incurs a loss in any \n     fiscal year, Amtrak shall renegotiate any applicable \n     contracts relating to food and beverage service (including \n     associated labor contracts) for such rail line in an effort \n     to--\n       (1) reduce the cost of such service; and\n       (2) increase to likelihood to make a profit in the \n     following fiscal year.\n       (c) Discontinuance.--If the food and beverage service on a \n     specific Amtrak rail line incurs a loss in any 2 consecutive \n     fiscal years, Amtrak shall terminate such service on such \n     rail line.\n       (d) Reinstatement.--Amtrak may reinstate food and beverage \n     service that was discontinued under subsection (c) if--\n       (1) at least 1 year has elapsed since the date on which \n     such service was discontinued on the applicable rail line;\n       (2) Amtrak submits a credible proposal to Congress and to \n     the Secretary of Transportation for generating food and \n     beverage service profits on such rail line for each of the \n     following 5 fiscal years; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Transportation, or the designee of the \n     Secretary, certifies to Congress that the proposal submitted \n     under paragraph (2) will likely generate food and beverage \n     service profits on such rail line for each of the following 5 \n     fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. Last \nnight, at 11 o'clock, I arrived at Union Station, taking the Acela \nExpress from New York City to Washington. It is a great value, with \ngood service. It is one of the areas where Amtrak makes money.\n  But what the American public needs to see about this bill--and I am \ngoing to talk about in this amendment, specifically--is we are right \nhere now at this level, as shown on this chart, and total subsidies \nwill not go down, they will go up over the next 5 years for Amtrak. If \nyou consider operating subsidies and capital subsidies, here is where \nthey are, as shown on this chart.\n  What we are going to have is about a $600 million increase between \nnow and 2012 in the amount the American taxpayers are going to \nsubsidize Amtrak. That may be something we want to do. This amendment \nspecifically deals with an area where Amtrak can make a difference \nright now, and it is on food service. Over the last 3 years, American \ntaxpayers have subsidized food service on Amtrak to the tune of a \nquarter of a billion dollars. Now, anybody who travels knows when you \nget on American Airlines, you can buy a Milky Way candy bar for $3. The \nsame thing costs 75 cents on Amtrak. They know you can buy a beer for \n$5. It costs $3 on Amtrak.\n  Why is it we have food programs and food sales programs that the \nAmerican taxpayer is subsidizing on Amtrak that we refuse to subsidize \non airlines?\n  Now, we have heard during this debate that, well, we subsidize \nAmtrak,\n\n[[Page S13538]]\n\nbut we subsidize all the rest of them. Here is the analysis of the \nDepartment of Transportation on how much we do subsidize the other \nforms of transportation in this country. It is pretty revealing.\n  If you are driving a car, you are paying in to the Federal \nGovernment. It is a negative subsidy. You, the individual driver, are \npaying $1.79, for every 1,000 miles you drive, to the Federal \nGovernment--just for the privilege of you driving. But if you are \nriding a bus, it is a $4.66 subsidy from us, the taxpayers, to us, the \nbus riders. If you are flying on an airplane, the subsidy is $6.18 for \nevery 1,000 miles we travel. It is what we pay us to fly.\n  When you get to public transit, it is quite a bit bigger. Could you \nmake justifications for that? I am not saying we should not. But when \nyou get to Amtrak, we are talking about $210 per thousand miles \ntraveled, on average. We know on certain rail lines, certain routes, \nthere is not much subsidy, Amtrak actually makes money. They have \nslightly improved in certain areas, especially with their latest data. \nBut $210?\n  Now, if you take their total subsidy, which right now is $1.3 \nbillion--which counts all the subsidies, both capital and others--if \nyou were to take out the losses on food, you would save another $125 \nmillion to $150 million.\n  Nobody expects, when you get on Amtrak rail passenger service, that \nthe rest of us ought to pay for your beer. Nobody expects we ought to \npay for your 3 Musketeers candy bar. Yet, in essence, that is what is \nhappening on Amtrak.\n  This amendment is fairly straightforward. What it says is three \nthings:\n  It says Amtrak has to calculate and report quarterly to the \nDepartment of Transportation and Congress on the quarterly profits and \nlosses, by route or rail line, of food and beverage services. What that \nmeans is they ought to know where they are losing their money, and we \nought to know where they are losing their money.\n  The second thing it says is, Amtrak ought to restructure their food \nand beverage service contracts for any rail line that is losing money \non its food and beverage services. This is not rocket science. This is \nthat if you are going to sell it, you ought to at least sell it for \nenough to cover the cost. Yet we continue to not do that. We continue \nnot to want to hold them accountable to do that.\n  Then finally, if they cannot present a way to be able to sell food \nand beverages at a break-even cost at least, then they ought to have to \ndiscontinue selling food or have a food service on it. And they have \ndone it on one line because it was losing so much money. The question \nis, why haven't they either raised the prices or done it on the other \nlines?\n  All this amendment is is a management audit tool for Amtrak that \nsays: You are going to tell us every 3 months by route where you are \nmaking your money. They need to know that anyhow. They don't right now. \nThey do not account for it right now. They cannot tell you how much by \nline or route they are making or losing on food service. Any manager of \nany process knows if you do not know the information, if you do not \nhave the metrics, you cannot manage it. If you do not have the metrics, \nyou cannot manage it.\n  The history in this debate on Amtrak is interesting, because in 1997, \nthe Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 was supposed to solve \nall the problems, and by 2003 we were not supposed to have a subsidy in \nAmtrak. That is what the bill said. It said we will, in fact, by 2003 \nsolve this drain of $1.3 billion per year coming out of everybody \nelse's hands into those people who ride Amtrak. We have not had an \nauthorization since 2003. This bill claims that, in fact, the subsidies \nwill go down. But they will not. That is their numbers. That is the \nbill's numbers.\n  So now we are saying we are fixing the problem--except the problem \ncontinues to grow. If, in fact, we would fix the food service portion \nof this, the subsidies would do this, as shown on this chart. It would \nbe a flat line. There would be no increase in subsidies--capital or \notherwise--if, in fact, we were breaking even on all the food.\n  It is a straightforward amendment. I know there is some consternation \nwith this amendment by the authors of the bill and the managers of the \nbill. I understand that. But the fact is, it is hard to explain to the \nAmerican people why we are subsidizing a 3 Musketeers candy bar and a \npackage of pretzels and a can of beer for people who ride Amtrak--and \nwe are.\n  It is interesting; I fly every week, and my total travel time is 8 \nhours each way. I price bottles of water at airports. A bottle of water \non Amtrak is $1.99. Do you know what the average price is for a bottle \nof water at airports in this country? And that is not even on the \nairplane. It is $2.49. Yet we are selling it 20 percent cheaper on \nAmtrak than you can buy it in an airport. If you buy it at a \nconvenience store, you can buy it for 99 cents. But we have a captive \naudience.\n  The airlines know how to take advantage of that, and we are not \nsubsidizing them, except for the $6, which we pointed out, per 1,000 \nmiles. That comes to 6 cents a mile, by the way, versus $21 a mile for \nthose on Amtrak.\n\n  So my hope is we will at least look at this issue and say: OK, if you \nare not going to manage it, at least look at the food side of it. \nMeasure it. Then, if we want to come back in a year and take this \namendment away, saying: OK, you have done it--with this amendment, if \nthey start breaking even on the food, it does not have any effect on \nthem, other than reporting. If they are not going to break even on \ntheir food and beverage service, what it says is: Give us a plan to \nshow how you are going to do it. It is very simple. But if you are not \ngoing to do either of those, then stop losing money on food service and \nbeverage service on Amtrak.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have a unanimous consent \nrequest we will propound in a few moments to get a time certain for a \nvote on this amendment. But we want to make sure everybody is OK with \nthat before we do it.\n  I say to Senator Lautenberg, do you want to go ahead and propound \nthat? We understand everybody has cleared that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, to be sure the Record reflects our \nunderstanding, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 11:45 a.m. \nbe for debate with respect to the Coburn amendment No. 3474, the time \nbe equally divided and controlled in the usual form, no amendment be in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote; that upon disposition of the \namendment, the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 294.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking Senator Coburn \nfor getting involved in the process. He made some requests last week in \nterms of needing more time to actually look at this legislation and \nthink about amendments that should be offered. Senator Reid agreed to \nthat.\n  Senator DeMint and Senator Coburn have both kept their commitments. \nSenator DeMint offered a number of amendments. We have cleared, I \nthink, four of them, and we are working on some others. Senator Coburn \ncame up with two very serious amendments he is interested in and has \nindicated he would agree to a limited time for debate and have a vote. \nSo I want to acknowledge that, first of all.\n  I too am concerned about some of the costs we have had at Amtrak. In \nfact, the last time we passed Amtrak reform, I included a provision in \nthat legislation to allow food to be contracted out. Up until that \npoint, it could not even be contracted out. It was all done in-house \nwith Amtrak, and there was no good reason why that should have been \nlimited that way. They still have not gotten the costs where they \nshould be. But the opportunity is there for them to do that.\n  I want them to continue to work to get better prices and cut the \nsubsidies, cut the costs, and also while providing good food. But I do \nthink food--whether you are on an airplane or a train--is an important \npart of the service. I am not going to take an Amtrak passenger train \nfrom some remote area that is going to be on the rail for a day or \nmaybe even overnight and not have\n\n[[Page S13539]]\n\nany food service. If you wipe out food service, you might as well \nterminate the route.\n  But I think this is an amendment that deserves discussion and \nconsideration. This amendment, as I understand it, would require Amtrak \nto regularly report to Congress on the profits or losses relating to \nthe provision of food and beverage service. We ought to have that. We \nought to have all kinds of reports. It ought to be transparent. We \nought to know where the costs are, where the profits are. We should \nincrease the profits and cut the costs.\n  But to say you should limit such service on Amtrak lines that incur \nlosses, what you are saying is you would have to terminate the lines \nbecause if you do not have food service, what are you going to do? Have \na brown bag? Bring a lunch? Raise the price? I am for that. I think you \nought to pay the costs for doing this.\n  But if we say: ``OK, if you cannot get this under control, we are \ngoing to terminate the line,'' what if the line is actually doing \npretty good, but the food service is still costing too much? We should \nkeep the pressure on, but I do not think we can, in good conscience, \ndeny passengers food and beverage service on these long-distance rails.\n  Amtrak ought to lead more. They ought to address this question of \nfood costs and get those costs down. I must say, we have not had \nparticularly good success in the Senate either. We have had trouble \ncontrolling our food costs. But we have heard the stories about airline \npassengers stranded on planes with no food, and they could not get off \nthe planes, and the kind of consternation that has caused.\n  Unlike air travelers who may deboard and maybe purchase food during \nlayovers, rail passengers do not have time during stops to get off and \ncome back on. Even if they could, most Amtrak stations do not have \nsnack bars. There is the question of what, in reality, your options \nare.\n  Even in corridor service, we know providing food and beverage is \nessential. The improved food service, for instance, on the Acela \ncontributed to a 20-percent increase in revenues during 2007. Of \ncourse, that is the gold standard. If all of Amtrak service was like \nthe Acela, serving the numbers of people with the quality of service \nthey have, and all that, then we would be a lot better off.\n  But the Department of Transportation inspector general found that \nAmtrak has reduced its food and beverage labor costs by $12 million \nover the past 3 fiscal years. I think pressure from the last Amtrak \nbill has been leading to this. They understand they have to do a better \njob. We believe that number can drop even further. S. 294 will reduce \nsubsidies by 40 percent over the life of the bill. This includes \nsection 210, which requires Amtrak to reevaluate onboard amenities and \nservice, including food for these long-distance rail routes.\n  We want reform. We are pressing on this issue, and it is in the bill. \nIn fact, I think some people, when they actually read this bill, have \nbeen surprised there are reforms in there, there are improvements that \nare going to be demanded. People might say we need even more. That is a \nlegitimate argument. But that has been our goal. We want Amtrak to \nprovide better service. We want Amtrak to be able to not lose money, to \nactually make money. But we want to have the national rail passenger \nsystem.\n\n  With this amendment, if a particular rail line suffers a loss on a \nfood service, then they would be required to renegotiate the contract \nrelating to food and beverage, including labor contracts. You might \nsay: Well, even that may not be bad. But if a particular rail line \nsuffers a loss in two consecutive years, they would be required to \nterminate food service on that line. Therein lies the problem. Amtrak \nwould be permitted to reinstate food and beverage service on a \ndiscounted line only after a 1-year moratorium and the Secretary \ncertifies a profit for food and beverage service would be generated on \nsuch rail line for each of the following 5 fiscal years.\n  I do agree this is a problem that should be able to be addressed. \nThey just ought to do it. There is a simple solution: You change the \nservice. You raise your costs. You get a different contractor. There \nare a lot of options. We should continue to press this point, but I \ndon't think we ought to make it such that we wind up having to \nterminate service if we can't get the food situation straightened out. \nI don't think it is necessary given the other reforms that we have \nincluded in this bill. It goes too far, but I understand the intent. I \nwant this service--I want improvement. I want the cost to come down. \nBut I want a national rail passenger service. I have learned from past \nexperience, don't mess with people's stomachs or you will get in real \ntrouble.\n  In that connection I will not read the entire piece, but I refer to \nan article from Parade magazine that will be printed on November 4, \n2007. Some of what it says is that with plane delays and high gas \nprices, Americans are asking: Can we save our trains? It goes into some \ndetail about all of the delays and inconveniences and problems now--the \ncongestion on our highways, the delays, the discomforts on airlines--\nand people are asking: Is there another alternative? That alternative \nshould be a national rail passenger system.\n  But, surely, the Government and Amtrak, we could all do a better job \nof making it a good experience and living within their means. They have \nnot done that. This bill, hopefully, in its present form, or with \nadditional amendments that can be added, will pressure Amtrak to \nprovide this service because I think we are going to need it for the \nfuture transportation needs of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, everybody knows the Senator from \nOklahoma is meticulous in terms of his anxiousness to reduce the costs \nof Government in any way we can. That certainly is what is being \nattempted in this bill that Senator Lott and I have introduced.\n  The amendment the Senator from Oklahoma has offered will slowly but \nsurely eliminate one crucial component of Amtrak service, and that is \nits food and beverage service.\n  Passengers who take Amtrak's long-distance trains may be in transit \nfor as long as 2 or 3 days, and some may be diabetic.\n  Unlike airports, most Amtrak stations don't have restaurants or snack \nbars where you can pick up a bite before you get on the train.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just a little over 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will summarize very quickly to say \nthat on these long rides, a person may be diabetic, may need food. It \nis part of what rail transportation offers, and it attracts more \npassengers to know that they can be comfortable and still have some \nnourishment along the way. If we want to reduce subsidies, then we \nought to look at the airlines where we are subsidizing them to the tune \nof $15 billion a year and say cut out the mini pretzels, cut out the \nlittle bag of nuts. It costs a lot of money when you multiply it by all \nof the passengers who get on airplanes.\n  The objective is to make Amtrak a more viable part of our \ntransportation network, and I hope we will not start to pick things \napart. Maybe we ought to look at what they do mechanically; see whether \nwe can reduce a mechanic here or there. That is not what we want to do. \nAll of this is going to be reported. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his amendment, but I am going to oppose it, and I hope all of our \ncolleagues will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is interesting that two-thirds of the \nairlines don't have pretzels anymore because they have to make a \nprofit, and they have to report to their shareholders. So it is not \nthere anymore.\n  We heard a statement that subsidies have been reduced by 40 percent. \nThat is the operating subsidies. The total subsidies haven't been \nreduced at all. They are actually going up. They are actually going up \nby this amount over the next 5 years. These are Amtrak's numbers, based \non this bill.\n  These are the numbers of the Department of Transportation, based on \nthis bill.\n  Now, if you would break even on food service, there wouldn't be an \nincrease in total subsidies. But none of us would\n\n[[Page S13540]]\n\nrun a business with a loss leader that would continue to undermine our \nability to put the capital into business and to stay in business. We \nwould, in fact, make a change. This amendment gives them 2 years. It \nsays, the first year--you get 2 years to lose money, so the first year \nif you have lost money, renegotiate it, raise your prices, cut your \nlabor costs. The cost of food service on Amtrak is 52 percent labor \ncosts. The average person doling out the food on Amtrak makes twice \nwhat somebody does in the private sector doing the same thing. So what \nwe really have is a subsidy to the food service workers on Amtrak \nbecause that is 52 percent of the cost, rather than a subsidy to the \nfood.\n  Again, the question the American people ought to ask is, should we be \nsubsidizing somebody's beer and 3 Musketeers on Amtrak when we don't do \nit anywhere else? Isn't it common sense that if you are going to offer \nfood service, you at least ought to break even?\n  What we know from the testimony of the head of Amtrak is they use it \nas a loss leader. The only problem is where they use it as a loss \nleader, they continue to lose more money. On their profitable routes, \nthey make money on food service. So the question is, should we, in \nfact, subsidize food? Nobody wants a diabetic not to have food \navailable, and that would not happen. That is why we put 2 years in \nhere. The first year you recognize you have a problem, and the second \nyear you fix it. This isn't an amendment that is designed to get rid of \nservice in terms of train routes. This is an amendment that says none \nof us would run a business losing this kind of money. It is a quarter \nof a billion dollars the last 3 years lost on food, on Amtrak--a \nquarter of a billion dollars.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would the Senator yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Knowing the situation that we run into with the \nairlines where the people are stuck for hours at a time, is it a good \nidea to eliminate--as the Senator suggested, we are happy that we \neliminated pretzels on the airlines. Is that a good idea?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the difference is, that becomes a \nmanagement decision of the airline, which has to compete. Amtrak has no \ncompetition. They have no competition. So, therefore, they continue to \ndo things, because we will subsidize them, that somebody in the private \nsector would not do. That is a decision that is made that says--\nAmerican Airlines saved $30 million last year by their restriction of \nfood services. It was in the paper today, $30 million they saved on all \nthe routes by a restriction of the food service. To them, in an airline \nindustry that has been struggling, that is a significant amount of \nmoney. You know what. We still flew American Airlines; we just bought \nit before we got on.\n  The statement that there is no food available in all of the Amtrak \nstops is not true. That is true in the most remote areas, but there is \nfood available.\n  So if we, in fact, would pass this amendment, and Amtrak would run \nthe food service like any other business would run it, this number \nwould become a flat line. In other words, we would go up here and then \nwe would come across, and the American taxpayer would save about $1 \nbillion over the next 5 years if, in fact, we would do that.\n  So the opposition--I want to finish my point. The opposition to this \namendment is the fear that we may lose a route because we may not offer \nfood service. I would be happy to offer----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for one \nmore question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me finish my point. I would be happy to offer the \nmanagers of this amendment, to make a second degree to this amendment \nthat says on long-haul routes, if, in fact, there is no possibility you \ncan never do it on a certain subsidy level, I will be happy to accept \nthat. The purpose is that--we lose a quarter of a billion dollars \nsubsidizing somebody's Heineken every day, every year, when we have \nthis system where we don't make a management decision that is in the \nbest interests.\n  Here is the real reason the decisions aren't made on food service. It \nis because they don't have to be because we are still going to put the \nmoney there. That is the real reason why it is not there.\n  In the private sector, it would have happened already. If there were \nprivate trains competing, I guarantee the prices would be higher for \nthe food component of it. Nobody is going to lose it.\n  So it is a straightforward amendment. I have a couple of minutes \nleft, and I am happy to yield for a question from the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator if he was \naware that we differ on the amount of subsidy that goes into rail \nservice food costs. It is only $80 million as we see it.\n  How would a rejection of all loss for food eliminate all subsidies, \nwhen, in fact, we subsidize the airlines that are for-profit \nbusinesses? Why should we then continue to offer them----\n  Mr. COBURN. Reclaiming my time, the reason we do is we subsidize for \n$6 per 1,000 miles traveled on the airlines, and we subsidize $210 per \n1,000 miles of travel on the railroad. That is a significant reason we \nought to be all the more efficient with what we do.\n  The Senator is correct. The last year, we only subsidized $80 million \nworth of food, but on average, every 3 years, it is a quarter of a \nbillion dollars. That was my statement. So ask yourself, should we be \nsubsidizing $80 million worth of food on Amtrak.\n  This is a straightforward, commonsense amendment that most Americans \nwould say makes sense. We at least ought to cover the cost. If we can't \ncover the cost, then maybe we ought to renegotiate the contracts with \nthe food service workers who make $43,000 a year who are selling you a \nbottle of water. Compare that to somebody who is working at an airport \nor a stewardess on an airplane who is serving you and who is making \nless than that.\n  So the consequences of our actions have great impact. Why is it \nimportant? Is it because of the subsidy we give Amtrak? Do you know \nwhat it is? It is borrowed from our grandkids. We can't deny it. We \nhave the administration claiming a $160 billion deficit this year, and \nthe real deficit is going to be $300 billion because we are going to \nborrow $140 billion from Social Security to pay for Medicare, and then \nwe are going to borrow $200 billion to pay for a war that we are \ncharging to our grandkids. So that is important because the subsidy \nisn't coming from us. It is coming from the next two generations.\n  I yield the floor. I understand all time has expired.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, we are working with the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee and the leadership on both sides to get an \nagreement worked out on how we proceed on this issue for the remainder \nof the afternoon. In the meantime, Senator DeMint is here and ready to \ngo on an amendment, and he has a committee markup underway also.\n  So unless there is objection, I ask Senator Lautenberg, could we let \nSenator DeMint call up his amendment and go ahead and have a discussion \non it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senators.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  I would like to discuss amendment No. 3467. Before I discuss the \namendment specifically, I would like to talk a little bit about rail \npassenger service in America and Amtrak specifically.\n  I think one of the best infrastructure visions we could have as a \ncountry today would be to create high-speed passenger rail service that \nmoves people economically and efficiently around the country. The irony \nis, as long as we continue to pour our Federal resources into the \nAmtrak model, we will never get to that vision of an efficient \npassenger rail service in this country.\n  It is clear from years of working with Amtrak and the model of using \nfreight rails and Government subsidies to support an Amtrak system, we \nwill never have a world-class passenger rail service through the Amtrak \nmodel. So I hope we as a Congress, as a Senate, particularly, can come \nto terms with the fact that if we continue to throw money at Amtrak, we \nwill never have efficient passenger rail service.\n  Certainly, there are a couple of lines of rail service of Amtrak, \nparticularly in the Northeast, that work well for a number of people. \nBut the fact is, many Americans are contributing to the few passengers \nwho are using Amtrak today. Taxpayers all over the country are putting \ntheir money into these few lines that work, even though very few \nAmericans actually ever use these rail services.\n  As we discuss this final bill, it is important we remember that in \nthe last year the Federal Government gave Amtrak $1.3 billion in \nsubsidies, even though they carry less than 1 percent of the Nation's \nintercity passengers.\n  Amtrak is the most heavily subsidized mode of transportation in the \ncountry. In fact, every ticket people purchase from Amtrak has an \naverage subsidy of over $210 per passenger per 1,000 miles traveled. We \neven have some lines where the subsidy reaches as high as $500.\n  My amendment does not change this. But it tells America the truth \nabout the subsidies for each of these tickets people buy.\n  My amendment requires Amtrak to put on every ticket for the line they\n\n[[Page S13542]]\n\nare using the amount of subsidy the taxpayers are putting into the cost \nof each of these tickets. By doing this, we will force Amtrak to do \nwhat all businesses have to do, which is to track the real cost of \nevery product they sell.\n  Right now, it is very difficult to determine actually how much Amtrak \nspends on each of its lines of service. But by requiring they put the \ncost of the subsidy on every ticket, they will have to calculate the \ncost--which is the revenue and the losses--for each line in this \ncountry.\n  Every business should have to do it. Amtrak should as well.\n  It is the only way we can get a handle on actually how much we are \nspending for each line and hopefully determining, after a while, which \nlines make sense to continue and which lines should be eliminated.\n  So I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It does \nnot do anything to reduce funding for Amtrak or put any additional \nrestrictions on them. But it does require them to show America what the \nreal subsidy is for every ticket they sell.\n  So I say to you, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nlook forward to your comments. Hopefully, we will have your support on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a number of conversations over \nthe last 24 hours with the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, with the Democratic \nleader, Steny Hoyer, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and others who \nhave indicated on the CHIP matter they need more time, they have had \nconversations with Republican House Members who voted not to override \nthe President's veto, they are having conversations with people within \nthe administration, trying to come up with something on CHIP, and they \nneed more time.\n  My first inclination, after having heard this, was, well, we have \nwaited long enough. But after having spoken to these Senators--Senator \nHatch, especially, has been working hard. They have already had \nmeetings with Republican House Members. Senator Baucus, I have spoken \nto him at great length, and he is also having meetings with some of the \nRepublicans in the House to see if there is something that can be \nworked out. I do not know if there can be.\n  But what we have done with the matter that will shortly be before the \nSenate: As to childless adults who are in the program now, under the \noriginal bill we passed, they would be phased out in 2 years. In the \nbill that is now before this body--or shortly will be--they are phased \nout over 1 year. So we cut that in half.\n  Ninety-two percent of the people drawing benefits--and the ``people'' \nare little people, are children drawing benefits from this program--92 \npercent of them are in families not exceeding 200 percent of poverty. \nAnd 200 percent of poverty is about $40,000 a year for a family of \nfour. We have only one State above 300 percent of poverty, and there \nare maybe five or six States from 200 percent to 300 percent of \npoverty. So we have said there will be no waivers above 300 percent of \npoverty. We have changed along that regard.\n  We have tightened down the language as it relates to illegal children \ndrawing benefits. Under the original bill we passed, illegal children \ncould not get the benefits. You had to be in the country for at least 5 \nyears, with proper papers, and then you could, after having been here 5 \nyears. So we have tightened everything down. We have changed that, \nhopefully, to pick up some more votes.\n  At this stage, Senator Hatch and others have said to me: We need a \nlittle more time. We would like--because Senator Hatch and Senator \nGrassley were in on the changes we made. They were not done by \nDemocrats. For every meeting held, they were in on the meetings. But \nthey said give us some more time and maybe we can come up with \nsomething else. I am willing to do that. We are willing to do that. I \nwould hope the Republicans mean that, that they do need more time.\n\n  So what I would be willing to do--and when I say ``I,'' it is not \nme--but what we would be willing to do is to put the vote off on CHIP \nuntil we finish the farm bill. I am going to do the farm bill next \nweek. I am not going to go to it this week. We would go ahead and \nfinish Amtrak and then move to something else. What it is, I don't \nknow. I will try to come up with something that would be without a lot \nof pain to anyone. There are many things we have to do that are \nbipartisan in nature that I think we could go to.\n  I had originally considered offering a unanimous consent request \nwhere we would move off CHIP and go to it when we finish the \ntransportation bill, and in exchange for that, give me permission to go \nto something else. I have withdrawn that. I don't want any excuses. I \ndon't want anyone saying: Look, we would have done that, but he was \ndemanding what we go to next, and I am not going to do that.\n  So I am going to recite into the Record a unanimous consent request \nwhich will say basically that we will move off CHIP, giving Senator \nHatch and others time to negotiate to see if they can come up with \nsomething that is agreeable to the body, and maybe we can do CHIP so \nthat--and the only requirement I think that Senator Hatch, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Baucus, I, the Speaker, Congressman Rangel, and \nCongressman Dingell have is that we cover the same amount of kids. We \ntried to do that in some fashion. Right now, if we don't do something, \nthe number of children covered will drop from 5.5 million to 4.5 \nmillion. That is the way it is. Those are the facts, and we can't \nchange that. If we passed our bill, the one that got 69 votes in this \nbody, instead of having 5.5 million, we would have 10 million children \nwho would be covered.\n  So I hope we can do that. But anyway, without belaboring the point, \nwhat I am going to ask permission to do is that we move off CHIP at \nwhat time it would occur naturally and take it up when we finish the \nfarm bill. The rest of this week we will be working on something else. \nWhat that will be, I will certainly consult with the Republican leader. \nBut right now, whatever I do, unless I get consent from the Senate--not \nonly the Republicans but the Senate--I would have to get consent to do \nthat or otherwise I would have to file cloture on a motion to proceed \nto it. So there are no surprises in that regard.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be vitiated with \nrespect to the motion to proceed to the CHIP bill, H.R. 3963, and the \nSenate begin consideration of that bill following the disposition of \nthe farm bill, H.R. 2419.\n  As I have indicated, we are not going to move right to the farm bill. \nWe are going to wait until at least Monday to get to the farm bill, as \nI have indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I may do \nthat, and address some comments to the distinguished majority leader, \nand maybe even some questions, first of all, I think we have made good \nprogress on the Amtrak bill. The leader was considerate of allowing it \nto go over until today, and our colleagues have fulfilled their \ncommitments to be reasonable with their amendments, and we believe we \nare ready to go to Senator DeMint's amendment and get a vote on it at a \ncertain time. I believe we could be very close to going to passage \nalso.\n  With regard to vitiating the cloture motion on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, I can't see any reason why we would object to that, \nbut we ought to continue to try to find a solution. Unfortunately, \nthere has been no real consultation with the leadership on this side of \nthe aisle by those who have been having all of these meetings, and we \nstill have not involved the administration in trying to get a solution \nthat we believe we could all get broad agreement on and avoid going \nback and forth on bills and vetoes. But to take more time--we still \nhope you will come up with something that will be supported broadly and \nsigned by the President. But the idea that we would then agree for this \nto go automatically to the farm bill, we would have to have--\n  Mr. REID. I am not asking unanimous consent for the farm bill; I am \njust going to go to the farm bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. But SCHIP would come back automatically after the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. After we finish that, yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. After a discussion with our leadership, at this time we \nwould have to object. We don't object to vitiating the cloture vote on \nthe CHIP bill,\n\n[[Page S13543]]\n\nbut we want to make sure we understand we are not agreeing to \nautomatically going to the CHIP bill after the farm bill. So based on \nthat, I would object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is hard for me to comprehend the logic of \nthe objection. We are not asking unanimous consent from anybody as to \nwhat we are going to go to next. If the minority wants to object to \ngoing to the farm bill, they have the right to do that. I think it \nwould be unusual for them to do that, but they have a right to do that.\n  We filed our 50th cloture motion, and it was my favorite. It was my \nfavorite because it was bipartisan. It was the first bipartisan cloture \nmotion we filed all year. It was on Amtrak. If we have to file cloture \non the farm bill, that is fine. It would just take us a couple of extra \ndays to get to the substance of the bill.\n  But I would also say it would seem to me that if the Republicans are \nsincere in wanting to do a CHIP bill, unless I am missing something, \nwhat better opportunity would they have? I have said let's get off this \nbill. As we all know, to finish the farm bill could take a little bit \nof time. I would hope we could finish it in a week, but as we know, in \nthat week it could be interspersed with an appropriations conference \nreport. We have to do the CR. So I can't imagine our finishing the farm \nbill very quickly.\n  But I was told initially on this CHIP matter that they needed 2 days \nto try to work something out. They are going to have well more than 2 \ndays. It is not as if the Republicans have been in the dark. Remember, \nthe two advocates for this--we would not have had a CHIP bill but for \nSenator Grassley and Senator Hatch. They were part of everything that \ntook place in this bill. When the bill was not overridden--when the \nveto was not overridden and the bill was rewritten in the House, it \nwasn't rewritten by the House; it was rewritten by the House and \nSenator Grassley's staff and Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch. They \nwere in on every word put in this new bill.\n\n  As far as the administration, it would seem to me if they have a \ncouple of weeks, then that is what this will basically give them, 10 \ndays to 2 weeks. That gives them lots of time to work with the \nadministration, Secretary Leavitt, or whoever they want to deal with \nit. Leader Pelosi and I asked the President the day he vetoed this \nbill--because he kept saying: I want to meet with the leadership. \nSpeaker Pelosi asked him in the morning; I asked him in the afternoon. \nHe said: I am not going to meet with you. So we have tried. We want to \nbe reasonable. This is an important bill. It deals with children. It is \nbipartisan. This is not a Democratic bill. It is a Democratic and \nRepublican bill.\n  So I have heard the objection. I understand English. I would hope, \nthough, that this afternoon my friends would reassess this; otherwise, \nwe will go ahead and vote, as we have, on a motion to proceed to it.\n  It seems to me it would be a little difficult, as fair as we have \ntried to be, for people to change their votes on it. But miracles never \ncease, and the Republicans, I am sorry to say, have been pulled in as \npuppets in the past during the almost 7 years this man has been \nPresident, and maybe they can do it again. I would hope not on an issue \nthis important.\n  I repeat, we simply want to have the Republicans get what they want. \nCan't they take yes for an answer? We have said, you want more time? \nThis isn't an idea I came up with. The Republicans came to me and said \nthey needed more time. Senator Hatch called me last night. I talked to \nhim twice last night. I talked to Senator Grassley yesterday; and \nSenator Baucus, I called him and said: Is that OK with you? He said: \nYes, that is OK with me. So I don't know how we could be more \nreasonable.\n  What happens if they don't do this? We are going to go ahead and vote \non the motion to proceed and vote cloture on the bill. If that is what \nthey want, that is what we can do. But I don't know how, when somebody \nsays will you do this for me, and we say yes, they say no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to Senator Reid's comments, I \ndon't see any problem with vitiating cloture on the so-called CHIP \nbill, H.R. 3963. If the leader would like to do that, I assume after \nconsultation with Leader McConnell there wouldn't be any problem \ngetting it done.\n  The problem is, say that after the farm bill you would automatically \ngo to the CHIP bill which would preclude debate time on the motion to \nproceed, if necessary. To put that after the farm bill without full \nrights of the minority would be a concern. First of all, we don't know \nwhen that might come. It could come 2 weeks from now, right up against \na date when we are supposed to be going out for the Thanksgiving period \nand we don't want to short-circuit that. But if we could work out \nsomething where our rights would be protected with regard to the CHIP \nbill instead of just going automatically to it after the farm bill, it \nlooks as if that is something that could be worked out.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a deal. Again, trying to be more \nreasonable than I probably should be, but in an effort to try to be \nfair, I would consider offering a cloture vote on the motion to proceed \nto CHIP following the farm bill, and if cloture is voted, go directly \nto the bill. That way we don't lose the 30 hours. This would give \npeople--if people felt aggrieved that they weren't treated properly \nduring this period of time. I just don't want to lose the 30 hours \nbecause that is time toward the end of the session, and we are \ndesperate for time for things that need to be done.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, if the Leader will yield, you are making an \neffort, and I think we will need some time to consult with our leader \nto make sure he is aware of this. I understand the leader doesn't want \nto have time used that is not necessary. But we have another unanimous \nconsent agreement. We have an amendment that is pending. In the \nmeantime, I will check with Senator McConnell and see what he is \nthinking.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, in fairness, I talked to Senator \nMcConnell prior to lunch, but it wasn't in any detail. I told him \ngenerally what I was going to do. So I think it is appropriate to take \na little more time, and we can all come out later and try this again.\n  But I want the record to be spread, if anyone can come up with a more \nfair proposal than I have offered, then they should come to the Senate \nfloor because I have basically given those people who have wanted more \ntime--and those are the Republicans--everything they have asked for.\n  By the way, I also want to say not only do I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments about moving forward on the Amtrak bill, but this is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, and I was maybe being a little \nflippant, but I was very serious. I think it is wonderful. We had a \nbipartisan cloture motion filed. We need to do more of those, if \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n20 minutes for debate with respect to the DeMint amendment, No. 3467, \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that no amendment be in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote; that the remaining pending \namendments be withdrawn; that no other amendments be in order other \nthan a managers' package of amendments that has been cleared by both \nmanagers and leaders; that upon disposition of these amendments, the \nbill, as amended, be read for a third time, and at 4 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the DeMint amendment; and that upon \ndisposition of the DeMint amendment, all postcloture time be considered \nyielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the bill; \nfurther, that the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3963 \nnot occur prior to 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, October 31 or at a time \ndetermined by the two leaders on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe now we are ready to go forward \nwith the pending DeMint amendment.\n  Mr. President, we agreed to 20 minutes of debate on the DeMint \namendment, once the Senator arrives. I believe we are sending a note to \nhim. He had to go to a markup in the Commerce Committee. He has \namendments\n\n[[Page S13544]]\n\nhe wants to offer. He will be back momentarily to offer those.\n  In the meantime, I want to respond to some of the things the majority \nleader was noting. I wanted to do it when he was on the floor, but it \nis important to try to work through these unanimous consent agreements.\n  Let me say that on the effort to vitiate cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the Children's Health Insurance Program, it was noted that \nit had been requested by Republicans that 2 more days be given to work \nsomething out. I note that I don't believe that request came from the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell. Members on both sides of the \naisle have to recognize that our leaders are our leaders. Our leaders \nhave to be consulted on parliamentary procedure and also on timing. So \nwhen one Senator--Senator Hatch--says give me 2 more days but there is \nno contact or consultation with our leadership on this side of the \naisle, that is a problem.\n  Also, we want to make sure we don't give up our normal rights, the \nregular order. I am concerned about going to some other issue after the \nAmtrak bill and then going to the farm bill next week. They have been \non the farm bill we don't know how long, and at the last minute we may \ncall up a bipartisan agreement, but it will not resolve the agreements \non SCHIP.\n  We must focus on poor children. I am concerned with the present \ncondition of the bill. My analysis is that this bill costs more than \nthe bill that was vetoed, and fewer children are covered. It has an \nexpress lane for illegal children to go into the program. There is a \nmultitude of problems with it. The biggest problem is we are still \ntalking about over $35 billion. Instead of trying to come to a \ncompromise on the money that is necessary to cover poor children first, \nit is still not going to get adults off the program. My observation has \nbeen when you let adults get on a program intended for children, you \ncrowd children out.\n  There are huge problems in the status of the negotiations, which are \ngoing on by a group that has not included the Republican leadership or \nthe administration. I don't know who met with whom, or why, or why not. \nWe ought to work this out. I don't like playing games with a program \nsuch as this. I stood on this floor and spoke when this program was \ncreated. I believe in it. I thought we were going to focus on poor \nchildren and not continue to raise the income levels that were covered \nto 300, 350, or 400 percent of poverty and put it into the program. We \nneed to look at the formula. Some States, such as mine, run out of \nmoney year after year because the formula doesn't deal with the \nrealities of the needs of the poor children.\n  There are multiple problems with what is going on. I am very \nconcerned, on our side of the aisle, about some of the involvement of \nsome of our people without consultation with our leader.\n  The incurable attitude around here is evidenced by this bill. You can \nfind a way to fight and have a disagreement or you can find a way to \nwork together. This Amtrak bill is, I believe, on the verge of passing \nby a wide margin. If the House is smart, they will not put poison pills \nin it and try to explode it. Let's get real reforms and put some \npressure on Amtrak. I want a successful national rail passenger system. \nDo I want subsidies for individual passengers to be reduced? Yes. Do I \nwant the cost of meals to be subsidized by the taxpayers? No. Do I want \na strongly led, effective national rail passenger system? Yes.\n  Let's try to make that happen. But it is not going to happen \ninstantly. We have to set up a process, require reforms, and give \nincentives to do better.\n  One of the things I think is going to help, which some of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle have referred to, is we are going \nto have more intercity service as a result of this bill. We have a \nprogram specifically aimed to help States set up interservice \ntransportation between not just New York and Albany but sites all over \nthe country where States can do more, where there is a way to get an \nopportunity to do more to have intercity service.\n  We have language that will start toward a situation where freight \nlines can bid to provide the service on these lines. We do it with a \npilot program. We don't just say anybody can come in; we say one the \nfirst year, two the second year, but we will work toward seeing if \nothers can offer this service more efficiently, effectively, and more \ncost responsible.\n  I am very much concerned about how these negotiations are going on on \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. There is a meeting going on \ndown the hall now that doesn't include the leadership on our side. \nFifty staff people have been standing out in the hall. I have a novel \nidea: I think Senators ought to be involved--men and women of good \nfaith and intellect who understand these problems. We don't have to \nhave our staffs do this for us.\n  The same is true with Amtrak. Senator Lautenberg and I have worked on \nthis for at least 3 to 5 years. This is the third Amtrak reform I have \nbeen involved in. I apologize for the other two not doing everything we \nwanted them to do. We have made progress. It didn't do as well as it \nshould have. Now we are trying again. I say to the Amtrak leadership \nand the Department of Transportation, first, we are giving DOT more \ninvolvement in what Amtrak does. No President has made Amtrak work the \nway it should. They don't pay enough attention to it. And it is not \npartisan; I don't think this administration is or that the previous \nadministration was.\n  This legislation will help us move in the direction of a national \npassenger rail system. I don't want to go into great length. I don't \nhave to object when the leader makes a request to lock in the agreement \nto basically finish Amtrak this afternoon and then do something else \nthis afternoon--we don't know what--and on Thursday and Friday and then \ncome to the farm bill next week. Then to go automatically to a CHIP \nbill, which we don't know what it is going to be, and we give up our \nrights of regular order, that is not a good arrangement.\n\n  I hope the two leaders will get together and proceed to another bill \ntomorrow. I don't know what it might be. I represent a farm State. I \nhope we can get a good farm bill and do it in a reasonable period of \ntime. I worry that we are not wanting to get an agreement on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Some people are saying $35 billion \nor bust. Others are saying we are not going to go to $35 billion. The \nPresident is at $5 billion. The earlier bill the President vetoed was \nat $35 billion. Now the new bill is $35 billion. Is there not an area \nbetween the two? I have done negotiations around here for years, in the \nHouse, in the Senate, and in conference. When one side is at 5 and the \nother is at 35, what is half of that? It is a little over 15. Would \nthat work? What is the solution? Is it 20? How complicated is that?\n  But we need to put the emphasis on the poor children first, quit this \nbudget creep we always get into, adding more and more children at \nhigher income levels, and now we have adults and other loopholes in \nthis program that I think we need to be very careful about. Can we do \nit? Absolutely.\n  I introduced a bill a month ago that was probably in the range of \nwhere the compromise ought to be. By the way, it was about double what \nI thought we needed to do when we started out, but I moved up. I hope \nthe two leaders will get an understanding of what the process is going \nto be and move forward on all of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, we are now waiting for Senator DeMint to return.\n  I will yield the floor so Senator Lautenberg may comment on the bill \nor on other issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to start off this discussion by \nsaying how much I appreciate working with Senator Lott and with other \nMembers of the Senate in terms of the amendments. They were offered and \nconsidered, but we moved with a degree of dispatch, indicating to me \nthat this is a bill that is wanted by a significant majority of the \nSenate. That is representing what we believe is a significant public \nopinion about whether Amtrak ought to be brought up to date and be part \nof the transportation system that can help relieve other transportation \nmodes of the congestion, pollution, et cetera, that we face constantly \nin our country right now.\n  I think the amendment that has been offered by Senator DeMint is not \none of those amendments we would accept--the notion that each ticket a\n\n[[Page S13545]]\n\npassenger carries should identify the amount of subsidy that goes into \nthat passenger's ride. I think it is wasteful and I don't see any \nbenefit to travelers or taxpayers. Can you imagine the complication \nthat is involved here? You don't know how many passengers are going to \nbe on that leg and the subsidy has to be divided among the number of \npassengers. How far is each passenger going to travel? That would also \nindicate a part of the subsidy. You cannot take a mathematical formula \nand apply it to this percentage or to this particular passenger's ride.\n  We all know what is afoot here. I generally agree that transparency \nis good when it comes to Federal taxpayers' dollars. But this amendment \nis not needed. It carries the request that Amtrak publish subsidies on \nits Web site. It already publishes subsidies information per route on \nits Web site every month as part of its financial report--the general \ninformation related to those routes, not individual subsidies per \nticket.\n  Amtrak also provides details on every dollar and dime of its finances \nto the Department of Transportation and the Congress on a continuous \nbasis. The DeMint amendment would provide travelers with redundant \ninformation and, frankly, waste Federal funds.\n  As I indicated in my earlier comment, it would also be logistically \nalmost impossible to do what this amendment calls for--to determine the \nsubsidy for each rider and print this information on a ticket. These \nnumbers change depending on how far a passenger rides the train. Even \nif they did not, Amtrak would have to redesign its online reservations \nand ticketing system for customers to get this information. One doesn't \nhave to have been in the computer business, as I was, in order to know \nit would take an incredible amount of time and energy to get the \nsoftware up to date and get the information in on time for it to be \nprinted with any degree of accuracy on the ticket. It is the kind of \nadded cost and redtape that taxpayers are disdainful of.\n  We don't require the same printing burdens on the airlines, and we \nhave provided some $20 billion to that industry in the last 6 years.\n  Americans already understand our Nation's passenger rail system \nrequires subsidies, just as rail systems in other countries. What \nAmerican travelers care about is receiving high-quality and convenient \nrail service as a result of that subsidy, and this amendment is not \ngoing to do anything to help us in those areas.\n  Senator Lott has indicated he and I have worked on transportation \nissues for many years. Finally, the public is so immersed in \ncongestion, in lost time, in delayed and missed appointments, and with \nthe price of gasoline going up as it is--I recently saw a prediction \nfrom someone engaged in the oil industry in the Far East that oil was \ngoing to be up to $200 a barrel in the not-too-distant future. Do we \nwant to continue to subject the American public to these outrageous \ncosts for this fuel, or do we want to try to achieve some balance in \nour transportation systems? Trains are much more economical, reduce \ncongestion, reduce pollution, and can establish a level of reliability \nwe can't get out of the aviation system.\n  We talked about whether we might abandon food and beverage service on \nthe rail lines. We took a vote and it was soundly defeated. But as I \nlistened to the debate, I wondered whether next we would be debating \nseparate charges for the oil and bearing grease that is used on the \nwheels of the train cars and locomotives, and maybe we can separate out \nfurther expenses, maybe paper used in hand towels and items of that \nnature and reduce the number of those used. We cannot deal with such \nsmall matters if we want to get onto doing something that helps the \ncountry function more efficiently.\n  This bill has truly got bipartisan support. We see it not only in the \nleadership that our friend the Senator from Mississippi applies so \nskillfully, but there were quite a number of colleagues on the \nRepublican side who joined in to get this bill as far as it is.\n  We have almost miraculously come to a consensus that says after years \nof working towards this goal, we are going to get to a positive \nconclusion toward the reauthorization of Amtrak. It doesn't mean all \nthe problems were solved by a long shot, but it does say we want rail \nto be as well treated as well as our other means of transportation. We \nspend some $40 billion each year on our highways, and aviation, unlike \nAmtrak, is a for-profit business, and we are still giving subsidies to \nthe airlines each and every year and, as I mentioned, over $20 billion \nsince 9/11.\n  When we look at the possibilities of rail service and see that in \nEurope, for instance, from Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, is 200 \nmiles, about the same distance we are from New York City, they do it in \n1 hour 25 minutes. Here, if we use an airplane, we can be sure that one \nout of four flights is going to be late in departure and usually late \non arrival.\n  If we could get Amtrak to improve its service so we can reduce the \namount of time it takes--I had the good fortune this morning to take a \n7 o'clock train out of New York City. I live in New Jersey, but it was \nconvenient for me to get to the terminal in New York City. I arrived \n2\\1/2\\ hours later, city to city--New York City to Washington, DC. We \ndidn't shake, rattle, and roll all the time. It was nice; if you wanted \nto have a coffee or write or read, it was reasonably comfortable to do \nthat. That is what rail passengers deserve all across this country--\nadequate service.\n  We are anxiously awaiting a vote on the next amendment, which has \nbeen ordered, and final passage on the Amtrak bill.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Lott, for his cooperative manner and his \nleadership throughout the issues we have faced in this body almost all \nthe years I have been here. We have served together a long time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I again say to Senator Lautenberg, I have \nenjoyed working with him on transportation issues--from aviation to \nhighways to highway safety and certainly the rail area and most \nparticularly with regard to Amtrak and the national rail passenger \nsystem.\n  Earlier today, I referred to a ``Parade'' article that will be \nprinted on November 4, 2007. This is a great article. I am going to be \nquoting some very interesting items that are included in this article \nbecause they are so applicable to our debate:\n\n       Americans spent about 3.7 billion hours stuck in traffic \n     last year, burning gasoline whose price had soared by 60 \n     percent.\n\n  And probably going up.\n\n       At the airports, security lines snake endlessly, runways \n     are choked, and delays are common. One recent study found \n     that between January and August 2007, one in four flights \n     arrived late; 159 flights were kept on the tarmac for more \n     than 3 hours in August.\n\n  I heard a story one time about a friend of mine, a Congressman from \nMissouri, who went to the airport and wanted to check three bags. He \ntold the attendant: I would like this bag to go to St. Louis, this bag \nto Kansas City, and this bag to Chicago.\n  They said: You can't do that. Why would you want to do that anyway?\n  He said: Well, that is what happened to my luggage last week.\n  There are certain indignities that go along with this. I don't want \nto attack airlines. We need to do more in aviation. We need a modern \naviation control system. We should be critical when they do things that \nare indefensible, such as keeping people trapped on a plane on the \ntarmac.\n  We need to be thinking about our transportation system in the air in \nthe next generation, how are we going to make it safe, how are we going \nto deal with congestion. Let's not stand here and complain; let's act \non it. That is why I am supporting an FAA reauthorization bill that \nincludes funds for modernization. Senator Rockefeller from West \nVirginia and I have worked together on that legislation. He has been \ncourageous, staking a tough stand. Everybody wants modernization; \nnobody wants to pay for it. We have had some serious recommendations, \nand I am still hopeful that we can resurrect that bill. That is another \nreason why we need this particular legislation.\n\n  ``Trains use one-fifth less energy than cars or planes.'' I know this \nis something the Presiding Officer from Vermont cares a lot about. This \nmakes environmental and conservation sense. They are business \nefficient, tourist\n\n[[Page S13546]]\n\nfriendly, and that goes not only for the Senator from New Jersey who \ncame down this very morning, but the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, \nwho said he was in New York City and came down on the train. It cost \nless, it was very pleasant, and it didn't take as much time.\n  Why shouldn't we try to do more of that? By the way, it is not just \nabout the eastern seaboard. We want a national passenger rail system. \nBut one of the keys, as I mentioned earlier, is intercity connections. \nWe are not talking about just going north, but talking about an \nintercity connection between DC and Charlotte, NC. We are talking about \nPortland and Seattle, Chicago and Detroit. We are talking Miami and \nJacksonville. And we provide additional assistance in this bill through \nthe State Capital Grant Program for intercity passenger rail projects.\n  The grant program makes grants to States or groups of States to pay \nfor the capital cost of facilities and equipment necessary to provide \nnew and improved intercity passenger rail. The Federal match is 80 \npercent. Projects are selected by the Secretary of Transportation based \non economic feasibility, expected ridership, and other factors.\n  By the way, that is the same arrangement we have with highways. \nPeople say: Oh, my goodness, subsidy of a rail passenger system? Well, \nyes. We have a subsidy for airlines, and we have a subsidy for \nhighways.\n  I wish we didn't have to have a subsidy. I do hope we do a better job \nof running Amtrak. I think some progress has been made. I still say \nformer Chairman of Amtrak, David Gunn is a good man and did a lot of \ntough things and would have done more if he had been able to stay on. I \nwish him well.\n  By the way, how much money are we subsidizing Amtrak? Last year, the \nfunding was $1.3 billion, the same as it was 25 years ago. We haven't \neven accounted for a piece of the inflationary impact.\n  I want modernization. I don't want the Acela, this nice train running \nfrom Washington, DC, to New York and Philadelphia and then have me have \nto ride some raggedy train from Meridian, MS, that bumps and grinds and \ndrags along and eventually comes to Washington. I want to have \nsomething like the Acela, also. We are going to have to have capital \nimprovements. We will have to modernize. We can't tell the people we \nwant you to consider the alternative of rail passenger if it is not on \ntime, if the food has been pulled off the trains, and the equipment is \npathetic. It is probably going to be an overnight trip. You have to \nhave some modicum of comfort to take advantage of this alternative.\n  I have a feeling--and it is not a good one--that we are going to have \ngridlock and congestion, maybe even safety threats. We are going to \nhave to have a national passenger rail system. I would rather ride on a \nsleeper or a nice passenger car than in a cargo-type boxcar. That is \nthe way a lot of people have traveled in years gone by, boxcars.\n  We are trying to do something responsible to make a difference for \nthe American people and deal with our transportation needs in this \ncountry.\n  I do want more transparency. I do want them to cut out the waste. If \nfood costs are being driven by 52 percent labor cost, change it. Raise \nthe cost, do whatever is necessary. But I am tired of people \ncomplaining about it and nobody doing anything about it.\n  I urge the Amtrak board: Get engaged. On transportation, I have urged \nthis administration and the previous administration: Lead us, push the \nedge. Yet we have had to drag administrations into this area, which is \none of the few areas, in my opinion, philosophically, the Federal \nGovernment has a role--interstate transportation. You can't do it alone \nif you are a poorer State, such as Vermont, Montana or Mississippi. It \nhas to be between States, it has to be supported by the Federal \nGovernment. It creates jobs. When we build a highway, when we extend a \nrunway, when we improve a terminal and make it safer, make it where the \ntransportation safety administration can do its job, when we lay more \nrailroad track, when we put more trains on that trackage, when we \nprovide good service, jobs are created.\n  I have absolutely been convinced, in the last 10 years of my career, \nthat transportation is key to future of the country. Infrastructure, \nyes, industrial sites, water, all that. But lanes, planes, trains, \nports, and harbors, if people can't get there, whether it is an \nindividual, a corporate executive or international, multinational \ncompany, they are not going to come. If they have to get there on a \ndirt road--no. They are not going to come. If they can't get decent \ncommercial service, they are not going to come.\n\n  This is just a part of the package. It is the kind of thing we can do \nin a bipartisan way. One of my big problems this whole year is we have \nlooked for ways or issues that we fight over. ``We are defining our \nbase.'' ``We are defining our party.'' Baloney. I didn't come here just \nto define a party. I think we ought to be trying to find a way to do \nsome things for the American people. It doesn't have to be the grand \ndesign of tax policy or budget policy. No, it can be national rail \npassenger system. It can be something smaller that we can work together \non that produces a real result. Let's quit looking for ways that we can \nfight. There will be plenty of time for that. Let's look for things we \ncan do together that have broad support.\n  I will be involved when that time comes. I am in and out of here--\naround here all the time, on a bipartisan basis, because I just can't \nstand the idea of just being here and producing nothing. I have been \ntold, in a way, I have some sort of congenital defect; and that is a \ndesire to get things done. I hope that is what the moniker on my \ntombstone will say: He died trying to get something done, something \nthat people care about in this country.\n  I am getting a little carried away. I am sounding like a preacher. I \napologize. But I am passionate about this. I feel a little offended. \nSome people are sitting here saying this guy is from Mississippi, what \ndoes he care? I care because it is right for our whole country, not \njust for my State. I don't have a vested interest, thank goodness. Yes, \nwe will have a little Amtrak service, not a whole lot, but we will have \na couple of lines that come blowing through my State. We will be glad \nto have them. We hope they will stop a couple of times and pick us up \nand take us to New Orleans or take us to Atlanta or take us to Chicago.\n  But Europe and Japan and other countries have done this. I don't like \nto emulate those countries in a lot of instances, but if they can do \nit, you are telling me we can't do it? It is just a matter of us making \nup our minds that we are going to do this, and I hope we have made up \nour minds this time and we are going to do something that will really \nhelp the national passenger rail system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Senator Lott was speaking about the \nlarger assignment that we have in front of us rather than simply a \nparty allegiance. There is no doubt that long before we were \nRepublicans and Democrats, we were Americans. If we keep that focus in \nmind, I think we can help our country achieve some of the goals that we \nneed to examine.\n  Look at the conditions that have overtaken America--I will use that \nword--and look back at the population. In 1970--1971, when AMTRAK was \ntaken over as a quasi-public corporation, the country had 200 million \npeople. Now, barely 35 years later, we have 300 million in this country \nof ours. Imagine, 100 million more people, and we are still depending \non a rail system that was largely developed far earlier than the 1970s.\n  I think Senator Lott was absolutely right when he spoke about our \nneed to bring the aviation system up to date as well. We have narrowed \nthe separation between airplanes to one thousand feet vertically. That \nis not designed to scare anybody because the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) can handle it, but the FAA does say we are \nsqueezing whatever spare air we have to fill the airspace. When we look \nat the lighter jets coming into service, it is expected that there will \nbe some 5,000 new very light jets in the sky in the next 10 years. We \nsee the planes are filled constantly and ways have to be figured out to \nmake air service more reliable.\n  I repeat something that has been said many times: One out of four \nflights is late today. One of the airports that suffers from these \ndelays is my favorite\n\n[[Page S13547]]\n\nairport, and that is Newark Liberty International Airport in New \nJersey. We have to learn different ways to do things because, as has \nbeen said, the air time to fly from Newark or LaGuardia--I live in \nbetween because I live in that part of New Jersey near the Washington \nBridge, so I live midway in between. So I can go to either airport for \nservice.\n  But what has happened is I have been on the airplane many times going \nup from here to our region and I hear the pilot say: Good evening, the \nweather is fine, the flying time to Newark Liberty Airport is 38 \nminutes. Since there are no weather delays we should enjoy our trip up \nthere, and I hope we will be able to close the door soon and get on our \nway.\n  In this particular flight that I am thinking of, the pilot closed the \ndoor, we were pushed out with the truck to get into place, and the \npilot said: Oh, we just learned air traffic in the New York area is \nfairly heavy, and our takeoff time is an hour from now.\n  An hour from now, for a 38-minute flight. I looked at my watch many \ntimes and couldn't wait for the hour to pass. The pilot gets on the air \nand says: We have just been advised that we have 23 minutes longer than \nexpected.\n  By the time that 38 minutes flying time got through, it was 3 hours \nof time passed.\n  I just told the story about taking a train down this morning from New \nYork Penn Station, and it was 2 hours and 35 minutes. I was in the \ncity, so I didn't have to travel a half or three-quarters of an hour to \nget to the airport, and then to be there a half hour or 45 minutes \nearly, so the time consumed just doesn't balance out.\n  We have to get on with this opportunity to improve our transportation \nsystems because we are being forced into it. We have not planned \nadequately enough to accommodate travel in our country. We have to act, \nbecause we know things are going to worsen, not get better \nautomatically.\n  As we deal with problems--the occupant of the chair, the Senator from \nVermont, and I--we are dealing actively with global warming because of \nemissions that come from cars, from buildings, from industrial sources, \nfrom all kinds of greenhouse gas sources that are creating global \nwarming. Global warming threatens our families directly. It is said by \nthe most auspicious scientific advisory groups--the National Academy of \nSciences, the Union of Concerned Scientists, National Science \nFoundation--they are saying: Get on with it. You have a 10-year window \nduring which time you can do something about arresting the growth of \nglobal warming that will make life quite different on our planet than \nwe are used to.\n\n  When we see ecological disturbances, like male fish in the Potomac \nRiver carrying eggs--not the female fish--that is an ominous sign. When \nwe see polar bears on floes that are ragged, watching as the ice melts \nfrom under their feet, it is an ominous sign. When we understand that, \nif the ice melts--and the occupant of the Presiding Officer's chair and \nI and other Senators were in Greenland not too long ago and watched ice \nmelt, not in little rivulets but almost like waterfalls, and the \nforecast is that if that ice melt continues at the pace it is, within \n50 years the seas can be 20 feet higher than they are. We have to get \non with it.\n  This is an opportunity to make a contribution to the reduction of \ngreenhouse gases and arrest the momentum of global warming. That rail \nbill we have is an essential factor in that area.\n  How about the experience this country has had in these last years \nwhen two nuclear energy plants were built, one in New Hampshire and one \nin Long Island, NY, that had to be virtually abandoned because there \nwas no sensible evacuation route. Rail makes a difference. If rail had \nbeen used in Louisiana at the time of Katrina, a lot more people could \nhave escaped some of the fear and the anxiety and the deaths and \nillnesses that struck people as a result of that terrible storm. Let's \nget on with it.\n  We have a commitment under the regular order of business to vote at 4 \no'clock on an amendment that talks about showing the subsidy per \nticket, offered from our colleague from South Carolina, to make certain \nthat we identify how much we are spending on a subsidy.\n  We are not saying the same thing has to be done on an air ticket. \nAviation is essential. Airlines helped connect this country. We are \nable to get coast to coast, long distances, in a relatively short time. \nWe subsidize these for-profit companies. They are businesses. Amtrak is \na not-for-profit company, so we are going to have to subsidize it. I \nthink now what we are saying is we are stepping up to the plate and \ngetting on with it.\n  I hope my colleague from South Carolina will be able to join us \nbecause the time now will be charged to the time allotted for debate. I \nam going to suggest the absence of a quorum while we wait and ask the \ntime for debate under the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I understand at 4 o'clock we have a vote \non DeMint amendment No. 3467. I would summarize again the purpose of \nthis amendment and what it entails. We have talked about the importance \nof disclosure, in letting the American people know how Government \noperates and actually what it costs them.\n  When it comes to Amtrak, we are all very aware that there are heavy \nsubsidies for Amtrak. This works out to an average of over $210 a \nticket across the country. In some parts of the country Amtrak is \nworking very well and in other parts of the country, the Federal \nGovernment is subsidizing over $500 a ticket to keep this going.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have about 6 minutes left. I \nsuggest we divide it between us so that we have a couple of minutes to \nrespond to the Senator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is fine. I will take a couple more minutes.\n  My amendment requests full disclosure of the costs of subsidies for \neach ticket. This would allow passengers and all Americans to know that \nwhen they buy a ticket, how much tax dollars go in, in addition to what \nthey pay, to subsidize the price of their ticket.\n  This will do a number of things, I think, that are important. It will \nnot only let the American people know how much they are spending to \nkeep Amtrak going, it will force Amtrak to actually calculate the real \ncosts of operating their lines throughout the country.\n  In order for us as a Congress to make good decisions about Amtrak and \nallow them to make good decisions about which lines should be \ndiscontinued, which ones should be continued, it is important for them \nto calculate the cost. Right now the way they calculate costs does not \nallow them to determine the real costs for their lines. I want to make \nclear we are not trying to cut any funding in this amendment from \nAmtrak. We are not asking to do anything but what a normal business \nwould do; that is, to calculate the real cost of operating each of \ntheir lines.\n  It is the same as asking a business to determine the cost of all of \ntheir product lines so they can determine which are profitable, which \nare not. In this case, we will determine not only which ones are not \nprofitable, and how much in subsidies there is, but what the real costs \nare for each line.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this as a measure of disclosure \nfor Amtrak, not in any way to harm Amtrak or their operations. I think \nit is a way to help them be more efficient in the future.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again to the Senator from South \nCarolina who just left the Chamber, I appreciate the way he has \napproached this. He did not come in and condemn it; he looked at it. He \nhad some ideas, and several of them have been accepted. I think he \nwound up getting five of his ideas that have been accepted. So he has \nbeen a constructive force.\n  I have found a lot of Members assume we are trying to provide money \nto Amtrak without any reforms. When they\n\n[[Page S13548]]\n\nlook at it, I think they are surprised at the number of requirements \nand plans and reform that we do include in this legislation.\n  But I would be opposed to this amendment. You would have to print on \neach individual ticket the specific amount of the Government subsidy \nper passenger for that route. Now, think about it. You know on its face \nthat would take a lot of effort. It is changing. It would cost, I have \nheard, probably as much as $3 million. I do not want to vouch for that, \nbut there would be some cost. But it is already available. You can get \nthis information through the public Web site. That is available, about \nwhat the cost of the subsidy is on these tickets. So it would provide \nsomething that is already available. You would have to pay for it. We \nhave a number of other reporting and disclosure requirements included \nin this bill. I think it is redundant to what we have in the bill.\n  We are focused on trying to reduce subsidies. The point should not be \nhow much is it now per ticket; the point should be: How much is it \naggregate and what are we going to do about it? We have got specific \nmarkers in this legislation, the metrics and standards that will be \nrequired to get us to a reduced amount of subsidy.\n  But, again, as I have said earlier, it is a chicken-and-egg thing. \nYou can do it in a responsible and reasonable way and get a result or \nyou can force things that cost money and do not achieve anything.\n  Also, we are not going to reduce the subsidies until we improve the \nservice, improve the capital stock, and do a better job. That is what I \nbelieve this legislation will do. So I urge the amendment be defeated.\n  I again thank the Senator from South Carolina for being willing to \nwork with us on a number of amendments he had that actually did add \nimprovements to the bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I do not know if there is any time \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we need a couple of minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent to extend the period prior to the vote for 5 minutes \nso we can prepare the managers' amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 3486; 3489, as Modified; and 3469, as Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, under the order, there is consent for \na managers' amendment to be in order. That managers' amendment is at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the three amendments be \nconsidered en bloc and modified, if applicable; that the amendments be \nagreed to as modified, if modified; and the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3486\n\n (Purpose: To require the rail cooperative research program to include \n    research designed to review rail crossing safety improvements, \n          including improvements using new safety technology)\n\n       On page 105, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       ``(12) To review rail crossing safety improvements, \n     including improvements using new safety technology.\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 3489, as modified\n\n       On page 60, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 224.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Passenger \nRail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. First I would like to \nthank Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott and their staff for all of \ntheir hard work on this bill. This bill is the product of true \ncollaboration and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. Serving \nnearly 26 million riders each year, Amtrak provides an invaluable \nservice to travelers and commuters all over the country and \nparticularly along the Northeast corridor.\n  Unfortunately, in the past few years, we have seen efforts to fully \nfund and modernize Amtrak thwarted, leaving Amtrak repeatedly \nunderfunded by the administration. This bill will end this pattern of \nstop-gap funding and provide Amtrak with the resources it needs to \nimprove service and passenger safety as we move forward. As you know, \nmany of the security measures initially included in this bill have \nalready been signed into law as part of the Implementing the 9/11 \nRecommendations Act. I congratulate my colleagues on\n\n[[Page S13549]]\n\nthese accomplishments as these measures will significantly strengthen \nthe security of our passenger rail system.\n  As Amtrak formulates its plan for the future, it is important that it \nhas the funding and support needed to maintain the system and restore \noperations to high performance levels. By authorizing $10 billion over \nthe next 6 years for repairs and operating costs, in addition to \nmillions in grant funding, Amtrak will be able to accomplish this goal \nand meet the transportation and safety needs of travelers who rely on \nthe system. This bill will also ensure that Amtrak is able to restore \nthe Northeast corridor--the most heavily trafficked stretch of the \nsystem--to a state of good repair by the end of 2012. This corridor is \nrelied upon by leisure and business travelers alike and is an integral \npart of the Northeast economy. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \non this bill and believe it provides Amtrak with a solid blueprint for \nthe future.\n  In New York particularly, Amtrak is indispensable to the economy and \nbusiness community. Thousands of riders travel daily to New York City \nfor meetings, to visit family and friends or for an early dinner before \na Broadway show. Amtrak offers New Yorkers reliable and hassle-free \naccess to cities all along the east coast, making it a crucial mode of \ntransportation for hundreds of thousands of travelers each year.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to continue to improve \npassenger rail service through Federal support and increases in safety \nand security and I look forward to the final passage of this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as ranking member of Senate Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, I rise to speak in \nthe support of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of \n2007. This bill reflects several years of work by Senators Lautenberg, \nLott, myself and many others to reform our Nation's passenger rail \nsystem.\n  Over the 6-year life of the bill, Amtrak's operating subsidy is \nreduced by 40 percent through cost cutting, restructuring, and reform. \nThis bill authorizes funding for Amtrak's capital and operating needs \nto maintain current operations, upgrade equipment, and return the \nNortheast Corridor to a state of good repair.\n  While I know that there are some who argue that this bill does not go \nfar enough, I do believe that it is a step in the right direction. In \nparticular, I believe that the State-Amtrak partnerships outlined in \nthis bill--with respect to both the cost allocation and capital match--\nwill be key to ensuring the long-term viability and growth in ridership \nof intercity passenger rail.\n  I have long advocated for the establishment of an equitable system \nfor States to pay their fair share toward the operating costs related \nto Amtrak corridor routes. In the Northwest, Amtrak operates the Amtrak \nCascades, which provides daily service between Eugene, OR and \nVancouver, British Columbia. This service is supported through \noperating funds provided by the States of Oregon and Washington.\n  With almost 700,000 riders last year, the Amtrak Cascades is the \nseventh most heavily traveled corridor in the country and represents a \nmodel for partnership among States, Amtrak, freight railroads and local \ncommunities. Currently, however, Oregon is one of only 14 States that \nprovide operating funds to support and maintain Amtrak's service. This \nbill would help change that.\n  On the capital side, this bill encourages States to get more involved \nwith our national passenger rail system by creating a new State Capital \nGrant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects.\n  The program makes grants to a State, or a group of States, to pay for \nthe capital costs of facilities and equipment necessary to provide new \nor improved intercity passenger rail. The Federal match is 80 percent. \nProviding States with this option will be a valuable tool to assist \nthem in their transportation planning.\n  Across the country and across all transportation modes, congestion is \nbecoming more and more of a problem, and, unfortunately, it is only \ngoing to get worse. Increasing the use of passenger rail, particularly \nwithin more densely populated corridors such as the Cascades corridor I \nmentioned earlier, should be part of our national strategy to fight \ncongestion.\n  It should be noted that intercity and commuter passenger railroads \nare one of the cleanest forms of transportation. On a per passenger \nmile, Amtrak is 17 percent more energy efficient that domestic airline \ntravel and 21 percent more efficient than auto travel.\n  Finally, I want to talk quickly about ridership and financial \nperformance. In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak ridership increased to \n25,847,000, marking the fifth straight year of gains and setting a \nrecord for the most passengers using Amtrak since its creation in 1971.\n  Additionally, total ticket revenue for the fiscal year topped $1.5 \nbillion, up 11 percent over the previous fiscal year.\n  More people are using Amtrak today than ever before, and given the \ntransportation capacity constraints our country will face in the coming \nyears, I believe it would be a mistake if we didn't make the \ninvestments now--in both time and money--to try to reform the system to \nensure that passenger trains are a viable transportation alternative in \nthe future.\n  I don't believe that this is a perfect bill, but I do believe that it \nis a step in the right direction, and I hope my colleagues will support \nit.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nPassenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007. I commend \nSenators Lautenberg, Carper, and Lott for their excellent work on this \nbill, and I am proud to co-sponsor it.\n  Amtrak is certainly important to my home State of Connecticut. Amtrak \noperates 46 daily trains in Connecticut, serving almost 1.5 million \npassengers each year. New Haven is the twelth busiest train station in \nthe entire Amtrak system, with over 630,000 passengers annually. Amtrak \nis also a significant employer in my State, providing 575 jobs to \nConnecticut residents.\n  These Connecticut facts provide me with robust reasons to champion \nAmtrak, but I also believe that we must have a strong national \npassenger rail system. We rely on the heavily used Northeast corridor \nto provide a convenient transportation option for those traveling \nbetween Washington, DC and Boston. The capital funding authorization in \nthe legislation before us will require that Amtrak develop a spending \nplan to improve infrastructure along the corridor, which will lead to \nreduced travel time and delays.\n  There is also an important environmental reason to support Amtrak. \nGlobal warming is a real problem, and we need to figure out sensible \nways to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We can only solve this \nnational crisis if we work together collectively. As far as Amtrak is \nconcerned, we cannot focus solely on the East and West coast train \ncorridors. Instead, we need to figure out ways to increase ridership \nfor as many routes as possible. This bill requires Amtrak to become \nmore efficient in delivering its long distance service by implementing \nperformance improvement plans for trains with low ridership.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act also creates a new \nState Capital Grant program for inter-city passenger rail projects. \nWith a Federal match of 80 percent, the Secretary of Transportation \nwill select worthy projects based on environmental impact, economic \nbenefit, and anticipated ridership. I want to underscore the importance \nof this new grant program. The era of cheap oil is over, and our \nNation's security depends on implementing innovative energy and \ntransportation alternatives.\n  The last Amtrak authorization bill expired in 2002, so the time for \nthis bill's passage is overdue. Amtrak deserves a stable funding \nblueprint for the next 5 fiscal years. Without such certainty, it is \nimpossible for Amtrak to succeed and meet the considerable challenges \nand goals we have placed before them.\n  I commend my colleagues again for a job well done on a bipartisan \npiece of legislation that builds a strong consensus on the next \ngeneration of passenger rail in the United States.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 294, \nthe Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, offered by \nSenators Lautenberg and Lott. I signed on as a cosponsor of this bill \nsoon after\n\n[[Page S13550]]\n\nit was introduced because this legislation provides a much-needed and \nlong overdue investment in the future of passenger rail in our country.\n  The benefits of a strong passenger rail network are clear: Amtrak \nhelps reduce congestion on our highways in an environmental-friendly \nmanner. Anyone who travels regularly on our Nation's highways \nrecognizes that we need a comprehensive solution to our congestion \nproblems that involves multiple modes of transportation. We need to do \nso, however, in a way that reduces carbon emissions. Passenger rail is \nkey to these efforts.\n  Amtrak has made great strides in recent years in terms of its on-time \nperformance, its commitment to high speed rail, and its emphasis on \nincreased ridership. While Amtrak still has work to do on the longer \ndistance routes serving Pennsylvania and other parts of the country, \nthe well-documented ontime performance of the Acela Express in the \nNortheast corridor is a perfect example of the possibilities that \nresult from appropriate investments in rail infrastructure. At the end \nof fiscal year 2007, Amtrak officials reported that ontime performance \nfor Acela Express was 87.8 percent, up more than 3 percent over the \nsame period in 2006.\n  The Northeast corridor is not the only area where Amtrak is making \nprogress. Pennsylvania's Keystone line, operating between Harrisburg \nand Philadelphia, ranks fifth in ridership and revenue growth among all \nAmtrak services. Many of my constituents use this line to travel \nbetween Harrisburg and Lancaster and on to Philadelphia and New York.\n  The legislation we are considering here today also would create a new \nState Capital Grant Program for intercity passenger rail capital \nprojects. The program would authorize the awarding of grants to a \nState, or a group of States, to pay for the capital costs of \ninfrastructure, facilities, and equipment necessary to provide new or \nimproved intercity passenger rail. This new program is particularly of \ninterest in Pennsylvania, as we continue to look at reinstituting \nroutes, particularly between Scranton and the New York metropolitan \narea.\n  Finally, it is my hope that this new investment will spur Amtrak to \naddress outstanding labor issues that have simply gone on for too long. \nAmtrak's infrastructure upgrades should be coupled with investments in \nits workforce, and I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate \nand the House, will continue to closely monitor this situation in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  Thank you. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nPassenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007.\n  The bill before us today would authorize an increase in Federal \nfunding for the operation and development of passenger rail services, \nreauthorize Amtrak for an additional 6 years, and provide much needed \nreform of the Nation's rail system.\n  This legislation makes an important first step to establish high-\nspeed rail systems throughout the United States.\n  A strong national rail system provides Americans with a practical \ntransportation alternative, helps to alleviate traffic congestion on \nour Nation's highways and reduces harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This legislation would also require an increase in financial and \noperation transparency and accountability at Amtrak, reduce Federal \noperating subsidies, and improve train performance and customer \nservice.\n  Today, Amtrak serves nearly 25 million riders each year at more than \n500 stations across 46 States.\n  Amtrak is also one of the Nation's largest providers of contracted \ncommuter service for State and regional authorities. Over 60 million \ncommuters in California, Maryland, Connecticut, Washington, and \nVirginia take Amtrak to work each year.\n  California's partnership with Amtrak represents the largest State-\nsupported passenger rail program in the United States. Each day, Amtrak \noperates approximately 70 intercity trains and 100 commuter trains in \nCalifornia.\n  Amtrak's corridors in California are also among the busiest in the \nNation, with more than 10 million Californians boarding Amtrak during \nfiscal year 2006.\n  The Pacific Surfliner service from San Diego through Los Angeles is \nthe second busiest corridor in the United States with over 2.5 million \nriders in 2006.\n  The Capitol Corridor service between Sacramento and San Jose is the \nthird most traveled corridor in the country with over 1 million riders \nin 2006.\n  Home to two of the Nation's top five most congested cities in the \nUnited States, my home State of California understands the importance \nof viable travel alternatives.\n  Passenger rail services have helped ease highway congestion, reduce \nautomobile emissions and improve the State's air quality.\n  California is well ahead of the curve on developing a transportation \nsystem that has low environmental impact yet meets the growing needs of \nthe California economy.\n  But there is still much more work to be done.\n  It is expected that California's population will grow to more than 50 \nmillion people by 2030.\n  California would need to build about 3,000 additional lane-miles on \nintercity highways and over 90 new gates and five new airport runways \nto serve the expected population in 2030.\n  The State of California and the California High-Speed Rail Authority \nare working to develop a high-speed rail system which would stretch \nfrom San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento in the north, to Los Angeles \nand San Diego in the south.\n  With trains operating at speeds up to 220 mph, the travel time from \ndowntown San Francisco to Los Angeles would be just under 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  As envisioned, California's high-speed train system could accommodate \nnearly 120 million passengers annually by 2030.\n  This state-of-the-art rail system would take millions of cars off the \nroad, ease traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \nallow people to travel faster, safer and more comfortably.\n  To move our great Nation into the next era of modern, efficient, \nenvironmentally friendly transportation, all levels of public and \nprivate finances and resources must be brought to bear. This \nlegislation is an important first step.\n  Investment in America's passenger rail system is important for \nCalifornia. It is important for this Nation. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Lautenberg and Lott for \ntheir hard work in bringing this important bill to the floor. They have \nworked on this issue for years and have always done so in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill which helps our \nNation in many ways, not the least of which is relieving congestion on \nour overcrowded transportation system.\n  We are facing a congestion crisis in this country today, and the \nproblem is only getting worse. Congestion causes Americans to travel \n4.2 billion hours longer and purchase an extra 2.9 billion gallons of \ngas each year, for a total congestion cost of $78 billion. This is an \nincrease from 2004 of 220 million hours, 140 million gallons of gas, \nand $5 billion. The Texas Transportation Institute calculates that the \ncost to the average traveler is $710 a year.\n  Americans are not just facing congestion on our roads; we're facing \nit in our skies and at our airports too. Across the country, flights \nare being delayed longer and longer, while passengers sit in the \nterminal or are forced to sit on the tarmac. Airlines are overwhelmed \ntrying to balance the increased demand for air travel with the \nshrinking space in our skies.\n  Amtrak is a big part of the solution to this congestion crisis. \nAmtrak trains take cars off the roads and offer passengers a faster, \nmore comfortable alternative to air travel for short-distance trips.\n  Furthermore, the average Amtrak train emits two-thirds less global \nwarming pollution per passenger mile than cars and trucks and half the \nglobal warming pollution of airplanes. We can already see the \nenvironmental benefits of Amtrak service, despite centuries-old tracks \nand aging equipment. This bill is critical because it will lay the \ngroundwork for Amtrak to achieve its full potential.\n\n[[Page S13551]]\n\n  The technology behind trains continues to improve and is more \nefficient. With the right Federal investment, we can see energy-\nefficient, high-speed trains moving passengers between cities cleaner \nand quicker than by car or plane.\n  We are beginning to see these benefits in my home State, as the State \nof Illinois doubled its investment in passenger rail last year. Thanks \nto that investment, Amtrak trains in Illinois have seen phenomenal \ngrowth on the trains from Chicago to St. Louis, Quincy, and Carbondale. \nThis past year, those three routes saw the greatest increase in \nridership of any line in the Amtrak system.\n  The Chicago-Quincy routes--the Illinois Zephyr and the Carl \nSandburg--have seen 41.4 percent growth in ridership in the last year.\n  The Chicago-St. Louis line--the Lincoln--saw a 55.8 percent increase \nin ridership since we have expanded service.\n  The Chicago-Carbondale routes--the Illini and the Saluki--have seen \nan outstanding boost of 67.4 percent.\n  These routes helped propel Amtrak to its fifth straight year of \nrecord ridership and ticket revenue.\n  The demand is only increasing, as even more Illinois communities are \nclamoring for passenger rail service. The Illinois Department of \nTransportation and Amtrak have released a feasibility study \ndemonstrating that passenger rail service from Chicago to Rockford is \nvery competitive with car travel, and we expect another feasibility \nstudy soon, which will show that the same is true for service from \nChicago to the Quad Cities.\n  In States such as Illinois that invest in passenger rail, we are \nseeing fewer cars on the road and increased economic activity along the \ntrain lines. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 \nrecognizes theses benefits and rewards States that make capital and \noperating investment in passenger rail.\n  I also thank the managers of this bill for including the State \nCapital Grants Program, which will give States real incentives to \ninvest in expanding passenger rail corridors. The Illinois model proves \nthat with the right investment, we can move Americans out of traffic \njams and into a cleaner, more reliable mode of transportation.\n  Today, we are considering Amtrak's authorization, an authorization \nthat expired in 2002. We already have let too much time pass without \ncapitalizing on the huge demand for passenger rail service. We must \npass this bill now to pave the way for the restoration and expansion of \nAmtrak.\n  Amtrak's success is despite the President's repeated underfunding--or \nnonfunding--of passenger rail in his budgets. It is a testament to the \nSenate and to the Congress that we have repeatedly rejected attempts by \nthe administration and others who oppose Amtrak.\n  Now as we stand at a crossroads of rail service in the United States, \ncommunities are increasingly vocal about their demand for cheaper, \ncleaner transportation options. Intercity rail service is an integral \ncomponent to meeting these needs. The expansion of Amtrak service is \nfar more than refitting rails and building new stations; it is about \neconomic development, relieving congestion on our roads, improving our \nenvironment, and making life easier for future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time postcloture \nis yielded back and the clerk will read the bill for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered, I \nbelieve.

PASSENGER TRAIN PERFORMANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 24308 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(f) Passenger Train Performance and Other Standards.--\n       ``(1) Investigation of substandard performance.--If the on-\n     time performance of any intercity passenger train averages \n     less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive calendar quarters, \n     or the service quality of intercity passenger train \n     operations for which minimum standards are established under \n     section 208 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement \n     Act of 2007 fails to meet those standards for 2 consecutive \n     calendar quarters, the Surface Transportation Board may \n     initiate an investigation, or upon the filing of a complaint \n     by Amtrak, an intercity passenger rail operator, a host \n     freight railroad over which Amtrak operates, or an entity for \n     which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service, the \n     Board shall initiate an investigation to determine whether, \n     and to what extent, delays or failure to achieve minimum \n     standards are due to causes that could reasonably be \n     addressed by a rail carrier over tracks of which the \n     intercity passenger train operates or reasonably addressed by \n     Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operator. As part of \n     its investigation, the Board has authority to review the \n     accuracy of the train performance data. In making its \n     determination or carrying out such an investigation, the \n     Board shall obtain information from all parties involved and \n     identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to \n     improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the \n     train.\n       ``(2) Problems caused by host rail carrier.--If the Board \n     determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum \n     standards investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable \n     to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak \n     over freight transportation as required under subsection (c), \n     the Board may award damages against the host rail carrier, \n     including prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it \n     determines to be reasonable and appropriate pursuant to \n     paragraph (3) of this subsection.\n       ``(3) Damages and relief.--In awarding damages and \n     prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board \n     shall consider such factors as--\n       ``(A) the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial loss as \n     a result of host rail carrier delays or failure to achieve \n     minimum standards; and\n       ``(B) what reasonable measures would adequately deter \n     future actions which may reasonably be expected to be likely \n     to result in delays to Amtrak on the route involved.\n       ``(4) Use of damages.--The Board shall, as it deems \n     appropriate, order the host rail carrier to remit the damages \n     awarded under this subsection to Amtrak or to an entity for \n     which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service. Such \n     damages shall be used for capital or operating expenditures \n     on the routes over which delays or failures to achieve \n     minimum standards were the result of a rail carrier's failure \n     to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation \n     as determined in accordance with paragraph (2).''.\n       (b) Fees.--The Surface Transportation Board may establish \n     and collect filing fees from any entity that files a \n     complaint under section 24308(f)(1) of title 49, United \n     States Code, or otherwise requests or requires the Board's \n     services pursuant to this Act. The Board shall establish such \n     fees at levels that will fully or partially, as the Board \n     determines to be appropriate, offset the costs of \n     adjudicating complaints under that section and other requests \n     or requirements for Board action under this Act. The Board \n     may waive any fee established under this subsection for any \n     governmental entity as determined appropriate by the Board.\n       (c) Authorization of Additional Staff.--The Surface \n     Transportation Board may increase the number of Board \n     employees by up to 15 for the 5 fiscal year period beginning \n     with fiscal year 2008 to carry out its responsibilities under \n     section 24308 of title 49, United States Code, and this Act.\n       (d) Change of Reference.--Section 24308 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Interstate Commerce Commission'' in \n     subsection (a)(2)(A) and inserting ``Surface Transportation \n     Board'';\n       (2) by striking ``Commission'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``Board'';\n       (3) by striking ``Secretary of Transportation'' in \n     subsection (c) and inserting ``Board''; and\n       (4) by striking ``Secretary'' the last 3 places it appears \n     in subsection (c) and each place it appears in subsections \n     (d) and (e) and inserting ``Board''.\n\n     SEC. 210.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN \n                   AMTRAK AS A NATIONAL PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In fiscal year 2007, 3,800,000 passengers traveled on \n     Amtrak's long distance trains, an increase of 2.4 percent \n     over fiscal year 2006.\n       (2) Amtrak long-distance routes generated $376,000,000 in \n     revenue in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 5 percent over \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) Amtrak operates 15 long-distance trains over 18,500 \n     route miles that serve 39 States and the District of \n     Columbia. These trains provide the only rail passenger \n     service to 23 States.\n       (4) Amtrak's long-distance trains provide an essential \n     transportation service for many communities and to a \n     significant percentage of the general public.\n       (5) Many long-distance trains serve small communities with \n     limited or no significant air or bus service, especially in \n     remote or isolated areas in the United States.\n       (6) As a result of airline deregulation and decisions by \n     national bus carriers to leave many communities, rail \n     transportation may provide the only feasible common carrier \n     transportation option for a growing number of areas.\n       (7) If long-distance trains were eliminated, 23 States and \n     243 communities would be left with no intercity passenger \n     rail service and 16 other States would lose some rail \n     service. These trains provide a strong economic benefit for \n     the States and communities that they serve.\n       (8) Long-distance trains also provide transportation during \n     periods of severe weather or emergencies that stall other \n     modes of transportation.\n       (9) Amtrak provided the only reliable long-distance \n     transportation following the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks that grounded air travel.\n       (10) The majority of passengers on long-distance trains do \n     not travel between the endpoints, but rather between any \n     combination of cities along the route.\n       (11) Passenger trains provide transportation options, \n     mobility for underserved populations, congestion mitigation, \n     and jobs in the areas they serve.\n       (12) Passenger rail has a positive impact on the \n     environment compared to other modes of transportation by \n     conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and \n     cutting down on other airborne particulate and toxic \n     emissions.\n       (13) Amtrak communities that are served use passenger rail \n     and passenger rail stations as a significant source of \n     economic development.\n       (14) This Act makes meaningful and important reforms to \n     increase the efficiency, profitability and on-time \n     performance of Amtrak's long-distance routes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) long-distance passenger rail is a vital and necessary \n     part of our national transportation system and economy; and\n       (2) Amtrak should maintain a national passenger rail \n     system, including long-distance routes, that connects the \n     continental United States from coast to coast and from border \n     to border.\n\n     SEC. 225. PASSENGER RAIL STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the General \n     Accountability Office shall conduct a study to determine the \n     potential cost and benefits of expanding passenger rail \n     service options in underserved communities.\n       (b) Submission.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall \n     submit a report containing the results of the study conducted \n     under this section to--\n       (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives.\n\n               TITLE III--INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL POLICY\n\n     SEC. 301.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I must say how satisfying it is that \nthe Senate has done what America has asked us to do. I can't tell you \nhow involved personally I have been in this for many years. Since my \nrelatively early days in the Senate, going back decades, I have been \ninterested in what we could do to make Amtrak an integral part of the \ntransportation system, to make Amtrak easier and more reliable for the \nAmerican people. They asked us to do this, to give them relief.\n  I wish to say to Senator Lott how much I have appreciated working \nwith him--not only now, but we have done so for a number of years. We \nhave the satisfaction of seeing this bill pass and we hope on its way \nto becoming law. With 70 votes, this is a clear message about what the \nrepresentatives of the American people are saying.\n  I thank Senator Lott. It has been a pleasure working with him. As I \nam sure he agrees, I look forward to having more opportunities to do \nthings in a bipartisan nature to help the American people. They asked \nus for relief and we are giving it to them--relief from traffic \ncongestion, relief from lines at the airports, and relief from planes \nlined up on the tarmac. Today, the Senate has said to American \ntravelers: You will have another choice, and the choice is passenger \nrail.\n  I am pleased to note the wide margin by which the Passenger Rail \nInvestment Improvement Act of 2007 has been approved in the Senate. The \nbill is going to speed passenger rail service in the United States into \nthe 21st century.\n  There are many people I wish to thank in addition to my friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi, the minority whip, Senator Lott, who has \nhad a long-standing commitment to passenger rail service.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Inouye, chairman of the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation, for giving me the privilege \nof pursuing and managing this legislation. His confidence has always \nbeen appreciated by me.\n  I thank the majority leader, Harry Reid, for his leadership and \ndecisiveness to work to bring our bill to the floor, and I thank his \nstaff for their support. In particular, the floor staff, including Lula \nDavis, Marty Paone, Tim Mitchell, and Trisha Engle. On the Republican \nside, everybody was cooperative. I thank David Schiappa, Laura Dove, \nand Jodie Hernandez.\n  I also thank all of our cosponsors of the bill. I particularly wish \nto focus on Senator Carper's help and his hard work and constant \nsupport for Amtrak, along with all of our cosponsors' dedication and \ncommitment to improving travel in America.\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\n  I thank Alex Kummant, the CEO of Amtrak, and his government affairs \nstaff, including Joe McHugh and Caroline Decker.\n  I thank my staff, of which I am very proud. They are always there, no \nmatter what the hours or the intensity of the work are. They are there \nwith their support, their knowledge and research and their constant \nconcern for making sure we do things right. My staff includes David \nMatsuda, Dan Katz, Doug Mehan, and Meg Slachetka.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly? I have \nanother commitment off the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the Senator's kind \nremarks. It was a pleasure working with him on this legislation. It has \nbeen a long time coming. I appreciate the active involvement he has \nhad, along with other Senators on both sides of the aisle, including \nSenator Carper of Delaware.\n  There is a long history of trying to get this passed freestanding \nthrough the Senate. We have to give credit to our leadership and to \nSenator Reid in particular. He had to make this happen. We tried last \nyear repeatedly to get it freestanding or to get a window to offer it. \nWe never could get it agreed to at that time. Senator Reid carved out a \npretty big block of time for a Transportation bill. He didn't have to \ndo that. He deserves credit for that.\n  I also thank my staff, including Anne Marie Turner, who is here with \nme; Chris Bertram, who has been working with me for years; and Beth \nSpivey. Our staffs work together great. I am pleased with the \nRepublicans who voted for it and probably all of the Democrats voted \nfor it. I hope the House will act on this expeditiously. This could be \na big step in the right direction. I thank my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for their cooperation. I hope we can do more of this sort \nof thing in the future. I thank the Senator for letting me interrupt \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not at all. I, too, thank Anne Marie Turner of \nSenator Lott's staff. She was always there, and I could tell by the \nexpression on her face at a given moment whether we were on the right \nor wrong track in talking about Amtrak. I also thank Chris Bertram and \nBeth Spivey of his staff as well.\n  I thank the staff from the Senate Commerce Committee, including \nStephen Gardner, who is always so helpful and has extensive knowledge \nabout transportation. Chairman Inouye was so gracious in making sure we \nwere supported with the assistance of Mr. Gardner. Also, I thank \nMelissa Porter, who is on loan as a detailee from the Federal Railroad \nAdministration; Shira Bergstein, from Senator Inouye's majority staff; \nBetsy McDonnell and Dan Neuman, from Senator Gordon Smith's and Senator \nStevens's Committee minority staff.\n  Getting legislation passed by this body takes a lot of work, and \nthese folks are to be commended.\n  Everyone knows our highways are jammed. We don't have to tell them \nthat from here. All they have to think about is what time they get out \nof work and what time they get home and what time do they have to leave \nin the morning to get to work on time. In New Jersey, the most densely \npopulated State in the country, we spend 300 hours commuting by car \nevery year. Fifteen percent of that time is wasted sitting in traffic, \ncreating pollution, creating anxiety, anger, frustration, and bigger \nbills as gas prices go up at the same time.\n  With more than 220 million vehicles on the road and the population \nprojected to pass the 400 million mark before 2050, congestion will \nremain a major challenge if cars and trucks remain the dominant mode of \ntravel.\n  I mentioned earlier in this debate that our population in 1971, when \nAmtrak was developed as a government corporation, was 200 million. Now, \nbarely 36 years later, we are 300 million. We haven't made much \nprogress in upgrading our rail systems even after our country has grown \nby 100 million people.\n  And now we are feeling the effects. Our skies are becoming jammed as \nmore planes take to the air. Last year was the worst year for flight \ndelays since 2000. One in four planes were late.\n  For travelers who fly, for instance, between Washington and the New \nYork/New Jersey area, a 36-minute flight often becomes 2 or more hours \nbecause of delays getting off the ground and, once there, getting off \nthe plane. I once flew up to LaGuardia Airport, and we waited an hour \nto get to the gate.\n  The airlines have admitted this and have revised their schedules to \nreflect that now this 36-minute flight should be expected to take 2 \nhours: 36 minutes in the air, and the rest of the time admiring the \nlandscape, which is pretty dismal when you see all these planes lined \nup on the tarmac like cars in traffic.\n  Between lines of cars on the highways and long lines at the airports, \nAmerica's travelers need and deserve another choice. The answer is a \nworld-class passenger rail system.\n\n  Riding a train saves people money. The national average cost per \ngallon of gasoline is over $2.80 a gallon. I have even heard estimates \nthat we will see oil at $200 a barrel before too long.\n  When you look at all the benefits to travelers, we see that riding a \ntrain can save time, money, and congestion in other modes of \ntransportation.\n  For instance, rail service often delivers passengers directly to \nwhere they need to go, as train stations are more frequently located in \ncity centers. I can tell my colleagues from personal experience, since \nI road the train as recently as this morning, that riding the train was \na pleasurable experience. It gave me a chance to read, to communicate, \nand even nod off for a couple of minutes. It was really a nice way to \ntravel. Passengers can work on laptops, talk on the phone, walk around \non the train, and generally be productive.\n  Riding the train also helps secure our country's future by improving \nthe environment. Amtrak trains are on average 17 percent more fuel \nefficient than passenger airlines, and 21 percent more fuel efficient \nthan passenger cars, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n  Furthermore, trains produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions than cars, \ntrucks, and planes, and per mile locomotives emit about 50 percent less \ncarbon dioxide than airplanes and still less than automobiles.\n  Trains also save lives. If there was ever a moment that demonstrated \nhow much America needed a passenger rail system, it was in the wake of \n9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. On 9/11, when our airports were shut down, \nAmtrak was able to get travelers back to their families.\n  On 9/11, airports were shut down. Amtrak was able to get travelers \nback to their families. During Hurricane Katrina, trains could have \nhelped evacuate persons from those affected cities if our Government \nwas better prepared to employ them. Trains sat idly by waiting for \npassengers to come aboard to be taken away from the center of the \nhurricane, but they could not get to the train. The Government wasn't \nthere to lend a hand.\n  There is great enthusiasm for passenger rail service in America. \nAmtrak's record ridership of 26 million passengers last year can attest \nto that fact. The potential of new railcars in our country is enormous. \nEfficient rail service between Chicago and other Midwest cities, such \nas St. Louis, Detroit, and Cleveland would revolutionize the way people \ntravel in an entire vital region of our country.\n  Likewise, a proposed passenger rail line serving Atlanta, Charlotte, \nRichmond, Washington, and points in between would allow people options \nbesides braving Interstate 95 traffic.\n  If we foster passenger rail service that is viable, reliable, and \ncomfortable, many will choose rail as an alternative, and Amtrak's \nrecord ridership has proven that fact.\n  Today's action by the Senate is a victory for anyone who is tired of \nsitting in traffic or waiting in an airport and for people who work so \nhard to make a living and often live far away from work, far away from \ntheir homes. I remember a conversation I had with a man who worked in \nNew York City who bought a house 50 miles away from his job. His \nthought, he said, for him and his family, in addition to seeing some \ngreen space, was that he would save money, he would be able to put his \nchildren in a house with some room. Now when I see the same man, he is \ndistraught because of the cost for gasoline. The cost for the time lost \nin traffic outweighs the advantages he\n\n[[Page S13566]]\n\nthought he would have. That is not an uncommon situation.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support and look \nforward to completing this legislation in this Congress and getting it \nsigned into law.\n  I look forward to hearing from our colleague, Senator Carper from \nDelaware, who worked so hard and has for many years. He is a frequent \nuser, as they say of Amtrak, that is. We appreciate his hard work and \nthe opportunity we shared to work together to get this legislation \nconsidered and passed today in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while Senator Lautenberg is still on the \nfloor, I wish to express my thanks and the thanks of my constituents in \nDelaware to him and Senator Lott for the partnership they forged in \nbringing us to the reauthorization victory we celebrate this afternoon.\n  Stephen Gardner is still on the floor. Stephen was a member of my \npersonal staff when I was first elected to the Senate. He is succeeded \nby Beth Osborne. We have a great working relationship with him. He has \ngreat talent. He is someone who has not just been in Washington and the \nSenate, but he worked for railroads in the past, including Amtrak. \nGiven his experience, he was invaluable in providing guidance and \nsupport in this process.\n  I wish to speak briefly, and then I am going to make a unanimous \nconsent request that we go into morning business so that Senator \nAlexander and I may engage in a colloquy on another matter.\n  Let me say this: I have come from a meeting at the other end of the \nCapitol, that may still be going on, that started around 2 o'clock. I \nstayed for almost an hour and a half. The meeting involved members of \norganized labor and several leaders in the House of Representatives who \nhave jurisdiction, Democrat and Republican, over infrastructure and \npassenger rail. The meeting was driven in part because of the threat of \na potential work stoppage on our passenger rail system. It turns out \nthat most Amtrak employees, hourly workers who work in the shops and \nwork on the trains, have not had a pay raise in about 7 or 8 years.\n  That is not a good situation. In fact, I think it is a grossly unfair \nsituation and very much a sad situation for them and for their \nfamilies.\n\n  My hope, and part of my encouragement and support for this \nlegislation, is that I think it provides a roadmap for going forward \nwith passenger rail service in this country in the 21st century. We \nneed a roadmap.\n  Senator Lautenberg and others have spoken as to why we need to do \nthings differently--congestion on our highways and in our airports, in \nthe skies, enormous reliance on foreign oil, too much bad stuff going \ninto our air. There are all kinds of reasons people are beginning to \nride trains more and more and why we need to provide supporting \nleadership at the Federal level, at the same time entering into \npartnership with State and local governments.\n  The beauty behind this legislation is that the Federal Government \nsays we are going to take charge and upgrade the Northeast corridor, \nbring it to a state of good repair. In doing that, we unleash the \npotential in the Northeast corridor, including bringing in the more \nexpensive high-speed Acela train which I helped create as a member of \nthe Amtrak board when I was Governor of Delaware, to the extent we can \njust let them run at 100 miles an hour, 110, maybe something close to \n150 miles an hour. Their ontime performance is up to 90 percent, and we \nwould like to make it higher so we can fill up the seats on the Acela. \nWe are close to doing that. They can be a cash cow in generating \nrevenues we need to support other passenger rail service in the \nNortheast corridor and in other parts of the country.\n  One of the good provisions in this legislation is bringing the \nNortheast corridor into a state of good repair and authorizing money to \nbe spent for that purpose, for capital improvement. Amtrak for years \nhas been starved for capital. Along with providing pay raises for the \nemployees, that is first and foremost what we need to do.\n  A second major change in this legislation, for areas outside the \ncorridor, whether it is Tennessee or Colorado, in places where we have \ndensely populated corridors, where the State and local governments \nwould actually like to have high-speed or higher speed rail and run \ntrains, maybe just for 200 miles or 300 miles, and provide better \nservice such as they are doing out of Chicago and out of the west coast \nwhere ridership is up 10, 20, 30, even 40 percent--States are involved \nin that partnership with the Federal Government.\n  This legislation says if a Governor of a State--Senator Alexander and \nI are former Governors. When we were Governors, if we wanted to enter \ninto an agreement with the Federal Government to build a new road or \nhighway, the Federal Government would provide 80 percent. If we wanted \nto get improvements to our airports, the Federal Government provided 80 \npercent of the money and the State provide 20 percent. If we wanted \nimprovements with respect to transit service, the Federal Government \nwould provide 50 percent, and the State would provide half.\n  But a better solution, a more cost-effective solution, happens to be \nintercity passenger rail, and the Federal Government provided zero and \nthe State had to provide all the money. Even if intercity passenger \nrail was a smarter solution, it received no support from the Federal \nGovernment. This bill changes that situation. It puts passenger rail \nfunding on the same level as airports and the same level as roads, \nhighways, and bridges.\n  It makes a whole lot of sense. If States believe they would rather \nspend their 20 percent on airports, roads, highways, or bridges, they \ncan do that. But if they think rail makes sense as part of the \nsolution, they can do that as well with the same kind of incentive. \nThat is good.\n  There are a bunch of long-distance trains that don't make money; they \nlose money, quite a bit of money. We have 16 long-distance trains in \nthis country. We direct the Federal Railroad Administration to take \nfive of those long-distance trains next year, five the year after that, \nand five the year after that and scrub them, look at them, look at what \nthey are doing well and what they are doing badly and what we need to \ndo to reduce the amount of money we are spending to provide passenger \nrail service in those areas.\n  I don't want to run trains if people don't want to ride them. That is \nnot what we should be about. The real secret to doing well with \npassenger rail in this country and, frankly, other countries is to find \nthose densely populated corridors. There are a lot of them. A lot are \nalong the coast. Over half the people in our country live within 50 \nmiles of one of our coasts. We have corridors up and down the east \ncoast from Maine to Florida, the gulf coast, the west coast from San \nDiego up to the Canadian border, up to Vancouver, in fact.\n  Passenger rail can do a lot to help us there, particularly 300-, 400-\nmile routes. People would just as soon ride a train on the Northeast \ncorridor than to drive or take an airplane.\n  Another thing that makes sense is these corridors in our country, \nsuch as Chicago to St. Louis--that is a great corridor and there are \nothers like that corridor in other parts of the country where passenger \nrail can be part of the solution. Those are the kinds of things we \nwanted to work on, to build.\n  Finally, some are interested in competition for freight rail. If they \nwant to come in and run passenger rail service, under this legislation \nthey can compete if they want to. They are not barred from competing. \nThey have the opportunity to do that as well, and the legislation \nencourages that kind of competition.\n  I will close with this comment. My hope is that the reauthorizing \nlegislation we passed today will be warmly received in the House. I \nthink it will be. I am encouraged that it will be.\n  Second, I hope it demonstrates to our colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, House and Senate, that we are not going to be business as \nusual at Amtrak. There is a new day and, frankly, a better business \nstrategy going forward. My hope is that confidence will be reflected in \ngreater appropriations bills, in the House and in the Senate, so Amtrak \ncannot only make the kinds of investments in infrastructure for \nAmtrak--rail, overhead wires, signaling systems, rolling stock--but \nalso\n\n[[Page S13567]]\n\nto say to these folks who haven't had a pay raise in the last 7 years \nor so: We are going to address that inequity too.\n  My hope is we can do all those, and the passage of this legislation \nwill help us in that direction, plus reduce a little bit of our \ndependence on foreign oil, plus reduce the emission of bad stuff into \nour air, reduce congestion at our airports and in our skies and on our \nhighways.\n  If we do all that we ought to declare victory. The thing I love most \nabout what happened here this week and last week on this bill is \nDemocrats and Republicans did it together; we actually worked together \nand I applaud the efforts of Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott and I \nespecially wish to say thanks to our leader, Senator Reid, for making \ntime on the schedule for us to have this debate, to follow through on \nit; and my colleagues on both sides who participated in the debate and \noffered reasonable amendments, some of which were adopted. This place \nactually functioned the way I think people of this country expect us \nto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13567-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander \nand I be allowed to participate in a colloquy for 10 minutes apiece, up \nto 10 minutes apiece for a total of up to 20 minutes. I think what I \nwould like to do initially is yield, if I could, to Senator Alexander \nfor his comments and whatever he would like to say.\n  While he comes to his feet to speak first, let me say, I think the \npeople in the country want us to work together. We have Democrats, we \nhave Republicans, we have Independents in this country, and we realize \nwe are not going to agree on everything. People realize that, but when \nwe can agree, they want us to do that. They want us to use common \nsense, take the opportunity to work across the aisle and make sure that \ncommon sense is reflected, whether it is passenger rail service or the \ninterest or noninterest in providing people protection from having \ntheir Internet access taxed, their e-mail traffic taxed, their instant \nmessaging taxed.\n  I have had the great privilege of working with Senator Alexander for \n3 or 4 years--in some cases maybe longer than we would like to \nremember--on the issue of tax moratorium, but he has been a great \npartner, and I especially want to thank him for letting me be his \npartner and say to Senator Enzi of Wyoming and Senator Voinovich of \nOhio, both former mayors, Senator Feinstein--a former mayor herself--\nSenator Dorgan, former revenue director for the State of North Dakota, \nand Senator Rockefeller, a former Governor of West Virginia, all of \nwhom worked together as a team to try to bring us to this day, to where \nwe are today, the House has adopted legislation we passed last year, \nproviding for a 7-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium.\n  Let me say to Senator Alexander what a real privilege it is for me to \nhave an chance to work with you on all kinds of issues, including this \none. I thank you for that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senators from Tennessee \nand Delaware may engage in a colloquy.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. He \nhas provided extraordinary leadership as a former chairman of the \nNational Governors Association on the legislation that was passed. Let \nme be specific about what has been done.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate worked out a compromise and passed \nlegislation to extend for 7 more years the moratorium on the taxation \nof access to the Internet. That was called the Sununu-Carper amendment, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Delaware. It was an \namendment to the 4-year extension that the House of Representatives \npassed on October 16 by a vote of 405 to 2. I was glad to be a \ncosponsor of the Sununu-Carper amendment. Hopefully, the House will \nvote on that legislation today, if it has not already, so the President \ncan sign it into law before the moratorium expires on November 1, which \nis this Thursday.\n  At the invitation of the Senator from Delaware, let me try to put \nthis accomplishment into a little larger perspective. Above the Senator \nfrom Colorado, who is the Presiding Officer, is a few words that have \nbeen our country's national motto, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' one from many.\n  How do we make this country one from many? Not by race or not by \ndescent but because we agree on a few principles. We have a common \nlanguage, and we have a common history.\n  A very wise professor, Samuel P. Huntington, at Harvard, who was a \nformer President of the American Political Science Association, said:\n\n       Much of our politics is about conflicts between principles \n     with which all of us agree.\n\n  For example, if we were debating immigration, we might say ``equal \nopportunity'' on the one hand, ``rule of law'' on the other. We all \nagree with both principles, but they conflict so we have an argument. \nThat is what happened with the question of whether the Federal \nGovernment should pass a law to extend a moratorium that says States, \ncities, and counties cannot tax access to the Internet.\n  On the one hand, if you have been a Governor, as Senator Carper and I \nhave been, nothing makes you madder than for Members of Congress to \nstand up with a big idea and say let's put this into law; let's take \ncredit for it and send the bill to the Governors, to the States and \ncities and the counties--because usually we find that Senator or \nCongressman back home in our States making a big speech about local \ncontrol at the next Lincoln Day or Jackson or Jefferson Day dinner.\n  That is the principle of federalism on the one side: No more unfunded \nFederal mandates, is what we Republicans like to say. In fact, a whole \nbunch of Republicans, including Newt Gingrich, stood up on the U.S. \nCapitol steps in 1994 and said: No more unfunded mandates. If we break \nour promise, throw us out. The New Republican Congress passed a law in \n1995, S. 1 it was called, no more unfunded mandates, that is the law of \nthe land. If Congress wants to order States and local governments to do \nit, Congress should pay for it.\n  That was the principle of federalism. But on the other hand, we had \nthe principle of--let's say laissez faire, for lack of a better word. \nIf you have been in business or helped to start a business, as I also \nhave, you want as little taxation as possible and as much certainty as \npossible. As the Internet grows and develops, from the very beginning, \nit was thought it ought to be as free as possible from multiple \nregulations and taxes from State and local governments. So that \nproduced the kind of debate that often comes to the floor of the \nSenate, those saying on the one hand: Wait a minute, let's leave the \nInternet alone. Let's let it grow. Let's keep the State and local \ngovernments from taxing it, or at least from taxing access to it. And \non the other hand, the States, the Governors and the mayors and the \ncity councilmen--many of us have been in those positions before--\nsaying: Wait a minute, it is not the job of Congress to say to Colorado \nor Delaware or Tennessee: You must have this service or you can't tax \nfood or you can't tax income or you can't put a sales tax on Internet \naccess.\n\n  In 2003 and 2004, we had a huge debate about the last extension of \nthe Internet access tax moratorium and came to a conclusion. At that \ntime, Senator Carper and I asked the industry, the companies, to sit \ndown with the National Governors Association, the National Conference \nof Mayors, the National Association of Counties and take these \nprinciples--federalism on the one side, laissez faire on the other--and \nsuggest to us some ways we could craft legislation that recognized we \nall agree with both principles. We need to find a way to put the \nprinciples together. That is what this compromise did.\n  I will let the Senator from Delaware explain a little more about the \ndetails of it, but if he doesn't mind, I will go ahead a few more \nminutes and give a couple of examples of why the compromise is a good \nidea. Fundamentally,\n\n[[Page S13568]]\n\nit is a good idea because it achieves these three objectives:\n  No. 1, it updates the definition of what we mean by access to the \nInternet. It updates that definition.\n  No. 2, it avoids most unfunded Federal mandates. In other words, \nStates that are now collecting--in effect, a sales tax on access to the \nInternet or, in some States, a gross receipts tax--in general may \ncontinue to do that during the next 7 years. It is a limited number of \nStates, but it is still important to those States.\n  No. 3, it provides, after a reasonable period of time, that we come \nback and take a look at the whole issue. We finally decided on 7 years \nin the Senate so we can make sure the definition of Internet access has \nnot changed so the law doesn't apply correctly. If anything is likely \nto change, it probably is the Internet.\n  At the time the Telecommunications Act was last written, in the \nmiddle of the 1990s, I doubt, with all respect, that most Members of \nthe Senate even knew what the Internet did, much less used it. In 1998, \nwhen the first moratorium and the definition of Internet access tax was \nwritten, all we knew about was a telephone dial-up Internet. Yet, by \n2004, we had to refashion a definition of access to the Internet to \ntake into account that suddenly telephone calls were being made over \nthe Internet, and States and local governments currently collect \nbillions of dollars in local taxes from telephone services.\n  If the Federal Government banned that, then States would either have \nto raise tuition or raise some other taxes or cut services. So we \ndecided, in 2004, that we didn't mean to keep States from making the \ndecisions about services and taxation that they had already made, \nexcept for the connection of access to the Internet. That didn't just \nfavor States and local governments, for us to figure that out and be \naccurate in our definition. It also was of great benefit to the \nindustry because, for example, some States were taxing what is called \nthe backbone of the Internet, which was not intended to be left out of \nthe moratorium.\n  This compromise, which Senator Carper, Senator Sununu and many others \nhave worked out, I think, in the spirit of our country, takes two very \nimportant principles--laissez faire and federalism--and notices that \nthey conflict in this question but comes to a reasonable compromise end \nresult. So what we have is an updating of the definition of what we \nmean by access to the Internet. What we have is avoiding, for the most \npart, unfunded Federal mandates. And what we have is a reasonable \nperiod of time in which we can come back and revisit the issue, to make \nsure that what was happening in 2007 is still what we mean by the \nInternet in 2014.\n  I am glad to have been a part of this discussion. It went much better \nthis year than it did in 2004, when we couldn't come to an agreement \nfor about a year. The reason was because those affected by it--the \nentrepreneurs of America and the mayors, the cities, the Governors and \ncounty officials--helped us a lot by getting together, resolving their \ndifferences, and understanding each side has a legitimate point.\n  I am glad to be a part of it. I am glad to engage in this colloquy \nwith Senator Carper and I salute him for his consistent leadership and \nfor, once again, demonstrating his ability to work well with people \nfrom many different walks of life and for being willing to work across \nthe aisle, when that was necessary, to produce a result.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if I could reply to the comments of my \nfriend, he mentioned the fact that we do things over the Internet today \nthat frankly we didn't think of about 10 years ago. Initially, we would \ndo dial-up. Eventually, later on, we would have other ways to access \nthe Internet to send our e-mail or instant messaging. I never imagined \n6 years ago we would ever be able to do telephone calls over the \nInternet. In my State and other States as well, those States and local \ngovernment depend on revenues they raise from telephone services to \nhelp pay for schools, to help pay for police, paramedics, fire service.\n  Now we have moved along. Folks are actually able to send TV, \napparently, over the Internet. In a bunch of jurisdictions, not so much \nStates but local governments, they actually derived some of their \nrevenues, not inconsiderable, over the years from cable services and a \ntax on cable services they collect.\n  My dad used to say different things. Probably everybody can remember \nmuch of what your mom and dad said in your lifetime. One of the main \nthings I remember my dad saying to my sister and me is there are two \nthings certain in life: One of them is death, the other is taxes.\n  One of the other things that is certain in life is change, \nparticularly change with respect to technology and change with respect \nto how we use the Internet. One of the beauties of the compromise we \nhave hammered out here with a lot of hard work and support from Senator \nAlexander and his staff member sitting right beside him, Lindsey, and \non our side I especially thank Bill Ghent and Chris Prendergast for all \ntheir hard work and particularly our committee staffs who did a great \njob--but one of the beauties of the compromise we worked out is we have \nto come back and revisit this issue somewhere down the line 7 years \nfrom now.\n  The reason why that is important is because this is going to change. \nThis technology is going to change. Our ability to use the technology \nand what we do with the Internet will change. It will be different 7 \nyears from now. It is important for us to have the ability to come \nback.\n  I certainly lend a strong ``amen'' to what Senator Alexander said. As \nGovernor, he was Chairman of the National Governors Association--so was \nSenator Voinovich. We have three Members of the Senate who previously \nwere Governors and led the National Governors Association. We fought \nhard as Governors in order to convince the Congress to pass the law \nthat President Clinton signed in 1995: No unfunded mandates.\n  We worked hard in 1998 to make sure that as the Federal Government \ncame in, we kind of stepped on that 1995 law, and said: Well, we want \nto change it a little bit, what you can collect in terms of revenues. \nWe passed the 1998 legislation, the moratorium on Internet tax access.\n  They grandfathered in about nine States and said: If you are already \ncollecting, you can continue to collect, but watch yourself there, and \nwe said to the other 41 States, the other jurisdictions, if you are not \ncollecting, you cannot start. But the thing I like about the \nlegislation, we are respectful of the grandfathers, the nine States; \nthey can continue to collect taxes as they have in the last 8 or 9 \nyears. But they can not do something new or different.\n  By the same token, if they are collecting tax revenues on traditional \nservices such as telephone and cable, they are going to be able to \ncontinue to do that. I do not know about the rest of you, but I was \nreminded of this--my boys have grown up in public schools in Delaware. \nIt is important that my State have the ability to collect taxes to help \neducate our children in my State and other States, every other State.\n  We have paramedic service in our State, statewide paramedics. We have \nfire and police. It is important to me that the city of Wilmington, in \nwhich I live, has revenues that they need to make sure we are safe; \nthat if we pick up the phone for 911, somebody is going to come if we \nneed them; if we have a fire in our house or in our neighborhood, that \nsomeone is going to come and put it out. I want to make sure our city \nand other communities have the revenue they need to do that.\n  The last thing I would say here--and this goes back to something my \ndad used to say to my sister and me, when we would pull some boneheaded \nstunt. I must have done it a lot, because he used to say: Use some \ncommon sense. He must have said that 1,000 times during the time I was \na little boy to the time I left and went off to college: Use some \ncommon sense.\n  I think what we have here, as my colleague said last week, a victory, \na victory for common sense, a victory for bipartisanship, a victory \nthat protects the rights and interests and obligations of State and \nlocal governments, a victory for those of us who want to have access to \nthe Internet and not be encumbered by additional taxes. It is a victory \nin all of those areas.\n  It has been a pleasure working with Senator Alexander and our \ncolleagues on this one. We can set this one aside\n\n[[Page S13569]]\n\nfor a while--I am sure we are both pleased to do that--and go on and \nmaybe work on clean air issues, try to figure out how to protect the \nhealth of folks who are breathing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, \nand try to figure out how to do something with respect to climate \nchange and maybe figure out how to use nuclear energy more effectively, \nto make all of that possible.\n  This has been a good--not a day's work but many months' work. I am \ndelighted with the outcome. I thank my colleague and our colleagues who \nhave worked with us and our staffs for getting us to this point.\n  The House of Representatives voted this afternoon. They took this up \nunder suspension of the rules, the legislation we passed here last \nweek. They passed the 7-year extension of the moratorium on Internet \naccess unanimously, over 400-some votes to none. So we can feel good \nabout that when we go home today.\n  Think about it. We have passed a good Amtrak bill, good passenger \nrail bill, worked across the aisle, thought outside the box. We did the \nsame kind of thing with respect to protecting the rights of consumers, \nwithout stepping on the rights of State and local governments. I think \nwe can be proud of that. I am, and I know my friend Senator Alexander \nis as well.\n  I yield to him for any last comments he wants to make.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator and the Presiding Officer.\n  Maybe the next thing we can do as a Senate is take up the Senator \nfrom Colorado's legislation that I cosponsored, and a number of others \nhave, on an honorable conclusion to the war in Iraq, and pass that. And \nthen the American people might notice that with public transportation, \nwith the Internet, and with the war in Iraq, the Congress was actually \nworking together on issues that make a difference to them and is acting \nlike grownups and achieving results.\n  This has been a good several months' work. I thank you for the \nprivilege of working with you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are memories you have of \nchildhood, and some of them are good memories and some of them are \ninteresting memories and some of them are sad memories.\n  I remember as a child being kind of forced to watch a TV program \nthat, frankly, probably was not my favorite, but now, as I look back on \nit, I understand why my great-aunt and some of the other friends and \nneighbors I lived with and near in southwest Missouri loved Porter \nWagoner.\n  Porter Wagoner has died of cancer at the age of 80. He lived in \nNashville, but he is one of Missouri's. He is a Missourian who went on \nto distinguish himself in country music. I know his funeral will be \nThursday at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry House. When his life is \ncelebrated at his funeral, I know hundreds and thousands of Missourians \nwill feel the loss of Porter Wagoner.\n  Porter Wagoner's life was a country music song. He was born on a farm \nnear West Plains, MO. My mother's family has their roots in West \nPlains, MO. This is the heart of the Ozarks in the center of the south \nof Missouri. He was from a family that was very poor, who literally \nlived off the land.\n  In fact, Porter Wagoner bought his first guitar for $8. The way he \npaid for that guitar was he trapped rabbits and sold the rabbit skins \nand saved up $8.\n  His family fell on hard times, and they had to auction the farm. So \nthey had to move into the city, the city of West Plains, MO, where \nPorter Wagoner got a job at the butcher shop. The butcher heard Porter \nWagoner playing that $8 guitar he had gotten from Montgomery Ward and \nasked him to sing in the commercials for his butcher shop on the \nradio--and a star was born.\n  After he began singing in the commercials for the butcher shop, they \neventually then put him on the radio to sing the advertisements in an \narea where people in Springfield, MO--the big city of Springfield--\nheard Porter Wagoner singing in those butcher shop advertisements, and \nhe moved to a station in Springfield, MO.\n  In 1952, he signed a record contract with Steve Sholes, the very same \nRCA producer who signed Elvis Presley 3 years later.\n  In 1953, Porter Wagoner spent $350 to buy his first extravagant \nrhinestone-studded creation that he became known for. He always had \nthese incredible outfits that were very sparkly and always involved a \nwagon wheel and maybe had one of his signature items, which was the \nfact he had put, in rhinestones, on the inside lining of the coat, in \ngreat big letters: ``Hi!'' So when you would meet Porter Wagoner, he \nwould flash his jacket, and this friendly ``Hi!'' would beam out at \nyou. He ended up buying over 50 of these outfits, and they epitomized \nthe style we affectionately call ``hillbilly deluxe.'' They cost \nanywhere from $8,000 to $12,000 apiece.\n  He had many successes. He had many ups and downs in his life. In \nfact, recently a record was made that talked about the time he was \nreceiving help for his mental issues in a hospital and how he went long \nperiods of time without recording. But through the years, he had 29 top \n10 hits, including ``Green, Green Grass of Home,'' ``Skid Row Joe,'' \nand ``The Cold Hard Facts of Life.''\n  There was this young blonde who he made famous. He asked her to come \nand sing with him on his show. It is now well known who that young \nblonde was because that, in fact, was Dolly Parton. If it were not for \nPorter Wagoner, Dolly Parton maybe never would have gotten the chance \nshe needed to catapult her into the culture of country music in this \ncountry.\n  He never had the kind of fancy success that many of our stars have \ntoday, but he was like country music. His life went up and down, with \nvery hard beginnings in terms of what he came from. He achieved great \nsuccess and had low moments.\n  But through it all, his style was very simple--a very simple country \nmusic style.\n  In fact, it was very common for him to use the talking style where he \nwould stop singing and actually talk through a song, telling the story, \nweaving the tale, tying the threads together, so the listeners, before \nthe song was over, not only found themselves tapping their toe or \nsmiling, but they would find that the heartstrings were being pulled. \nThey would have an emotional connection to Porter Wagoner's music and \nthe lyrics he considered so important to the essence of country music.\n  I know everyone in Missouri will miss Porter Wagoner. We have \ntributes to a lot of people on this floor. I know the people in West \nPlains, MO, are so proud of him. In fact, I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, right now, if you traveled with me to West Plains, MO, and we \nturned onto the main drag, you would look at the street sign, and it \nwould be named nothing other than ``Porter Wagoner Boulevard.''\n  He had a band called the Wagonmasters.\n  Tonight in Missouri--all across rural Missouri and in the urban areas \nof Kansas City and St. Louis--all the country music fans are proud of \nthe fact he was one of Missouri's own. Not only will country music miss \nhim, we will miss him in Missouri and what he has meant to our State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, for months, news of recalled toys has \ndominated our headlines. As a mom and as a former prosecutor and now as \na Senator, I find it totally unacceptable that toxic toys are on our \nshores and in our stores. As my 12-year-old daughter said when her \nfavorite Barbies were recalled: Mom, this is getting serious.\n  Today, the Senate Commerce Committee on which I serve took action to \nstem the tide of recalls, to finally take lead out of children's \nproducts, to establish real third party verification, to simplify the \nrecall process, to finally make it illegal to sell a recalled product, \nand to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission more resources. Our \nbill is the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act of 2007, and \nit is some of the most sweeping reform we have seen in years and years \nand years of this agency, which is really now a shadow of its former \nself.\n  I would like to thank the Commerce Committee chairman, Senator \nInouye, for his work on this bill, as well as Commerce Consumer \nSubcommittee chair, Senator Pryor, for his work, as well as Senator \nDurbin and Senator Bill Nelson. We all worked together to put together \na very strong bill. To me, the focus is simple. We need to get these \ntoxic toys out of our children's hands.\n  Today's action by the Commerce Committee sends to the Senate floor \nour opportunity to effectively ban lead from all children's products--\nnot just voluntarily, not just as a guideline, but with the force of \nlaw. I think it is shocking for most parents when they realize that we \nnever had a mandatory ban on lead in children's products. We never had \nthat in this country. It was a voluntary guideline, and it takes a long \ntime, and there are delays and delays and all kinds of loopholes and \nrequirements that have led us to the situation that we are in now.\n  As millions of toys are being pulled from store shelves for fear of \nlead contamination, it is time to make crystal clear that lead has no \nplace in children's products.\n  The need for this ban for me is crystallized from a case that \nhappened in Minnesota. Any parent can tell you the first place a new \ntoy goes is in a little child's mouth, but that shouldn't be our first \ntest for lead, as you will see with what happened in this case in \nMinnesota.\n  Last year, 4-year-old Jarnell Brown got a pair of tennis shoes at the \nstore with his mom, and with that pair of tennis shoes came a free \ncharm. His mom didn't buy that charm, he didn't buy that charm, but \nthey brought it home, and he swallowed that charm. He didn't die from \ningesting the charm. He didn't choke on it. It wasn't that his airway \nwas blocked. He just swallowed this little charm and it went into his \nstomach and over a period of days, the lead in that charm went into his \nsystem, went into his bloodstream, slowly, slowly, over a period of \ndays, and he died. When they tested him, his lead level was three times \nthe accepted level. When they tested that charm, that charm, which was \nfrom China, was 99 percent lead.\n  What is most tragic about this little boy's death is that it could \nhave been prevented. He should have never been given that toy in the \nfirst place. It shouldn't take a child's death to alert us to this \nproblem, but that is what we have seen across this country. Parents \nshould have the right to expect that toys are tested and that problems \nare found before they reach a toy box.\n  The legislation I originally introduced to address this problem, the \nlead ban, is what is included in this bill that we passed through the \ncommittee today. It basically says that lead in any children's product \nshall be treated as a hazardous substance. It sets a ceiling for trace \nlevels of lead, and it empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nto lower the ceiling even further through rulemaking as science and \ntechnology allow. It sets the level at .04, which is slightly below the \nvoluntary guideline they have been using at the CPSC--.06. Several \nother States have levels around .06.\n  It also sets a lower level for jewelry at .02 parts per million, \nwhich is basically the level that is taking effect in California. The \nreason for that is not just little kids, 4-year-olds swallowing charms \nlike the sad, tragic case in Minnesota, but also actually junior high \nand high school girls chewing on jewelry. It is the most direct way to \nget lead into their system, and that is why we set the trace lead level \nlower for jewelry. That was what we proposed in my bill, and that is \nthe standard that is now included in the Commerce bill which is headed \nto the floor.\n  Just yesterday, Consumer Reports released the results of 4 months of \nlaboratory testing for lead in children's products, and what they found \nwas alarming: high levels of lead in items ranging from toys to jewelry \nto vinyl backpacks, to lunch boxes. According to a poll released by \nConsumer Reports, 36 percent of consumers say they will be buying fewer \ntoys this holiday season, and 70 percent said they will be checking \nproduct labels. It is clear that consumer confidence in the safety of \nour toys has been shaken.\n  For 30 years, we have been aware of the dangers posed to children by \nlead paint. It shouldn't have taken us this long to take lead out of \ntheir hands and out of their mouths, and it is the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission's job to do just that.\n  In recent months, it has become all too obvious that this commission \nneeds much reform and that it is long overdue. As we all know, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission's last authorization expired in \n1992, and its statutes have not been updated since 1990. Not \nsurprisingly, the marketplace for consumer products has changed \nsignificantly in the last 15 years, and this summer we saw firsthand \nhow ill-equipped the Commission is to protect our most vulnerable \nconsumers--our children.\n  Today, the Commission is a shadow of its former self, although the \nnumber of imports has tripled--tripled in recent years, and as my \ncolleagues know, all of these recalls recently have been toys from \nChina, literally millions and millions of toys. The number of the \nCommission's staff and inspectors has been reduced by more than half, \ndropping from a high in 1980 of 978 to just over 400 today. In total, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission has only about 100 field \ninvestigators and compliance personnel nationwide.\n  Even worse, we now know the Commission has only one toy inspector. \nHis name is Bob. He worked in kind of a makeshift laboratory, and he is \nretiring at the end of this year.\n  Repeatedly this year, we have seen that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission's recall process can be very slow. In some cases, such as \nthe recalls of the Simplicity cribs and the Magnetix toys, years passed \nbetween when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was first alerted \nto the problem and when it acted to recall the product in question--the \nresult of an outdated provision that places the interests of \nmanufacturers before the interests and safety of consumers.\n  The legislation passed by our Commerce Committee today goes a long \nway in modernizing the Commission. This legislation more than doubles \nthe CPSC's budget authorization by the year 2015--a dramatic change--\nand it provides the Commission with the tools it needs to enforce our \nconsumer protection laws.\n  Today's legislation will also make it illegal to sell a recalled toy, \nfinally taking action against those bad actors out there who are \nknowingly leaving recalled products on their shelves or placing them \nfor sale online.\n  I do at this moment thank some of the retailers that have been \nworking with us on this bill, including Target from our State of \nMinnesota, as well as Toys ``R'' Us, whose CEO testified before our \nAppropriations Committee and was positive about moving forward and \nunderstood the need to beef up the tools for the CPSC, as well as \nincrease resources for that agency.\n  Finally, I was pleased to see incorporated into our bill today the \nidea that we need to make it easier for parents to identify the toys \nwhen a recall happens. First of all, when a recall happens, we need to \nmake it easier to get the information. I have talked to parents who \nhave neighbors who put an e-mail under their door, and that is how they \nfound out about it.\n  The other way is to make it easier. When they know there is a recall, \ncurrently, there is no requirement for a batch number or a date on \nthese toys. When Thomas the Train Set is recalled,\n\n[[Page S13571]]\n\nthe parents are going through the caboose, the green car, and the \nyellow car, trying to figure out do they have the car that was \nrecalled. Obviously, they don't always remember the date they bought \nit. This can be easily fixed by putting a batch number on the toy. \nObviously, you cannot do it on things such as Pick Up Stix, on \nindividual sticks. We are reasonable about this. The bill says ``when \npracticable.'' You can put it on the toy where you can read it. It also \nrequires that the batch number be put on the package. The reason it has \nto be put on the package is not for the parents. Except for my mother-\nin-law, I think most people throw the packaging away.\n  It needs to alert smaller retailers and people selling things on \neBay. The major outlets, such as Target, are able to, once they find \nout what the batch number is, close down their register so those toys \ncannot get through. If you are selling it on eBay or if you are in a \nsmaller store, you may have to look at the batch number to find out, \nsuch as a parent would, what is recalled.\n  That is why our legislation asked for the batch number to be both on \nthe toy, when practicable, and on the packaging. We have seen too many \nheadlines this summer to sit around and think this problem is going to \nsolve itself.\n  As a Senator, I feel strongly that it is important to take this step \nto protect the safety of our children. When I think of that 4-year-old \nboy's parents back in Minnesota and about all these other children who \nhave been hurt by these toys that they had no control over--they are \nlittle kids--we can do better in this country. We can beef up this \nagency that has been languishing for years, and we can put the rules in \nplace that make it easier for them to do their job.\n  We cannot sit around bemoaning the results anymore. We have to act. \nWe have our opportunity, and I hope we do it quickly.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now more than halfway through our \nfifth year in this war in Iraq. We find ourselves stuck as an occupier \nin a Middle East civil war. Thousands of our sons and daughters have \nbeen killed or injured. The total financial cost may be well over $1 \ntrillion--money, I might add, that this administration has borrowed \nagainst our children's future.\n  America's reputation internationally has been severely damaged and \ncritical military, diplomatic, and intelligence resources have been \ndiverted from the war in Afghanistan--a war I supported, and a country \nthis administration has increasingly neglected. And now, after so many \nerrors, so many lives, and so much damage, this administration is again \nraising the prospect of yet another war in the Middle East--this time a \nwar with Iran.\n  I fear this administration has learned nothing from the colossal \nerror, colossal misjudgment in the invasion of Iraq. Let me be clear: I \nam gravely concerned about Iran's activities in the region and its \nnuclear agenda. But any offensive action against Iran must be approved \nby Congress. The Constitution is very clear: Article 1, section 8 vests \nin Congress the power to declare a war. Our Founding Fathers did this \nfor an important reason. Taking a nation into war is a serious decision \nand must be decided with the consent of the people. The Framers wisely \ngave Congress this power based on experience in other nations in which \ntheir executives too easily took nations to war in the pursuit of \nglory, ambition, treasure, or revenge.\n  In fact, as my colleague Senator Byrd of West Virginia has eloquently \nsaid in the past, it is exactly during the time of war or emergency \nthat our constitutional principles--checks and balances, separations of \npowers--are the most critical.\n  Recent statements by this administration give me concern that this \nadministration is considering just this--an offensive military action \nagainst Iran without the consent of Congress. Both President Bush and \nVice President Cheney have made public remarks about Iran that suggest \nan administration readying for military aggression. We know Vice \nPresident Cheney's historic views on fundamental checks and balances in \nour constitution. They are disturbing.\n  For example, in 1996, the PBS documentary series, ``Frontline,'' ran \nan episode on the fifth anniversary of the gulf war. It included a \ntroubling interview with Dick Cheney, who was Secretary of Defense \nduring the first Bush administration. In it, Secretary Cheney said:\n\n       I argued in public session before the Congress that we did \n     not need the congressional authorization. I was not \n     enthusiastic about going to Congress for an additional grant \n     of authority. I was concerned that they might well vote no, \n     and that would make life more difficult for us.\n\n  President George H. W. Bush, nonetheless, wisely sought, and \nreceived, congressional approval. Yet incredibly, Secretary of Defense \nCheney said at the time:\n\n       If we had lost the vote in Congress, I would certainly have \n     recommended to the President that we go forward anyway.\n\n  Those were his words as Secretary of Defense. Now, not only a \nheartbeat away from the President but also the closest counsel to the \nPresident, we know what his views are in terms of the role of Congress \nand our constitution. He is not alone. President George W. Bush has \nshown similar disregard for the role of Congress and the law with his \nregular use of signing statements. Let me read an excerpt from his \nsigning statement from the 2002 Iraq war resolution. President Bush \nwrote that while he appreciated receiving congressional support,\n\n       My request for it did not, and my signing this resolution \n     does not, constitute any change in the long-standing \n     positions of the executive branch on either the President's \n     constitutional authority to use force to deter, prevent, or \n     respond to aggression or other threats to U.S. interests or \n     on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.\n\n  The President was appreciative that Congress, the majority of \nCongress, gave their support for his war in Iraq. He made it abundantly \nclear at his signing statement he didn't believe it was necessary.\n  And in October 2005, when asked by members of the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations whether the President would circumvent congressional \nauthorization if the White House chose military action against Iran or \nSyria, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice replied:\n\n       I will not say anything that constrains his authority as \n     Commander in Chief.\n\n  So now we know. Not only the President but the Vice President and the \nSecretary of State view the Constitution, when it comes to the \ndeclaration of war, as an annoyance, not to be taken seriously, if it \nwould in any way stand in the path of a commander in chief's agenda. \nApparently, the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of \nState see congressional approval for war as an option, not a \nfundamental requirement under the Constitution. This should trouble \nevery American.\n  Let me also be clear that nothing this Congress has previously said \nor done authorizes offensive military action against Iran. Nothing.\n  Following the attacks of September 11, Congress passed Senate Joint \nResolution 23 on September 18, 2001. It authorized the President to use \narmed forces\n\n     against those nations, organizations, or persons against \n     those he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided \n     the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11.\n\n  This language was certainly never intended to allow this President to \ninitiate offensive military action against Iran.\n  Later, in October 2002, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force Against Iraq Resolution. It authorized the President to \nuse armed forces\n\n     to defend the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq.\n\n  Again, that resolution was never intended to allow military action \nagainst Iran.\n\n[[Page S13572]]\n\n  Even more troubling is how this administration missed early \nopportunities to deal with the challenge of Iran. For example, shortly \nafter the toppling of Saddam Hussein, moderates in the Iranian \nGovernment faxed an offer to the State Department--a ``grand bargain,'' \nthey called it. It arrived at a time when moderates were still in power \nin Iran and it reportedly had the approval of the Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomenei.\n\n  The grand bargain offered to put all issues on the table with the \nUnited States--Iran's support for terrorist groups in the region, its \nnuclear program, among other things. Tragically, this administration \nignored it, as it ignored so many diplomatic opportunities prior to the \ninvasion of Iraq. Hellbent on use of our great military, it ignored a \ndiplomatic opportunity that could have been historic. The Iranian \nmoderates were discredited, replaced by hard-line elements who today \nare pursuing more reckless policies in the region.\n  A war with Iran could have devastating consequences. It could further \ninflame an already intense Middle East, further radicalize terrorist \norganizations, lead to more death and disability, and severely disrupt \ntrade and oil shipments in the Middle East. It could entangle our \nbeleaguered military in yet another complex, long-term conflict.\n  Richard Armitage, President Bush's former Deputy Secretary of State, \nwarned us. He said:\n\n       It would be the worst of worlds for an outgoing \n     administration to start a conflict.\n\n  How right he was. Accordingly, any such decision must be taken \nseriously and with deliberation.\n  Last week, I introduced a resolution affirming in very plain, concise \nlanguage the constitutional requirement that this President, any \nPresident, must seek congressional approval before initiating an \noffensive military action, such as one in Iran. Perhaps that time may \ninevitably arrive--I hope not--but if it does, this President cannot \nstand alone or act alone. The Constitution requires that he come to \nthis Senate and the House of Representatives in the Capitol to make his \ncase to the American people.\n  I recall his press conference of 2 weeks ago. The President brought \nup an image which was hard to comprehend--the image of a third world \nwar, a third world war if we didn't take action against Iran. I know \nIran is a threat in the region, I know they sponsor terrorism, I know a \nnuclear Iran is not a stabilizing force but a destabilizing force, and \nyet for this President to walk away from economic sanctions, diplomatic \nalternatives, and to suggest that the military is the only way to prove \nour resolve is to once again remind us that 5 years ago this same \nPresident came to us and asked for the invasion of Iraq.\n  I remember Vice President Cheney telling us our soldiers would be \ngreeted with flowers and parades and a triumphant welcome. That lasted \nfor such a short period of time. And now, 3,900 American soldiers, \n3,900 American lives later, tens of thousands who have been injured and \ndisabled, we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict with no end in \nsight.\n  This President is looking to the exit on January 20, 2009. This \nCongress has to stand with one voice, Democrats and Republicans, and \nremind this President that as he heads for the exit he shouldn't head \nAmerica into a new war. We are not prepared for this. We don't need \nthis. And the President needs to understand what we do need is a chief \nexecutive who will follow the Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13572-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO POLICE CHIEF JOHN KAZLAUSKAS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to John \nKazlauskas, who after 41 years of dedicated service, will be retiring \nas the Owensboro, KY, chief of police this November.\n  Ever since his start at the Owensboro Police Department in 1966, \nChief Kazlauskas has been committed to the progress of the department \nand to the safety of his community. His dedication and hard work \nallowed him to quickly progress from a patrol officer to captain, and \nultimately to the highest rank within the department, chief of police, \nin 2002.\n  Throughout his tenure, Chief Kazlauskas has played a vital role in \ndeveloping several innovative internal programs that have modernized \nthe department. Chief Kazlauskas helped to create the evidence \ncollection unit and the polygraph unit. Chief Kazlauskas also assisted \nthe department with its accreditation process, which involved \nimplementing 120 standards required by the Kentucky Association of \nChiefs of Police.\n  As chief, Mr. Kazlauskas helped improve the services offered by the \nlocal police department by further expanding the bomb squad and \nemergency teams, ensuring police cruisers had modern mobile data \nterminals, and overseeing the implementation of an electronic \nmanagement system, providing a major overhaul to the records \ndepartment.\n  Chief Kazlauskas also made a significant impact throughout Owensboro, \nincreasing the community involvement with the department by putting \ninto place the Citizens Advisory Panel, Crime Stoppers, and creating a \npublic information officer position within the department. These steps \nhave built a trusting relationship between the citizens of Owensboro \nand local law enforcement, making them partners in keeping their \nneighborhoods safe.\n  Chief Kazlauskas not only spent his career ensuring the safety of his \ncommunity, but also contributing to the safety of this Nation. Drafted \ninto the armed services in 1968, Chief Kazlauskas served as an Army \nhelicopter pilot, chief warrant officer. After a tour of duty in the \nRepublic of South Vietnam, Chief Kazlauskas received a Bronze Star with \n23 Air Medal Oak Leaf Clusters for flying over 800 hours of combat \ntime.\n  Chief Kazlauskas has provided constant support, always placing the \nwell-being of his community above his own. The Commonwealth, as well as \nthe city of Owensboro, has benefited greatly from his outstanding \nleadership. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in \nrecognizing Police Chief John Kazlauskas's unwavering dedication to his \nfellow officers, his community, and Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13572-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13572-S13573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL GEORGE WARFIELD FLOYD CHAPMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to LTC \nGeorge Warfield Floyd Chapman, a war hero who sacrificed much to ensure \nthe safety and freedom of his fellow Americans.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman recently passed away at the age of 92, \nleaving behind a great legacy of faith, courage, and honor. Born in \nLovely, KY, in January 1915, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman graduated from \nPike Jr. College in 1937 and from Eastern Kentucky University in 1940.\n  In 1941, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was drafted and commissioned a \nsecond lieutenant in the U.S. Army Infantry Division. In 1943, shortly \nafter marrying his late wife of 64 years, Katherine Carole Coble, he \nwas sent to Europe to fight in World War II.\n  In 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was captured by the German Army \nduring the Battle of Anzio, Italy, a tragic conflict that witnessed the \nstaggering loss of many British and American soldiers. He then spent \nthe next year in prisoner of war camps in Germany and Poland, wounded \nand enduring great hardships and suffering.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was awarded the Silver Star and two Purple \nHearts for his wartime service, but in no way do these truly reflect \nall that he gave for his country.\n  After his return from Europe, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman and his wife \nKatherine moved to Texas where they raised three sons. Lieutenant \nColonel Chapman worked in production for the Continental Oil Company \nand remained active in the U.S. Army Reserve, retiring as a lieutenant \ncolonel. By the time he retired from the Continental Oil Company in \n1962, he had earned a master's degree from Texas A University.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was a hard worker who not only dedicated \nmuch of his life to his country but also to his family as a devoted \nhusband and exceptional father. He was also a historian, maintaining an \nexcellent knowledge and passion for understanding life, history, and \npolitics.\n\n[[Page S13573]]\n\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman will be forever remembered \nnot only as a hero of World War II, but also as a hero in the hearts of \nhis beloved family members. They treasure the gifts he gave to them and \nto his country. Lieutenant Colonel Chapman belongs to a select group of \nindividuals to whom our country will forever be indebted. I would ask \nmy colleagues to rise today in honor of all those who gave so much to \nthis country, including a great Kentuckian, LTC George Warfield Floyd \nChapman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13573-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EASTER SEALS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the charitable sector has long been an \nimportant partner with government in meeting the needs of the disabled. \nFor more than 85 years, Easter Seals has partnered with individuals, \nfamilies, businesses, communities, and government to help children and \nadults with disabilities live, learn, work, and participate in their \ncommunities.\n  Each year, Easter Seals assists more than 1 million people through \nits nationwide network of community-based organizations. These \naffiliates provide top-quality, family-focused, and innovative services \nto meet the specific needs of the particular community it serves.\n  Last year, more than 72,000 children received early intervention and \nchildhood development services through Easter Seals. Over 54,000 adults \nwith disabilities learned the skills and gained the confidence needed \nto seek meaningful employment because of Easter Seals' job training \nprograms. Almost 35,000 children and adults with disabilities \nparticipated in confidence-building activities at Easter Seals' camping \nand recreation programs. Tens of thousands of children and adults with \ndisabilities received life-changing medical rehabilitation therapies \nand case management services from Easter Seals.\n  Easter Seals has long been an effective advocate and important \nresource on policy issues affecting people with disabilities and their \nfamilies. Its founder, Edgar ``Daddy'' Allen, lobbied the Ohio \nLegislature to fund services for children with disabilities in the \n1920s. Today, thousands of Easter Seals volunteers and staff from \nacross the country will continue in ``Daddy'' Allen's footsteps, \nmeeting with their legislators to discuss the importance of low-income \nworking families being able to obtain health insurance for their \nchildren.\n  Earlier this month, Easter Seals held its national convention in \nWashington, DC, and its supporters met with Members of the House and \nSenate to discuss its worthy mission.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend \nWomen's Lunch Place in Boston, MA for 25 years of dedicated service to \nwomen in need in the Boston area.\n  The persistence of homelessness in our State has long been a focus of \nconcern and attention for many of us in Boston and throughout our \nCommonwealth. Homeless persons each have their own story of their \nunique circumstances, but they teach us the same lesson--that we must \ndeal more effectively with the causes of homelessness, such as drug \nabuse, poverty, domestic violence, mental illness, and the lack of \nbasic skills and adequate education.\n  All the members of Women's Lunch Place and its supporters take well-\ndeserved pride in the outstanding work they have done over the past 25 \nyears in providing needed assistance for the countless numbers of women \nwho have walked through its doors. They have made a remarkable \ndifference in the lives of those they have touched so deeply, and all \nof us in Massachusetts are proud of their achievement.\n  The strong commitment of Women's Lunch Place has enabled these women \nto embark on a new life and equipped them with the support of a \ncommunity and a newfound optimism for their future. As it continues its \nmission and its ever-expanding possibilities in the years ahead, I \ncommend Women's Lunch Place for all it does so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13573-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY HISTORY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on a topic that is of \ngrowing importance to many throughout our Nation, especially in my home \nState of Utah. That subject is family history.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have always been a strong believer \nin the importance of researching personal family history and learning \nmore about our roots and heritage. For some, it is a hobby; for others, \nit is a passion to collect, preserve, and share genealogies, personal \nhistories, and memorabilia that document the life and times of families \naround the world.\n  Studies show that a large majority of Americans have an interest and \nare actively involved in tracing their family's history. Indeed, \nmillions of individuals throughout the United States and the world \ncontinue to utilize our Nation's libraries and archives to search the \nrecords that detail the history of our Nation, our States, our \ncommunities, and our citizens. In recent years, the Internet has also \nbecome an invaluable tool for those seeking to learn more about where \nthey came from and what legacies they have inherited.\n  I have been pleased to learn that several agencies throughout the \nFederal Government have established programs which I believe will \ngreatly assist our citizens in their desire to research their family \nhistory. The National Archives and the Departments of Defense, Veterans \nAffairs, the Interior, Commerce, and Justice have all undertaken \nefforts to make digital copies of American records accessible through \nthe Internet. Once completed, these programs will ensure that countless \nhistorical documents, including military, census, court, land, justice, \nand probate records as well as photographs, newspapers and other \nsources of historical information will be preserved for generations to \ncome.\n  As you might expect, Mr. President, scanning billions of documents is \na daunting, as well as expensive, task. Realizing this, Federal \nagencies have created numerous public-private partnerships with various \ncompanies throughout the country, including some from my home State of \nUtah. Many of these companies do so out of an interest in helping the \npublic gain access to important documents and are not wholly motivated \nby profits or gain. The expertise provided to the government by many \nUtahns have made it easier for agencies to scan, index, and preserve \nvarious records for posterity. Private organizations have also worked \nwith government archivists to devise disaster plans in order to protect \nvital records from being destroyed in event of catastrophe.\n  The importance of protecting and preserving the history of our \ncountry cannot be overstated. Recent events, such as Hurricane Rita and \nthe fire in the Washington, DC Library, have demonstrated the need to \nbe proactive in preserving the records of our Nation's past.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend those, both in the government and \nthe private sector, who have worked to preserve our Nation's heritage \nfor future generations. As one who has long been interested in family \nhistory, I am extremely grateful for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13573-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13573-S13574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been 5 years since the sniper \nshootings that paralyzed the Washington, DC, area came to an end. At \n3:19 in the morning on October 24, 2002, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation arrested John Allen Mohammad and John Lee Malvo, putting \nan end to their reign of terror. Over the course of 23 long days, these \ntwo individuals randomly shot and killed 10 innocent people and \ncritically injured 3 more.\n  Following their arrests, John Lee Malvo was sentenced to life \nimprisonment, and John Allen Mohammad was sentenced to death. Many \ncommunity leaders urged action on gun safety legislation. However, how \nmuch has been done to help prevent such incidents?\n  Last month the Federal Bureau of Investigation released its latest \n``Crime in the United States'' report, detailing\n\n[[Page S13574]]\n\nlocal, State, regional and national statistics for 2006. According to \nthe report, 14,990 people were murdered in the United States last year \nalone. This is an increase over 14,965 murders in 2005, and 14,210 in \n2004. Of the 14,990 murdered in 2006, 10,177 people were killed by a \nfirearm. In Michigan alone, there were 711 murders last year, 498 \ninvolved a firearm. These numbers are simply staggering.\n  Gun violence is preventable. However it requires action. In order to \nreduce the level of gun violence in our homes and communities, Congress \nmust pass common sense legislation to keep guns out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals.\n  Without action, guns will be found increasingly in our high schools, \nuniversities, religious institutions, and our homes. Some of us in \nCongress have heard voices cry of families, educators, and police \nofficials around this country and continue to work to pass sensible gun \nlegislation, which would limit access to guns by prohibited persons, \nclose the gun show loophole, reauthorize the assault weapons ban and \naid law enforcement agencies in tracking gun traffickers. Congress \nneeds to address these needs and do everything possible to reduce the \nlevels of gun violence in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13574-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RISING GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, oil prices closed at another record high \nyesterday over $93.50 a barrel. That is nearly triple the average price \njust 4 years ago, and we have reason to fear that oil may be on its way \nto over $100 a barrel and possibly to $120 a barrel. Gas prices are \nreportedly 65 cents a gallon higher than they were just a year ago. \nThis is an unacceptable burden to hundreds of thousands of families \nacross the country, and it harms American consumers as well as the \nAmerican economy. This winter, the price of home heating oil will be a \nserious burden on thousands of Vermonters.\n  The relentless rise in oil prices should be another clear signal that \nwe need to redouble efforts toward energy independence. As we develop \nalternative energy sources, we must keep focus on the artificial \nmanipulation of oil and gas prices today. Demand for oil is rising, but \nmembers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or \nOPEC, continue to collude to prevent the supply from matching that \ndemand. As the Centre for Global Energy summarized it: ``Without more \noil from OPEC, prices will continue to rise over the winter.'' In a \nproperly functioning market, OPEC members would compete to serve the \ndemand, but OPEC acts outside the basic principles of competition.\n  As the weather cools, rising prices for heating oil are an even \ngreater cause for concern. Thousands of hard working Vermont families, \nseniors and disabled persons will experience considerable strain in \ncoming months as they try to balance the cost of such necessities as \nhome heating oil, prescription drugs and food on their tables. The \nEnergy Information Administration forecasts that the average U.S. \nhousehold will see a winter increase of 22 percent in heating-oil \nexpenditures from last year. In fiscal year 2006, Congress appropriated \nover $3 billion for the critical Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP. Yet in his fiscal year 2008 budget, President Bush has \nrequested only half that amount, or $1.5 billion. While LIHEAP grants \nare decreasing, the number of applications is rising.\n  The American consumer is being harmed for the benefit of oil \nproducing cartels. This is just wrong. When the President took office, \nAmericans could fill their cars, heat their homes, and run their \nbusinesses on gasoline that cost $1.45 a gallon. Today, fuel prices \nhave skyrocketed to an average $2.87 a gallon. Prices will, at times, \nfall, but because fuel prices are not properly subject to competition \noversight and enforcement, the American consumer will only benefit from \nlower prices when it serves some other purpose of the cartel and \nforeign governments.\n  The administration must stop OPEC from artificially affecting prices \nin the United States. I joined Senator Kohl as an original cosponsor of \nhis bipartisan NOPEC legislation that would hold accountable certain \noil producing nations for their collusive behavior that has \nartificially reduced the supply and inflated the price of fuel.\n  When entities engage in anticompetitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers, it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate and prosecute. It is wrong to let members of OPEC off the \nhook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of \napproval of national governments.\n  It is time for the administration to take the side of American \nconsumers, not the side of oil cartels. We cannot claim to be energy \nindependent while we permit foreign governments to manipulate oil \nprices in an anticompetitive manner. Vermont families, and families \nacross the country, need our help to make essential home heating more \naffordable this winter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13574-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS FOR SEPTEMBER 11 VICTIMS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the days following the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle came \ntogether to pass comprehensive legislation entitled ``The Air \nTransportation Safety and System Stabilization Act.'' This measure \nprovided victims the option of filing a claim with a national \ncompensation program or seeking limited damages in one Federal district \ncourt--the United States District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York. Unfortunately, the legislation we passed failed to grant that \ntrial court with the power to serve and enforce subpoenas outside of \nthe traditional 100-mile radius of the Southern District of New York, \neven in the very cities where the hijacked flights originated and where \ntwo of them crashed on the morning of September 11.\n  We were able to pass a legislative fix to this problem recently in \nthe Senate. I understand that the House of Representatives is poised to \npass the Senate bill today. I praise my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and in both Chambers for acting to provide nationwide service of \nsubpoenas for the September 11 victims. Although no amount of \ncompensation can replace a lost loved one, the Procedural Fairness for \nSeptember 11 Victims Act offers a technical fix that is crucial to \nallowing victims and their families to have their claims fairly and \nthoroughly heard in court. I urge the President to sign this \nlegislation into law without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13574-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13574-S13575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REPATRIATION OF REMAINS OF VIETNAM VETERANS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the return of the \nremains of LTJG Donald F. Wolfe, whose body has finally been returned \nto American soil.\n  Lieutenant Wolfe--along with four of his fellow Navy aviators and \nsailors--was killed on October 8, 1967, when the E-1B aircraft they \nwere flying on crashed near Da Nang in heavy weather. The bodies of \nthese brave Navy servicemen could not be recovered at the time due to \nweather, terrain and hostile activity.\n  But today, almost exactly 40 years after this terrible incident, the \nremains of Lieutenant Wolfe and his colleagues are back home, bringing \npeace of mind and closure to his family at long last.\n  One of the great stains on the history of this Nation is the way that \nmany of our Vietnam War veterans were treated when they returned home \nfrom war.\n  We should be honest with ourselves and with our veterans: The way \nthat many of these veterans were treated during this time was wrong, \nand that kind of treatment hurt our country psychologically, and it \nhurt our country militarily.\n  Fortunately, our Nation has learned from that sorry episode. I take \ncomfort in the fact that despite our vigorous disagreements about the \nIraq war, all of us in this Senate and in our hometowns and States \nhonor those who serve there.\n  And today we have an opportunity to make sure that these five men get \nthe welcome home that all our troops deserved. We should stop to honor \ntheir memory and their service. It is not too late to say to these men \nand their families: Thank you.\n  I intend to observe a moment of silence this afternoon in memory of \nthese men and in memory of all those who are still classified as \nmissing in action. I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to do \nthe same.\n\n[[Page S13575]]\n\n  There are 1,767 individuals who are still classified as Missing in \nAction from the Vietnam War. Eighteen of these soldiers are from \nMontana.\n  They are: David Allinson, Helena; Richard Appelhans, Dodson; Alan \nAshall, Billings; Michael Bouchard, Missoula; Alan Boyer, Missoula; \nAnthony Caldwell, Missoula; William Christensen, Great Falls; Jack \nDempset, Helena; Charles Dudley, Bozeman; Michael Havranek, Missoula; \nRobert Holton, Butte; James Hunt, Missoula; Edward Letchworth, Libby; \nPatrick Magee, Alder; Lee Nordahl, Choteau; Victor Pirker, Trout Creek; \nDean Pogreba, Three Forks; and Robert Willett, Great Falls.\n  To them and their families, you are not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13575-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          PRESIDENT'S MEETING\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today President Bush is scheduled to \nmeet with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. These heads of state have \nmet before, but today's meeting comes at a pivotal time in Uganda's \nhistory.\n  After more than 20 years of conflict in northern Uganda in which well \nover a million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of \nchildren abducted and terrorized, peace appears to be within reach. \nTalks between the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army, \nLRA, have led to genuine improvements on the ground. However, there is \nstill much more work to be done to ensure a lasting peace. The United \nStates must become a more active peace partner with Uganda as it \nnegotiates with the Lord's Resistance Army.\n  The constructive mediation efforts of U.N. Special Envoy and former \nMozambican President Joaquim Chissano deserve sustained, high-level \nU.S. diplomatic support. Two issues will be particularly difficult. \nFirst, Ugandans themselves will have to balance the imperative to make \npeace with the clear need to hold accountable those responsible for the \nhorrifying abuses of the past. Second, leaders need to keep a spotlight \non the vast development needs of the traumatized north. Paper plans and \ngrand announcements will not be enough--the Government of Uganda must \nbe committed to the north's development, and the donor community, \nincluding the United States, must be prepared to offer real resources \nto help.\n  Sadly, as negotiations to end the threat posed by the LRA continue, a \ndifferent source of instability--- that of lawless militias in \nKaramoja, and the Ugandan military's often counter-productive, abusive \nresponse to them has prevented a more complete consolidation of \nsecurity in the country. The Ugandan people can never achieve their \nfull potential when they feel targeted by both their own military and \nmarauding criminals.\n  This visit to the White House follows by days a meeting between \nPresident Bush and President Kabila of the Democratic Republic of \nCongo. I hope President Bush uses both meetings to reassert U.S. \nsupport for regional dialogue and stabilization efforts. Uganda has an \nimportant part to play in ongoing efforts to bring lasting stability to \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly through \nparticipation in the Tripartite Plus mechanism. The U.S. should \ncontinue to foster dialogue through that process.\n  Uganda is a major contributor to the African Union's peacekeeping \nefforts in Somalia. But the undermanned AU peacekeeping contingent \ncannot succeed in the absence of a broader political and economic \nstrategy to stabilize Somalia. Right now, the Ugandan peacekeepers are \nin the hot seat, and the rest of the world is failing to advance the \npeace process and deliver the support that they need. The United States \nhas a responsibility to lead effectively on this issue. I hope that the \ntwo Presidents have a frank discussion about what needs to be done to \nadvance peace in Somalia.\n  Of course, Uganda is deservedly admired around the world for its \nearly efforts to speak frankly and act effectively to fight HIV/AIDS, \nand I have no doubt that the ongoing fight against the pandemic as well \nas global efforts to combat malaria will be on the agenda for President \nMuseveni's meeting. Recent reports have found that a disturbingly high \npercentage of Uganda's young people do not have accurate information \nabout AIDS and about how to protect themselves. Because of its renown, \nUganda has a special leadership role to play in this struggle. Frank \ntalk is needed today more than ever.\n  Finally, I hope that President Bush will convey to President Museveni \nthe sincere sympathies of the people of the United States for those \naffected by the recent severe floods in Uganda. As Americans cope with \nthe terrible wildfires in California, we are all especially sensitive \nto the devastating human consequences of natural disasters wherever \nthey occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13575-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13575-S13576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA ``GINGER'' KIRK\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to special \nagent Virginia ``Ginger'' Kirk of the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService, who is retiring from employment with the Federal Government on \nOctober 30, 2007. Special Agent Kirk is retiring after over 24 years of \nGovernment service, the last 21 of which have been spent with NCIS. Of \nspecial note, during the course of her service with NCIS, she spent a \nyear as a Department of Defense legislative fellow in the office of the \nlate Congresswoman Tillie Fowler.\n  During the course of Special Agent Kirk's career in Government \nservice, she rose from a GS-3 computer programmer for the Navy to a GS-\n15 NCIS senior special agent. In her final NCIS job, she was assigned \nto the Navy's Acquisition Integrity Office--a high-profile, high-impact \nposition that put her on the inside of the Department of the Navy's \nmost significant procurement fraud investigations.\n  Special Agent Kirk's law enforcement career began in the Norfolk \nfraud unit of the Naval Investigative Service, NIS--the precursor of \ntoday's NCIS. In addition to contributing to the collective success of \nthe office there, Special Agent Kirk was singled out to receive the NIS \nDirector's Cup, distinguishing her as the first-ever NIS Special Agent \nof the Year for fraud investigations. Her early career assignments were \nparticularly fraud-focused and included tours at NAS Oceana, Pearl \nHarbor, New York, and Washington, DC. Among other postings, she spent a \nyear with the FBI's Washington Field Office, working on major \nGovernment procurement fraud investigations jointly with her Bureau \ncounterparts. That was followed by her first assignment in the \ncounterintelligence arena in 1996, supporting both arms control treaty \nimplementation and the Navy's International Program Office. Eighteen \nmonths later, Special Agent Kirk transferred to NCIS headquarters to \nserve as a desk officer in the NCIS Counterintelligence Directorate's \nPacific Division.\n  In 1999, in what she describes as one of the most significant \nhighlights of her career, she was selected to represent NCIS as a DOD \nlegislative fellow on Capitol Hill. She served on the staff of the late \nCongresswoman Tillie Fowler, where she worked on a variety of defense, \njudiciary, and other issues. As a result of Special Agent Kirk's \npresence and persistence, Congresswoman Fowler sponsored legislation \nthat was later incorporated into the Fiscal Year 2001 National Defense \nAuthorization Act and ultimately resulted in statutory arrest authority \nbeing granted to civilian special agents of NCIS--an act of Congress \nthat to this day is considered a watershed event within the agency.\n  Following her Capitol Hill assignment, Special Agent Kirk was \nreassigned to the NCIS Counterintelligence Directorate, where she \nworked on a host of policy issues. Thereafter, she was promoted to \nsupervisory special agent and posted to NCIS's Washington, DC, field \noffice. While her first year there was spent investigating procurement \nfraud, Special Agent Kirk and the fraud squad refocused their efforts \non counterterrorism concerns as a result of the 9/11 attacks and the \nanthrax threat that plagued the Nation's Capital at that time.\n  In 2002, Special Agent Kirk transferred to the Pentagon as the NCIS \nliaison to the Joint Counterintelligence Evaluation Office within the \nOffice of\n\n[[Page S13576]]\n\nthe Secretary of Defense. She was subsequently assigned to be Assistant \nSpecial Agent in Charge for Criminal Investigations at the NCIS \nSoutheast Field Office, located aboard Naval Station Mayport. She \nconcluded her NCIS career back in DC in the Navy's Acquisition \nIntegrity Office.\n  Mr. President, during the course of her Federal service, Special \nAgent Kirk has made many sacrifices. As noted above, she moved \nfrequently to meet the needs of her agency, the Department of the Navy, \nand our Nation. She spent extended periods geographically separated \nfrom her husband, who was also an NCIS special agent, as each of them \nstrived to meet their own mission demands. She and her husband, retired \nNCIS special agent Guy Kirk, have bought a home on the side of a \nmountain in Brevard, NC, where they plan to take some time together to \nhike and explore the area. She has also set up a stained glass studio \nand plans to pursue the artistic side of life. I know all of my \ncolleagues join me in thanking Special Agent Kirk for her many years of \ndedicated service, and in wishing her ``fair winds and following seas'' \nas she and her husband Guy embark on the next chapter of their lives \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13576-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING CAMPBELL-TIMMERMAN LEGION AUXILIARY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to a key institution in my State, the South \nDakota Community Foundation, SDCF, which will celebrate its 20th \nanniversary on November 11, 2007. This statewide organization is a \nperfect example of how private funds are raised in communities to \nensure future sustainability. The SDCF is a model for those who believe \nthere is no better way to improve themselves and our great State than \nthrough working together to accomplish great things.\n  The SDCF was started two decades ago by a group of leaders with a \nvision for South Dakota. Their vision included capitalizing on the \nphilanthropic nature of South Dakotans to help rural communities \nredevelop and serve the needs of their citizens. Strong leadership over \n20 years has resulted in thousands of investors and partners that have \nassisted local communities and nonprofit organizations to achieve new \nlevels of success. The original group of investors was especially \ncritical, as they embraced a concept that has now exceeded the \nexpectations of many. Over 70 communities and hundreds of nonprofit \norganizations across South Dakota now have direct partnerships with the \nSDCF.\n  Twenty years ago, under the direct leadership of our late Governor \nGeorge S. Mickelson, the SDCF was created. I wish that Governor \nMickelson were alive today to witness the lasting legacy his \ninitiatives have given to our State. The SDCF continues to meet the \nvisionary goals of Governor Mickelson, and remains committed to taking \nthe organization to levels unanticipated 20 years ago. Governor \nMickelson's widow, Linda Mickelson Graham, served in a leadership role \non the SDCF board of directors for nine years, and their oldest son, \nMark Mickelson, is set to become chairman of the board in 2009. \nGovernor Mickelson's dream is alive and well within the SDCF and across \nSouth Dakota.\n  The original funding for the SDCF came from generous gifts from the \nMcKnight Foundation and the 3M Foundation. On their way to raising the \nfirst $10 million, the 3M Foundation and the State of South Dakota \ncontributed $2 million each, and the McKnight Foundation added $3 \nmillion as a challenge grant. Using this seed money as an incentive, \nGovernor Mickelson and then-SDCF Executive Director Bernie Christenson \nraised an additional $3 million within 1 year to fully fund the first \nphase of the SDCF.\n  Today, the SDCF has grown to over $70 million in total assets. Over \n360 funds have been established by communities, families, nonprofit \norganizations, and businesses to benefit South Dakota in perpetuity. \nThese funds provide support for nonprofit causes benefiting children, \nsenior citizens, and individuals with special needs. South Dakotans \nfrom rural areas, Indian reservations, and our largest cities are \nreaping the benefits of this visionary plan.\n  Leadership has been a key component to the success of the SDCF. The \noriginal leadership to get the SDCF started, the continued leadership \nof the board members, and dedicated staff have all played and integral \nrole. Current Chairman of the Board John E. Johnson, President Bob \nSutton, and the current board leadership have set goals for the \ncontinued growth of the organization. This growth would not be possible \nwithout committed staff members, and two of them--Stephanie Judson and \nGinger Niemann--have 20 years of combined service to the SDCF. The \nrelationships they have built with donors and partners of the SDCF over \nthe years are invaluable, and they deserve credit for a job very well \ndone.\n  The future for the SDCF is bright. Over the next 5 years, the \norganization will grow to over $100 million in permanently endowed \nassets. This will result in $5 million annually being distributed to \nnonprofit and charitable causes in South Dakota. This commitment to \nhuman service, economic development, and cultural and educational \norganizations in South Dakota will leave a lasting legacy.\n  The success of the SDCF has come from many areas, including unmatched \npublic/private partnerships, strong nonprofit organizations, local \ncommunity leaders, generous contributors, and prudent fiscal \nmanagement. On the local level, a new generation of leaders has been \ndeveloped, with many communities finding the future resting in the \nhands of these individuals. Through the establishment of permanent \nendowment funds, these local leaders are able to envision what their \ncommunities\n\n[[Page S13577]]\n\nwill look like decades from now. This is a major shift away from the \nmentality that small, rural communities had little or no future.\n  Today, I extend my hearty congratulations to the SDCF as the \norganization celebrates 20 years of ``Success Through Community \nCaring'' in South Dakota. As the work of the SDCF continues, I look \nforward to celebrating another 20 years of success in 2027.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13577-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3678) to amend \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act to extend the moratorium on certain taxes \nrelating to the Internet and to electronic commerce.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1473.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the Prado Basin Natural Treatment System Project, to \nauthorize the Secretary to participate in the Lower Chino Dairy Area \ndesalination demonstration and reclamation project, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the urban demands we have placed on \nour water supplies and ecosystem have resulted in significant water \nshortages in communities across the Nation. Water quality and quantity \nare in jeopardy if local, State, and Federal Governments do not support \nthe implementation of cost-effective projects that enhance and increase \npotable water supplies.\n  Therefore, I am introducing this bill to authorize programs that will \nfacilitate a comprehensive water supply and watershed project in \nsouthern California. Leaders and agencies across five counties in the \nSanta Ana Region of southern California have partnered to develop a \ncomprehensive plan which addresses regional needs of their communities; \ncommunities whose population exceeds 3 million citizens. These \ncommunities are committed to leveraging over $1 billion in local and \nState funds to match the Federal Government's investment. Similar \nlegislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Gary Miller, together with Representatives Ken Calvert, \nDavid Dreier, Edward Royce, John Campbell, Dana Rohrabacher and Loretta \nSanchez.\n  Specifically, this bill would fund three distinct projects, which \ntogether will help address water needs of 64,000 households and \nincrease the region's water supply by 31,000 acre-feet per year in an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner.\n\n[[Page S13582]]\n\n  This legislation could serve as a model for communities nationwide to \nhelp meet the challenges imposed by decreasing snow pack and \nprecipitation and scarce potable water supplies that will be \nexacerbated by climate change.\n  This bill would authorize the Federal Government to spend $10 million \non a cost shared basis to create wetlands along the Santa Ana River, \nproviding an expanded natural treatment system to purify the River \nbefore it replenishes Orange County's groundwater supplies. Like all of \nthe projects in the plan, the construction of natural treatment systems \nusing wetlands minimizes the impacts on the environment, reduces carbon \nemissions, and improves the quality of our groundwater supplies without \ncostly control technologies.\n  An authorization of $25 million in the expansion of groundwater \ndesalination in the Chino Basin would increase desalination from the \ncurrent 9,000 acre-feet per year to 40,000 acre-feet per year. This \nelement of the program would provide a new fresh drinking water supply \nfor Jurupa Community Services District, Santa Ana Mutual Water Company \nin Riverside County, and the cities of Norco, Chino, Chino Hills, and \nOntario in San Bernardino County. These communities serve the needs of \nmillions of citizens.\n  Because the Santa Ana River watershed crosses multiple jurisdictions, \nthis legislation seeks to complement the ability to produce reclaimed \nwater in one area with expanded desalination projects in the \nneighboring Chino Basin, providing a four-fold increase in the ability \nto desalinate groundwater supplies. The Chino Basin groundwater \ndesalters will be the primary drinking water supply for over 40,000 new \nhomes in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.\n  The Groundwater Replenishment System, which is expected to be fully \noperational in just weeks, is the largest indirect potable reuse \nproject in the world. The focal point of the system is membrane \npurification technology. Thus, $12 million is being requested to build \nan advanced water filtration technologies research center to find \nbetter, more cost-effective approaches to water purification as it \nrelates to municipal water supply needs.\n  This regional plan will decrease reliability on imported water \nsupplies from the Colorado River and California's deteriorating Bay-\nDelta water supply system. It will also allow for banking millions of \ngallons of water in our groundwater basin, protecting the region \nagainst natural disasters that could disrupt the delivery of water to \nSouthern California from the fragile Delta and Colorado systems.\n  I am proud of the commitment our regional agencies have made to \ndevelop a response to meet the current and future demands for water \nsupply. The regional plan has broad community support, solves multiple \nwater supply problems, reduces energy consumption, restores habitat, \nand provides significant jobs and economic benefits to one of the \nNation's most densely populated areas. I look forward to timely \nconsideration of this legislation that could provide the road map to \nsolving water demands across the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the rule that agreements between \nmanufacturers and retailers, distributors, or wholesalers to set the \nminimum price below which the manufacturer's product or service cannot \nbe sold violates the Sherman Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I use today to introduce legislation \nessential to consumers receiving the best prices on every product from \nelectronics to clothing to groceries. My bill, Discount Pricing \nConsumer Protection Act, will restore the nearly century old rule that \nit is illegal under antitrust law for a manufacturer to set a minimum \nprice below which a retailer cannot sell the manufacturer's product, a \npractice known as ``resale price maintenance'' or ``vertical price \nfixing''. Last June, overturning a 96-year-old precedent, a narrow 5-4 \nSupreme Court majority in the Leegin case incorrectly interpreted the \nSherman Act to overturn this basic\n\n[[Page S13583]]\n\nrule of the marketplace which has served consumers well for nearly a \ncentury. My bill will correct this misinterpretation of antitrust law \nand restore the per se ban on vertical price fixing.\n  The reasons for this legislation are compelling. Allowing \nmanufacturers to set minimum retail prices will threaten the very \nexistence of discounting and discount stores, and lead to higher prices \nfor consumers. For nearly a century the rule against vertical price \nfixing permitted discounters to sell goods at the most competitive \nprice. Many credit this rule with the rise of today's low price, \ndiscount retail giants--stores like Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and the \ninternet site Amazon, which offer consumers a wide array of highly \ndesired products at discount prices.\n  From my own personal experience in business I know of the dangers of \npermitting vertical price fixing. My family started the Kohl's \ndepartment stores in 1962, and I worked there for many years before we \nsold the stores in the 1980s. On several occasions, we lost lines of \nmerchandise because we tried to sell at prices lower than what the \nmanufacturer and our rival retailers wanted. For example, when we \nstarted Kohl's and were just a small competitor to the established \nretail giants, we had serious difficulties obtaining the leading brand \nname jeans. The traditional department stores demanded that the \nmanufacturer not sell to us unless we would agree to maintain a certain \nminimum price. Because they didn't want to lose the business of their \nbiggest customers, that jeans manufacturer acquiesced in the demands of \nthe department stores--at least until our lawyers told them that they \nwere violating the rule against vertical price fixing.\n  So I know first hand the dangers to competition and discounting of \npermitting the practice of vertical price fixing. But we don't need to \nrely on my own experience. For nearly 40 years until 1975 when Congress \npassed the Consumer Goods Pricing Act, Federal law permitted States to \nenact so-called ``fair trade'' laws legalizing vertical price fixing. \nStudies the Department of Justice conducted in the late 1960s indicated \nthat prices were between 18-27 percent higher in the states that \nallowed vertical price fixing than the states that had not passed such \n``fair trade'' laws, costing consumers at least $2.1 billion per year \nat that time.\n\n  Given the tremendous economic growth in the intervening decades, the \nlikely harm to consumers if vertical price fixing were permitted is \neven greater today. In his dissenting opinion in the Leegin case, \nJustice Breyer estimated that if only 10 percent of manufacturers \nengaged in vertical price fixing, the volume of commerce affected today \nwould be $300 billion dollars, translating into retail bills that would \naverage $750 to $ 1,000 dollars higher for the average family of four \nevery year.\n  Defenders of the Leegin decision argue that today's giant retailers \nsuch as Wal-Mart, Best Buy or Target can ``take care of themselves'' \nand have sufficient market power to fight manufacturer efforts to \nimpose retail prices. Whatever the merits of that argument, I am \nparticularly worried about the effect of this new rule permitting \nminimum vertical price fixing on the next generation of discount \nretailers. If new discount retailers can be prevented from selling \nproducts at a discount at the behest of an established retailer worried \nabout the competition, we will imperil an essential element of retail \ncompetition so beneficial to consumers.\n  In overturning the per se ban on vertical price fixing, the Supreme \nCourt in Leegin announced this practice should instead be evaluated \nunder what is known as the ``rule of reason.'' Under the rule of \nreason, a business practice is illegal only if it imposes an \n``unreasonable'' restraint on competition. The burden is on the party \nchallenging the practice to prove in court that the anti-competitive \neffects of the practice outweigh its justifications. In the words of \nthe Supreme Court, the party challenging the practice must establish \nthe restraint's ``history, nature and effect.'' Whether the businesses \ninvolved possess market power ``is a further, significant \nconsideration'' under the rule of reason.\n  In short, establishing that any specific example of vertical price \nfixing violates the rule of reason is an onerous and difficult burden \nfor a plaintiff in an antitrust case. Parties complaining about \nvertical price fixing are likely to be small discount stores with \nlimited resources to engage in lengthy and complicated antitrust \nlitigation. These plaintiffs are unlikely to possess the facts \nnecessary to make the extensive showing necessary to prove a case under \nthe ``rule of reason.'' In the words of FTC Commissioner Pamela Jones \nHarbour, applying the rule of reason to vertical price fixing ``is a \nvirtual euphemism for per se legality.''\n  In July, our Antitrust Subcommittee conducted an extensive hearing \ninto the Leegin decision and the likely effects of abolishing the ban \non vertical price fixing. Both former FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and \ncurrent FTC Commissioner Harbour strongly endorsed restoring the ban on \nvertical price fixing. Marcy Syms, CEO of the Syms discount clothing \nstores, did so as well, citing the likely dangers to the ability of \ndiscounters such as Syms to survive after abolition of the rule against \nvertical price fixing. Ms. Syms also stated that ``it would be very \nunlikely for her to bring an antitrust suit'' challenging vertical \nprice fixing under the rule of reason because her company ``would not \nhave the resources, knowledge or a strong enough position in the market \nplace to make such action prudent.'' Our examination of this issue has \nproduced compelling evidence for the continued necessity of a ban on \nvertical price fixing to protect discounting and low prices for \nconsumers.\n  The Discount Pricing Consumer Protection Act will accomplish this \ngoal. My legislation is quite simple and direct. It would simply add \none sentence to Section 1 of the Sherman Act--the basic provision \naddressing combinations in restraint of trade--a statement that any \nagreement with a retailer, wholesaler or distributor setting a price \nbelow which a product or service cannot be sold violates the law. No \nbalancing or protracted legal proceedings will be necessary. Should a \nmanufacturer enter into such an agreement it will unquestionably \nviolate antitrust law. The uncertainty and legal impediments to \nantitrust enforcement of vertical price fixing will be replaced by \nsimple and clear legal rule--a legal rule that will promote low prices \nand discount competition to the benefit of consumers every day.\n  In the last few decades, millions of consumers have benefited from an \nexplosion of retail competition from new large discounters in virtually \nevery product, from clothing to electronics to groceries, in both ``big \nbox'' stores and on the Internet. Our legislation will correct the \nSupreme Court's abrupt change to antitrust law, and will ensure that \ntoday's vibrant competitive retail marketplace and the savings gained \nby American consumers from discounting will not be jeopardized by the \nabolition of the ban on vertical price fixing. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Discount Pricing Consumer \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1911 in the Dr. Miles decision until June 2007 in \n     the Leegin decision, the Supreme Court had ruled that the \n     Sherman Act forbid in all circumstances the practice of a \n     manufacturer setting a minimum price below which any \n     retailer, wholesaler or distributor could not sell the \n     manufacturer's product (the practice of ``resale price \n     maintenance'' or ``vertical price fixing'').\n       (2) The rule of per se illegality forbidding resale price \n     maintenance promoted price competition and the practice of \n     discounting all to the substantial benefit of consumers and \n     the health of the economy.\n       (3) Many economic studies showed that the rule against \n     resale price maintenance led to lower prices and promoted \n     consumer welfare.\n       (4) Abandoning the rule against resale price maintenance \n     will likely lead to higher prices paid by consumers and \n     substantially harms the ability of discount retail stores to \n     compete. For 40 years prior to 1975, Federal law permitted \n     states to enact so-called ``fair trade'' laws allowing \n     vertical price fixing. Studies conducted by the Department of \n     Justice in the late 1960s indicated that retail\n\n[[Page S13584]]\n\n     prices were between 18 and 27 percent higher in states that \n     allowed vertical price fixing than those that did not. \n     Likewise, a 1983 study by the Bureau of Economics of the \n     Federal Trade Commission found that, in most cases, resale \n     price maintenance increased the prices of products sold.\n       (5) The 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court majority in \n     Leegin incorrectly interpreted the Sherman Act and improperly \n     disregarded 96 years of antitrust law precedent in \n     overturning the per se rule against resale price maintenance.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to correct the Supreme Court's mistaken interpretation \n     of the Sherman Act in the Leegin decision; and\n       (2) to restore the rule that agreements between \n     manufacturers and retailers, distributors or wholesalers to \n     set the minimum price below which the manufacturer's product \n     or service cannot be sold violates the Sherman Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON VERTICAL PRICE FIXING.\n\n       (a) Amendment to the Sherman Act.--Section 1 of the Sherman \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1) is amended by adding after the first \n     sentence the following: ``Any contract, combination, \n     conspiracy or agreement setting a minimum price below which a \n     product or service cannot be sold by a retailer, wholesaler, \n     or distributor shall violate this Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2262. A bill to authorize the Preserve America Program and Save \nAmerica's Treasures Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserve \nAmerica and Save America's Treasures Act to formally authorize two \nimportant historic preservation programs--the Preserve America Program \nand the Save America's Treasures Program. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort my colleague from New York, Senator Clinton.\n  Both the Preserve America Program and the Save America's Treasures \nProgram have demonstrated significant success nationwide. However, both \nadministration programs have relied solely on the will of the \nappropriations process and currently lack the long-term stability \nprovided by formal authorization. This bill would authorize these two \nimportant programs and provide for the protection of America's heritage \nfor years to come.\n  The Preserve America initiative was announced by First Lady Laura \nBush on March 3, 2003, and established by Executive Order 13287. The \ninitiative was developed in cooperation with a number of Federal agency \npartners to encourage and support community efforts for the \npreservation and enjoyment of our priceless cultural and natural \nheritage. Since 2003, 549 cities in all 50 States have been designated \nPreserve America Communities, and 140 of the Preserve America \nCommunities have received a combined total of $10 million to develop \nsustainable resource management strategies and sound business practices \nfor the continued preservation and use of heritage assets.\n  The Save America's Treasures program began during the Clinton \nadministration as a national effort to protect our Nation's threatened \ncultural treasures, including historic structures, collections, works \nof art, maps and journals that document our heritage and to highlight \nand preserve the history and culture of the U.S. The program was \nestablished by Executive Order 13072 in February 1998. Save America's \nTreasures was originally created as the centerpiece of the White House \nNational Millennium Commemoration, and as a public-private partnership \nthat included the White House, the National Park Service and the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation. From 1998 through 2006, over \n$300 million in Federal and private funding has been awarded for over \n1,000 grants.\n  While both programs are nationwide in scope, I want to highlight the \nfact that the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures programs \nhave also been very successful in my home State. Las Vegas and Silver \nCity, NM, have been designated Preserve America communities, and 15 \nSave America's Treasures grants worth nearly 5 million dollars have \nbeen awarded over the years to entities throughout the State of New \nMexico for various historic preservation projects. From the Palace of \nthe Governor's Collections in Santa Fe to the Lincoln Historic \nDistrict, where the outlaw Billy the Kid participated in the Lincoln \nCounty War, these programs have proved invaluable to preserving the \nrich heritage of New Mexico.\n  I am proud to offer this bill to authorize these two important \nhistoric preservation programs. I hope my colleagues will join with me \nin approving the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator \nDomenici to introduce the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures \nAct. This legislation will formally authorize Save\n\n[[Page S13586]]\n\nAmerica's Treasures and Preserve America for the first time.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, I helped create Save America's Treasures to \npreserve and promote historic sites and artifacts across our country. \nOn February 2, 1998, President Clinton established Save America's \nTreasures by Executive Order 13072. Save America's Treasures was \noriginally founded as the centerpiece of the White House National \nMillennium Commemoration and as a public-private partnership that \nincluded the White House, the National Park Service, and the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation.\n  Save America's Treasures was envisioned as a 2-year commemorative \nproject that would illuminate the problem of our neglected heritage and \ninspire Americans to help save the important treasures in their own \ncommunities. Almost 10 years later and Save America's Treasures is \nstill going strong. This model public-private partnership has provided \ncritical support of bricks and mortar preservation projects in every \nState and territory. These sites include such icons as the Star \nSpangled Banner, the Old North Church, Mesa Verde, Valley Forge and the \nlast remaining architectural model of the World Trade Center. The list \nalso includes the Founding Father's Papers, the Acoma Pueblo, President \nLincoln's Cottage, and the Sewall Belmont House.\n  To help ensure that future generations will have an opportunity to \nexperience our past and understand our identity as a community and as a \nnation, Save America's Treasure's has educated the public on \npreservation problems facing the buildings, sites, monuments, objects \nand documents that represent America's diverse cultural legacy, and it \nhas supported preservation of historic collections and properties.\n  The program also supports and advances the purposes and policies of \nthe national historic preservation program set forth by the Congress in \nthe National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.\n  The President and First Lady Bush have continued to keep the historic \npreservation effort alive in America. President Bush announced the \nPreserve America initiative through Executive Order 13287 on March 3, \n2003 to promote the preservation of America's heritage by actively \nadvancing the protection, enhancement, and contemporary use of the \nhistoric properties.\n  Through the Preserve America initiative, Americans gain greater \nknowledge about our Nation's past, strengthened regional identities, \nincreased local participation in preserving the country's cultural and \nnatural heritage assets, and support for the economic vitality of our \ncommunities.\n  The legislation that Senator Domenici and I have introduced will \nformally authorize Preserve America and Save America's Treasures. Both \nof these programs have relied solely on the will of the appropriations \nprocess and lack the long-term viability provided by formal \nauthorization. Both programs have demonstrated significant on-the-\nground-results and are clearly worthy of authorized legislation to \ninstitutionalize them for future generations.\n  Our legislation will authorize a competitive Save America's Treasures \ngrant program within the National Park Service in partnership with the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the \nPresident's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.\n  It will also authorize a competitive Preserve America grant program \nwithin the Department of the Interior in cooperation with the Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation and other Federal agencies.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation that will \nhelp ensure that future generations will have an opportunity to \nexperience our past and understand the identity of our Nation. I thank \nSenator Domenici for his leadership, and I hope my colleagues will join \nwith me in approving the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/30/senate-section/article/S13586-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 360--OFFERING CONDOLENCES REGARDING THE TRAGIC FIRE \nIN OCEAN ISLE BEACH, NORTH CAROLINA, WHICH KILLED 6 UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH \nCAROLINA STUDENTS AND 1 STUDENT FROM CLEMSON UNIVERSITY ON OCTOBER 28, \n                                 2007.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
