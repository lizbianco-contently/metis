Mr. President, when I was elected to Congress in 1982, I \nhad the opportunity to visit over the telephone on many occasions with \na new Congressman named Tom Lantos. He was new from California. He was \nvery interested in my election. He helped me\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nraise some money for that election, made many phone calls, and reached \nout to me as a friend. So when I came to Washington, I had the \nopportunity to meet him personally. That was the beginning of the \ndevelopment of a real friendship.\n  I have traveled with Tom Lantos overseas. He led delegations. When I \nwas a new Senator, I traveled with him. Senator Daschle led a trip. One \nof the places we went was to Hungary, and we had the opportunity to \nhave Tom Lantos show us around Budapest. Why was that important? It was \nimportant because the Nazis waited until toward the end of the war \nbefore they moved in to disperse the Jews out of Budapest and Hungary \ngenerally.\n  He was one of the Jews in Budapest they captured on many occasions. \nHe escaped the Nazis on seven different occasions. They would capture \nhim; he would get away. He said one reason he was able to escape as \nmuch as he did was that he had long blond hair, and the Nazis didn't \nfigure he was Hungarian. He actually took us to places where he had \nbeen captured, arrested by the Nazis in Budapest. It was a wonderful \ntime we spent with him for 2 days in Budapest.\n  This morning, our country grieves the loss of truly an American hero, \nCongressman Tom Lantos, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in \nthe House of Representatives. He was born in Budapest, Hungary. When he \nwas 16 years of age, Hitler and the Nazis occupied his country. He and \nhis family, like so many other Hungarian Jews, were captured, rounded \nup, beaten, and taken away, sent to labor camps. As I have indicated, \nhe was a hard one to stay captured; he got away.\n\n  It was through him I first learned about the struggles that people \nhave on a personal, individual basis. He was a man who protected his \ngirlfriend, his friend Annette at the time. They were both saved by the \ngreat Swedish diplomat after whom we have streets named in Washington, \nDC. He was able to escape many times but not his family. All of them \nwere killed.\n  All alone, a teenager, with little cause for hope, after the war, he \nmoved through displaced persons camps. Tom Lantos remained optimistic. \nHe refused to give up. He spent a couple years wandering around Europe \nafter the war.\n  He wrote an essay on President Franklin Roosevelt, and because of \nthis essay, he earned an academic scholarship to study in the United \nStates. He came on a converted World War II troop ship in 1947. He \nbrought with him only one possession. It was a large Hungarian salami, \nbut when he arrived, it was confiscated by Customs officials. So it is \nneither a cliche nor an exaggeration to say that Tom Lantos came to \nAmerica with nothing.\n  This ``American by choice,'' as he was fond of calling himself, \nearned a BA and a master's degree from the University of Washington-\nSeattle and a Ph.D. from the University of California. Soon after he \narrived here, he married his childhood sweetheart, Annette Lantos.\n  For the next three decades, he and Annette lived in the San Francisco \narea. Tom worked as a professor in economics, an international affairs \nanalyst, and an economist in many different areas, testifying in cases, \nconsulting generally. In less than three decades after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen, Tom Lantos became a Congressman. He brought to Washington \nremarkable depth of knowledge and intellect and stood out as a \npowerhouse from the day he arrived in Washington.\n  As I indicated, I had the honor of serving with him in Congress, but \nI also served with him on the House Foreign Affairs Committee as it was \nthen called, and, as everyone else, I found him blessed with the mind \nof a scholar and grace of a gentleman. Tom Lantos could deliver a \nspeech. He still had the Hungarian accent, but he could bring an \naudience to its feet. He was a great speaker.\n  I can recall no one in Congress who did not admire this fine man. He \nand Annette were always there to talk about their lives together as \nkids, teenagers. They had been together 60, 70 years. Raoul Wallenberg \nwas the Swedish diplomat. Because of Tom Lantos, there is a street \nnamed after him in Washington, DC, right by the Holocaust Memorial.\n  I can recall no one, Democrat or Republican, who didn't relish the \nopportunity to work with him. Once Tom Lantos said:\n\n       I like to work hard to make this a better country, to \n     provide a just government for our people and make sure we \n     have learned from the past.\n\n  Tom Lantos did just that--leaving an indelible mark on issue after \nissue from health care, Social Security, to the environment, the \nbudget, foreign affairs, of course, but also was his love of animals. \nHe had a caucus in the Congress he worked on dealing only with animals. \nHe loved animals and wanted to make sure they were treated \nappropriately.\n  He cochaired the congressional human rights caucus where he fiercely \nadvocated the spread of liberty throughout the world. His convictions \nwere so deeply rooted that he and four other Members of Congress were \narrested in 2006 for protesting the genocide in Darfur at the Sudanese \nEmbassy.\n  After years in the minority, Congressman Lantos finally achieved his \ndream of chairing the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but it lasted \nonly one year. He was diagnosed being sick right before Christmas, the \nfirst knowledge he had esophageal cancer, and he passed away within the \nlast 24 hours.\n  We were all deeply saddened to hear he was sick. I was stunned when I \nlearned he was so sick he would retire to fight cancer. The fight did \nnot last long.\n  I talked today with Howard Berman, who will replace him as chair of \nthat committee. He told me he visited Tom in Washington at his house. \nHe said he handled his oncoming death the way he handled so many \nthings: with great dignity and understanding.\n  Tom leaves behind a great family. He has two daughters, Annette, the \nsame name as his wife, and Katrina. These are two beautiful women, as \nbeautiful on the inside as they are on the outside. These 2 daughters \ngave Tom and Annette 17 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. He \ndoted on those grandchildren. A number of us here had him contact us \nfor things dealing with his grandchildren, making sure they got in the \nschool they were supposed to, jobs he wanted them to get. He cared \nabout every one of those 17 grandchildren.\n  Landra and I have 16 grandchildren, but we have 5 children. He had 2 \ndaughters with 17 grandchildren.\n  The Lantos family is truly in our hearts today. Tom said once:\n\n       It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor \n     of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground \n     could have received an education, raised a family, and had \n     the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life \n     as a Member of Congress. I will never be able to express \n     fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this country.\n\n  That is what Tom Lantos said and he meant every word of it. He \nbenefited from the limitless opportunity America affords, but America \nbenefited far more from the service of Congressman Tom Lantos.\n  So today we pause to express our profound affection and appreciation \nand gratitude for this wonderful man. Congressman Tom Lantos was a \ngreat American. His spirit will be sorely missed and his legacy never \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S824-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S824-S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a very busy week ahead. We are going \nto finish, as I have indicated, the debate on FISA tonight. We will \nhave a series of votes. We have about seven or eight votes we have to \ncomplete tomorrow. We have postcloture debate tomorrow. We need to \nfinish this bill tomorrow, and we will finish it tomorrow. We will \ncomplete it.\n  We are going to take a run at the Indian health bill. I spoke with \nSenator Dorgan this morning. He said he has had a good working \nrelationship with Jon Kyl and they are very close to being able to \nfinish this bill.\n  We are going to bring up the conference report on intelligence \nauthorization this week. The legislation contains an important \nprovision that would ensure one standard of interrogation across the \nU.S. Government requiring the CIA to abide by the Army Field Manual \ndealing with interrogation techniques.\n\n  That matter has, it appears, a 60-vote point of order against it. We \nunderstand that. I hope we don't have to file\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\ncloture on it. I recognize we have that one vote, and I am happy to \narrange a convenient time for everyone to vote. We could move that very \nquickly, but it is important we do this work.\n  We have other things we are looking forward to. I am going to meet \nwith the Republican leader as soon as we finish here to talk about \nother things we can do so we can be keyed up to work when we come back. \nWe have 3 weeks when we come back after the Presidents Day recess. The \nlast week of that work period we will be dealing with the budget. After \nthat, we are out for the recess for Easter. Then we come back and have \nan 8-week work period. So we have a lot to do. We think we can do all \nthat, plus more.\n  It is going to be a short but very issue-packed time this year. We \nhave the Presidential elections that are winding down, at least the \nnomination process, and then we have all the senatorial elections \naround the country that also take a little extra time. Hopefully, we \ncan join together and get some things done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We have another chance \nin the current week to put up a bipartisan win by passing legislation \non the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Mr. President, on another subject, I, too, want to \ntalk about the passing of our good friend, Tom Lantos. It would have \nbeen easy to excuse Tom Lantos for turning against the world after the \nsufferings he endured as a young man. But the reason we admire certain \npeople is they do not do what we would expect them to do in the face of \nextraordinary trials. They transcend them. And that is why a cold wind \nswept through the Capitol this morning when we heard that Tom had \npassed away.\n  America's history is a history of unlikely success stories, but even \nby American standards, Tom's was stunning. When the Nazis invaded \nHungary in the frenzied last months of the war, he threw on a cadet's \nuniform and secretly funneled food and medical supplies to those in \nhiding. He later said he assumed he wouldn't make it out alive, but he \n``wanted to be of some use.''\n  He would add many more years to be of use--not only to his beloved \nwife Annette and their large extended family or to the people of \nCalifornia's 12th District but to suffering and oppressed people. His \nown bitter experiences led him to make no distinction at all among \nthose who were denied their basic human rights. He would always be \ngrateful for the honor of being able to help them. Well into his \nseventies, he said he still got goosebumps looking up at the flag on \nthe Capitol on his morning walk to work.\n  Tom and I had our differences on domestic issues, but it was a great \nmark of his commitment to human rights that he frequently joined \nRepublicans when these rights were at stake. He worked with the \nRepublicans to introduce a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel \nin its fight against terrorism. He worked with the Republicans to get \nfunds to fight AIDS around the world. Every year since 2003, he and I \nwere the House and Senate sponsors of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct.\n  We were also united in our strong support for Israel. We took leading \nroles in the House and Senate on the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act. \nAnd we were united in our concerns about Iran. Tom introduced the Iran \nCounterproliferation Act in the House. I cosponsored it in the Senate.\n  When Tom was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness last month, he \nresponded again in an extraordinary way. He responded with gratitude. \nHe said:\n\n       It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor \n     of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground \n     could have received an education, raised a family, and had \n     the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life \n     as a Member of Congress.\n\n  We know Tom's decision to retire was especially painful, since he had \njust last year been named chairman of the House Committee on Foreign \nAffairs, a committee he had served on for 26 years. It was a position \nhe said he had been preparing for his whole life.\n  With his distinctive accent, his grace, and his deep learning--he \nspoke five languages and devoted 6 hours a day to reading books and \nmagazines--Tom always gave the impression of being a true gentleman of \nthe House, and he was. But he was just as tough. Tom Lantos \naccomplished something few people do in life: he committed himself to \nan ideal and followed through on it until the end. He gave it \neverything he had, and America admires him for it.\n  I want to express Elaine's and my deepest sympathies to Annette. We \ngot to know Tom and Annette on several trips abroad, which is a way you \nmake friendships around here, both across the aisle and in the other \nbody. Annette and Tom lived near us here on Capitol Hill. I recall \nfrequently seeing Annette out walking the dog. So we grieve for her and \ntheir daughters and the entire extended Lantos family on their loss.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments to eulogize \nour old friend, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, \nTom Lantos. He has been one of my dear friends all these years. I have \nbeen here 31 years, and he was here 26 years. He and Annette have \nreally been wonderful people in Elaine's and my life.\n  Mr. President, this morning began sadly, as the two leaders have \nsaid, with the news of the death of Congressman Tom Lantos, one of the \ngiants among the Democrats in the House, and, frankly, among all \nMembers of Congress during the last 28 years. Congressman Lantos had \nbeen diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, and had recently announced \nhe would not run for a 14th term for the 12th District of California, \nwhich he so ably served since 1980.\n  Tom Lantos led a remarkable life. A Hungarian Jew, he lived what he \nsaid was a happy childhood until the Hungarian fascist allies of Hitler \nbrought the Holocaust to Hungary. Through most of the war, he was \ninterned in various forced labor camps, some from which he escaped, and \nwas at least once recaptured, following a beating that he later said, \n``I was pleasantly surprised to survive.''\n  After a final escape, he spent the remainder of the war in hiding, \nprotected, as so many Hungarian Jews were, by Raoul Wallenberg, the man \nwho risked his life to protect as many of Hungary's Jews as he could \nand who vanished into the Soviet camps at the end of the war. One of \nthe great days of my life was to pay homage to Raoul Wallenberg at the \nmonument in Europe.\n  Six hundred thousand Hungarian Jews perished in the Holocaust, \nincluding Tom Lantos's family. One of the first initiatives of \nCongressman Lantos upon coming to the House of Representatives in 1980 \nwas to pass legislation granting Raoul Wallenberg U.S. citizenship.\n  Tom Lantos was, in his words, ``an American by choice,'' and to know \nhim was to see that every day of his life he embraced the opportunities \nan immigrant can find in this great country. He arrived penniless to \nthis country, as my two colleagues have said. According to his \nbiography, his only possession was ``a precious Hungarian salami,'' \nwhich was confiscated upon arrival, as my colleagues mentioned. But \nwith a scholarship and hard work, he earned a Ph.D. in economics and\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\ntaught at San Francisco's State University for almost three decades, \ndeveloping, during that time, his credentials as a commentator on world \naffairs.\n  Tom Lantos brought to the House his passionate patriotism and the \ndrive of a survivor. When people would comment on the demands of his \nwork, which included regular travel to his constituency 3,000 miles \naway, his global travels as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, which he recently chaired, and the hectic pace of his other \ncongressional assignments, he would be quick to remind us that this was \nnothing in comparison to what he had faced as a young man.\n  He founded the House Human Rights Caucus, a platform which he used to \nhighlight the human rights abuses around the world, and with which he \nbecame inextricably associated. For many of us in Congress and for many \noppressed through the world, Congressman Lantos was the chairman for \nhuman rights.\n  He was a Democrat who believed in the use of American power for good \nand who understood the nuances of subtle, as well as confrontational, \ndiplomacy.\n  For example, he kept trying to get a visa to visit Tehran because he \nbelieved there was always room to talk with enemies as well as friends. \nBut when asked what he would say to the dictators in Tehran, he was \nless than subtle:\n\n       I will tell the Iranians the truth--that it's a great \n     country and they need to be reintegrated into the family of \n     civilized nations and that they must give up their lunatic \n     notions.\n\n  Less than subtle, to be sure, but truthful. It is hard to disagree \nwith this view, Mr. President.\n  Tom Lantos also recognized that diplomacy could fail and the use of \nthe U.S. military could achieve noble ends. He was a strong supporter \nof the military during the Cold War, supported military assistance to \nIsrael, urged President Clinton to lead NATO forces against Milosevic's \ngenocide, and supported our interventions in Iraq, although, to be fair \nto him, he was critical, as many of us have been, about the \nimplementation of our invasion of Iraq.\n  The point is, Tom Lantos represented the wing of the Democratic Party \nthat kept central our national security concerns, that recognized our \nduty in the world, and accepted that the use of force is sometimes \nrequired. This is the wing of the Democratic Party that needs to \nsurvive if that party is to remain relevant to the events in the world \nthat will continually shape us.\n  I am honored to have been a friend of Tom Lantos for decades. We \nloved each other. We showed that love repeatedly over the years. He was \na dear friend, and I want everybody to know just how deeply I felt \nabout him. Our staffs worked together well, and he always had my \nadmiration and respect.\n  I will never forget a tour he gave me and Senators Reid and Daschle \nof the old Jewish ghetto in Budapest when our separate codels happened \nto be in that city at the same time in 1996. Later, he gave us a \npersonal tour of the magnificent Hungarian Parliament building. One of \nthe first post-Communist governments was in power, and they so highly \nregarded Tom Lantos for his heritage, as well as his anti-Communist \nstance throughout his life, that he was granted free access throughout \nthe building. He even knew where to turn the lights on.\n  The prayers and thoughts of Elaine and I go out to Annette, his \nbeautiful wife of 58 years, whom he married in California, but who, \nlike himself, was a survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary and was \nactually a childhood sweetheart. The fact that they loved each other as \nlong as they have, that they came from similar backgrounds, and worked \ntogether daily throughout their lives only makes her loss that much \nsadder.\n  Our condolences go out to her and their two wonderful children. And I \nbelieve there are 18 grandchildren. But the death of Tom Lantos is a \ngreat loss, as well, to his constituents, to his colleagues in the \nHouse, to his party, and to all of us in Congress. It is a loss to our \ngreat Nation and to all those who strive in solidarity for the cause of \nhuman rights.\n  Tom Lantos was slight of build, but he was a giant. He was a moral \nforce who used the authority of a survivor from the Holocaust, of an \nAmerican immigrant, and of a scholar and leader to show the great \ninstitution of Congress how it can lead in a dangerous and often \nimmoral world.\n  Elaine and I loved Tom, we love Annette, and we hope we can be of \nsome assistance to Annette and her family as we move into the future. \nBut we will miss Tom very badly. What a great and noble man who \nsuffered so much for freedom.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that was a very fine tribute from the Senator \nfrom Utah to a very fine man. I had the honor of serving with Tom \nLantos in the House of Representatives, and I certainly join all others \nwho mourn his death today.\n  I wonder if I might ask the Senator from California--I think she \nwould like to make a FISA presentation. I understand the Senator would \nlike to have about an hour. Is that how long she plans to speak?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I would like to say a few words \nabout Tom Lantos, he was a friend, and also speak on two amendments on \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Mr. KYL. I wonder if, in the spirit the Senator and I have frequently \nresolved matters, I have about 10 minutes of presentation. Perhaps if \nwe can enter into an agreement, you proceed and make your comments \nabout Representative Lantos, I will speak for my 10 minutes or so, with \nthe understanding that you then conclude the remainder of your remarks. \nWe could propose that in the form of a unanimous consent agreement. \nWould that be acceptable?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I had the great pleasure of knowing \nTom Lantos as a friend and as a mentor. I have known him for many \nyears. I last spoke with him about 3 weeks ago, maybe 4, and he said he \nwas going to forego treatment, that he was ready for whatever would \ncome, that he and Annette were going to remain in Washington, that he \nwas very content with his medical treatment at Bethesda, and he did not \nbelieve he would try anything heroic.\n  Those of us who know, know cancer of the esophagus is devastating and \nunrelenting. From that point on, I began to think quite a bit about Tom \nLantos. I thought back when Yahoo had the confrontation with China and \ndid not stand up but gave in to China, and Tom stood on his feet, with \namazing blue eyes and his gray hair, and said: They are moral pygmies.\n  He called it as it was. He stood for human rights. After 30 years in \nthe House, he became Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nRegretfully, his life ended before he had much more time than a year in \nthat position.\n  Tom Lantos represented the district directly to the south of my city, \nSan Francisco. He was a wonderful Representative. I watched him over \nthe past 30 years as time went on. I watched his 18 grandchildren grow. \nI remember meeting them in the airport in Denver. I do not know whether \nMembers know this; some of them were home schooled, and they went to \ncollege at the age of 14. That is pretty amazing; all high achievers, \nall very close, a tight family; a wife who was his childhood \nsweetheart.\n   This does not often happen. But then if you think back to Hungary in \nthose days, and you think back to a young, blue-eyed man in the camps, \nescaping at night, being caught, coming back, leaving again, becoming \npart of Raoul Wallenberg's group, coming to this country, becoming \neducated and all the greatness of the country opening before him.\n  He truly measured up to the greatness of America. I was very proud to \ncall Tom Lantos a friend and a mentor. He will be missed. He will be \nmissed in his district, he will be missed in California, and he will be \nmissed in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S826-S827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we are debating the amendments to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I am going to say a few words \nabout why Congress ought to provide legal relief to those private \nentities that have aided the United States in our war against al-Qaida \nand, in particular, one of the amendments that will be voted on \ntomorrow.\n  I begin by quoting a passage in an opinion by Justice Cardozo, from \nthe time when he was the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. \nIn the 1928 decision Baggington v. Yellow Taxi Corp., this is what \nJustice Cardozo had to say about the legal immunities that should be \nprovided to private parties that assist law enforcement efforts:\n\n       The rule that private citizens acting in good faith to \n     assist law enforcement are immune from suit ensures that the \n     citizenry may be called upon to enforce the justice of the \n     State, not faintly and with lagging steps, but honestly and \n     bravely and with whatever implements and facilities are \n     convenient and at hand.\n\n  We need to encourage citizen involvement in our efforts against al-\nQaida. We know that good intelligence is the best way to win the war \nagainst those terrorists, and if we want to monitor al-Qaida, we need \naccess to the information which is available through the \ntelecommunications companies.\n  We asked them for help, and they provided that help at a critical \ntime, after 9/11. We need to know, for example, whether al-Qaida \nterrorists are planning other attacks against us. When we ask parties \nto assist us, such as those telecommunications companies that assisted \nus after 9/11, we want them to reply not faintly and with lagging steps \nbut, rather, in Justice Cardozo's words: We want them to answer the \ncall honestly and bravely and with whatever implements and facilities \nare conveniently at hand.\n  In today's technological world, what that means is that when we ask \nthese telecommunications companies for their support, they provide the \nincredibly intricate and advanced technology at their disposal to \nassist us in understanding what communications al-Qaida is having with \neach other.\n  Now, tomorrow we are going to be voting on some amendments which, in \nmy view, weaken and in one case would actually strip the liability \nprotections the Intelligence Committee bill provides to such private \nparties. I think these amendments are unwise.\n  Certainly, I urge my colleagues to reject them. Let me focus on one \nof them today, one that relates to a subject called substitution. The \nidea is that while it would be unfair to hold these telecommunications \ncompanies responsible for coming to the aid of the Government in its \ntime of need, that they should be immune from liability, that we should \nsomehow substitute the U.S. Government in their place and that would \nsomehow balance the equities here of having the matter litigated and \nyet protecting the telecommunication companies.\n  There are several reasons why this simply does not work. In the first \nplace, it would still be required to reveal the identity of the company \ninvolved. Part of this entire matter is protecting the identity of the \ncompany so it does not lose business around the world and so it is not \nsubject to the kind of abuse that would otherwise occur.\n  In addition to that, full discovery could be conducted. In other \nwords, depositions could be taken, interrogatories could be served. In \nevery respect, the company is not protected from the legal process, it \nis simply not liable at the end of the day; it would only be the \nGovernment that would be liable.\n  But the individuals of the company and the company itself would still \nbe subject to all the rigors of litigation which we are trying to \nprotect them from. The litigation does not go away. In addition to \nthat, a method has been set up to litigate this before the FISA Court, \nwhich misunderstands what the FISA Court is. The FISA Court is not like \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The FISA Court is individual judges \ncalled upon primarily to issue warrants that permit the Government to \nengage in its intelligence operations.\n  So you do not have a court sitting the way you do in a typical \nFederal district court or a circuit court. This FISA Court would \npresumably have to litigate whether the companies are entitled to \nsubstitution, so it is not a free substantiation but, rather, if they \ncan prove that they are entitled to the substitution.\n  Finally, the point of having this liability protection for the \nGovernment's purpose is first and foremost because of the need to \nprotect its sources and methods of intelligence collection from the \nenemy or from the public at large. Of course, if you still have the \nlitigation ongoing, if you still have the process, it is just that \nParty A is liable rather than Party B.\n  You still have the threat that sources and methods could be \ncompromised, information relating to the activity could be disclosed, \nas it has in the current debate. We should remind ourselves that what \nwe are debating publicly is a system of collection that has been, to \nsome extent, defined by public discussion of matters that were and \nshould have been totally classified.\n  We have given the enemy a great deal of information about how to \navoid the kind of collection that is vital to our efforts. That is the \nkind of thing we are trying to prevent. So substitution, simply \nsubstituting the Government as a party for the phone companies does not \nsolve that problem either. The bottom line is, that as with these other \namendments, the so-called substitution amendment is not a good \namendment, it should be rejected, and I hope at the end of the day we \nwill have been able to vote it down.\n  Let me conclude by repeating some of the things the Statement of \nAdministrative Policy stated in quoting the Intelligence Committee's \nconclusions in its report.\n  Al-Qaida has not ceased to exist in years since the September 11 \nattacks. It still exists and it still seeks the wholesale murder of \nAmerican civilians. We know how devastating such attacks can be. And we \nknow that once an attack is underway--once a plane has been hijacked, \nor a bomb has been assembled--it is too late. We need to stop al-Qaida \nattacks before they are executed, before they are being carried out. We \nneed to act at a time when such attacks are still being planned or when \nal-Qaida terrorists are still being prepared.\n  To gather this type of intelligence--the intelligence needed to stop \na terrorist attack--we will need the assistance of private parties. \nInformation about al-Qaida's communications, its travel, and other \nactivities often is in the hands of private parties. If we want to \nmonitor al-Qaida we will need access to information. And when \ntelecommunications companies or others are asked for their help in \ntracking, for example, an al-Qaida cell that may be operating in this \ncountry, we do not want those parties to reply ``faintly and with \nlagging steps.'' Rather, in\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nJustice Cardozo's words, we want them to answer the call for assistance \n``honestly and bravely and with whatever implements and facilities are \nconvenient at hand.''\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee bill contains provisions that \nensure that results that future requests for assistance will be met \n``honestly and bravely,'' rather than with fear of becoming embroiled \nin litigation. Tomorrow the Senate will be voting on amendments that \nseek to strip out or weaken the legal protections that the Intelligence \nCommittee bill provides to private parties that assist antiterrorism \ninvestigations. These amendments are unwise, and I would strongly urge \nmy colleagues to reject them.\n  As the Statement of Administration Policy on the Judiciary Committee \nbill notes, the failure to provide strong legal protections to private \nparties would undermine U.S. efforts to respond to and stop al-Qaida in \ntwo ways: first, it allows the continuation of litigation that has \nalready resulted in leaks that have done serious damage to U.S. \ncounterterrorism efforts. This litigation is inherently and inevitably \ndamaging to U.S. efforts to monitor al-Qaida's communications. As one \nIntelligence Committee aide aptly characterized the situation, allowing \nthis litigation to go forward would be the equivalent of allowing the \nlegality of the Enigma code-breaking system to be litigated during \nWorld War II.\n  In addition, the failure to provide protection to third parties who \nhave assisted the United States would undermine the willingness of such \nparties to cooperate with the Government in the future. And such \ncooperation is essential to U.S. efforts to track al-Qaida. As the SAP \non this bill further explains:\n  In contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee bill, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee substitute would not protect electronic \ncommunication service providers who are alleged to have assisted the \nGovernment with communications intelligence activities in the aftermath \nof September 11th from potentially debilitating lawsuits. Providing \nliability protection to these companies is a just result. In its \nConference Report, the Senate Intelligence Committee ``concluded that \nthe providers . . . had a good faith basis for responding to the \nrequests for assistance they received.''\n  The Committee further recognized that ``the Intelligence Community \ncannot obtain the intelligence it needs without assistance from these \ncompanies.'' Companies in the future may be less willing to assist the \nGovernment if they face the threat of private lawsuits each time they \nare alleged to have provided assistance.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that: ``The possible \nreduction in intelligence that might result from this delay is simply \nunacceptable for the safety of our Nation.'' Allowing continued \nlitigation also risks the disclosure of highly classified information \nregarding intelligence sources and methods. In addition to providing an \nadvantage to our adversaries by revealing sources and methods during \nthe course of litigation, the potential disclosure of classified \ninformation puts both the facilities and personnel of electronic \ncommunication service providers and our country's continued ability to \nprotect our homeland at risk. It is imperative that Congress provide \nliability protection to those who cooperated with this country in its \nhour of need.\n\n  The ramifications of the Judiciary Committee's decision to afford no \nrelief to private parties that cooperated in good faith with the U.S. \nGovernment in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11 \ncould extend well beyond the particular issues and activities that have \nbeen of primary interest and concern to the Committee. The Intelligence \nCommunity, as well as law enforcement and homeland security agencies, \ncontinue to rely on the voluntary cooperation and assistance of private \nparties. A decision by the Senate to abandon those who may have \nprovided assistance after September 11 will invariably be noted by \nthose who may someday be called upon again to help the Nation.\n  Many members of the Senate Majority insist that there be stringent \ncongressional oversight of these intelligence-collection programs. No \none disputes that point. All agree that we need oversight over the \nintelligence agencies. That is why this Congress and previous \nCongresses have agreed on a bipartisan basis to create robust oversight \nof U.S. intelligence gathering, even when such intelligence gathering \nis directed at foreign targets. The agencies executing wiretaps and \nconducting other surveillance must report their activities to Congress \nand to others, so that opportunities for domestic political abuse of \nthese authorities are eliminated.\n  I conclude by asking: what is the Senate's goal? Do we want to allow \nour intelligence agencies to be able to obtain the assistance of \ntelecommunications companies and other private parties when those \nagencies are investigating al-Qaida? If so, then we need to create a \nlegal environment in which those companies will be willing to \ncooperate--an environment in which their patriotic desire to assist the \nUnited States does not conflict with their duties to their shareholders \nto avoid expensive litigation.\n  We need to write the laws to ensure against the domestic political \nabuse of surveillance authority, and we have done that. The question \nnow is whether we want to give our intelligence agents the tools that \nthey need to track al-Qaida. We should do so, and in order to do so, we \nmust defeat amendments that would weaken the bill's legal protections \nfor private parties who assist the government's efforts against al-\nQaida.\n  To conclude, we obviously want to write our laws to ensure that in \nintelligence collection, and any kind of this activity, the rights of \nAmerican citizens are fully protected, that we protect against domestic \npolitical abuse of surveillance authority. We have done that.\n  The question now is whether we want to give our intelligence agencies \nthe tools they need to track al-Qaida and other terrorists. We should \ndo so, and in order to do so, we have to defeat amendments that would \nweaken the Intelligence Committee bill, which lays out a good process \nfor balancing the equities involved and ensuring that we have provided \nnot only the Government agencies what they need to do the job we have \nasked them to do but also to protect the private parties whom the \nGovernment has asked to volunteer to help and which up to now they have \nbeen able to do because they felt that what they did would be protected \nfrom liability.\n  Without that liability protection, the kind of negative results would \noccur which I have identified.\n   So I hope that when this substantiation amendment comes before us, \nwe will vote it down and that we will also reject the other amendments \nwhich are designed to weaken the Intelligence Committee FISA bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator from California yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nimmediately following the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3910\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on two of the \namendments in the list of amendments to be voted on tomorrow. The first \nis amendment 3910. That relates to making the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act the exclusive authority for conducting electronic \nsurveillance. This is cosponsored by Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman \nLeahy, by Senators Nelson of Florida, Whitehouse, Wyden, Hagel, \nMenendez, Snowe, Specter, Salazar, and I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Cantwell to that list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For the information of my colleagues, I do not intend \nto modify this amendment, and so I will be seeking a vote on the \namendment as it is currently drafted.\n  I voted in support of the FISA bill as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. But I made clear in that committee, as well as in statements \ncalled additional views, which are attached to the report of the bill, \nthat I coauthored with Senators Snowe and Hagel that changes were \nnecessary.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, we were able to secure improvements to \nthe Intelligence Committee's bill that I believed were needed. Most \nimportantly,\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\nthe Judiciary Committee added strong exclusivity language similar to \nthe amendment I have now before the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the Judiciary package was not adopted on the floor. So \nthe amendments we present are designed to restore the exclusivity \nlanguage I believe is vital to FISA and goes to the heart of the debate \non this bill, which is whether this President or any other President \nmust follow the law.\n  With strong exclusivity language, which is what we try to add, we \nestablish a legislative record that the language and the intent of the \nCongress compels a President now and in the future to conduct \nelectronic surveillance of Americans for foreign intelligence purposes \nwithin the parameters and confines of this legislation.\n  The amendment makes the following important changes to the bill:\n  First, it reinforces the existing FISA exclusivity language in title \n18 of the U.S. Code by restating what has been true in the statute \nsince 1978--that FISA is the exclusive means for conducting electronic \nsurveillance, period. So legislative intent is clear.\n  Second, the amendment answers the so-called AUMF; that is, the \nauthorization to use military force loophole used by the President to \ncircumvent FISA.\n  What is that? The administration has argued that the authorization of \nmilitary force against al-Qaida and the Taliban implicitly authorized \nwarrantless electronic surveillance. This is an argument embroidered on \nfiction, made up from nothing.\n  Nonetheless, the executive has chosen to use it.\n  Under our amendment, it will be clear that only an express statutory \nauthorization for electronic surveillance in future legislation shall \nconstitute an additional authority outside of FISA. In other words, if \nyou are going to conduct surveillance outside of FISA, there has to be \na law that specifically enables you to do so. Otherwise, you stay \nwithin FISA.\n  Third, the amendment makes a change to the penalty section of FISA. \nCurrently, FISA says it is a criminal penalty to conduct electronic \nsurveillance except as authorized by statute. This amendment specifies \nthat it is a criminal penalty to conduct electronic surveillance except \nas authorized by FISA or another express statutory authorization. This \nmeans that future surveillance conducted under an AUMF or other general \nlegislation would bring on a criminal penalty. So follow the law or \nelse there is a criminal penalty.\n  Fourth, the amendment requires more clarity in a certification the \nGovernment provides to a telecommunications company when it requests \nassistance for surveillance and there is no court order. Henceforth, \nthe Government will be required to specify the specific statute upon \nwhich the authority rests for a request for assistance.\n  I believe our amendment will strengthen the exclusivity of FISA. I \nbelieve it is critical. Without this strong language, we run the risk \nthat there will be future violations of FISA, just as there have been \npresent violations of FISA. History tells us that this is very \npossible.\n  Let me go into the history for a minute because it is interesting how \neerily similar events of the past were to events of today. Let me tell \nthis body a little bit about something called Operation Shamrock.\n  In its landmark 1976 report, the Church Committee disclosed, among \nother abuses, the existence of an Operation titled ``Shamrock.'' What \nwas Shamrock? It was a program run by the NSA and its predecessor \norganizations from August of 1945 until May of 1975. That is, for 30 \nyears, the Government received copies of millions of international \ntelegrams that were sent to, from, or transiting the United States. The \ntelegrams were provided by major communications companies of the day--\nRCA Global and ITT World Communications--without a warrant and in \nsecret. A third company, Western Union International, provided a lower \nlevel of assistance as well.\n  It is estimated that at the height of the program, approximately \n150,000 communications per month were reviewed by NSA analysts. So \ntelegrams coming into the country and going out of the country all went \nthrough NSA.\n  According to the Church Committee report, the companies agreed to \nparticipate in the program, despite warnings from their lawyers, \nprovided they received the personal assurance of the Attorney General \nand later the President that they would be protected from lawsuit.\n  The NSA analyzed the communications of Americans in these telegrams \nand disseminated intelligence from these communications in its \nreporting.\n  If all of this history sounds eerily familiar, it should. The \nparallels between Shamrock and the Terrorist Surveillance Program are \nuncanny, especially when one considers that FISA was passed in 1978 as \na direct result of the Church Committee's report. Yet here we are, same \nplace, again today.\n  Almost immediately after the Church Committee's report was unveiled, \nCongress went to work on what is now the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act to put an end to warrantless surveillance of \nAmericans. FISA states that when you target surveillance on Americans, \nyou need a court order, period.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that FISA was not the exclusive authority \nsince 1978 and that the President has inherent article II authorities \nto go around FISA.\n  On the first point, the legislative history and congressional intent \nfrom 1978 is clear: Congress clearly intended for FISA to be the \nexclusive authority under which the executive branch may conduct \nelectronic surveillance.\n  Let me read what the Congress wrote in 1978 in report language \naccompanying the bill:\n\n       [d]espite any inherent power of the President--\n\n  That means despite any article II authority--\n\n     to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance in the \n     absence of legislation, by this bill and chapter 119 of title \n     18, Congress will have legislated with regard to electronic \n     surveillance in the United States, that legislation with its \n     procedures and safeguards, prohibits the President, \n     notwithstanding any inherent powers, from violating the terms \n     of that legislation.\n\n  That is the report language written in 1978.\n  The congressional debate also took on the Supreme Court's decision in \nthe Keith case in which the Court ruled that since Congress hadn't \nenacted legislation in this area at that time, then it simply left \nthe Presidential powers where it found them. Right? Wrong. In response \nto the Court's decision, the 1978 congressional report stated the \nfollowing:\n\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, however, does \n     not simply leave Presidential powers where it finds them. To \n     the contrary, this bill would substitute a clear legislative \n     authorization pursuant to statutory, not constitutional, \n     standards.\n\n  Clear. Distinct. Definitive.\n  It is important that the record here today clearly reiterates that in \n1978 there was an unambiguous position that FISA was the exclusive \nauthority under which electronic surveillance of Americans could be \nconducted. This was in the bill language and the report language as \npassed by the 95th Congress.\n  But FISA's exclusivity was recognized not just by the Congress. The \nexecutive branch also agreed that FISA was controlling and that any and \nall electronic surveillance would be conducted under the law.\n  President Carter at the time issued a signing statement to the bill. \nThis wasn't a signing statement like we see today. It was not used to \nexpress the President's disagreement with the law or his intent not to \nfollow part of the law. Rather, President Carter used his statement to \nexplain his understanding of what the law meant.\n  Here it is in direct quote:\n\n       The bill requires, for the first time, a prior judicial \n     warrant for all electronic surveillance for foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence purposes in the United \n     States in which communications of U.S. persons might be \n     intercepted.\n\n  Again, clear, distinct, definitive.\n  By issuing this statement, President Carter and the executive branch \naffirmed not only Congress's intent to limit when the executive branch \ncould conduct surveillance, but it ratified that Congress had the power \nto define the parameters of executive authority in this area.\n  So there was an abuse--Operation Shamrock--similar to this incident \nwith the telecoms today, followed by a clear act of Congress in passing \nFISA,\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nfollowed by a clear statement of the executive affirming the meaning of \nFISA. Together, these acts were taken to end the exercise of unchecked \nexecutive authority. Here we are, back in 1978 today.\n  Despite the 1978 language and Congress's clear willingness to amend \nFISA to make it apply to the new war against terrorism early in its \ntenure, the Bush administration decided that it would act outside the \nlaw. This was a conscious decision. Not one part of FISA was ever tried \nto be put under the auspices of the FISA law and the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. That was both wrong and unnecessary.\n  To justify this mistake, the Department of Justice developed a new \nconvoluted argument that Congress had authorized the President to go \naround FISA by passing the authorization for use of military force \nagainst al-Qaida and the Taliban. Can anybody really believe that? \nThis, too, was wrong. I was there. I sat in most meetings. I defy \nanybody in this body to come forward and tell me privately or publicly \nthat going around FISA was ever contemplated by the AUMF. In fact, it \nwas not. It was never even considered.\n  Apparently not confident of its AUMF argument, the administration \ndecided to also assert a broad theory of Executive power, premised on \nArticle II of the Constitution. These are the powers of the President.\n  Under this argument, the Bush administration asserted that despite \ncongressional action, the President has the authority to act \nunilaterally and outside of the law if he so chooses, simply by virtue \nof his role as Commander in Chief. While Presidents throughout history \nall tried to expand their power, this new twist would place the \nPresident of the United States outside the law. Taken to its logical \nconclusion, if the Congress cannot enact statutes that the President \nmust follow, then he is above the law. I disagree with that position. I \ndo not believe anyone can be above the rule of law. But I am not the \nonly one.\n  Justice Jackson described it best in his Youngstown opinion. In 1952, \nagainst the backdrop of the Korean war, the Supreme Court addressed the \nissue of when congressional and executive authorities collide in the \nYoungstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer. The question presented in \nYoungstown was whether President Truman was acting within his \nconstitutional powers when he issued an order directing the Secretary \nof Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the Nation's \nsteel mills. In other words, the Government was going to take over the \nsteel mills.\n  The Truman administration argued that the President was acting within \nhis inherent power as Commander in Chief in seizing the steel mills, \nsince a proposed strike by steelworkers would have limited the Nation's \nability to produce the weapons needed for the Korean war.\n  The Bush administration today is making the very same argument. It is \nasserting that the President's constitutional authorities as Commander \nin Chief trump the law. However, in a 6-to-3 decision in Youngstown, \nthe Supreme Court held that President Truman exceeded his \nconstitutional authority. Justice Jackson authored the famous \nconcurring opinion, setting forth the three zones into which \nPresidential actions fall.\n\n  The first zone: When the President acts consistently with the will of \nCongress, the President's power is at its greatest.\n  Two: When the President acts in an area in which Congress has not \nexpressed itself, there is an open question as to the scope of \ncongressional and Presidential authority. So we know the first two.\n  The third zone: When the President acts in contravention of the will \nof Congress, Presidential power is at its lowest.\n  That is where we are right now. Clearly, President Bush acted outside \nof the scope of the law. According to Youngstown, his power is at its \nlowest. The only way to test that is to bring a case before the Supreme \nCourt again. But the fact the Court ruled against Truman in a situation \nof war--in a situation where a strike would have shut down the steel \nmills, when Truman tried to use his commander in chief authority to \nseize the steel mills, the Court said: You cannot do that, and then it \nwent on to define the different zones of Presidential authority. It is \na big opinion, and it is one which is often quoted in our judicial \nhearings on Supreme Court nominees.\n  Justice Jackson also wrote:\n\n       When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress--\n\n  Which is this case--\n\n     his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only on \n     his constitutional powers, minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter.\n\n  Now, this is key, this last part: Although Justice Jackson's opinion \nwas not binding at the time, the Supreme Court has since adopted it as \na touchstone for understanding the dimensions of Presidential power. \nThe Youngstown case is as important today as it was then.\n  That is why I am proposing this amendment. I want to make it crystal \nclear, and my cosponsors want to make it crystal clear, that Congress \nhas acted to prohibit electronic surveillance on U.S. persons for \nforeign intelligence purposes outside of FISA, and this amendment does \nthat.\n  One day this issue is going to be before the Court, and on that day I \nwant the Justices to be able to go back and see the legislative intent; \nthe legislative intent as it was in the Judiciary Committee, the \nlegislative intent as it is here on the floor, and the legislative \nintent of this amendment to strengthen the exclusivity parts of FISA.\n  What we have here is a case of history repeating itself: abuse \nfollowed by a clear statement from Congress, then another abuse with \nthe Terrorist Surveillance Program. It too should be followed by a \nclear statement from Congress.\n  Now is the time for the Congress of the United States to reassert its \nconstitutional authorities and pass a law that clearly and \nunambiguously prohibits warrantless surveillance outside of FISA. Now \nis the time to say that no President, now or in the future, can operate \noutside of this law.\n  I mentioned that in 2001 the President chose to go outside of FISA. \nIn January of 2007, after the Intelligence Committee learned about the \nfull dimensions of the law, guess what. The executive branch brought it \nto the Court and bit by bit put the program under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. Today, the entire program is within \nthe parameters of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n  What I am saying to this body is it was a terrible misjudgment not to \ndo so in 2001, because I believe the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt would have given permission to the program. So I believe this \namendment is absolutely crucial, and I very much hope it will pass \ntomorrow.\n  Now, if I may, I wish to speak in support of my amendment to replace \nthe full immunity in the underlying bill with a system of FISA Court \nreview. This is amendment No. 3919. I am joined in this amendment by \nSenators Bill Nelson, Ben Cardin, and Ken Salazar. I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Whitehouse as a cosponsor, and I know that \nSenator Whitehouse wishes to come to the floor to speak to this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This amendment is about allowing a court to review \nthe request for immunity for the telecommunications companies, but in a \nway that is carefully tailored to meet this unique set of suits. It \nallows for the good faith defense if the companies reasonably believed \nthe assistance they provided the Government was legal.\n  As Members know, the FISA Court comprises 11 Federal district court \njudges appointed by the Chief Justice. It has heard thousands of \napplications for FISA warrants and has recently made determinations on \nthe executive's procedures under the Protect America Act. In January of \n2007, the Court put the entire Terrorist Surveillance Program under its \njurisdiction. Its judges and its staff are experts in surveillance law, \nand the Court protects national security secrets.\n  Let me describe the amendment briefly. Under this amendment, the FISA \nCourt is directed to conduct a tailored, three-part review.\n  Part one: The FISA Court will determine whether a telecommunications \ncompany actually provided the assistance to the Federal Government as\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\npart of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. If not, those cases are \ndismissed. So if you didn't give help and you have litigation pending, \nthe case is dismissed, period.\n  Second: If assistance was provided, the Court would review the \nrequest letters sent from the Government to the companies every 30 to \n45 days. The FISA Court would then have to determine whether these \nletters, in fact, met the requirements of the applicable law. There is \nlaw on this. It is part of FISA. It is 18 U.S.C. 2511. If they met the \nrequirements, the cases against the companies are dismissed.\n  Now, let me tell my colleagues what the law says. Sections \n2511(2)(a)(ii)(A) and (ii)(B) state that companies are allowed to \nprovide assistance to the Government if they receive a certification in \nwriting by a specified person (usually the Attorney General or a law \nenforcement officer specifically designated by the Attorney General).\n  The certification is required to state that no warrant or court order \nis required by law, that all statutory requirements have been met, and \nthat the specified assistance is required by the Government. Now that \nis what the law says. It is short, it is succinct, it is to the point.\n  The question is: Do the specifics of the actual documents requesting \nassistance meet the letter of this law with respect to contents and \ntiming. If they did, the companies would be shielded from lawsuits. \nWhy? Because that is the law. That is what the law says. No one would \nwant us not to follow the law.\n  Finally, in any case where the defendant company did provide \nassistance but did not have a certification that complied with the \nrequirements I have read, the FISA Court would assess whether the \ncompany acted in good faith, as has been provided under common law.\n  There are several cases of common law that describe what is called \nthe good faith defense--the U.S. v. Barker, Smith v. Nixon, Halperin v. \nKissinger, and Jacobson v. Bell Telephone. So there is common law on \nthe subject.\n  There would be at least three lines of defense for defendant \ncompanies in this situation. They could argue that the assistance was \nlawful under the statutes other than 18 U.S.C. 2511--the law I have \ncited; that they believed, perhaps wrongly, that the letters from the \nGovernment were lawful certifications; or that complying with the \nrequest for assistance was lawful because the President had article II \nauthority to conduct this surveillance. They could make their \narguments, and the plaintiffs, against the defendant companies, could \nmake their arguments.\n\n  In this case, the FISA Court would then determine whether the company \nacted in good faith and whether it had an objectively reasonable belief \nthat compliance with the Government's written request or directives for \nassistance were lawful. If the Court finds that the company met this \nstandard, the lawsuits would be dismissed.\n  I believe this very narrow three-part test strikes the right balance \nbetween the competing interests in the immunity debate. This amendment \nneither dismisses the cases wholesale, nor does it allow the cases to \nproceed if the companies had an objectively reasonable belief that \ntheir compliance was lawful.\n  Let me point out for a moment some of the history relevant to this \nissue.\n  First: Requests for assistance from the Government to the telecoms \ncame about 1 month following the worst terrorist attack against our \nNation. That is fact. There was an ongoing acute national threat. That \nis a fact. The administration was warning that more attacks might be \nimminent. That was fact. And we now know that there was a plot to \nlaunch a second wave of attacks against the west coast.\n  Two: Certain telecom companies received letters every 30 to 45 days \nfrom very senior Government officials. That is fact. I have read them. \nThe letters said the President had authorized their assistance. That is \nfact. They also said the Attorney General had confirmed the legality of \nthe program. That is fact. These assurances were from the highest \nlevels of the Government.\n  Third: Only a very small number of people in these companies had the \nsecurity clearances to be allowed to read the letters, and they could \nnot consult others with respect to their legal responsibility, nor are \nthese telecommunication company executives expert in separation of \npowers law--either article II legal arguments or the flawed AUMF \nargument.\n  Fourth: As I mentioned, common law has historically provided that if \nthe Government asks a private party for help and makes such assurances \nthat help is legal, the person or company should be allowed to provide \nassistance without fear of being held liable. That is true. Common law \ndoes this. One would think this would be especially true in the case of \nprotecting our Nation's security.\n  Fifth, taking no legislative action on the pending cases ignores the \nfact that these companies face serious, potentially extraordinarily \ncostly litigation but are unable at the present time to defend \nthemselves in court. The Government has invoked the state secrets \ndefense.\n  Now, this is a sort of insidious defense. It places the companies in \na fundamentally unfair place. Individuals and groups have made \nallegations to which companies cannot respond. They cannot answer \ncharges, nor can they respond to what they believe are misstatements of \nfact and untruths.\n  Bottom line, they cannot correct false allegations or misstatements, \nthey cannot give testimony before the court, and they cannot defend \nthemselves in public or in private.\n  While I have concerns about striking immunity altogether or \nsubstituting the Government for the companies, I don't believe full \nimmunity is the best option without having a court review the \ncertification and the good-faith defense.\n  Currently, under FISA there is a procedure that allows the Government \nto receive assistance from telecommunications companies. As I have \nalready described, title 18 of the U.S. Code, section 2511, states that \nthe Government must provide a court order or a certification in writing \nthat states:\n\n       No warrant or court order is required by law, that all \n     statutory requirements have been met, and that the specified \n     assistance is required, setting forth the period of time \n     during which the provision of the information, facilities, or \n     technical assistance is authorized and specifying the \n     information, facilities, or technical assistance required. . \n     . .\n\n  That is it. Under the law, these are the circumstances under which a \ntelecommunications company may provide information and services to the \nGovernment. Unfortunately, the administration chose not to go to the \nFISA Court in the fall of 2001 for a warrant. I will never understand \nwhy. Instead, it asserted that Article II of the Constitution allowed \nthe President to act outside of FISA.\n  However, as I said, by January of 2007--more than 5 years later--the \nentire Terrorist Surveillance Program was, in fact, brought under the \nFISA Court's jurisdiction. So, ultimately, the administration agreed \nthat the program can and should be conducted under the law.\n  Senators Nelson, Cardin, Salazar, Whitehouse, and I believe the \nquestion of whether telecommunications companies should receive \nimmunity should hinge on whether the letters the Government sent to \nthese companies met the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 2511 or, if not, if \nthe companies had an objectionably reasonable belief their assistance \nwas lawful, and what that objective belief was.\n  In other words, we should not grant immunity if companies were \nwillingly and knowingly violating the law.\n  So the best way to answer this question is to allow an independent \ncourt, skilled in intelligence matters, to review the applicable law \nand determine whether the requirements of the law or the common law \nprinciple were, in fact, met. If they were, the companies would receive \nimmunity; if not, they would not. But a court would make that decision, \nnot a body, some of whom have seen the letters but most of whom have \nnot. But it would be a court that is skilled in this particular kind of \nlaw.\n  I want to briefly comment on procedure. I very much regret that this \namendment faces a 60-vote threshold when the other two amendments \nrelating to telecom immunity face majority votes. Clearly, someone was \nafraid this might get a majority vote and, therefore, they put on a 60-\nvote requirement.\n  This, I believe, is prejudicial, and it places a higher burden on \nthis amendment. And the irony is, this amendment could be an acceptable \nsolution\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nfor the other House, which has passed a bill that doesn't contain any \nprovisions for immunity and has said they would not provide any \nprovision for immunity. This is the way to handle that particular \nissue.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this amendment both on \nthe merits and so that we can finish the FISA legislation. I hope the \nconferees will take a strong vote on this amendment--whether it reaches \n60 Senators to vote aye or not--as a signal that it is a good solution \nwhen the legislation goes to conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on both of these \namendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to asking for \nthe yeas and nays on the two amendments at this time?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the last 6 months I have come to the \nfloor on numerous occasions to offer my support of the limited immunity \nprovisions in the Rockefeller-Bond bill.\n  In addition to my views on this subject, there are countless \nAmericans who have expressed their support for the immunity provision.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter sent to the Senate leadership last month, which is signed by 21 \nState attorneys general, which expresses their strong support for the \nimmunity provision included in this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     RE FISA Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248).\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: We \n     understand that the Senate will soon consider S. 2248, the \n     FISA Amendments Act of 2007, as recently reported by the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Among other things, \n     the bill would directly address the extensive litigation that \n     communications carriers face based on allegations that they \n     responded to requests from the government regarding certain \n     intelligence-gathering programs. For a number of reasons, we \n     support these carefully crafted provisions of the bill that \n     the Intelligence Committee adopted on a bi-partisan basis.\n       First, protecting carriers from this unprecedented legal \n     exposure is essential to domestic and national security. \n     State, local and federal law enforcement and intelligence \n     agencies rely heavily on timely and responsive assistance \n     from communications providers and other private parties; \n     indeed, this assistance is utterly essential to the agencies' \n     functions. If carriers and other private parties run the risk \n     of facing massive litigation every time they assist the \n     government or law enforcement, they will lack incentives to \n     cooperate, with potentially devastating consequences for \n     public safety.\n       Second, the provisions of the bill are consistent with \n     existing, long-standing law and policy. Congress has long \n     provided legal immunity for carriers when, in reliance on \n     government assurances of legality or otherwise in good faith, \n     they cooperate with law enforcement and intelligence \n     agencies. But because the government has invoked the ``state \n     secrets privilege'' with respect to the subject matter of the \n     cases, the carriers are disabled from mounting an effective \n     defense, they are not permitted to invoke the very immunities \n     written into the law for their benefit, and they cannot rebut \n     the media storm that has damaged the companies' reputations \n     and customer relationships. The immunity provisions of S. \n     2248 would overcome this paradox, but not simply by \n     dismissing the pending cases outright. Instead, they would \n     establish a thoughtful, multi-step process involving \n     independent review by the Attorney General and the courts \n     that, only when completed, would lead to dismissal of the \n     claims.\n       Third, cases against the carriers are neither proper nor \n     necessary avenues to assess the legality of the government's \n     intelligence-gathering programs. Government entities or \n     officials are already parties in over a dozen suits \n     challenging the legality of the alleged programs, and the \n     immunity provisions in S. 2248 would have no impact on these \n     claims. In short, Congress should not, in a rush to hold the \n     government accountable for alleged wrongdoing, burden these \n     carriers with the substantial reputational damage and \n     potentially ruinous liability that could flow from these \n     suits. If these alleged programs were legally infirm, the \n     government, not private actors who acted in good faith and \n     for patriotic reasons, should answer for them.\n       For these reasons, we urge that any FISA-reform legislation \n     adopted by the Senate include the carrier-immunity provisions \n     currently contained in S. 2248.\n         Hon.

Mr. President, here is the list of the attorneys general \nwho signed this letter endorsing the immunity provision in the original \nRockefeller-Bond bill. They are attorneys general from the States of \nWisconsin, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Colorado, Florida, Alabama, \nArkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Utah, Texas, New Hampshire, Virginia, North \nDakota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, \nNebraska, West Virginia, and Washington.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfour letters sent from law enforcement organizations, all in support of \nthe immunity provision of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Sheriff's Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, November 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: On behalf \n     of the National Sheriffs' Association (NSA), I am writing to \n     urge you to support Section 202 of the FISA Amendments Act of \n     2007 (S. 2448). This extension of retroactive immunity under \n     the terms referenced in this section would have a significant \n     impact on the cooperative relationship between the government \n     and the private companies to safeguard public safety.\n       As you know, the electronic surveillance for law \n     enforcement and intelligence functions depends in great part \n     on the cooperation of the private companies that operate the \n     nation's telecommunication system. Section 202 would provide \n     much needed liability relief to electronic communication \n     service providers that assisted the intelligence community to \n     implement the President's surveillance program in the \n     aftermath of September 11, 2001. The provision of retroactive \n     immunity would help ensure that these providers who acted in \n     good faith to cooperate with the government when provided \n     with lawful requests in the future.\n       The nation's sheriffs recognize the critical role that \n     electronic communication service providers play in assisting \n     intelligence officials in national security activities. \n     However, given the scope of the current civil damages suits, \n     we are gravely concerned that, without retroactive immunity, \n     the private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with \n     lawful government requests in the future. The possible \n     reduction in intelligence that might result from protracted \n     litigation is unacceptable for the security of our citizens.\n       As the Senate considers the FISA Amendments Act of 2007, we \n     strongly urge you to help preserve the cooperative \n     relationship between law enforcement and the private sector \n     by supporting Section 202.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Sheriff Craig Webre,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The National Troopers Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: As the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee gets set to consider legislation \n     that would update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     (FISA), the National Troopers Coalition wishes to express its \n     support for Section 202 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2007. \n     This section is of particular importance to the NTC and law \n     enforcement in general\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\n     because it will have a significant impact on the cooperative \n     relationship between government and the private sector in \n     relation to public safety.\n       Section 202 provides much needed relief from mass tort \n     litigation relief to telecommunications companies that helped \n     protect our nation after the horrific attacks of September \n     11, 2001. Should this narrow provision not be adopted, we \n     believe that all levels of law enforcement will suffer by \n     losing the cooperation of vital allies in our ongoing fight \n     againt crime. The chilling effect will be that businesses may \n     feel compelled to avoid the risk of litigation by declining \n     to cooperate with law enforcement even though they have every \n     reason to believe the request is lawful.\n       In the weeks following the 9/11 attacks, some \n     telecommunications companies were apparently asked by the \n     President for their assistance with intelligence activities, \n     aimed at preventing similar attacks in the future. These \n     companies were assured that their compliance was necessary \n     and deemed lawful by the Attorney General. Upon complying \n     with the government's request, and providing information that \n     would keep the American people safe, these companies now face \n     the prospect of years of litigation, even though they cannot \n     defend themselves in court due to the highly classified \n     nature of the governmental program they were assured was \n     legal. This is disheartening, to say the least.\n       The nation's State Troopers understand the vital role that \n     private businesses play in emergency situations and criminal \n     investigations, and we are concerned that if these companies \n     continue to be dragged through costly litigation for having \n     responded in these circumstances, it will deter their \n     voluntary cooperation with law enforcement authorities in the \n     future. When it comes to protecting the public from \n     terrorists, sophisticated international gangs and on-line \n     predators, government counts on its private sector partners \n     for help. We cannot afford to send the message that if you \n     cooperate with law enforcement you will be sued.\n       As the Senate considers this legislation, we strongly urge \n     you to help preserve the cooperative relationship between law \n     enforcement and private businesses by supporting Section 202.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Dennis J.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Spector: I am \n     writing on behalf of the forty-four state narcotic officers' \n     associations and the more than 69,000 law enforcement \n     officers represented by the National Narcotic Officers' \n     Associations' Coalition (NNOAC) to encourage your strong \n     support for Section 202 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2007.\n       Section 202 provides much-needed relief from mass tort \n     litigation towards telecommunications companies that helped \n     protect our nation after the horrific attacks of September \n     11, 2001. Should this provision not be adopted, we believe \n     that federal, state and local law enforcement will suffer by \n     losing important voluntary cooperation of allies in our \n     national fight against crime. Private corporations and \n     business may decide to avoid the risk of litigation by \n     declining to cooperate with law enforcement--even if they \n     have every reason to believe the request for their help is \n     lawful and just.\n       The NNOAC understands and appreciates the vital role that \n     private businesses play in emergency situations and criminal \n     investigations. Our membership is very concerned that if \n     these corporate entities continue to be dragged through \n     costly litigation for having responded during dire \n     circumstances--like the terrorist attacks occurring on \n     September 11, 2001--it will have a chilling effect on the \n     private sector's voluntary cooperation with law enforcement \n     in the future. The United States government cannot afford to \n     send the message to corporate America that if you cooperate \n     with law enforcement and the office of the United States \n     Attorney General, you will get sued.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important \n     provision and your continued support towards law enforcement. \n     I am happy to discuss this issue further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ronald E.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As President of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express my support for Section 202 of the FISA Amendments Act \n     of 2007. This section is of particular importance to law \n     enforcement because it will have a significant impact on the \n     vital cooperative relationship between government and the \n     private sector that is necessary to promote and protect \n     public safety.\n       As you know, Section 202 provides relief from litigation to \n     telecommunications companies that responded to the \n     government's request for assistance following the horrific \n     attacks of September 11, 2001. It is my belief that failure \n     to adopt this provision could jeopardize the cooperation of \n     vital allies in our ongoing fight against crime and \n     terrorism. Businesses often feel compelled to avoid the risk \n     of litigation by declining to cooperate with law enforcement \n     even though they have every reason to believe the request is \n     lawful.\n       Police chiefs understand the vital role that private \n     businesses often play in emergency situations and criminal \n     investigations, and we are concerned that if these companies \n     are faced with the threat of litigation for responding in \n     these circumstances, it will have a chilling effect on their \n     voluntary cooperation with law enforcement authorities in the \n     future.\n       At this critical time in history, when federal, state, \n     tribal and local law enforcement agencies are striving to \n     protect the public from terrorists, sophisticated \n     international gangs, online predators, and other violent \n     criminals, it is extremely important that we be able to rely \n     on the private sector for much needed assistance.\n       Therefore, as the Senate considers this legislation, I urge \n     you to help preserve the cooperative relationship between law \n     enforcement and private businesses by supporting Section 202.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter and \n     for your efforts on behalf of law enforcement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald C. Ruecker,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, The first letter is from the National \nSheriffs Association on behalf of 20,000 nationwide sheriffs. It states \nin part:\n\n       The Nation's sheriffs recognize the critical role that \n     electronic communication service providers play in assisting \n     intelligence officials on national security activities. We \n     are gravely concerned that, without retroactive immunity, the \n     private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful \n     Government requests in the future. The possible reduction in \n     intelligence that might result from protracted litigation is \n     unacceptable to the security of our citizens. We strongly \n     urge you to help preserve the cooperative relationship \n     between law enforcement and the private sector by supporting \n     the immunity provision of this bill.\n\n  The other letters include one from the National Troopers Coalition, \non behalf of its 40,000 members, one from the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, on behalf of its 21,000 members, and one from the \nNational Narcotics Officers' Association's Coalition on behalf of its \n69,000 members. All of these letters support the retroactive immunity \nprovision.\n  I have to tell you, when 150,000 law enforcement personnel with \ntremendous experience and expertise say they support telecom \nretroactive immunity, we should be listening and we should be giving \nthis great weight. They know firsthand the dangers we face and they \nknow what is at stake.\n  Let me talk a little about the Feinstein amendment No. 3910 on \nexclusive means. S. 2248 already has an exclusive means provision that \nis identical to the first part of the distinguished Senator's \namendment. That provision simply restates Congress's intent back in \n1978, when FISA was enacted, to place the President at his lowest ebb \nof authority in conducting warrantless foreign intelligence \nsurveillance.\n  The current provision in S. 2248 was acceptable to all sides in the \nIntelligence Committee because it maintains the status quo with respect \nto the dispute over the President's constitutional authority to \nauthorize warrantless surveillance.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is a significant expansion of the bipartisan provision that \nwe enacted in the Intelligence Committee bill. Her amendment goes \nfurther by stating that only an express statutory authorization for \nelectronic surveillance, other than FISA or the criminal wiretap \nstatutes, shall constitute additional exclusive means.\n  This attempts to prohibit the President's exercise of his judicially \nrecognized article II authority to issue warrantless electronic \nsurveillance directives.\n  During the next attack on our country or in the face of an imminent \nthreat, the Congress may not be in a position to legislate an express \nauthorization of additional means. We may get intelligence information \nabout an imminent threat during a lengthy recess, over a holiday. Air \ntravel may be inhibited.\n  The bottom line is, we don't know what tomorrow will bring. Yet this\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nprovision of the distinguished Senator from California would raise \nunnecessary legal concerns that might impede effective action by the \nexecutive branch to protect this country.\n  This amendment would also make members of the intelligence community \nwho conduct electronic surveillance at the direction of the President \nsubject to the FISA criminal penalty provisions of a $10,000 fine and \nimprisonment for not more than 5 years.\n  Virtually all of these people are not partisan people. They are \npeople who continue on regardless of what administration is involved. \nThey are there to do the job to protect us. They are not partisans. We \nshould not treat them as such, and certainly we should not be saying \nthat if they make a mistake, they are subject to a criminal provision \nof a $10,000 fine or imprisonment of not more than 5 years. Also, it is \nlikely these criminal penalties would apply to any service provider who \nassisted the Government in conducting such electronic surveillance. \nThat makes it even tougher to get their cooperation. Up until now they \nhave been willing to cooperate because they realize how important this \nwork is, and they have the request of high-level officials in the \nGovernment. That should be enough to protect them. They are doing it \npatriotically, to protect our country. They should not be hampered nor \nshould their general counsels have to make a decision that the U.S. \nGovernment will have to go to court, with all of the delays involved in \nthat, in order to do what it takes to protect the people in this \ncountry.\n  Regardless of what the skeptics and critics have said about the \nPresident's Terrorist Surveillance Program, the Constitution trumps the \nFISA statute. If a Government employee acts under the color of the \nPresident's lawful exercise of his constitutional authority, that \nemployee should not be subject to a criminal penalty.\n  In my opinion, the current restatement of exclusive means is fair and \nkeeps the playing field level, and it is enough. Ultimately, the \nSupreme Court may decide whether Congress has the authority to limit \nthe President's authority to intercept enemy communications. Until \nthen, it is my hope that we don't try to tilt the balance in a way that \nwe may someday come to regret.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this exclusive means amendment.\n  The next Feinstein amendment is No. 3919. This amendment alters the \nimmunity provision of the Rockefeller-Bond bill. I will oppose this \namendment.\n  As has been said countless times, the immunity provision in this \nlegislation was created after months of extensive debate and \nnegotiation between the Congress and the intelligence community.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the painstaking work that the Intelligence \nCommittee undertook in order to create this immunity provision. The \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence stated the \nfollowing in the Intelligence Committee report:\n\n       The [Intelligence] Committee did not endorse the immunity \n     provision lightly. It was the informed judgment of the \n     Committee after months in which we carefully reviewed the \n     facts in the matter. The Committee reached the conclusion \n     that the immunity remedy was appropriate in this case after \n     holding numerous hearings and briefings on the subject and \n     conducting a thorough examination of the letters sent by the \n     U.S. Government to the telecommunications companies.\n\n  The administration wanted more than what is in this bill, and they \ndid not get it. In a bipartisan way, we came together to come up with \nthis bill, and it should not be tampered with now on the floor.\n  Let's look at what this means in relation to ongoing litigation. \nSince this immunity compromise provides no immunity for Government \nagencies or officials, the following seven cases will continue to be \nunaffected by this legislation. The immunity provision of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence bill still allows TSP challenges in \nthe al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Inc. v. George W. Bush case, the \nACLU v. National Security Agency case, the Center for Constitutional \nRights v. George W. Bush case, the Guzzi v. George W. Bush case, the \nHenderson v. Keith Alexander case, the Shubert v. George W. Bush case, \nand the Tooley v. George W. Bush case.\n  I wish to draw attention to the first case. The al-Haramain Islamic \nFoundation has been designated by the Department of the Treasury as a \n``specially designated global terrorist'' for providing support to al-\nQaida and was similarly designated by the United Nations Security \nCouncil. If there ever was a case that should be dismissed, this is \nit--a terrorist organization providing support to al-Qaida sues the \nPresident for listening to their terrorist conversations. Unbelievable. \nAnd yet since the immunity provision in this bill is silent on the \nissue, the case will go on.\n  I highlight this case to remind people the provision in the bill \nalready represents a compromise. The provision in the original bill \npassed by a 13-to-2 bipartisan vote out of the Intelligence Committee \non which I serve. Despite repeated attempts to tweak this compromise, \nit remains the most appropriate and just mechanism for the resolution \nof this issue.\n  Just like the faulty ideas of Government indemnification and \nGovernment substitution, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nreview of certifications is yet another alternative that fails to \nimprove on the original bipartisan immunity compromise we have in the \nbill before us.\n  I will oppose any provisions which weaken the immunity compromise. \nThis amendment we are debating will do exactly that. Rather than rely \non the carefully crafted language, this amendment introduces radically \nnew ideas which completely change the dynamics of the immunity \nprovision of the bipartisan bill. Rather than allowing the presiding \ndistrict judge to review the Attorney's General certification called \nfor in this bill, this amendment unnecessarily expands the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court jurisdiction into areas unheard of when \nthis court was created nearly 30 years ago and equally unheard of in \nthe year 2008.\n  Let's remember what it is that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt was created to do:\n\n       A court which shall have jurisdiction to hear applications \n     for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance.\n\n  That is the mission of the FISC. So the FISC hears applications for \nand grants orders approving electronic surveillance. That is it. That \nis all they were created to do and rightly so. These are judges from \nall over the country who serve on the FISC at special times and do read \nthese briefs, do read these legal matters that come before them, and \nthen do exactly that, ``a court which shall have jurisdiction to hear \napplications for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance.''\n  Yet this legislation will completely alter the nature of this court \nby transforming it into a trial court for adversarial litigation. This \ncompletely alters the intention of FISA from 1978 which carefully \ncreated this court. The role of the FISC, or Federal Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, has been greatly misunderstood during this debate.\n  I suggest we pay close attention to the recent opinion from the FISC, \nwhich is only the third public opinion in the history of the FISC, and \nthat is over a 30-year period. The importance of this quote has been \nemphasized many times by Senator Bond, and this is what the FISC said:\n\n       Although the FISC handles a great deal of classified \n     material, FISC judges do not make classification decisions \n     and are not intended to become national security experts. \n     Furthermore, even if a typical FISC judge had more expertise \n     in national security matters than a typical district court \n     judge, that expertise would not be equal to that of the \n     executive branch which is constitutionally entrusted with \n     protecting the national security.\n\n  I understand there are certain Senators in this body who dislike \nPresident Bush. That is their right. But on the other hand, there may \ncome a time when a President of their party may have to protect our \ncountry. They ought to think it through because they are taking away \nthe tools that are necessary to protect our country in a zeal to go \nbeyond what the FISC was ever designated to do.\n  Going beyond the fact this amendment would turn the role of the FISA \nCourt on its head, let's look at what the FISC is asked to do in this \namendment. According to the language, liability protection would only \noccur in three limited instances: One, the statutory defense in 18 \nU.S.C. 2511(2)(a)(ii)\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\nhas been met. Two, the assistance of electronic surveillance service \nproviders was undertaken on good faith and pursuant to an ``objectively \nreasonable belief'' that compliance with the Government's directive was \nlawful. And three, assistance was not provided.\n  Regarding the first instance in which litigation would be dismissed, \nwe need to realize 18 U.S.C. 2511 is not the only statute that allows \nthe Government to receive information from telecommunications \ncompanies. There are numerous statutes which authorize the Government \nto receive information from private businesses. Here is a list not \nmeant to include all such statutes. Look at this list:\n\n  18 U.S.C. 2516; 18 U.S.C. 2518, 18 U.S.C. 2512(2)(a)(ii), 18 U.S.C. \n2511(3)(b)(iv), 50 U.S.C. 1802(a), 50 U.S.C. 1804, 50 U.S.C. 1805, 50 \nU.S.C. 1811, 50 U.S.C. 1861, 18 U.S.C. 2702(b)(5), 18 U.S.C. \n2702(c)(5), 18 U.S.C. 2702(b)(8), 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4), 18 U.S.C. \n2703(a), 18 U.S.C. 2709, 50 U.S.C. 1842, 18 U.S.C. 3127, 50 U.S.C. \n1843, and 50 U.S.C. 1844, to mention a few.\n  Regarding the second narrow instance of dismissal of litigation, the \nphrase ``objectively reasonable belief'' is not defined in the \nlegislation. What does this mean? How can it not be given a definition \nif the court is supposed to rely on it? Are we going to turn it over to \nthe court to define it? Again, that is not the mission of the court. \nThe court is not skilled in intelligence matters, except to the extent \nthey have to know about it to be able to approve the various requests \nthat are made of them, and there is no way it is going to be as skilled \nas the intelligence community.\n  So this amendment would grant the FISC new jurisdiction to review \npast conduct of private businesses utilizing a standard which did not \nexist at the time of the supposed activity and a standard which is not \neven defined in the legislation which creates it. Wow.\n  In addition, this amendment would allow plaintiffs and defendants to \nappear before the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court. But we \nshould know the FISC is not a trial court. It has never had plaintiffs \nin ongoing civil litigation appear before it in its nearly 30 years of \nexistence.\n  There are approximately 40 civil cases which are ongoing out of this \nmatter. Would all these plaintiffs appear before FISC? How would \nclassified information, therefore, be protected? This amendment would \ncreate an entirely new role for the FISC, thus abandoning the very \nformula by which the FISC was created in the first place. Remember, the \nFISC was created to be a specialized court. Yet the expansion of FISC \njurisdiction and duty required by this amendment brings us down a road \nwhere the FISC could be transformed from a specialized court to an \nappendage of the Federal district court. That precedent set by this \namendment could forever alter the role of the FISC.\n  Quite simply, the FISC is not a trial court, nor should it be. Quite \nsimply, the FISC is not a forum for adversarial litigation, nor should \nit be.\n  This amendment extends the rationale that the answer to any question \nduring this debate is ``have the FISC look at it.'' The role of the \nFISC is vitally important, but the FISC is not the answer to every \nquestion during this debate. Misguided attempts to expand the FISC to \nbe the purported solution to any alleged problem with terrorist \ntracking are impractical, imperceptive, and inappropriate.\n  We are long past the time for guesswork, and we need to support the \ntried-and-true bipartisan immunity provision as appropriate remedy to a \ncritical problem. I reiterate my strenuous objection to this amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues not to support an amendment which introduces \nfar too many unanswered questions into a debate which needs none.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3912\n\n  With regard to amendment No. 3912 regarding bulk collection, this \namendment did pass out of the Judiciary Committee, but it passed on a \n10-to-9 party-line vote after only four minutes of discussion. This \nJudiciary substitute was tabled by the full Senate by a 60-to-36 vote, \nand this amendment is one of the reasons it was.\n  There is confusion about the need for this amendment. Does it \npreclude bulk collection or not? The text of the amendment seems to \nindicate that no bulk collection is permitted. Yet the author of the \namendment states there is an exception for military operations. I have \nread the amendment, and I don't see any exception listed. Perhaps he is \nreferencing comments in the Judiciary Committee report. But committee \nreports are not law.\n  The Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence have \ncarefully reviewed this amendment, and they have stated that if this \namendment is in a bill which is presented to the President, they will \nrecommend that the President veto the bill, and I agree with that \nrecommendation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3979\n\n  With regard to the Feingold amendment No. 3979 on sequestration of \nU.S. person communications, I am very concerned about the substance of \nthis amendment, as are many of my colleagues. In addition, the Attorney \nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence have thoroughly reviewed \nthis amendment, and they recently sent a letter to the Senate stating:\n\n       This amendment would eviscerate critical core authorities \n     of the Protect America Act and S. 2248. Our prior letter and \n     Statement of Administration Policy explained how this type of \n     amendment increases the danger to the Nation and returns the \n     intelligence community to a pre-September 11th posture that \n     was heavily criticized in congressional reviews. It would \n     have a devastating impact on foreign intelligence \n     surveillance operations. It has never been the case that the \n     mere fact that a person overseas happens to communicate with \n     an American triggers a need for court approval. Indeed, if \n     court approval were mandated in such circumstances, there \n     would be grave consequences for the intelligence communities' \n     efforts to collect foreign intelligence.\n\n  The last part of this has been underlined.\n\n       Accordingly, if this amendment is part of a bill that is \n     presented to the President, we, as well as the President's \n     other senior advisors, will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Unlike many of the amendments we have debated here on the Senate \nfloor, this amendment did not receive a vote in either the Intelligence \nor Judiciary Committees. Not that that is limiting, but the amendment \nitself is not a healthy one on its face. Yet this amendment is among \nthe most drastic in terms of affecting the efficiency and effectiveness \nof our intelligence collection processes. This amendment imposes \ntremendous restrictions in which the intelligence community is limited \nin what information they can receive and how this information can be \nshared.\n  That is what I think we were shocked to find when 9/11 occurred, that \nour various intelligence community organizations--FBI, CIA, et cetera--\nwere not sharing information. Now that we have solved that problem, why \ngo back?\n  The massive reorganization of our collection techniques which would \nbe required by this amendment is certainly obvious. The author of the \namendment has recognized this as well, previously stating:\n\n       I do understand this amendment imposes a new framework that \n     may take some time to implement.\n\n  We need to remember the purpose of this bill is, and always has been, \nto enable the intelligence community to target foreign terrorists and \nspies overseas. But in order to make sure we are not missing valuable \nintelligence, we need to get all of a target's communications, not only \nwhen that target is talking with other people overseas, and that may \nmean intercepting calls with people inside the United States. In fact, \nthose may be the most important calls to try to prevent an attack in \nthe United States.\n  I understand there is concern about the impact of foreign targeting \non U.S. persons. But we have a lot of protections built into this new \nbill that came out of the Intelligence Committee on a 13-to-2 \nbipartisan vote. I have been to this floor on numerous occasions and \nhighlighted how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's role in \nall aspects of foreign intelligence collection is being greatly \nexpanded by this bill, far beyond the 1978 FISA statute.\n  In addition, the Senate agreed to an amendment by Senator Kennedy \nthat would make it clear you cannot use authorities in this bill to \nrequire communications where the sender and all intended recipients are \nknown to be in the United States. We shouldn't go any farther.\n  The intelligence community must use minimization procedures. Our \nanalysts are familiar with these procedures. They have used them for a \nlong\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\ntime without any known abuses. Yet the scope of this amendment seems to \nrepresent no confidence in the minimization procedures used by the U.S. \nGovernment. Keep in mind, these minimization procedures were enacted \nover 30 years ago, and this bill will authorize the FISC to review and \napprove them for the first time.\n  This bill goes farther than ever before in our history in striking a \nbalance between intelligence collection and protection of civil \nliberties. Personally, I am proud of this bill. I think all in the \nIntelligence Committee should have stuck with it, and we should not be \ntrying to amend it at this point, especially with amendments that \naren't going to work and will diminish our ability to get the \nintelligence we need to protect our citizens. Now I believe that in \nthis bill we are protecting the civil liberties of ordinary Americans, \nbut we also need to make sure our intelligence community isn't blind to \ninformation which may ultimately prove to be critical.\n  Section (a)(1) of this amendment would not allow the collection of \ncertain communications if the Government knows before acquisition a \ncommunication is to or from a person reasonably believed to be in the \nUnited States. The Government knows when it targets foreign citizens in \nforeign countries that they might call or be called by U.S. persons. \nThese are called ``incidental communications.'' Under the limitations \nin this amendment, the Government could not initiate the collection in \nthe first place under many circumstances. This essentially undoes the \nauthority granted in section 703 of this bill and will cause us to go \ndeaf to our enemies.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has told us before that speed \nand agility are essential in tracking terrorists and preventing \nterrorist attacks. Yet even if collection could somehow begin under the \ndangerous restrictions in this amendment, analysts would have to go \nthrough hoop after hoop after hoop to use information that has foreign \nintelligence value. Remember, if it doesn't have foreign intelligence \nvalue, any U.S. person information would already have been minimized.\n  I do not understand why we would set up unnecessary roadblocks and \nslow this process down when we already have so many substantial \nprotections in place. The Director of National Intelligence has stated \nthis amendment would cause significant operational problems for the \nintelligence community that could lead to intelligence gaps. I affirm \nthis statement. Knowing this, it would be irresponsible to handcuff our \nintelligence community with these additional restrictions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous amendment.\n  I emphasize again: We have brilliant, knowledgeable, well-trained, \ndecent, honorable people who are here, no matter who is President, in \nthe business of protecting our citizens from terrorist acts. And this \nbill, which passed 13 to 2 on a bipartisan vote out of the Intelligence \nCommittee, provides more checks on these good people than the FISA Act \nof 1978 did, and that act has worked very well through all those years. \nThe reason we are doing this bill is because we are in a new age, with \nnew methods of communication that simply were not covered by the 1978 \nact, to put it in simple terms.\n  This is a complex thing, and I think we have to be very careful if we \ngo beyond what the Intelligence Committee bill has said we should do. \nIt was a bill worked out after months of hearings and work by the \nIntelligence Committee. I believe, in the Senate, I have probably been \non the Intelligence Committee longer than anybody else, and I want to \nprotect our people too. I want to protect them in a multiplicity of \nways. But one of the most important ways we can protect them in this \nday of Islamic fascism is to give them the tools to do it and not \nrestrict and hamper them from doing it--keeping in mind that they are \nhonest, non-partisan citizens who are more interested in protecting \nAmericans and getting the information we need to protect everybody than \nthe partisans and sometimes uninformed people make them out to be.\n  Yes, any administration can put the top-level people in, but it is \nthose who collect this information on a daily basis, minimize this \ninformation when it needs to be minimized, and work to do it in an \nhonorable fashion who do the work. We should not be tying their hands \nand hampering them from getting the work done in this day and age when \nwe have so many problems, and it looks to me as if we are going to have \nthem for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3919\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am glad to have had the occasion to \nbe on the floor and hear the words of the very distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, who has served with such distinction on the Intelligence \nCommittee for so long, but I would respond to him first that this much-\ntouted 13-to-2 vote in the Intelligence Committee, as shown by the \nrecord of the additional views of the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, reflected the consensus of the Intelligence Committee that \nthis was a work in progress; that it should go on to the Judiciary \nCommittee, which was its next stop, and then to the floor. There was no \nsense that the work on the bill should stop at the time it left the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Indeed, in the 13-to-2 vote, there were 9 Senators who offered \nadditional views suggesting changes or differences in the legislation. \nSo I don't think it would be wise or appropriate for this body to take \na look at what the Intelligence Committee did and say that because the \nnumber appears to be 13 to 2 on the surface that we are not going to do \nour job of continuing to work on this work in progress.\n  In that spirit, I rise today to support amendment No. 3919, on good \nfaith determinations, offered by Senators Feinstein and Nelson. In the \ndivisive debate we are having over immunity, Senator Feinstein's \namendment is a commendable effort to find middle ground, to which \nSenator Feinstein has brought great diligence and care. Senator Specter \nand I have offered a broader approach, but I also support the \nFeinstein-Nelson amendment.\n  This amendment goes forward with the first half of Specter-\nWhitehouse. It provides for an independent judicial review of the \ncompanies' good faith. Specter-Whitehouse then provides for \nsubstitution of the Government in place of the companies, which would \nprotect plaintiffs' legitimate rights to continue legitimate \nlitigation, including the right to conduct discovery.\n  Substitution also avoids the problem of uncompensated congressional \ntermination of ongoing litigation--a separation of powers problem. \nSenator Feinstein's alternative at least provides for the bare minimum \nof a judicial determination whether the defendant companies were acting \nin compliance with the law or with the reasonable good faith belief \nthat they were in compliance. I would note this is probably the lowest \npossible standard. We don't even require companies to have been acting \nwithin the law. All we require in this amendment is that they have a \nreasonable and good faith belief they were acting within the law.\n  As I have said before, both of the all-or-nothing approaches we are \npresented with here are flawed. Full immunity would strip the \nplaintiffs of their day in court and take away their due process rights \nwithout any judicial determination that the companies acted in good \nfaith. That is not fair. Nothing suggests this isn't legitimate \nlitigation, and it is wrong to take away a plaintiff's day in court \nwithout a chance to show why doing so may not be warranted.\n  I hope in this Chamber we can all agree that if the companies did not \nact reasonably and in good faith they shouldn't get protection. If we \nagree on that, the question becomes where the good faith determination \nshould be made. I think it should be in court, and that is where \nSenator Feinstein's amendment puts it--in this case, the FISA Court. \nFirst, it should not be here. We in Congress are not judges, and good \nfaith is a judicial determination. We should leave this key \ndetermination to the judicial branch of Government. The companies have, \nof course, asserted that they acted in good faith. But we surely should \nnot rely on one side's assertions in making a decision of this \nimportance.\n  Moreover, most Senators have not even been read into the classified \nmaterials that would allow them to reach a fair conclusion. This body \nis literally incapable of forming a fair opinion\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nwithout access by most Members to the facts. So this is the wrong place \nto have it. We need to provide a fair mechanism for a finding of good \nfaith by a proper judicial body with the proper provisions for secrecy, \nwhich the FISA Court has. If we do not do this, we are simply acting by \nbrute political force, and doing so in an area where there are \nsignificant constitutional issues. Congress cutting off the ongoing \nwork of the judicial branch may well violate the boundary that keeps \nthe legislative and judicial branches separate--a cornerstone of our \nConstitution.\n  In an opinion written by Justice Scalia, the U.S. Supreme Court said \nthat the Framers of the Federal Constitution had what they called ``the \nsense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the \njudicial power, prompted by the crescendo''--was the word they used--\n``of legislative interference with private judgments of the courts.''\n  If there were ever a case of legislative interference with private \njudgment of the courts, this is it. On the other hand, consider the \nfact that the Government has forbidden these defendants to defend \nthemselves. By invoking the state secrets privilege, the Government has \ngagged the companies. In my view, that is not fair either, particularly \nif the Government put these companies in this mess in the first place. \nSo both of the all-or-nothing approaches are flawed.\n  I think Senator Specter and I have come up with the best answer: \nsubstitution. But Senator Feinstein's amendment at least requires the \nFISA Court to make an initial determination that the companies either \ndid not provide assistance to the Government--obviously, if they did \nnot do anything, they should not be liable--or were actually complying \nwith the law. Clearly, if they complied with the law, they should not \nbe liable--or were at least acting with a reasonable good-faith belief \nthat they were complying with the law--again, the lowest possible \nstandard. If we cannot agree on this, then we have really taken our \neyes off of our duties. The difference then becomes that once that \ngood-faith determination is made, the Specter-Whitehouse amendment \nwould lead to substitution, whereas the Feinstein-Nelson amendment \nwould lead to a termination of the claims.\n  Both of these approaches are better than the all-or-nothing \nalternative we otherwise face, and both share the same goal: to use \nexisting procedures and existing rules and existing courts to unsnarl \nthis litigation and move it toward a just and a proper conclusion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both the Specter-Whitehouse and the \nFeinstein-Nelson amendments.\n  I make one final point. Senator Hatch pointed out that the people who \nserve us in our intelligence community are honorable, are well trained, \nare intelligent, are decent, and are trying to do the right thing. I do \nnot challenge any of that.\n  As the U.S. attorney, I worked with FBI agents day-in and day-out, \nSecret Service agents, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms agents--all decent, honorable, hard working, well \ntrained, trying to do the right thing. In that environment, they are \nall very comfortable that the structure we have put in place for \ndomestic surveillance, to protect American's rights, is a useful thing, \nit is important infrastructure of Government.\n  I see what we are trying to do now not as a criticism of the people \nin the intelligence community but, rather, as being an attempt to build \nout the infrastructure, the infrastructure that balances freedom and \nsecurity in this new area of international surveillance, in just the \nsame way we put restrictions on our agents at home.\n  As attorney general, I actually had to personally get the wiretaps \nfor the State of Rhode Island from the presiding judge of the superior \ncourt. I would say the same thing about the Rhode Island State troopers \nwith whom I worked in those cases.\n  Agents and police officers who have this responsibility do not resent \nthe fact that they are given a structure to work within. I doubt that \nthe intelligence community would resent a sensible measure that would \nallow a judicial determination before an American company has a finding \nof good faith made about it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3979\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, today I want to address several of the \npending amendments to the FISA legislation, and I will indicate the \namendment number of each one as I discuss it. First is what we call the \nFeingold-Webb-Tester amendment No. 3979. I wish to address some of the \narguments that have been made in opposition to Feingold-Webb-Tester and \nto set the record straight about what the amendment does. The Senator \nfrom Missouri has suggested it would cut off all foreign intelligence \ncollection because the Government would not be able to determine in \nadvance whether communications are foreign to foreign. This is \npreposterous. The whole point of the amendment is to allow the \nGovernment to acquire all communications of foreign targets when it \ndoes not know in advance whether they are purely foreign or have one \nend in the United States.\n  The administration also argues we should not pass the Feingold-Webb-\nTester amendment because it would be difficult and time consuming to \nimplement. That is no reason to oppose the amendment. I understand the \namendment imposes a new framework, and that is precisely why the \namendment grants the Government up to a year before it goes into \neffect.\n  I also wish to make clear that the amendment does not force the \nGovernment to determine the location of every person and every e-mail \nthe Government acquires, contrary to what has been suggested. The \namendment only requires that the Government determine whether one end \nof a communication is in the United States where reasonably \npracticable, based on procedures approved by the FISA Court. In some \ninstances, that would be easy to do, while in others it would not be \nfeasible at all. The court-approved procedures will take those \ndifferences into account.\n  It is also not true that the amendment would harm our nonterrorism \nforeign intelligence operations. This amendment leaves intact the \nwarrantless acquisition of any foreign-to-foreign communications and \nany communications where the Government doesn't know in advance whether \nthey are to or from people in the United States. Even for \ncommunications where the Government knows they involve Americans in the \nUnited States, no court order is actually required for communications \nrelating to terrorism or anyone's safety.\n  This is much broader than the pre-Protect America Act law. None of \nthis would have been possible 7 months ago. Let's not forget the \njustification for this legislation has always been about terrorism and \nforeign-to-foreign communications. Last month, the Vice President \ndefended the Protect America Act by talking about ``one foreign citizen \nabroad making a telephone call to another foreign citizen abroad about \nterrorism.'' The Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment allows those calls to \nbe monitored without a warrant.\n  The Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment allows the Government to get the \ninformation it needs about terrorists and about purely foreign \ncommunications, while providing additional checks and balances for \ncommunications between people in the United States and their overseas \nfamily members, friends, and business colleagues. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment.\n  Let me next turn to Amendment No. 3912, which has been referred to as \nthe bulk collection amendment. I wish to again stress the importance of \nmy amendment prohibiting the bulk collection of Americans' \ninternational communications. The bill we are debating is supposedly \nintended to permit monitoring of foreign-to-foreign communications and \nthe tracking of terrorists overseas without a warrant. It is not \nsupposed to allow the Government to collect all communications into or \nout of the United States, but\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nthat is exactly what the Government could seek to do with these \nauthorities, which is why this amendment is critical. I have yet to \nhear any real arguments against it.\n  The DNI's recent letter opposing the amendment fails to come up with \nany substantive arguments. Instead, it describes hypothetical \nsituations that clearly wouldn't be affected by the amendment. In order \nto protect the international communications of innocent Americans at \nhome, the amendment simply requires that the Government is seeking \nforeign intelligence information from its targets. In the only examples \ncited in the letter--a neighborhood or group of buildings or geographic \narea that the U.S. military is about to invade--clearly, the Government \nhas that purpose. The notion that the Government could not make a good-\nfaith certification to the court that it is seeking foreign \nintelligence, which is all this amendment requires, is simply \nludicrous. What is telling about the DNI's letter, besides that it \nincludes no real arguments against the amendment, is what it does not \nsay. It does not refute the danger this amendment is intended to \naddress: the bulk collection of all communications between the United \nStates and Europe or Canada or South America or, indeed, the world.\n  The DNI has testified that the PAA would authorize that kind of \nmassive, indiscriminate collection of Americans' communications, and \nthe administration has never denied that this bill could, too, unless \nwe pass this amendment. In fact, this letter does nothing to reassure \nthe American people the Government could not and would not collect all \ntheir international communications. Worse, the letter argues that a \nprohibition on that kind of massive collection would not ``appreciably \nenhanc[e] the privacy interests of Americans.'' If the DNI does not \nthink the privacy interests of Americans would be affected by the \ncollection of all their international communications, potentially \nvacuuming up their communications not just with foreigners overseas but \nwith Americans overseas as well, then that is all the more reason to be \nconcerned.\n  Serious constitutional issues are at stake. The administration is \neffectively telling us it intends to ignore them.\n\n  Let me also respond to a statement by the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee last week that a dragnet of all international \ncommunications of Americans would probably violate the fourth \namendment. I am pleased to hear the chairman acknowledge that the \nsurveillance the administration would like to conduct would violate the \nconstitutional rights of Americans, but how could we possibly expect \nthis administration--an administration that has already demonstrated \nindifference to Americans' privacy and has already said that bulk \ncollection would be ``desirable''--to hold back. Nor should we rely on \nthe FISA Court to stop this, as the chairman has suggested. If Congress \nbelieves something is unconstitutional, we have absolutely no business \nauthorizing it. We have been warned, and now we need to act by passing \nmy modest bulk collection amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time on amendment No. 3902.\n  As to the Dodd-Feingold immunity amendment No. 3907, I am pleased to \njoin my colleague in offering this amendment to strike the immunity \nprovision. I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 15 minutes to \nspeak on the Dodd amendment and that the time be charged to the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3907\n\n  I strongly support Senator Dodd's amendment to strike the immunity \nprovision from this bill. I thank him for his leadership on the issue. \nI offered a similar amendment in the Judiciary Committee, and I \nsupported a similar amendment in the Intelligence Committee when it was \noffered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson. Congress should not be \ngiving automatic retroactive immunity to companies that allegedly \ncooperated with the President's illegal NSA wiretapping program. This \nprovision of the bill is both unnecessary and unjustified, and it will \nundermine the rule of law. Retroactive immunity is unnecessary because \ncurrent law already provides immunity from lawsuits for companies that \ncooperate with the Government's request for assistance, as long as they \nreceive either a court order or a certification from the Attorney \nGeneral that no court order is needed and the request meets all \nstatutory requirements.\n  Companies do not need to do their own analysis of the court order or \nthe certification to determine whether the Government is, in fact, \nacting lawfully. But if requests are not properly documented, FISA \ninstructs the telephone companies to refuse the Government's request \nand subjects them to liability if they instead decide to cooperate. \nThis framework, which has been in place for 30 years, protects \ncompanies that act at the request of the Government, while also \nprotecting the privacy of Americans' communications. Some supporters of \nretroactively expanding this provision argue that the telephone \ncompanies should not be penalized if they relied on high-level \nGovernment assurance that the requested assistance was lawful. As \nsuperficially appealing as that argument may sound, it utterly ignores \nthe history of the FISA statute.\n  Telephone companies have a long history of receiving requests for \nassistance from the Government. That is because telephone companies \nhave access to a wealth of private information about Americans, \ninformation that can be a very useful tool for law enforcement. But \nthat very same access to private communications means telephone \ncompanies are in a unique position of responsibility and public trust. \nYet before FISA, there were basically no rules to help the phone \ncompanies resolve this tension, between the Government's request for \nassistance in foreign intelligence investigations and the companies' \nresponsibilities to their customers. This legal vacuum resulted in \nserious Government abuse and overreaching.\n  The Judiciary Committee has heard testimony about this system from \nMort Halperin, a former Nixon administration official who was himself \nthe subject of a warrantless wiretap and was involved in the drafting \nof the FISA law in the 1970s. He testified that before FISA:\n\n       Government communication with the telephone company . . . \n     could not have been more casual. A designated official of the \n     FBI called a designated official of [the company] and passed \n     on the phone number. Within minutes all of the calls from \n     that number were being routed to the local FBI field office \n     and monitored.\n\n  Not surprisingly, this casual ad hoc system failed to protect \nAmericans' privacy. The abuses that took place are well documented and \nquite shocking. With the willing cooperation of the telephone \ncompanies, the FBI conducted surveillance of peaceful antiwar \nprotesters, journalists, steel company executives, and even Martin \nLuther King, Jr., an American hero whose life we recently celebrated.\n  So Congress decided to take action. Based on the history of and \npotential for Government abuses, Congress decided it was not \nappropriate for telephone companies to simply assume that any \nGovernment request for assistance to conduct electronic surveillance \nwas legal.\n  Let me repeat that. A primary purpose of FISA was to make clear once \nand for all that the telephone companies should not blindly cooperate \nwith Government requests for assistance. At the same time, however, \nCongress did not want to saddle telephone companies with the \nresponsibility of determining whether the Government's request for \nassistance was a lawful one. That approach would leave the companies in \na permanent state of legal uncertainty about their obligations. So \nCongress devised a system that would take the guesswork out of it \ncompletely. Under that system, which is still in place today, the \ncompanies' legal obligations and liability depends entirely on whether \nthe Government has presented the company with a court order or a \ncertification stating that certain basic requirements have been met.\n\n  If the proper documentation is submitted, the company must cooperate \nwith the request and will be immune from liability. If the proper \ndocumentation has not been submitted, the\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\ncompany must refuse the Government's request or be subject to possible \nliability in the courts.\n  AT, which was the only telephone company in existence at the time \nin the 1970s, was at the table when FISA was drafted. As Mr. Halperin \ndescribed in his testimony, the company:\n\n     received the clarity that it sought and deserved. The rule, \n     spelled out clearly in several places in the legislation and \n     well understood by all, was this: If [the phone company] \n     received a copy of a warrant or certification under the \n     statute, it was required to cooperate. If it did not receive \n     authorization by means outlined in the statute, it was to \n     refuse to cooperate and was to be subjected to state and \n     federal civil and criminal penalties for unlawful acquisition \n     of electronic communications.\n\n  The telephone companies and the Government have been operating under \nthis simple framework for 30 years. Companies have experienced, highly \ntrained and highly compensated lawyers who know this law inside and \nout. In view of this history, it is inconceivable that any telephone \ncompanies that allegedly cooperated with the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping program did not know what their obligations \nwere. It is just as implausible that those companies believed they were \nentitled to simply assume the lawfulness of a Government request for \nassistance. This whole effort to obtain retroactive immunity is based \non an assumption that does not hold water.\n  Quite frankly, the claim that any telephone company that cooperates \nwith a Government request for assistance is simply acting out of the \nsense of patriotic duty doesn't fare much better. Recently, we learned \nthat telecommunications companies actually have cut off wiretaps when \nthe Government failed to promptly pay its bills.\n  The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General released a \nreport last month finding that ``late payments have resulted in \ntelecommunications carriers actually disconnecting phone lines \nestablished to deliver surveillance to the FBI, resulting in lost \nevidence.'' Since when does patriotic duty come with a price tag? \nEvidently, assisting the Government's criminal intelligence \ninvestigation efforts fell somewhere below collecting a paycheck on the \ncompanies' lines of priorities.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued the telephone companies alleged to \nhave cooperated with the program had a good-faith belief their actions \nwere in accordance with the law. But there is an entire statute in \naddition to the certification provision that already provides telephone \ncompanies with a precisely defined good-faith defense. Under this \nprovision, which is found in section 2520 of title 18, if the company \nis relying in good faith on a court order or other statutory \nlegislative authorization, they have a complete defense to liability. \nThis is a generous defense, but as generous as it is, it is not \nunlimited. The court must find that the telephone company determined in \ngood faith that there was a judicial, legislative, or statutory \nauthorization for the requested assistance.\n\n  I also wish to address the argument that retroactive immunity is \nnecessary because the telephone companies can't defend themselves in \ncourt. When I hear this argument, I can't help but think that this \nadministration has staged the perfect crime: enlist private companies \nto allegedly provide assistance in an illegal Government program, then \nprevent any judicial inquiry into the program by claiming a privilege--\nthe so-called state secrets privilege--that not only shields your own \nactions from scrutiny but enables the companies to evade judicial \nscrutiny as well by claiming that they are defenseless. All the \nadministration needs to get away with this is Congress's blessing.\n  That is exactly why immunity is the wrong solution. Think about what \nwe would be doing. We would be saying that in matters of national \nsecurity, you can break the law with impunity because the courts can't \nhandle national security materials. This is outrageous. Do we really \nwant to create a law-free zone for crimes that involve national \nsecurity matters? If the Government's use of the state secrets \nprivilege is interfering with holding companies accountable for alleged \nviolations of the law, the solution isn't to shrug and just give up on \naccountability; the solution is to address the privilege head-on and \nmake sure it doesn't become a license to evade the laws we have passed.\n  In any event, the notion that the Federal courts can't handle \nnational security matters is insulting to the judges this body has seen \nfit to confirm, and it is contrary to the facts. Cases involving \nclassified information are decided routinely by the Federal courts. \nThat is why we have a statute--the Classified Information Procedures \nAct--to govern how courts handle classified materials. Pursuant to that \nstatute, courts have in place procedures that have successfully \nprotected classified information for many years. There is no need to \ncreate a ``classified materials'' exception to our justice system.\n  That brings me to another issue. I have been discussing why \nretroactive immunity is unnecessary and unjustified, but it goes beyond \nthat. Granting companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal \nprogram this new form of automatic retroactive immunity undermines the \nlaw that has been on the books for decades, a law that was designed to \nprevent exactly the type of actions that allegedly occurred here. \nRemember, telephone companies already have absolute immunity if they \ncomplied with the applicable law, and they have an affirmative defense \nif they believed in good faith that they were complying with that law. \nSo the retroactive immunity provision we are debating here is necessary \nonly if we want to extend immunity to companies that did not comply \nwith the applicable law and did not even have a good-faith belief that \nthey were complying with it. So much for the rule of law. Even worse, \ngranting retroactive immunity under these circumstances will undermine \nany new laws we pass regarding Government surveillance. If we want \ncompanies to follow the law in the future, it certainly sends a \nterrible message, and sets a terrible precedent, to give them a ``get \nout of jail free'' card for allegedly ignoring the law in the past.\n  I find it particularly troubling when some of my colleagues argue \nthat we should grant immunity in order to encourage the telephone \ncompanies to cooperate with the Government in the future. Let's take a \nclose look at that argument.\n  Telephone companies are already legally obligated to cooperate with a \ncourt order, and as I have mentioned, they already have absolute \nimmunity for cooperating with requests that are properly certified. So \nthe only thing we would be encouraging by granting immunity here is \ncooperation with requests that violate the law. That is exactly the \nkind of cooperation FISA was supposed to prevent.\n  Let's remember why: These companies have access to our most private \nconversations, and Americans depend on them to respect and defend the \nprivacy of these communications unless there is clear legal authority \nfor sharing them. They depend on us to make sure the companies are held \naccountable for betrayals of that public trust. Instead, this immunity \nprovision would invite the telephone companies to betray that trust by \nencouraging cooperation with a legal Government program.\n  Since 9/11, I have heard it said many times that what separates us \nfrom our enemies is respect for the rule of law. Unfortunately, the \nrule of law has taken it on the chin from this administration. Over and \nover, the President and his advisers have claimed the right to ignore \nthe will of Congress if and when they see fit. Now they are claiming \nthe same right for any entity that assists them in that effort. It is \ntime for Congress to state clearly and unequivocally: When we pass a \nlaw, we mean what we say, and we except the law to be followed. That \ngoes for the President, it goes for the Attorney General, and it goes \nfor the telephone companies. The rule of law is not less important \nafter 9/11. We can and we must defeat al-Qaida without breaking the law \nor sacrificing Americans' basic rights.\n  We have a choice. The Senate can stand up for the rule of law and let \nthese cases go forward in the courts or we can decide to give our \nblessing to an administration that broke the law and the companies that \nallegedly helped it, and we can signal that we stand ready to bail them \nout the next time they decide to ignore the law. I urge my colleagues \nnot to take that step. Support the rule of law by voting in favor of \nthe Dodd-Feingold amendment No. 3907.\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\n  I again thank my colleague from Connecticut for his tremendous \nleadership on this issue. It has been extremely helpful in this effort. \nI sincerely thank him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remaining time be reserved.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before our colleague from Wisconsin leaves \nthe floor, let me thank him for his leadership on this issue, along \nwith many others associated with this piece of legislation: the reverse \ntargeting and the bulk collection issues which he has raised, which \nseem so obvious and so clear that you wonder why they even have to be a \nsubject of debate. The clear reaction, in fact, from leading \nauthorities, including those of the intelligence agencies, has been to \nstate categorically that the very actions he wants to exclude from this \nlegislation are prohibited under law. Reverse targeting is \nunconstitutional, and bulk collection is unattainable. But some in the \nadministration have said: Were bulk collection possible, we believe we \nhave the right to do it. The idea of bulk collection without following \nthe rule of law should violate the sensibilities of every single Member \nof this body.\n  This debate and this discussion are very important. This has gone on \nnow since back in December--actually, before then. The Senator from \nWisconsin sits on both the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence \nCommittee, and so he has been deeply involved in these issues for a \nlong time.\n  What I wish to state at the outset is that these amendments we are \noffering should not be the subject of some sort of political divide \nbetween Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, or \nwhatever definitions one wants to apply to the people who serve here. \nThis is about the rule of law. It is about the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and the idea that this issue and debate should somehow \nbe divided along those lines ought to be offensive to every single \nMember of this body. Every single one of us, on the day we raise our \nright hand and take the oath of office, swear to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. That is nothing less than what we \nare engaged in with this debate.\n  We have been asked to subscribe to the false dichotomy that in order \nfor us to be more secure as a nation, we must give up some of our \nrights. The Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Connecticut \nbelieve very firmly that quite the opposite is true: that if you begin \nto give up rights, you become less secure, as a people and as a nation. \nOur deep concern is that that is exactly the path we seem to be \nfollowing these days with the refusal to adopt the Feingold amendments \nin dealing with reverse targeting and bulk collections. It is what I am \nfearful may be the case when we try to strike title II of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act and prohibit the retroactive immunity \nbeing sought by the administration and by a handful of telephone \ncompanies.\n  Let me remind our colleagues that when this proposal was first made \nto the Intelligence Committee, the proposal was to grant immunity to \nanyone involved in the collection of this information, including those \nwho allegedly authorized it at the executive branch. So while I am \ncritical of what is in the Intelligence Committee bill that has been \nbrought to us by my friend from West Virginia and my friend from \nMissouri, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, I wish to begin by \nthanking them for having rejected the administration's earlier request \nthat there be broad-based immunity granted to everyone involved in \nwarrantless wiretapping. But it is instructive to know what the \nadministration wanted at the outset: complete immunity for everyone \nassociated with this vacuum-cleaning operation, who eavesdropped on \nmillions of phone conversations, e-mails, and faxes over the last 5 \nyears.\n  Why were they seeking immunity for everyone involved in this? I think \nthe answer becomes abundantly clear. There is a great concern that the \ncourts may conclude that, in fact, what was done was illegal and that \nthose who participated in it might be held liable.\n  Again, I thank the Intelligence Committee for narrowing this request. \nHowever, title II of this bill would still provide telecommunications \ncorporations retroactive immunity for their warrantless and possibly--\npossibly--illegal spying on their very customers.\n  Much more than a few companies and a few lawsuits are at stake. Equal \njustice is at stake--justice that does not place some corporations \noutside of the rule of law.\n  Openness is at stake--an open debate on security and liberty, and an \nend to warrantless wiretapping of Americans.\n  Senator Feingold laid out the history of FISA in eloquent terms this \nafternoon, going back to the 1970s and describing the genesis of this \nlaw that has been amended, I might add, many, many times over the last \n30 years. It has been amended periodically to conform to the emerging \ntechnologies, the emerging abilities of those who would do us harm, and \nthe emerging strategies that would allow us to collect the information \nthat would minimize their ability to do just that.\n  So over the years, this body has been asked to modify that law. \nAlmost without exception, I think it is important to point out, this \nbody has amended that law almost unanimously, because all of us \nrecognize that it is critically important that we have the ability to \ndetermine who would do us harm, how they would do that harm, and to \nstop it before it happens. There is not a single Member of this body \nwho is not deeply committed to that goal. We all understand and are \ndeeply committed to the idea that we ought to do everything we can to \nprotect ourselves. But we also understand, and have since the 1970s, \nthe importance not only of gathering the information from those who \nwould do us injury but simultaneously doing that which is also critical \nfor our survival as a nation; that is, protecting the liberties and \nrights of this country.\n  They are what makes us unique as a nation. We were really the first \nNation that insisted that we were a nation of laws and not men. It was \na unique idea in the annals of recorded history; but at the founding of \nthis great Republic, we declared that we were going to do things \ndifferently. In fact, many have argued over the years that if we were \nlooking for pure efficiency, this is the last form of government we \nwould have designed. But the Framers of our Constitution were \ninterested in other things than just efficiency. Had efficiency been \nthe goal, they certainly would have thought of a more streamlined \nsystem. But they set up a system that not only determined what we did \nbut how we did things: establishing coequal branches of Government--an \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branch--coequal branches of \nGovernment, and insisting that there be checks and balances, because \nthe Framers had been through a system in which a king and a handful of \npeople decided the fate of not only their own nation but the colonies \nthey controlled. So they set up this cumbersome, less efficient system \nbecause they were deeply determined to protect the rule of law that \nnever allowed one individual or a handful of individuals decide the \nfate of a nation.\n  So it is important to understand the genesis of this tension which \nhas existed in our country for more than 200 years: protecting our \nsecurity and protecting our liberties. I am not suggesting that it is \nalways easy to strike the perfect balance, but over the years we have \ntried as a nation, from one generation to the next, to try to keep that \nbalance, that tension, in place so that not one side or the other would \ndominate. In our time, the challenge is to balance our need to gather \ninformation with the protection of privacy and the rights that all \nAmericans seek, regardless of geography or ideology.\n\n  That has been the tension that confronts us and that is what brings \nme to this debate, calling upon my colleagues to support the amendment \nSenator Feingold is offering to strike title II of this legislation.\n  Retroactive immunity stands against the very principles Senator \nFeingold has outlined, which I have tried to describe. Under \nretroactive immunity, the law will forbid some of our fellow citizens \nfrom having their day in court.\n  On what basis are we asked to pass retroactive immunity? On trust. \nThere are classified documents, we are told, that prove the case beyond \nthe shadow of a doubt; but, of course, we are in the allowed to see \nthem. I have served in\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nthis body for 27 years. Yet I am not allowed to see these documents. \nRetroactive immunity allows the President to stand up and say: Trust \nme, I know what I am talking about, and you don't.\n  There is only one way to settle the issue at stake today. Not simply \non trust, not the opinion of a handful of individuals--as much as we \nmay admire or like them--but in our courts. We are not judges. We are \nmembers of a legislative body.\n  Real judges and juries--whose courts ought to be our pride, not our \nembarrassment--deserve to do their jobs and decide these cases. By \nstriking this title of the bill, we would allow them to.\n  That is all we are asking. Let's have the courts decide. We are not \nhere to assign guilt or innocence. That is not our job as legislators. \nWe are here to hold open the courthouse door, to ensure a fair hearing \nto American citizens seeking redress. I, for one, will accept whatever \nverdict results.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue; this is a rule-of-law \nissue. It is about striking the right balance between liberty and \nsecurity. I have absolutely rejected, as I said a few moments ago, the \nfalse dichotomy that tells us to choose one over the other. And If a \nDemocratic President were seeking to grant retroactive immunity, I \nwould object as stridently and passionately as I am this afternoon. \nThis should not be a partisan issue. We should all be in favor of \nallowing our courts to perform their constitutional responsibility to \ndetermine whether these companies should be held accountable.\n  I believe that when surveillance is fully under the rule of law, \nAmericans will only be more secure. To claim otherwise is an insult to \nour intelligence, our common sense, and our proud tradition of law.\n  I don't know how many colleagues have seen the movie called ``A Man \nFor All Seasons.'' It is the story of St. Thomas More, who was the only \nindividual in history that I know of who achieved the trifecta of being \na lawyer, a politician, and a saint--a rare combination in any \ngeneration. In the movie, St. Thomas More was asked if he would be \nwilling to cut down every law in England to get his hands on the devil. \nMore answered: Absolutely not. He said:\n\n       When the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on \n     you, where would you hide, the laws all being flat? This \n     country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast--\n     Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down . . . do you \n     really think you could stand upright in the winds that would \n     blow then?\n\n  Those laws know no secrecy, Madam President, they know no \ndistinctions for power or wealth. They live, that is, in openness. And \nwhen that openness has been defended, when the facts are in light, \nwhere they belong, I welcome all my colleagues' ideas in the great and \nongoing debate on security and liberty in this century--a debate in the \nopen, and open to us all.\n  It can begin by adopting this amendment striking retroactive \nimmunity. We can allow the courts to do their jobs to determine whether \nwhat happened was legal.\n  There are those who would argue the telecoms' actions were legal--but \nnone of us know that for sure. If we don't adopt this amendment, we \nwill never know. Whatever happened will be buried for all of history. \nWe will have set the precedent that on the mere word or request of the \nadministration--or any future administration--that telecommunications \ncompanies, or others who can collect millions of volumes of data about \nus, will be allowed to turn it over to the federal government. Maybe \nthe next time it will be medical records or financial records that all \nof us would like to think are held private--maybe those records, under \nsome argument, will be handed over.\n  When does this stop? When do we say there is a legal means by which \nwe do this? That has been what FISA has tried to establish for the last \nthree decades--to strike that balance between liberty and security. If \nwe set a precedent with the rejection of this amendment, we open the \ndoor, regretfully, for not only this administration but future ones to \nengage in the very practice that would deprive us of that balance \nbetween liberty and security.\n  So when the vote occurs tomorrow on this amendment that Senator \nFeingold and I have offered, I urge my colleagues to step out of their \npartisan roles and consider the example we are setting.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that the President suggested he would \nveto the FISA legislation if this amendment passes. The idea that an \nAmerican President would suggest that we ought to put aside the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act merely to protect a handful of companies \nwho seek immunity, and to deny us the opportunity to determine whether \nwhat they did was legal, seems to go far beyond what we need to be \ndoing at this hour, where our security is at risk, as we all know.\n  The best way to handle this, in my view, is to accept and adopt this \namendment and send the FISA bill to the President for signature. I \nbelieve that despite his warnings to the contrary, he will sign this \ninto law. I don't want to believe an American President would put us at \nrisk and deny these courts the ability to grant warrants and court \norders to gather the information we need to keep us secure, all to \nprotect a few corporations from lawsuits.\n  I have said this repeatedly over the past several months, but it \ndeserves repeating. Not all the telephone companies complied with that \nrequest. If they all had, it might strengthen their arguments. But in \nthe end, this is a Republic: the President cannot order us to break the \nlaw. And the argument that orders from on high excuse illegal behavior \nhas been thoroughly debunked.\n  Remember, when one telecom, Qwest, asked for a court order to justify \ncooperation with the President's surveillance program, it never \nreceived one. That ought to be instructive. Why wasn't the court order \nforthcoming? Why didn't the Administration go to the FISA Courts, which \nwere created exactly for that purpose? Why did some companies say no \nwhen others said yes?\n  For all of these reasons, and the ones eloquently posed by Senator \nFeingold, we urge our colleagues to accept this amendment. Let the \ncourts do their work and determine the legality or illegality of these \nactions.\n  If we are able to do that, I think we will strengthen our country and \ncome closer to maintaining that balance between security and the rule \nof law that generations throughout our Nation's history have struggled \nwith, doing their utmost to maintain that healthy balance.\n  To reject this amendment, I think, destroys that balance, does great \ndamage to it. I think we will regret that in the years to come.\n  With that, I yield the floor to others who may want to be heard on \nthis amendment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3927\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, one of the amendments before us is the \nSpecter-Whitehouse amendment to title II of the FISA Amendments Act of \n2007. I urge our colleagues to support the Specter-Whitehouse amendment \nfor the following reasons:\n  Title II of the bill, as currently written, provides retroactive \nimmunity for telecommunications providers who disclosed communications \nand other confidential information about their customers at the behest \nof administration officials. These provisions in the bill before the \nSenate require the immediate dismissal of any lawsuit against a \ntelecommunications provider based on such disclosure if the Attorney \nGeneral certifies that an appropriate Government official indicated in \nwriting to the provider that the activity was, one, authorized by the \nPresident, and, two, determined to be lawful. It is the words \n``determined to be lawful'' that create the problem. Determined by \nwhom?\n  The way the bill is written, a determination of the Department of \nJustice or intelligence community officials is sufficient to ensure \nimmunity even if the courts would conclude that the activity was \nillegal. Dismissal would be\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nrequired even if a court would conclude that the disclosure violated \nthe constitutional rights of individuals whose personal information was \nillegally disclosed. It would be required even if innocent American \ncitizens were damaged by the disclosure or by the compromise of \nconfidential personal information.\n  The provision in the bill before us granting retroactive immunity is \nnot necessary, it is not wise, and it is not fair. Retroactive immunity \nis not necessary to ensure the future cooperation of the \ntelecommunications providers who receive legitimate requests for \ninformation from the intelligence community. In fact, Congress has \nalready ensured such cooperation in the Protect America Act adopted \nlast August which authorizes the Attorney General or the Director of \nNational Intelligence to direct telecommunications providers to \ndisclose certain information, and that law provides prospective \nimmunity to telecommunications who cooperate with such directives.\n  Title I of the bill before us appropriately continues to provide \nprospective immunity to telecommunications providers. Title I states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, no cause of action shall lie \n     in any court against any electronic communication service \n     provider for providing any information, facilities, or \n     assistance in accordance with a directive issued by the \n     Attorney General or the Director of National Intelligence \n     pursuant to the act.\n\n  In light of this prospective immunity, which is appropriately in the \nbill, retroactive immunity is not necessary to ensure the future \ncooperation of telecommunications providers with legitimate requests \nfor information from the intelligence community.\n  A retroactive immunity is not wise either because it precludes any \njudicial review of these important issues. If private parties engaged \nin illegal activities at the request of senior executive branch \nofficials, that may be an appropriate mitigating factor to be \nconsidered in the courts. But to simply grant immunity retroactively \nmay encourage others to engage in illegal activities in the future. \nThat is a bad precedent because it should never be an excuse in a free \nsociety that you acted illegally because Government officials asked you \nto do so.\n  That leaves the question of equity for telecommunications providers \nwho may have cooperated with administration officials in good faith \nwith the assurance that such cooperation was legal and that they were \nhelping to safeguard our national security.\n  If one had to choose between a known equitable interest of the \ntelecommunications providers who was prevailed upon in the aftermath of \n9/11 to assist the Government by disclosing private customer \ncommunications without first conforming with the clear requirement of \nthe FISA law for a warrant approved by the FISA Court before doing so, \nif--if--one had to choose between that equitable interest and the \nperhaps uncertain claims of plaintiffs whose conversations may have \nbeen eavesdropped upon without their knowledge and with little, if any, \nprovable damage, one might reach the conclusion that retroactive \nimmunity was an appropriate remedy for the telephone companies.\n  But we do not have to make that choice. We can recognize both the \nequitable interest of the companies and the possible claims of our \ncitizens, and we can also avoid the terrible precedent of giving \nretroactive immunity to law violators. We can do that by adopting the \nSpecter-Whitehouse amendment.\n  How can we protect the telecommunications providers from legal \nliability if they acted in good faith at the request of the \nadministration without taking the extraordinary step of retroactively \neliminating any remedy for possible violations of the Constitution and \nthe laws of the United States? The Specter-Whitehouse amendment before \nus would accomplish that by immunizing telecommunications providers who \nacted in good faith based on the assurances of appropriate \nadministration officials from legal liability and at the same time \nsubstituting the United States for the telecommunications providers as \nthe defendant in lawsuits based on the actions of those providers. That \nsubstitution would safeguard telecommunications providers from \nliability just as effectively as the retroactive immunity language in \ntitle II of the bill.\n  But unlike the retroactive immunity language of title II the Specter-\nWhitehouse amendment would not leave persons who can prove they were \nvictims of unlawful or unconstitutional actions without a remedy. On \nthe contrary, the Specter-Whitehouse amendment would ensure that any \nsuch innocent victims retain whatever legal rights they have under \napplicable law, except that the U.S. Government would be substituted \nfor the telecommunications providers as the defendant in such lawsuits. \nAnd it is appropriate that the Government be liable rather than the \ntelecommunications providers since the disclosures were allegedly made \nby the providers in these cases at the request of senior executive \nbranch officials based on appeals to help safeguard U.S. security and \nassurances that the providers would be protected from liability \nregardless of the requirements of law.\n  The argument has been made that we must provide retroactive immunity \nto the telecommunications providers to ensure the cases against them \nare immediately dismissed because if the cases are permitted to \nproceed, vital national security information will be disclosed. Some \nhave even taken the position that the mere existence of this \nlitigation, even without the disclosure of any information, will \nsomehow help the terrorists. But the President has already disclosed \nthe existence of the collection program at issue. It has been discussed \nin Congress and in the press. The Director of National Intelligence has \npublicly discussed the program.\n  Nor will the continuation into the future of cases against \ntelecommunications providers or the U.S. Government, should the \nGovernment be substituted as the Specter-Whitehouse amendment would \nprovide as a defendant, that would not make public sensitive collection \nmethods. That is because the courts have numerous tools at their \ndisposal to safeguard sensitive classified information from disclosure \nduring the course of a trial and courts have used these tools \nthroughout our history. Federal courts utilize these tools without \ncompromising the national security when our Government chooses to \nprosecute terrorists or spies.\n\n  Indeed, the recently enacted Military Commissions Act provides the \nsame tools for the protection of classified information in cases \nbrought against alleged terrorists in the military justice system. U.S. \ncitizens who are allegedly damaged at the Government's behest surely \nshould be given as much protection as alleged terrorists.\n  The administration's willingness to utilize these procedures to \nsafeguard sensitive classified information in the prosecution of \nalleged terrorists, but not in suits brought for the protection of the \nrights of American citizens, gives the appearance that retroactive \nimmunity is being sought under this bill as it now stands, not to \nprotect classified information but, rather, to protect the \nadministration itself.\n  The bottom line is we can protect telecommunications providers from \nliability for unlawful or unconstitutional disclosures made in good \nfaith reliance on written assurances by high-ranking executive branch \nofficials without retroactively depriving alleged victims of such \ndisclosures of any remedy, if they can demonstrate they have been \ndamaged by illegal practices. The Specter-Whitehouse amendment would \nenable us to deal fairly with both telecommunications providers and \nwith persons who can prove they were damaged by illegal disclosures of \ntheir personal information. I urge our colleagues to support the \nSpecter-Whitehouse amendment as the fair way of protecting both \ntelecommunications providers but also protecting what should be a very \nbasic principle of our Constitution--you cannot and should not \nneedlessly remove a remedy from people who have been injured. To do \nthat retroactively runs contrary to everything we believe in this \nConstitution about the rights of American citizens to be protected and \nto have remedies when they are wronged.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3941\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, last week the Senate adopted, by voice \nvote, amendment No. 3941 offered by the vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, which would require the FISA Court to rule on \nchallenges to the Government's directives within a specified timeframe. \nI opposed the\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\namendment because it unnecessarily restricts the court's ability to \nconsider important constitutional and statutory issues related to this \nlegislation. The amendment limits the time for the court's \nconsideration of challenges to directives issued under this law to a \nmere 30 days, unless ``necessary to comport with the due process clause \nof the Fifth Amendment.'' There would be no other basis for the court \nto extend its deliberations to a 31st day.\n  This amendment could have serious unintended consequences. There may \nbe many decisions that the court can, in fact, make in a relatively \nshort period of time. But there may also be issues that the court will \nhave to consider that could take longer. There have been many questions \nraised about the meaning of many of the provisions of this bill. The \ncourt will certainly be required to address some of these complex \nstatutory interpretation issues. There have also been serious \nconstitutional concerns raised about this bill that the court will need \nto consider.\n  This is new legislation that radically changes how surveillance is \nconducted, and there are numerous complex issues that the court will be \ncalled on to resolve. And, unlike this body, the court will have to \nconsider in detail the legality and constitutionality of the law as it \nis implemented, which could involve extensive factual development, as \nwell as review of relevant precedent.\n  There are many other reasons why the court would want to extend its \ndeliberations that would not implicate fifth amendment due process \nrights. A party may seek more time to prepare its pleadings. The court \nmay request more information. The Government may wish to prioritize \nother more pressing issues or may have a host of strategic reasons for \nseeking delay; or a crisis or national emergency could require the \nimmediate attention of the intelligence personnel and lawyers assigned \nto present the Government's case to the court and could occupy the \ncourt's time and attention. Under those circumstances, we would surely \nwant the court to focus its attention on the emergency at hand. But if \nthere were also a pending challenge to a directive that the court must \ndecide in just 30 days, it could be faced in a terrible dilemma. And \nonly permitting the court to extend its consideration of a challenge if \na refusal to do so rises to the level of a violation of the fifth \namendment is far too restrictive.\n  I would also think there might be some concern that if the court does \nnot have enough time to decide whether to enforce a directive issued by \nthe Government, it could very well simply decide not to.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has made many of these \nsame arguments in a letter sent today to Senators Reid and McConnell. \nThe conference warns that the amendment could limit the court's ability \nto consider complex issues or could force the court to divert its \nattention from other pressing matters. Indeed, the letter warns that \n``the national security significance of the cases before the FISC means \nthere is a chance this provision could force the FISC by statute to \nforego consideration of another matter of paramount importance.''\n  This amendment could seriously shortchange the court's ability to \ndetermine whether the Government is acting legally or whether the bill \nis constitutional, on its face or as implemented in a particular \nsituation. For that reason, I opposed this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3913\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the bill we are now considering will \nprovide an enormous expansion of the government's ability to conduct \nwarrantless surveillance. I support providing our intelligence agencies \nwith the flexibility they need to surveil foreign targets that may be \nintending us harm, but we must be similarly vigilant in making certain \nthat this surveillance is limited to its intended scope.\n  I commend Senator Feingold in crafting an amendment that would \nprohibit what is known as ``reverse targeting'' and would ensure that \nthis new surveillance is directed only toward its overseas targets and \nnot toward surveillance of innocent Americans without a court order. \nThe Intelligence Committee's bill, S. 2248, requires the government to \nseek an order from the FISA Court only when ``the'' purpose of the \ngovernment's acquisition is the targeting of Americans inside of the \nUnited States. I fear that the government will read into this language \na loophole and it may justify eavesdropping on American's private \ncommunications, without any court order, as long as they have some \ninterest in an overseas ``target,'' even if a significant purpose of \nthe interception is to collect the communications of a person in the \nUnited States. Is this fear legitimate? I think so, given this \nadministration's history of convoluted, disingenuous legal \ninterpretation. We must be clear in our language, because we know what \nthey will do if we are not.\n  Senator Feingold's provision would clarify that if the government \nintercepts the communications of a person overseas but ``a significant \npurpose'' of the surveillance is to collect the communications of the \nU.S. person with whom the person overseas is communicating, the \ngovernment must get a court order. This is an important distinction. In \nlight of the sweeping powers we are granting to the government to \nconduct surveillance without up front court review, we must also cabin \nthe scope of the government's power to eavesdrop on the communications \nof innocent Americans.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3915\n\n   The authorities and procedures in S. 2248 would permit the FISA \nCourt to review government targeting and minimization procedures. If, \nhowever, the Court finds certain aspects of those procedures to be \ninadequate--even grossly inadequate--S. 2248 provides no authority to \nrestrict the use of information already collected using those \nprocedures. That means that the government would be free to access, \nuse, and share information about private communications that was \ncollected in violation of the law.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment would ensure that the Court has the \nauthority to stop a continuation, and perhaps escalation, of the harm \ncaused by the government's use of illegal procedures. This provision \nwould limit the government's use and dissemination of illegally \nobtained information if the FISA Court later determines that the \nprocedures were not reasonably designed to target people outside of the \nUnited States or to adequately minimize the use of information about \nU.S. persons. It is important to note that, under this provision, if \nthe government acts to address the Court's concerns and correct these \nprocedures it would then be free to use and disseminate the information \nit acquired.\n  This is not a novel application of law under FISA. FISA's existing \nemergency provision holds that if the government begins emergency \nsurveillance without a warrant, and the FISA Court then determines the \nsurveillance to be unlawful, the government cannot use and disseminate \nthe information it acquired except under very limited circumstances. \nSenator Feingold's amendment simply applies these reasonable safeguards \nto the new and broadly expanded authority we are now giving to the \ngovernment. This provision represents a crucial safeguard for the \nprotection of Americans' privacy rights.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3927\n\n  I strongly oppose the blanket grant of retroactive immunity in the \nIntelligence Committee bill. This administration violated FISA by \nconducting warrantless surveillance for more than 5 years. They got \ncaught. If they had not, they would probably still be doing it. In the \nwake of the public disclosure of the President's illegal surveillance \nof Americans, the administration and the telephone companies are being \nsued by citizens who believe their privacy and constitutional rights \nhave been violated. Now, the administration is trying to force Congress \nto terminate those lawsuits in order to insulate itself from \naccountability. We should not allow this to happen.\n  The administration knows that these lawsuits may be the only way that \nit will ever be called to account for its flagrant disrespect for the \nrule of law. In running its illegal program of warrantless \nsurveillance, the administration, relying on legal opinions prepared in \nsecret and shown to only a tiny group of like-minded officials, ensured \nthe administration received the advice they wanted. Jack Goldsmith, who \ncame in briefly to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel described the program as a ``legal\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nmess.'' This administration does not want a court to have the chance to \nlook at this legal mess. Retroactive immunity would assure that they \nget their wish.\n  The Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee tried for well \nover a year and a half to obtain access to the information that our \nmembers needed to evaluate the administration's arguments for immunity. \nIndeed, over a year ago Chairman Specter was prepared to proceed to \nsubpoena information from the telephone companies in light of the \nadministration's stonewalling. It was only just before the Intelligence \nand Judiciary Committees' consideration of this bill that committee \nmembers finally obtained access to a limited number of these documents. \nSenators who have reviewed the information have drawn very different \nconclusions.\n  Now this matter is before all Senators and it is well past time for \nall Members to have access to the information they need to make \ninformed judgments about the provisions of these bills. The majority \nleader wrote to the administration stating that Members of the Senate \nneed that access. We have had no response--the administration has \nignored the request. It is clear that they do not want to allow \nSenators to appropriately evaluate these documents and draw their own \nconclusions.\n  There are reports in the press that at least one telecommunications \ncarrier refused to comply with the administration's request to \ncooperate with the warrantless wiretapping. All Senators should have \nthe opportunity to know these facts, so they can make an informed \njudgment about whether there were legitimate legal concerns that other \ncooperating telecommunications companies should have raised. Indeed, if \nother carriers had been more careful in their legal analysis, and had \nraised these concerns, would the administration have had a greater \nincentive to come to the Congress and get the law changed? Would we \nhave been spared five long years of illegal behavior by this \nadministration?\n  I have drawn very different conclusions than Senator Rockefeller \nabout retroactive immunity. I agree with Senator Specter and many \nothers that blanket retroactive immunity, which would end ongoing \nlawsuits by legislative fiat, undermines accountability. Senator \nSpecter has been working diligently first as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and now as its ranking member to obtain judicial \nreview of the legality of the warrantless wiretapping of Americans from \n2001 into last year. The check and balance the judiciary provides in \nour constitutional democracy has an important role to play and should \nbe protected. Judicial review can and should provide a measure of \naccountability.\n  We hear from the administration and some of our colleagues that we \nmust grant immunity or the telephone companies will no longer cooperate \nwith the Government. Senators should understand that even if we do not \ngrant retroactive immunity, telecommunications carriers will still have \nimmunity for actions they take in the future. Their cooperation in the \nfuture will still be required by legal orders and they will not be \nsubject to liability for doing what the law requires. If they follow \nthe law, they have immunity.\n  We have heard some people argue that the telephone companies should \nget immunity because they complied with the Government's requests to \nengage in warrantless surveillance out of patriotism. I do not doubt \nthe patriotism of the executives and employees of these companies, but \nthis month we learned that these companies cut off wiretaps, including \nwiretaps of terrorists, because the FBI failed to pay its telephone \nbills. How can this administration talk repeatedly, on the one hand, \nabout the importance of FISA surveillance, and on the other hand, fail \nto pay its phone bills and jeopardize this critical surveillance. But \nbeyond that, the fact that carriers were willing to cut off \nsurveillance when they were not paid--presumably some of the same \ncarriers that agreed to conduct warrantless surveillance--undercuts the \nargument about their patriotic motives.\n  As one former FBI special agent has said, ``It sounds as though the \ntelecoms believe it when the FBI says the warrant is in the mail, but \nnot when they say the check is in the mail.''\n  I believe the rule of law is important in protecting the rights of \nAmericans from unlawful surveillance. I do not believe that Congress \ncan or should seek to take those rights and those claims from those \nalready harmed. Moreover, ending ongoing litigation eliminates perhaps \nthe only viable avenue of accountability for the Government's illegal \nactions. Therefore, I say again: I oppose blanket retroactive immunity.\n  I do support and will vote for the amendment that Senators Specter \nand Whitehouse will offer on ``substitution.'' This amendment would \nplace the Government in the shoes of the private defendants that acted \nat its behest and let it assume full responsibility for illegal \nconduct. The Specter-Whitehouse amendment contains an explicit waiver \nof sovereign immunity, which will allow the lawsuits to proceed against \nthe United States, and it makes other changes designed to assure that \nthe Government does not have advantages as a defendant that the \ncarriers would not have. While I see no need to deal with the issue of \nlawsuits against the providers in this Congress, I believe that \nsubstitution is a fairer means of dealing with these lawsuits than full \nretroactive immunity, because it would give the plaintiffs their day in \ncourt, and it would allow for a measure of accountability for the \nadministration's actions in the years following 9/11.\n  This administration violated FISA by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance for more than 5 years. They got caught, and the \ntelecommunications carriers got sued. Now, the administration insists \nthat those lawsuits be terminated by Congress, so that it does not have \nto answer for its actions. Retroactive immunity does more than let the \ncarriers off the hook. It shields this administration from any \naccountability for conducting surveillance outside of the law. It would \nstop dead in their tracks the lawsuits that are now working their way \nthrough the courts, and leave Americans whose privacy rights have been \nviolated with no chance to be made whole. These lawsuits are perhaps \nthe only avenue that exists for an outside review of the Government's \nactions. That kind of assessment is critical if our Government is to be \nheld accountable. That is why I do not support legislation to terminate \nthese legal challenges and I will vote to strike it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nBanking Committee's action on S. 2062, the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2007. Senator \nShelby and I agreed to discharge this bill from the Banking Committee, \nwith an amendment, to help move the bill along.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the Native American Housing and Self-\nDetermination Act, NAHASDA, which provides critical funds for housing \nNative Americans who suffer significant and unique housing problems. \nAccording to HUD data, almost one-third of Native Americans have severe \nhousing burdens. They live in overcrowded conditions, lack basic \nplumbing and utilities, or pay over half of their income for their \nhousing costs. NAHASDA is the primary way that Indian tribes are \nassisted in addressing these critical housing needs.\n  The amendment drafted by Senator Shelby and I includes a provision to \nclarify that this bill should not interfere with ongoing court cases \nregarding funding allocations. I want to acknowledge the contributions \nof Senators Tester and Enzi in working on this provision. In addition, \nthe amendment helps to retain the requirements that funds be used for \nthose Native Americans in the worst housing situations and that funds \ncontinue to be used to increase affordable housing opportunities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to quickly pass S. 2062 \nas amended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S845-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S845-S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SCHOOL SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has now been nearly 10 months since the \nhorrific incident at Virginia Tech resulted in the tragic deaths of 32 \nstudents and faculty members, and serious injuries to many other \ninnocent victims. During that time, we have witnessed a barrage of new \nincidents involving threatening conduct and, too often, deadly acts of \nviolence at our schools and college campuses nationwide.\n  Just in the last few days tragedy has struck at one of our Nation's \nhigh schools and on a university campus. Today's press reports indicate \nthat a student at Mitchell High School in Memphis, TN, is in critical \ncondition after a violent incident in the school's cafeteria. Just this \npast Friday, a female student killed two other women, and then herself, \ninside a classroom on the campus of Louisiana Technical College in \nBaton Rouge. This terrible incident could easily have been even more \ndeadly: there were nearly 20 people in the classroom at the time.\n  The Senate has so far failed to take up and pass the School Safety \nand Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007, S. 2084, which the \nJudiciary Committee reported last September to help improve school \nsafety. This comprehensive legislation should be considered and passed \nwithout further delay.\n  In originating the bill over 6 months ago, the Judiciary Committee \nshowed deference to Governor Tim Kaine and the task forces at work in \nVirginia, and sought to complement their work and recommendations. \nWorking with several Senators, including Senators Boxer, Reed, Specter, \nFeingold, Schumer, and Durbin, the committee originated this bill and \nreported it at the start of the 2007 academic year. My hope was that \nCongress would adopt these critical school safety improvements last \nfall.\n  Since this bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee, we have seen \ntragedy at Louisiana Technical College, Delaware State, University of \nMemphis, SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, OH, as well as incidents in \nCalifornia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, to name just a few. I, \nagain, urge the Senate to proceed to consider this comprehensive \npackage of school safety measures. It includes sensible yet effective \nsafety improvement measures supported by law enforcement across the \ncountry. We should be doing all that we can to help.\n  Last October, a troubled student wearing a Fred Flintstone mask and \ncarrying a rifle through campus was arrested at St. John's University \nin Queens, NY, prompting authorities to lock down the campus for 3 \nhours. The day after that incident, an armed 17-\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nyear-old on the other side of the country in Oroville, CA, held \nstudents hostage at Las Plumas High School, also resulting in a lock-\ndown. Around that same time, an armed student suspected of plotting a \nColumbine-style attack on fellow high school students was arrested in \nNorristown, PA. The students in these situations were lucky and escaped \nwithout injury.\n  University of Memphis student Taylor Bradford was not so lucky. He \nwas killed on campus last September in what university officials \nbelieve was a targeted attack. He was 21 years old. Shalita Middleton \nwas not so lucky. She died last October from injuries she sustained \nduring the Delaware State incident. She was 17 years old. Nathaniel Pew \nwas not so lucky. He was wounded at Delaware State. High school \nteachers Michael Grassie and David Kachadourian and students Michael \nPeek and Darnell Rodgers--all of whom were wounded by a troubled \nstudent at SuccessTech Academy last October--were not so lucky. And the \ntwo female students killed this past Friday in Baton Rouge were not so \nlucky.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act responds \ndirectly to incidents like these by addressing the problem of violence \nin our schools in several ways. The bill authorizes Federal assistance \nfor programs to improve the safety and security of our schools and \ninstitutions of higher education, provides equitable benefits to law \nenforcement serving those institutions including bulletproof vests, and \nfunds pilot programs to develop cutting-edge prevention and \nintervention programs for our schools. The bill also clarifies and \nstrengthens two existing statutes--the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act \nand the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act--which are designed to \nimprove public safety.\n  Specifically, the bill would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced last April, and I want to thank \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this issue. The improvements include \nincreased funding for much-needed infrastructure changes to improve \nsecurity as well as the establishment of hotlines and tip-lines, which \nwill enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to \nschool administrators before they occur.\n  These improvements can save lives. After the four students and \nteachers were wounded at SuccessTech Academy, the press reported that \nparents had been petitioning to get a metal detector installed and \nadditional security personnel added, and that the guard who was \npreviously assigned to the school had been removed 3 years ago. In \nfact, at the time, the entire city of Cleveland had just 10 metal \ndetectors that rotated throughout the city's more than 100 schools. \nTitle I of the bill would enhance the ability of school districts to \napply for and receive grant money to fund the installation of metal \ndetectors and the training and hiring of security personnel to keep our \nkids safe.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of Virginia \nTech and more recent college incidents, title I also creates a matching \ngrant program for campus safety and security to be administered out of \nthe COPS Office of the Department of Justice. The grant program would \nallow institutions of higher education to apply, for the first time, \ndirectly for Federal funds to make school safety and security \nimprovements. The program is authorized to be appropriated at \n$50,000,000 for the next 2 fiscal years. While this amounts to just $3 \nper student each year, it will enable schools to more effectively \nrespond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  The bill would also make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits, and for funds administered under the \nByrne Grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program. \nProviding this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. I \ncommend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area.\n  The bill helps law enforcement by making improvements to the Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, LEOSA. These amendments to \nexisting law will streamline the system by which qualified retired and \nactive officers can be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we \npermit qualified officers, with a demonstrated commitment to law \nenforcement and no adverse employment history, to protect themselves, \ntheir families, and their fellow citizens wherever those officers may \nbe.\n  The bill focuses on prevention as well, by incorporating the \nPRECAUTION Act at the request of Senators Feingold and Specter. This \nprovision authorizes grants to develop prevention and intervention \nprograms for our schools.\n  Finally, the bill incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of \n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  The Senate should move forward and act. The Virginia Tech Review \nPanel--a body commissioned by Governor Kaine to study the Virginia Tech \ntragedy--recently issued its findings based on a 4-month long \ninvestigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill would adopt \na number of recommendations from the Review Panel aimed at improving \nschool safety. We must not miss this opportunity to implement these \ninitiatives nationwide, and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety \nof our kids. I hope the Senate will promptly move forward to invest in \nthe safety of our students and better support law enforcement officers \nacross the country by considering and passing the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S846-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S846-S847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n             INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT-ELECT LEE MYUNG-BAK\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, in just 2 weeks President-elect Lee \nMyung-bak will be inaugurated as the next President of South Korea. His \ninauguration offers a fresh opportunity to reaffirm and reinvigorate \nthe U.S.-South Korea relationship for a new era.\n  The U.S.-ROK alliance has been a remarkably strong and successful \none. Forged in blood during the Korean war more than a half-century \nago, the alliance has sustained itself through the crucible of the cold \nwar and remains central to U.S. security policy in East Asia. Our bonds \nhave only deepened through the extensive social and cultural ties that \nhave formed between our two countries, including 100,000 Americans who \nlive in Korea, and the 2 million Korean-Americans who enrich our \nsociety through their classic American ethic of hard work, strong \nfamilies, and tight-knit church communities.\n  Nonetheless, I do not think it is an overstatement to say that the \nU.S.-Korea relationship has been adrift in recent years. At the heart \nof it have been our respective approaches to North Korea. The Bush \nadministration has been divided within itself on how to deal with \nPyongyang, branding it a member of the ``Axis of Evil'' and refusing \nbilateral discussions with it before subsequently reversing course. \nThis unsteady approach not only has allowed North Korea to expand its \nnuclear arsenal as it has resumed reprocessing of plutonium and tested \na nuclear device. It also has understandably caused anxiety in South \nKorea, as its leaders and people have tried to figure out what the Bush \nadministration policy is.\n  I have no illusions about North Korea, and we must be firm and \nunyielding in our commitment to a nonnuclear Korean peninsula. In the \nprocess we must pay attention to the interests of the South Korean \npeople to ensure that we move forward in unity and common purpose.\n  The U.S.-Korea economic relationship has also benefited both nations \nand deepened our ties. I look forward as well to supporting ways to \nincrease our bilateral trade and investment ties through agreements \npaying proper attention to our key industries and agricultural sectors, \nsuch as autos, rice, and beef, and to protection of labor and \nenvironmental standards. Regrettably,\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nthe U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement does not meet this standard.\n  Given the importance of getting this relationship right I would \nencourage President Bush to invite President Lee to the White House as \nearly as possible after his inauguration as a signal of the commitment \nof the United States to the alliance, and to reaffirm the importance of \nthe alliance to the United States. In the process, we need to work with \nSouth Korea on a common vision for the alliance to meet the challenges \nof the 21st century, not only those on the Korean Peninsula but in the \nregion and beyond.\n  An alliance that once was built solely on defense against common \nthreats must today be built also on our shared values and strong mutual \ninterests. I congratulate President-elect Lee on his election, pass on \nmy good wishes for him and the Korean people for his inauguration, and \nhonor the Korean people for their vibrant democracy. I look forward to \nthe opportunity to work with him in the years ahead to replenish and \nrevitalize this crucial relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S847-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the December 24, 2007, ``Year in \nPictures'' edition of Sports Illustrated featured a mud-soaked and \nelated Brandon Day on the cover. Day is a junior linebacker for the \nFighting Saints of Carroll College in my hometown of Helena, MT. This \namazing image was captured by photographer John Russell following the \nFighting Saints fifth National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics \nfootball title in the past six seasons on December 15, 2007, in \nSavannah, TN.\n  The story of this team and the cover photo on Sports Illustrated has \nreally moved me. With all the negative stories recently in the sports \nworld, it was both heartening and appropriate for the magazine to honor \nthe spirit of intercollegiate athletics by shining the spotlight on \nsuch a hard-working and deserving group of student athletes. The young \nmen that make up Carroll's football squad truly embody the best of \nthese ideals and Montana values. They have worked hard both on and off \nthe field and have achieved not only athletic glory, but also success \nin the classroom and have given much back to the Helena community and \ntheir hometowns. Coming from small towns across Montana and the West, \nthese student athletes certainly don't demand or expect this kind of \nrecognition for their achievements, but they certainly are worthy of \nthe praise. This group of young men are great ambassadors for the \ncollege they so proudly represent and are terrific role models for \ntheir fellow students and the many younger kids who look up to them.\n  This strength of character is certainly a tribute to their fine and \ncaring coach, Mike Van Diest, who has taught his players that devotion \nto school, family, and faith come before football. He demands \nexcellence from his players both on and off the field, as does the \npresident of the school, Dr. Thomas Trebon. Dr. Trebon recently wrote a \nletter to Sports Illustrated that tells the story of the Fighting \nSaints. I thank Dr. Trebon for all of his hard work and leadership at \nCarroll College, and I look forward to cheering on the Saints again in \n2008. I know that they will continue to make Montana proud.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have the letter from Dr. Trebon printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n       Dear Sports Illustrated: All of Montana is thrilled by the \n     SI ``2007 Pictures of the Year'' front cover featuring \n     Carroll College junior linebacker Brandon Day's euphoric \n     reaction to the Fighting Saints' fifth NAIA National Football \n     Championship win.\n       The untold story about the Saints found honest reflection \n     in the SI cover photo, with Day and his victorious teammates \n     soaked in mud while overcome with joy. It's a story about \n     humble happiness through hard work, where every standout \n     member of the Saints who receives recognition promptly points \n     to his teammates as the real reason for their success. It's \n     the story of Fighting Saint Luke DenHerder, who returned to \n     the gridiron after beating a lethal cancer, while his fellow \n     student-athletes cheered him and even shaved their heads in \n     solidarity during his chemotherapy. It's the story of a team \n     comprised of men hailing primarily from rural Western towns, \n     ranches and farms, from struggling middle-class families, who \n     know the meaning of hard work and who haven't seen much glory \n     in return. Until now.\n       Carroll's story is about two-time NAIA National Coach of \n     the Year (2003 and 2005) Mike Van Diest, who led the Saints \n     to all five national championship wins, all while demanding \n     that our athletes' priorities must be God first, family \n     second, school third and football last. Indeed, the press \n     corps following our team to Tennessee took more photos of our \n     players studying for their final exams and volunteer reading \n     to school children in Savannah, Tenn., than engaged in pre-\n     game practice. This fall, seven Fighting Saints were named \n     national Daktronics-NAIA Football Scholar-Athletes, the team \n     maintains a grade point average over 3.2, and nearly half of \n     our football squad is selected yearly as All-Academic \n     honorees in the Frontier Conference. Yet, the true story \n     about the Saints was told before the clock ran out during the \n     championship game. After each play, our Carroll student-\n     athletes showed their commitment to sportsmanship by helping \n     their opponents up from tackles and shaking hands with the \n     University of Sioux Falls players.\n       In these days when more of us long for a return to civility \n     and yearn to see our star athletes and athletic programs meet \n     the high standards of role models, SI's cover photo was \n     distinctly gratifying. In one shot, photographer John Russell \n     captured both a moment of athletic triumph and distilled our \n     dream of bringing back the values of simpler times, when good \n     men from humble beginnings win out in the end and become \n     heroes.\n                                                    Thomas Trebon,\n     President, Carroll College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S847-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME 2008\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am proud to be involved for a \nsecond year in the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme, an \nexchange program in which outstanding college students from Australia's \ntop universities compete to serve as interns for the U.S. Congress. The \nprogram is in its ninth year of bringing the Washington experience to \nour friends from Australia, firsthand. In addition to working in \ncongressional offices, the program provides students with a number of \nother opportunities and activities, including visits to historic sites, \nvisits to government agencies, meetings with government leaders, and \neducational events.\n  This year, Suzi Allan, a student from the University of Canberra, \nAustralia, is taking a 2-month hiatus from her communications degree to \nhelp me serve Idaho constituents. Of the program, Suzi says, ``The \nUCWIP has given me the unique opportunity to gain firsthand insight \ninto the world's most influential government. I have had incredible \nexperiences while working in Senator Crapo's office and have enjoyed \nlearning more about the U.S. Congress.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak today \nto recognize an outstanding lifelong resident of South Dakota, Rev. \nWebster Two Hawk.\n  Recently, Reverend Two Hawk marked 50 years of service to his church \nand his faith. His congregation is the St. Peter's Episcopal Church in \nFort Pierre, SD, where he has been a volunteer priest for the last 27 \nyears. Reverend Two Hawk, now retired, has a long list of \naccomplishments throughout his lifetime.\n  Reverend Two Hawk was born and lived near White River, SD, until \ngoing to schools in Todd County. Upon completion of high school in \nMission, SD, now Todd County High School, he attended the University of \nSouth Dakota, my alma mater, where he graduated in 1952 with a degree \nin business administration. Upon leaving college, Two Hawk enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army to serve in the Korean war. Upon his return from service, \nhe attended Kenyon College in Ohio where he graduated\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nwith a master's degree in divinity and was ordained at St. Peter's \nChurch in Lake Andes on the Yankton Sioux Reservation. He served there \n6 years as priest before moving to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation \nfor another 6 years and ultimately returning home to the Rosebud Sioux \nReservation.\n  His return home led him down a different path of service he was \nelected chairman of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. He had many \naccomplishments during his tenure as leader of the tribe; most notably \nwas the opening of Sinte Gleska University in 1971. His desire to serve \nalso led him to work for the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service and \nwas also appointed by former Gov Bill Janklow as the commissioner for \nthe South Dakota Tribal Government Relations Office from 1996 until \n2003. As well, he serves on the board of directors for the Wakpa Sica \nReconciliation Place.\n  Currently, Reverend Two Hawk is working to rebuild the congregation \nin his hometown of White River, SD. I take this opportunity to commend \nRev. Webster Two Hawk for his lifetime of service to his congregation \nand to his tribe. Both are certainly thankful for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S848-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEN HARPER\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish honor Ken Harper, a \nfellow Arkansan who has embraced the spirit of patriotism. Not only has \nhe served our country in the military, but he has created inspirational \npoetry and a special commemorative gift to veterans. Ken Harper has a \nunique talent for writing poetry of a ``military significance'' and \n``significance of character'' that gives inspiration to those who read \nit.\n  Ken Harper proudly served in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. He \nserved a tour of duty with the U.S. Navy beginning in 1979. In 1985, he \nchose to continue his military career by serving in the U.S. Army. \nAfter his military service was completed, Ken still had the desire to \nserve.\n  Inspired by the fallen sailors and marines of Pearl Harbor, Ken \nrequested a few American flags to be flown from military memorials and \nships on behalf of some retired veterans he knew. The success of this \nmotivated him to have more flags flown in dedication of other veterans. \nLater, he would have two special flags he claims as his own raised on \nseveral naval ships and even on board a NASA space ship.\n  Because Ken Harper has selflessly honored so many, today we honor him \nfor his efforts, talents, and service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S848-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S848-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S848-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S848-S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED FEBRUARY 2008 WITH THE ANNUAL \n       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2008--PM 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Over the past 6 years of economic expansion, the American economy has \nproven its strength and resilience. Job creation grew uninterrupted for \na record period of time, inflation remains moderate, unemployment is \nlow, and productivity continues to grow. The economy is built upon a \nstrong foundation, with deep and sophisticated capital markets, \nflexible labor markets, low taxes, and open trade and investment \npolicies.\n  Americans should be confident about the long-term strength of our \neconomy, but our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty, and \nthere are heightened risks to our near-term economic growth. To insure \nagainst these risks, I called upon the Congress to enact a growth \npackage that is simple, temporary, and effective in keeping our economy \ngrowing and our people working.\n  There is more we should do to strengthen our economy. First, we must \nkeep taxes low. Unless the Congress acts, most of the tax relief that \nwe have delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away and 116 \nmillion American taxpayers will see their taxes rise by an average of \n$1,800. The tax relief of the past few years has been a key factor in \npromoting economic growth and job creation and it should be made \npermanent. We must also work together to tackle unfunded obligations in \nentitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I \nhave laid out a detailed plan in my Budget to restrain spending, cut \nearmarks, and balance the budget by 2012 without raising taxes.\n  Second, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of \nhomeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the \nmarket. My Administration has acted aggressively to help credit-worthy \nhomeowners avoid foreclosure. We launched a new initiative called \nFHASecure to help families refinance their homes. I signed legislation \nto protect families from higher taxes when lenders forgive a portion of \ntheir home mortgage debt. We have also brought together the HOPE NOW \nalliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure \nby facilitating the refinancing and modification of mortgages. The \nCongress can do more to help American families keep their homes by \npassing legislation to reform Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, modernize the \nFederal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to \nissue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.\n  Third, we must continue opening new markets for trade and investment. \nWe have an unprecedented opportunity to reduce barriers to global trade \nand investment through a successful Doha round. The Congress should \nalso approve our pending free trade agreements. I thank the Congress \nfor its approval of a good agreement with Peru, and ask for the \napproval of agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These \nagreements will benefit our economy by providing greater access for our \nexports and supporting good jobs for American workers, and they will \npromote America's strategic interests. I have asked the Congress to \nreauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so that we can help \nthose workers who are displaced by trade to learn new skills and find \nnew jobs.\n  Fourth, we must make health care more affordable and accessible for \nall Americans. I have proposed changes in the tax code that would end \nthe bias against those who do not receive health insurance through \ntheir employer and would make it easier for many uninsured Americans to \nobtain insurance. This reform would put private health care coverage \nwithin reach for millions. My Budget also improves access to health \ncare by increasing the power of small employers, civic groups, and \ncommunity organizations to negotiate lower-priced health premiums. \nThese policies would encourage competition among health plans across \nState lines, help reduce frivolous lawsuits that increase patients' \ncosts, and promote the use of health savings accounts.\n  Fifth, we must increase our energy security and confront climate \nchange. Last year, I proposed an ambitious plan to reduce U.S. \ndependence on oil and help cut the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. \nI am pleased that the Congress responded, and I was able to sign into \nlaw a bill that will increase fuel economy and the use of alternative \nfuels, as well as set new efficiency mandates on appliances, light \nbulbs, and Federal Government operations. In my State of the Union \nMessage, I proposed that we take the next steps to accelerate \ntechnological breakthroughs by funding new technologies to generate \ncoal power that captures carbon emissions, advance emissions-free \nnuclear power; and invest in advanced battery technology and renewable \nenergy. I am also committing $2\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nbillion to a new international clean technology fund that will help \ndeveloping nations make greater use of clean energy sources. \nAdditionally, my Budget proposes to protect the economy against oil \nsupply disruptions by doubling the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Finally, a strong and vibrant education system is vital to \nmaintaining our Nation's competitive edge and extending economic \nopportunity to every citizen. Six years ago, we came together to pass \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, and no one can deny its results. Now we \nmust work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for \nStates and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, and \nprovide extra help for struggling schools.\n  Many of these issues are discussed in the 2008 Annual Report of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The application of numerous and significant variations \n     in State law impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and \n     individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance \n     coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly \n     offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by \n     mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate \n     commerce.\n       (3) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to \n     encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual \n     health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by \n     the States in regulating this coverage.\n       (4) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided \n     a successful model for the sale of insurance across State \n     lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance \n     to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 304.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The application of numerous and significant variations \n     in State law impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and \n     individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance \n     coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly \n     offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by \n     mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate \n     commerce.\n       (3) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to \n     encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual \n     health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by \n     the States in regulating this coverage.\n       (4) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided \n     a successful model for the sale of insurance across State \n     lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance \n     to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 304.

I ask unanimous consent to have my name added as a \ncosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was a great honor to serve in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives before coming to the Senate and, during that \ntime, to serve with Tom Lantos of California. His was an extraordinary \nstory of a man who survived the Holocaust and came to the U.S. Congress \nrepresenting a district in the State of California, rising to the rank \nof chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  He was as inspiring a speaker as one could ever hear on many topics \nbut especially on the Holocaust and the impact it had on so many \ninnocent people. He was, more than any other person, a leader in \nacknowledging the bravery and courage of Raoul Wallenberg and so many \nothers who resisted the Holocaust and fought to save the poor victims, \nincluding many Jewish people.\n  Tom Lantos and his wife Annette traveled across the world, speaking \non behalf of the United States and developing strong personal \nrelationships with many leaders overseas. He was truly a great \nrepresentative of the U.S. House of Representatives and of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  A few weeks ago, we were surprised to learn that he was suffering \nfrom cancer and announced he would not be running for reelection. I \ndidn't realize at the time how grave his condition was. His passing \nover the weekend brings a reminder of his service to our country, his \nservice to the State of California, and the loss which those of us who \ncounted him as a friend will endure in these days of mourning.\n  I am happy to join as a cosponsor of this resolution in tribute to \nCongressman Lantos.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 446) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \npending amendment sponsored by Senator Whitehouse and myself. I am \ndelighted to see Senator Whitehouse occupying the chair. I have a \nreceptive, though a limited, audience.\n  I begin by thanking the Senate personnel for staying late. Monday is \na day when I customarily travel the State--Scranton, Harrisburg--and \narrive late in the day. I am pleased to see Senator Dodd is also \nspeaking so that my late arrival is not the sole cause. But we do have \nto work late because the majority leader has scheduled votes on these \nissues tomorrow. I wanted an opportunity to supplement earlier \nstatements which I made on this issue because I believe it is an \nimportant issue on which the Senate needs to focus.\n  The legislation and oversight and judicial review since 9/11 have \nprovided a historic confrontation among the three branches of \nGovernment on the basic doctrine of separation of powers. When I say it \nis historic, I do not believe that is an overstatement. There is no \ndoubt that the events of 9/11 require a vigorous response by the United \nStates to fight terrorism. The brutal, heinous murder of 3,000 \nAmericans and the continuing threat of al-Qaida worldwide require that \nwe fight terrorism with great vigor. At the same time, it is important \nthat constitutional rights be maintained. The fact is that the Congress \nhas been very ineffective in limiting the expansion of Executive power. \nOnly the courts have been able to maintain a balance.\n  The specific issue involves the effort to give the telephone \ncompanies retroactive immunity and foreclose some 40 lawsuits in some \nFederal court which are pending at the present time. There is no doubt \nthat the information reportedly obtained by the telephone companies for \nnational security is vital and needs to be maintained. But there is a \nway to keep that information flowing and still maintain the \nconstitutional balance by implementing the amendment which Senator \nWhitehouse, the Presiding Officer, and I have introduced, the essence \nof which is to substitute the U.S. Government as the party defendant.\n  In that situation, the Government would have the identical defenses \nthe telephone companies now have--no more, no less. For example, \ncustomarily the Federal Government has the defense of sovereign \nimmunity. You can't sue the Federal Government unless the Government \nconsents or unless the Congress of the United States says\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nyou can sue the Government. The Congress of the United States is the \nfinal determiner of that; of course, with Presidential signature or \nwith an override, if the President vetoes.\n  So in this situation, the Government being substituted for the \ntelephone companies would not have the governmental immunity defense \nbecause the telephone companies do not have it. The Government would \nhave the state secrets defense because it has intervened in the cases \nagainst the telephone companies to assert the defense of state secrets, \nso that if state secrets are involved, that may block the plaintiffs' \ncases. Under our amendment the Government would continue to have the \navailability of a state secrets defense.\n  I doubt very much there will be any monetary awards in these cases, \nbut that is not for me to decide. That is for the judicial process to \ndecide, to run its course.\n  When I say the legislative branch has not been successful in \noversight in limiting the expansion of Executive power, I do so because \nof what has happened with the terrorist surveillance program.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is an explicit statute \nwhich is the law of the land, explicitly stating that wiretapping can \noccur only with judicial authority. The tradition is for the Government \nto present an affidavit containing probable cause to warrant the \nwiretap that goes before a judge. The judge reviews it. If probable \ncause is present, then there may be an invasion of privacy under our \nConstitution with that constitutional safeguard of a neutral \nmagistrate.\n\n  The President has taken the position that he does not have to be \nbound by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because of his \narticle II powers under the Constitution. He is arguing that the \nstatute cannot affect the President's constitutional authority, and he \nis correct as a principle of law. But the question is whether he has \nthat authority. And the terrorist surveillance program was secret from \nthe time it was put into effect shortly after 9/11/2001 until mid-\nDecember 2005, when the Senate was in the midst of the final day of \ndebate on the PATRIOT Act re-authorization, which was to give the law \nenforcement authorities broader power.\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee at that time and was arguing to \nmove ahead with the PATRIOT Act re-authorization when that morning the \nnews came across that there had been a secret program in effect. That \nscuttled our efforts to get the PATRIOT Act passed that day, with the \ncomment being made that some were prepared to vote for the PATRIOT Act \nre-authorization until they found out about this secret program they \nhadn't known about.\n  A long time has passed since December 2005. That matter is still tied \nup in the courts. But the courts, at least, are available to make a \ndecision on that ultimately--it may take some time, but to make a \ndecision on it.\n  Similarly, the administration, the President has ignored the National \nSecurity Act of 1947 which explicitly states that the executive branch \nmust give notice to the intelligence committees of the House and Senate \nwhere programs are carried out like the terrorist surveillance program. \nThe President did not follow that statute. Again, the underlying \ncontention is that he has power under article II so that he doesn't \nhave to follow the statute.\n  Finally, he did make those matters available. He did so on the eve of \nthe confirmation of General Hayden as head of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. So finally, under political pressure--he couldn't get General \nHayden confirmed unless he made them available--he did so.\n  We have had other illustrations. We have had the signing statements \nwhere the President issues a statement when he signs legislation into \nlaw which modifies what Congress has passed.\n  I will be very specific. The Constitution provides that each House \npasses legislation. There is a conference submitted to the President. \nHe either signs it or vetoes it. But when the President got the PATRIOT \nAct re-authorization with provisions which had been negotiated as to \nJudiciary Committee oversight on how those law enforcement powers could \nbe carried out, the President issued a signing statement--and this had \nbeen negotiated between the Judiciary Committee and the President's \nemployees--the President issued a signing statement and changed the \nthrust of the statute.\n  In a widely publicized matter involving interrogation techniques, the \nSenate passed, on a 90-to-9 vote, limitations on Executive power in the \nDetainee Treatment Act. There was a meeting between President Bush and \nSenator McCain, author of the provision, limiting executive authority. \nWe passed the bill, and the President signed it but with reservation \nthat his executive authority under article II did not deprive him of \nauthority to handle the situation as he chose. But in the midst of all \nthis, the courts have been effective. The courts have limited Executive \npower.\n  In the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court held that the \nPresident's military commissions violated the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice and lacked any congressional authorization. In short, the Court \nheld the President cannot establish a military commission to try Hamdan \nunless Congress granted him the authority to do so.\n\n  In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court said that due process \nrequires a citizen held as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful \nopportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a \nneutral decisionmaker.\n  In the celebrated case of Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court held that \nthe Federal habeas corpus statute gave district courts jurisdiction to \nhear challenges by aliens held at Guantanamo Bay.\n  In Doe v. Gonzales in September of last year, the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York struck down the permanent gag \norders issued with national security letters as a violation of the \nFirst Amendment.\n  In Hepting v. AT, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker of the Northern \nDistrict of California held that the publicly available information \nconcerning the terrorist surveillance program was not subject to the \nstate secrets defense.\n  In the very heavily publicized case of Padilla, the fourth circuit \ninitially held that the executive had the authority to hold Padilla as \nan enemy combatant in September of 2005. Then when Padilla petitioned \nthe Supreme Court for certiorari, it looked as if that might be \noverturned. The Government moved for authorization to transfer Padilla \nand to vacate the decision. They anticipated an unfavorable decision \nand they tried to moot it out; that is, render it meaningless. Judge \nLuttig, writing for the fourth circuit, was very strong in rejecting \nthe Government's position, saying this:\n\n       Because we believe that the transfer of Padilla and the \n     withdrawal of our opinion at the government's request while \n     the Supreme Court is reviewing this court's decision of \n     September 9 would compound what is, in the absence of \n     explanation, at least an appearance that the government may \n     be attempting to avoid consideration of our decision by the \n     Supreme Court, and also because we believe that this case \n     presents an issue of such especial national importance as to \n     warrant final consideration by that court--\n\n  That is, the Supreme Court--\n\n     we deny both the motion and the suggestion.\n\n  Pretty strong language, telling the Government what they can and what \nthey can't do.\n  The Government is not going to listen to the Congress, but the \nGovernment listens to the court.\n  When the issue arose as to the destruction of the CIA tapes, Senator \nLeahy and I wrote the Attorney General asking for information as to \nwhat had happened, and the Attorney General wrote back and said: We are \nnot going to give you any information at this time. But we got no \ninformation. Then the word was that it was political, what was being \ndone. Then a Federal district court ordered the Government to file a \nreport with the court as to what had happened on the destruction of the \nCIA tapes. Well, nobody said the court decision was political. You \ncan't challenge the judicial decision except to take an appeal, and \nthat is the process we follow.\n  I recently made a trip to Pakistan. Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I \nwent to Pakistan to take a look at what was going on there because \nPakistan is so important. The country has nuclear weapons but a very \nunstable government. We met with President Musharraf. We were scheduled \nto meet with Benazir Bhutto at 9 p.m. on December 27. While we were \npreparing for\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nthe meeting--she had scheduled it at 9 o'clock in the evening because \nshe had a full day of campaign activities. While we were preparing for \nthe meeting, we found out about 6:30, 7 o'clock, she had been \nassassinated, which was a terrible blow, not only on a personal level. \nI had come to know her to some extent when she was Prime Minister of \nPakistan. But she had the potential as an extraordinary political \nfigure to unify Pakistan. She had a remarkable educational background. \nShe was educated at Harvard, also at Oxford; very glamorous, movie star \nbeautiful, a great political figure with a chance to unify the country. \nNow we start from scratch.\n  Congressman Kennedy and I questioned President Musharraf about what \nhe was doing. He had gotten $10 million since 9/11 to act against al-\nQaida. Why hadn't Osama bin Laden been captured? There were a lot of \nindications that the money was not being used for the purpose for which \nit was appropriated. President Musharraf said to Congressman Kennedy \nand me that he didn't like the conditionality, and we pointed out to \nhim that is the way we function. We don't give $10 million for use by \nPresident Musharraf any way he likes. Then we raised a question about \nwhat President Musharraf was doing with the Supreme Court. He held the \nChief Justice in house arrest. He dismissed many of the justices. He \nappointed a favorable Supreme Court. Well, the United States is not \nPakistan. In Pakistan, the chief executive, President Musharraf, tells \nthe Supreme Court what to do. He suspends the Chief Justice. He fires \nhalf of the court.\n  In the United States, under our checks and balances, the President of \nthe United States listens to what the Supreme Court of the United \nStates says. A fundamental of our society is the separation of powers. \nThat is the very basis of how we function in the United States, with \nthe executive having certain powers, the Congress having certain \npowers, and the Court having certain powers. Regrettably, the evidence \nis conclusive that the Congress has been ineffective in congressional \noversight. The protocol is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe ranking member are told about what is happening on serious \nconstitutional issues. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee when \nthe terrorist surveillance program was in operation, and neither the \nranking member, Senator Leahy, nor I, were told about what was going \non. The President is taking the position that he is not bound by \nstatute, and he may be right. He may be right, but in our society, the \ncourts have to make that decision.\n\n  I believe it would be a serious step to close down the courts where \nsome 40 cases are pending. Let them go through the judicial process. \nNow if we had a choice of having the benefit of what the telephone \ncompanies are doing and closing down the courts, that might be one \nthing. But Senator Whitehouse and I have structured an amendment, \ncosponsored by other Senators, to have both of those benefits \noperative. We can maintain the telephone companies providing whatever \ninformation they are providing, and at the same time keep the courts \nopen by substituting the Government as the party defendant.\n  We are continuing in the midst of an historic confrontation. It is \ntesting the mettle of our constitutional process. It is testing the \nmettle of our constitutional process because of the importance of being \nvigorous in fighting al-Qaida. The telephone companies have been good \ncitizens and they ought not to be held liable for whatever it is they \nhave done. But the Government can step in, and if there are verdicts \nwhich, as I say, I very much doubt, it is a cost of national defense. \nIt ought to be paid by the Treasury of the United States, and the \ncourts ought to be kept open.\n  Senator Dodd is about to address the Chamber. I know he is opposed to \ngranting retroactive immunity, and he has a very powerful argument, and \nmay the Record show he is nodding in the affirmative. That is what we \nlawyers do when we have a little support, even if it is only a nod of \nthe head or a gesture. I greatly admire what Senator Dodd is doing here \nand what he has done since he was elected to the Senate in 1980. He and \nSenator Alan Dixon came to the Senate at the same time as two newly \nelected Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle. They were \noutnumbered by Republican Senators who were elected, 16 of us for that \nelection, 16 to 2. But now Senator Dodd has narrowed the odds and only \nSenator Grassley and I remain of those 16, so it is only 2 to 1. Of \ncourse, when it was 2 to 16 it was a fair fight, and when it is 1 to 2, \nSenator Dodd may have the advantage. Who knows. I say that only in \njest. But we are about to hear some strong arguments and some real \noratory on these issues.\n  But we don't have to make a choice between having the information and \nhaving the courts open. You can do both if the amendment which Senator \nWhitehouse and I have offered is adopted.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and defer to my distinguished \ncolleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from \nPennsylvania, whom I always enjoy listening to. I enjoyed particularly \nhearing his comments about President Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto, who \nI had the privilege and pleasure of knowing for some time over the last \n20 years. As do all of us here, I care deeply about what happens in \nPakistan, and I admire remarkable leadership. I was stricken by her \nloss and the tragic way in which she lost her life in her effort to \nbring democracy to her country. So I associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Specter who was there, I know. In fact, I listened with \ngreat interest to his comments and thoughts at the time when he and \nCongressman Patrick Kennedy were there on a mission together. So I once \nagain thank him.\n  I know he talked about our arrival some 27 years ago, when the two of \nus arrived here, and it is true there were 16 Republicans and two \nDemocrats. I always like to point out that there are two fine \nRepublicans still here, Senator Grassley and Senator Specter, and 50 \npercent of the Democrats who were elected that year are still in this \nChamber. So I remain of the two of us, Alan Dixon being the other \nMember.\n  I look up and I see the Presiding Officer. Any time I get up to \naddress this issue, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is the \nPresiding Officer. He has heard my thoughts on this issue now since \nDecember. I think it has been almost 20 hours I have spoken on the \nsubject matter of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the \nissue of retroactive immunity. I will be trying to convince my \ncolleagues to vote against cloture tomorrow so we can force the \ncommittees to go back and adopt the Judiciary Committee approach rather \nthan the one adopted by the Intelligence Committee which gives \nretroactive immunity to the telecom industry.\n  I note as well that the House, the other body, in its consideration \nof this matter, agreed with the Judiciary Committee and did not include \nretroactive immunity in their Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \namendments. The House reached the conclusion that the retroactive \nimmunity was not warranted, that the courts should be given the \nopportunity to decide the legality or illegality of the telecom \nindustry's decision to agree to the administration's request to allow \nthe unfettered surveillance of millions of telephone calls, faxes, and \ne-mails.\n  Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and I have offered an amendment to \nstrike section 2 of the bill, which would then put the legislation \nroughly on parity with the House-passed legislation and deliver that to \nthe President. The President has said: If you do that, I will veto the \nbill, which I regret deeply. The idea that you veto all of the other \namendments dealing with foreign intelligence because you didn't provide \nretroactive immunity to a handful of telephone companies is rather \nbreathtaking when you consider the vulnerability that can pose and the \ninability of us to collect the important surveillance, the intelligence \nwe need to keep our country secure and safe.\n  Mr. President, I am not normally accustomed to engaging in lengthy \nconversations about any subject. Certainly it is the privilege and \nright of every Senator to engage in extended debate on a subject about \nwhich they care passionately. I cannot think of another occasion in the \nlast 20 years, 25 years, when I have engaged in extended debate on any \nsubject matter. It doesn't suggest there haven't been moments\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nwhen I thought it was warranted, and others certainly provided that \nopportunity or we resolved the matters prior to using that tool that \nhas been available to every Member of this Chamber since the founding \nof our Republic. But I care deeply about this issue. It is not just a \npassing issue; it is not just one section of a bill.\n  It goes far beyond the words or language of even the companies \ninvolved here. It goes to the very heart of who we are as a nation, as \na people. Our willingness or ability to understand the value and \nimportance of the rule of law is an issue that transcends any other \nissue we grapple with, the understanding of how important it is to \nprotect and defend the rule of law, our Constitution, to guarantee the \nrights and liberties of every citizen of our country.\n  Tonight, I will engage in a rather lengthy conversation about this \nissue, with my apologies to the staff and others who have to spend time \nlistening to this conversation. But I want people to know how important \nthis issue is. This is very important. It doesn't get any more \nimportant than this one as to whether millions of Americans' telephone \nconversations, e-mails, and faxes over the past 5 years were listened \nto, eavesdropping that would still be ongoing were it not for disclosed \nreports by journalists and a whistleblower that revealed this program. \nIt would still be ongoing, without a court order and without a warrant. \nThat is dangerous.\n  The very rationale which gave birth to the FISA some three decades \nago was specifically designed to deal with the very fact situation that \ncauses me to rise and talk about this subject matter this evening. FISA \nintended to balance two legitimate issues--gathering information to \nkeep us secure, while protecting the rights and liberties of every \nsingle American citizen against an unwarranted invasion of their \nprivacy. It has never been easy to maintain that balance. It is never \nperfect, as I said earlier this afternoon, but it ought to be our \ncommon goal, regardless of party and ideology, to do our very best to \nstrike that balance. That is what this issue is, and that is why it is \nso important.\n  If we set the precedent by a vote tomorrow that keeps this provision \nin the bill, and it remains so in the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, we will be setting a precedent which, I suspect, \nfuture administrations may point to under a different fact situation, \nat a different hour, at a different time, when they may decide it is \nnot in their interest to go to a FISA Court. The next request by an \nadministration to provide information may be medical or financial or \nhighly personal information, and they will point to a time when the \nSenate was given the opportunity to insist that a series of telephone \ncompanies go to the courts of this country to determine whether they \ndid the legal thing by turning over information, and the Senate said: \nNo, we are going to grant retroactive immunity.\n  We will never determine whether you had the right to do so, and \nimplicitly it would sanction the activity by our refusal to strike the \nlanguage granting the immunity. That is what is at stake in the vote \ntomorrow, if we are unable to defeat cloture.\n  That is why I am determined to do everything I can to convince my \ncolleagues of an alternative course. So I urge my colleagues, in the \nstrongest terms that I can, to vote to strip the retroactive immunity \nfrom this bill and, if it is not stripped, to vote against cloture.\n  Not only would this bill ratify a domestic spying regime that has \nalready concentrated far too much unaccountable power in the \nPresident's hands, in its current form it places above the law the \ntelecommunications companies that may have violated the privacy and \ntrust of millions of American citizens.\n  In December, I opposed retroactive immunity on the Senate floor for \nsome 10 hours in this Chamber. In the weeks since then, I have \ncontinued to speak out against it.\n  Unwarranted domestic spying didn't happen in a panic or short-term \nemergency--not for a week or a month or even a year. If it had, I might \nnot be here this evening. But the spying went on, relentlessly, for \nmore than five years. And if the press didn't expose it, I imagine it \nwould still be happening today.\n  I might not be here either if it had been the first offense of a new \nadministration. Maybe not if it even had been the second or third, I \nmight add. I am here this evening because after offense after offense \nafter offense, my frustration has found its breaking point. I am here \nthis evening because of a pattern of continual abuses against civil \nliberties and the rule of law. When faced with that pattern, we should \nnot act in the interest of the Democratic Party or the Republican \nParty. We should act in the interest of the Constitution of the United \nStates because we are, above anything else, its temporary custodians. \nIf these abuses had been committed by a President of my own party, I \nwould have opposed them just as passionately as I do this evening.\n  I am here tonight because of the latest link in that long chain of \nabuse. It is alleged that giant telecom corporations worked with our \nGovernment to compile America's private domestic communications records \ninto a database of enormous scale and scope. Secretly and without a \nwarrant, these corporations are alleged to have spied on their own \nAmerican customers.\n  Here is only one of the most egregious examples: According to the \nElectronic Frontier Foundation:\n\n       Clear, firsthand whistleblower documentary evidence \n     [states] . . . that for year on end, every e-mail, every text \n     message, and every phone call carried over the massive fiber \n     optic links of sixteen separate companies routed through \n     AT's Internet hub in San Francisco--hundreds of millions of \n     private, domestic communications--have been . . . copied in \n     their entirety by AT and knowingly diverted wholesale by \n     means of multiple ``splitters'' into a secret room controlled \n     exclusively by the NSA.\n\n  The phone calls of millions of Americans diverted into a secret room \ncontrolled by the NSA. That allegation still needs to be proven in a \ncourt of law. But before that happens, there is an even simpler \nquestion: What do you see in it?\n  If you only see cables and computers there, the whole thing seems \nalmost harmless. Certainly nothing to get worked up about--a routine \nsecurity sweep and a routine piece of legislation authorizing it. If \nthat is what you see in the NSA's secret room, I imagine you will vote \nto extend that immunity.\n  If you see a vast dragnet for millions of Americans' private \nconversations, conducted by a Government agency without a warrant, then \nI believe you will recognize what is at stake. You will see that what \nis at stake is the sanctity of the law and the sanctity of our privacy \nas American citizens. You will then oppose this retroactive immunity.\n  Maybe that sounds overdramatic to some of my colleagues. They will \nask: What does it matter, at the end of the day, if a few corporations \nare sued? They will say: This is a small issue, an isolated case. The \nlaw is still safe and sound.\n  I find that view profoundly wrong. But I will give them this: As long \nas they keep this small, they win. As long as they keep this case \nisolated and technical, they win. As long as it is about a few \nlawsuits, and nothing more, they win. They are counting on the American \npeople to see nothing bigger than that.\n  I am counting on them to see more and to fear less. So much more is \nat stake than a few phone calls, a few companies, and a few lawsuits. \nMr. President, equal justice is at stake--justice that makes no \nexceptions. Openness is at stake--an open debate on security and \nliberty, and an end to warrantless, groundless spying. Retroactive \nimmunity stands against those principles.\n  It doesn't say: I trust the American people; I trust the courts and \njudges and juries to come to just decisions. Retroactive immunity says: \nTrust me.\n  There are classified documents, we are told, that prove the case for \nretroactive immunity beyond a shadow of a doubt. But we are not allowed \nto see them. I have served in this body for more than a quarter \ncentury, and I am not allowed to see these documents at all. I am told \nto trust somebody, believe people when they stand up and tell you \nexactly what is here. Neither are the majority of my colleagues allowed \nto see them. We are left entirely in the dark to draw the conclusion \nthat there is nothing to be concerned about. The courts don't need to \nlook at this.\n  Obviously, I cannot speak for my colleagues, but I would never take \n``trust\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nme'' for an answer--not even in the best of times.\n  ``Trust me.'' It is the offer to hide ourselves in the waiting arms \nof the rule of men. I cannot put it better than this:\n\n       ``Trust me'' government is government that asks that we \n     concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man; that we trust \n     him to do what's best for us. My view of government places \n     trust not in one person or one party, but in those values \n     that transcend persons and parties.\n\n  Those words were spoken by Ronald Reagan in 1980, the former \nPresident of the United States. Those words are every bit as true \ntoday, even if some have chosen to forget them. But times of threat and \nfear blur our view of transcendent values; and those who would exploit \nthose times urge us to save our skins at any cost.\n  The rule of law has rarely been so fragile. It has really seemed less \ncompelling. What, after all, does the law give us? It has no parades, \nno slogans; it lives in books and precedents. It cannot entertain us or \ncaptivate us or soothe our deepest fears. When set against everything \nthe rule of men has to offer, the rule of law is mute.\n  That is the precise advantage seized upon, in all times, by the law's \nenemies.\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  Those are the words of James Madison, and they are worthy of \nrepetition.\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  James Madison, the father of the Constitution, made that prediction \nmore than two centuries ago. With the passage of this bill, his words \nwould be one step closer to coming true. So it has never been more \nessential that we lend our voices to the law and speak on its behalf.\n  This is our defining question, the question that confronts every \ngeneration of Americans since the founding of our Republic: the rule of \nlaw, or the rule of men?\n  How many times must we get the wrong answer?\n  To those who say this is just about a few telecoms, I answer that \nthis is about contempt for the rule of law, large and small.\n  This is about the Justice Department turning our Nation's highest law \nenforcement officers into patronage plums, and turning the impartial \nwork of indictments and trials into the machinations of politics.\n  This is about Alberto Gonzales coming before Congress to give us \ntestimony that was, at best, wrong, and, at worst, perjury.\n  This is about Congress handing the President the power to designate \nany individual he wants an ``unlawful enemy combatant,'' hold that \nindividual indefinitely, and take away his or her rights to habeas \ncorpus--the 700-year-old right to challenge your detention. If you \nthink the Military Commissions Act struck at the heart of the \nConstitution, well, it struck at the Magna Carta while it was at it.\n  If you think this only threatens a few of us, you should understand \nthat the writ of habeas corpus belongs to all of us. It allows anyone \nto challenge their detention. Rolling back habeas corpus endangers us \nall. Without a day in court, how can you prove that you are entitled to \na trial? How can you prove that you are innocent? In fact, without a \nday in court, how can you let anybody know what you have been detained \nfor at all?\n  The Military Commission Act also gave President Bush the power some \nsay he wanted most of all: the power to get information out of \nsuspected terrorists--by almost any means. The power to use evidence \npotentially gained from torture.\n  This is about torture--officially sanctioned torture. As a result of \ndecisions made at the highest levels of our Government, America is \nmaking itself known to the world with stories like this one: A prisoner \nat Guantanamo--to take one example out of hundreds--was deprived of \nsleep for over 55 days, a month and 3 weeks. Some nights he was doused \nwith water or blasted with air conditioning. After week after week of \nthis delirious, shivering wakefulness, on the verge of death from \nhypothermia, doctors strapped him to a chair--doctors, healers who took \nthe Hippocratic oath to ``do no harm''--pumped him full of three bags \nof medical saline, brought him back from death, and sent him back to \nhis interrogators.\n  To the generation coming of age around the world in this decade, that \nis America. Not Normandy, not the Marshall Plan, not Nuremberg. \nGuantanamo.\n  This is about the CIA destroying tapes containing the evidence of \nharsh interrogations--about the administration covering its tracks in a \nway more suited to a banana republic than to the home of freedom.\n  This is about waterboarding, a technique invented by the Spanish \nInquisition, perfected by the Khmer Rouge, and in between, banned--\noriginally banned for excessive cruelty--by the Gestapo!\n  Waterboarding's not torture? Listen to the words of Malcolm Nance, a \n26-year expert in intelligence and counterterrorism, a combat veteran, \nand former Chief of Training at the U.S. Navy Survival, Evasion, \nResistance and Escape School.\n  To those who say that this is just about a few telecoms, I answer: \nThis is about contempt for the law, large and small.\n  This is about the Justice Department turning our Nation's highest law \nenforcement offices into patronage plums, and turning the impartial \nwork of indictments and trials into the machinations of politics.\n  This is about Alberto Gonzales coming before Congress to give us \ntestimony that was at best, wrong--and at worst, perjury.\n  This is about Congress handing the President the power to designate \nany individual he wants an ``unlawful enemy combatant,'' hold him \nindefinitely, and take away his right to habeas corpus--the 700-year-\nold right to challenge your detention. If you think that the Military \nCommissions Act struck at the heart of the Constitution, you would be \nunderstating things--it struck at the Magna Carta while it was at it.\n  And if you think that this only threatens a few of us, you should \nunderstand that the writ of habeas corpus belongs to all of us--it \nallows anyone to challenge their detention. Rolling back habeas rights \nendangers us all: Without a day in court, how can you prove that you \nare entitled to a trial? How can you prove that you are innocent? In \nfact, without a day in court, how can you let anyone know that you have \nbeen detained at all?\n  While training American soldiers to resist interrogation, he writes:\n\n       I have personally led, witnessed and supervised \n     waterboarding of hundreds of people. . . . Unless you have \n     been strapped down to the board, have endured the agonizing \n     feeling of the water overpowering your gag reflex, and then \n     feel your throat open and allow pint after pint of water to \n     involuntarily fill your lungs, you will not know the meaning \n     of the word. . . .\n       It does not simulate drowning, as the lungs are actually \n     filling with water. The victim is drowning. How much the \n     victim is to drown depends on the desired result . . . and \n     the obstinacy of the subject.\n       Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation . . . usually the \n     person goes into hysterics on the board. . . . When done \n     right it is controlled death.\n\n  In spite of all that, last week the White House declared that \nwaterboarding is not torture, that waterboarding is legal, and that, if \nit chooses, America will waterboard again.\n  This is about Michael Mukasey coming before the Senate and defending \nthe President's power to openly break the law. When he came to the \nSenate before his confirmation, Mr. Mukasey was asked bluntly and \nplainly: Is waterboarding constitutional? Mr. Mukasey replied with a \nhead-scratching tautology:\n\n       If waterboarding is torture, torture is not constitutional.\n\n  Surely we can expect a little more insight from someone so famously \nwell versed in national security law. But Mr. Mukasey pressed on with \nthe obstinacy of a witness pleading the Fifth:\n\n       If it's torture. . . . If it amounts to torture, it is not \n     constitutional.\n\n  And that is the best this noted jurist, this legal scholar, this \nlongtime judge had to offer on the defining moral issue of this \nPresidency: claims of ignorance. Word games.\n  And again last month, he refused categorically to denounce \nwaterboarding. In fact, Mr. Mukasey was asked the easiest question we \nhave in a democracy: Can the President openly break\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\nthe law? Can he--as we know he has done already--order warrantless \nwiretapping, ignore the will of Congress, and then hide behind nebulous \npowers he claims to find in the Constitution?\n  Mr. Mukasey's response: The President has ``the authority to defend \nthe country.''\n  And in one swoop, the Attorney General conceded to the President \nnearly unlimited power, as long as he finds a lawyer willing to stuff \nhis actions into the boundless rubric of ``defending the country.'' \nUnlimited power to defend the country, to protect us as one man sees \nfit, even if that means listening to our phone calls, even if that \nmeans holding some of us indefinitely.\n  This is about extraordinary rendition--outsourced torture. It is \nabout men this administration prefer we did not know exist. But we do \nknow.\n  One was a Syrian immigrant raising his family in Canada as a citizen. \nHe wrote computer code for a company called Math Works. He was planning \nto start his own tech business. On a trip through New York's JFK \nAirport, he was arrested by U.S. Federal agents. They shackled him and \nbundled him into a private CIA plane which flew him across the Atlantic \nOcean to Syria.\n  This man spent the next 10 months and 10 days in a Syrian prison. His \ncell was 3 feet wide, the size of a grave. Some 300 days passed alone \nin that cell, with a bowl for his toilet and another bowl for his \nwater, and the door only opened so he could go wash himself once a \nweek, though it may have been more or less because the cell was dark \nand he lost track of time.\n  The door only opened for one reason: for interrogators who asked him, \nagain and again, about al-Qaida. Here is how it was described:\n\n       The interrogator said, ``Do you know what this is?'' I \n     said, ``Yes, it's a cable,'' and he told me, ``Open your \n     right hand.'' I opened my right hand, and he hit me like \n     crazy. It was so painful, and of course I started crying, and \n     then he told me to open my left hand, and I opened it, and he \n     missed, then hit my wrist. And then he asked me questions. If \n     he does not think you are telling the truth, then he hits \n     again.\n\n  The jail and the torturers were Syrian, but America sent this man \nthere with full knowledge of what would happen to him because it was \npart of a longstanding secret program of ``extraordinary rendition.'' \nAmerica was convinced that he was a terrorist and wanted the truth \nbeaten out of him.\n  No charges were ever filed against him. His adopted nation's \ngovernment--Canada, one of our strongest NATO allies--cleared him of \nall wrongdoing after a yearlong investigation and awarded him more than \n$10 million in government compensation for his immense pain and \nsuffering--but not before he was tortured for 10 months in a cell the \nsize of a grave. Our own Government, I note, has refused to even \nacknowledge that his case exists.\n  It is about a German citizen living in the city of Ulm with his wife \nand four children. On a bus trip through Eastern Europe, he was pulled \noff at a border crossing by armed guards and held for 3 weeks in a \nhotel room where he was beaten regularly. At the end of 3 weeks, he was \ndrugged and shipped on a cargo plane to Kabul, Afghanistan.\n  For 5 months he was held in the Salt Pit, a secret American prison \nstaffed by Afghan guards. All he had to drink was stagnant water from a \nfilthy bottle. Again and again, masked men interrogated him about al-\nQaida. And finally, he says, they raped him.\n  He was released in May of 2004. Scientific testing confirmed his \nstory of malnourishment, and the Chancellor of Germany publicly \nacknowledged that he was wrongfully held. What was his crime? Having \nthe same name as a suspected terrorist. Again, our own Government has \nrefused to even acknowledge this case exists.\n\n  There are not enough words in the world to cover the facts. If you \nwould like to define torture out of existence, be my guest. If you \nwould rather use a Washington euphemism--``tough questioning,'' \n``enhanced interrogation''--feel free. Feel free to talk about \n``fraternity hazing'' such as Rush Limbaugh did, or to use a favorite \nterm of Vice President Cheney, ``a dunk in the water,'' as he described \nwaterboarding. Call it whatever you like. And when you are through with \nall of your evasions, the facts will still be waiting for you--the fact \nof waterboarding, ``controlled death,'' the fact of ``outsourced \ntorture,'' the fact of secret prisons, the fact of month-long sleep \ndeprivation, the fact of the President's personal power to hold \nwhomever he likes for as long as he would like.\n  Have I gone wildly off the topic? Have I brought up a dozen unrelated \nissues? I don't think, Mr. President--I don't think I have at all.\n  We are deceiving our ourselves when we talk about the U.S. attorneys \nissue, the habeas issue, the torture issue, the rendition issue, the \nsecrecy issue. As if each one were an isolated case! As if each one \nwere an accident! When we speak of them as isolated, we are keeping our \npolitics cripplingly small, and as long as we keep them small, the rule \nof men is winning. There is only one issue here--only one. It is the \nlaw issue, the rule of law. Does the President serve the law or does \nthe law serve the President?\n  Each insult to our Constitution comes from the same source. Each \nsprings from the same mindset. And if we attack this contempt for the \nlaw at any point, we will wound it at all points.\n  That is why I am here this evening. Retroactive immunity is on the \ntable today, but also at issue is the entire ideology that justifies \nit, the same ideology behind torture and executive lawlessness. \nImmunity is a disgrace in itself, but it is far worse in what it \nrepresents. It tells us that some believe in the courts only so long as \nthe verdict goes their way. It puts secrecy above sunshine and fiat \nabove the law.\n  Did the telecoms break the law? That I don't know. Pass immunity and, \nof course, we will never know. A handful of favored corporations will \nremain unchallenged. Their arguments will never be heard in a court of \nlaw. The truth behind this unprecedented domestic spying will never see \nthe light of day.\n  ``Law'' is a word that we barely hear from the supporters of \nimmunity. They offer neither a deliberation about America's difficult \nchoices in an age of terrorism nor a shared attempt to set for our \ntimes the excruciating balance between security and liberty. They \nmerely promise a false debate on a false choice: security or liberty, \nbut never both.\n  I think differently, and I hope others do as well. I think that \nAmerica's founding truth is unambiguous: security and liberty, one and \ninseparable, and never one without the other.\n  Secure in that truth, I offer a challenge to immunity supporters. You \nwant to put a handful of corporations above the law. Could you please \nexplain how your immunity makes any one of us any safer at all?\n  The truth is that a working balance between security and liberty has \nalready been struck. In fact, it has been settled for decades. For \nthree decades, in fact, FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, has prevented executive lawbreaking and protected Americans, and \nthat balance stands today.\n  In the wake of the Watergate scandal, the Senate convened the Church \nCommittee, a panel of distinguished members determined to investigate \nexecutive abuses of power. Unsurprisingly, they found that when \nCongress and the courts substitute ``trust me'' for real oversight, \nmassive lawbreaking can result.\n  They found evidence of U.S. Army spying on the civilian population, \nFederal dossiers on citizens' political activities, a CIA and FBI \nprogram that had opened hundreds of thousands of Americans' letters \nwithout warning or warrant. In sum, Americans had sustained a severe \nblow to their fourth amendment rights ``to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures. . . .''\n  But at the same time, the Senators of the Church Committee understood \nthat surveillance needed to go forward to protect the American people. \nSurveillance itself was not the problem. Unchecked, unregulated, \nunwarranted surveillance was. What surveillance needed, in a word, was \nlegitimacy. And in America, as the Founders understood, power becomes \nlegitimate when it is shared, when Congress and the courts check that \nattitude which so often crops up in the executive branch--``if the \nPresident does it, it's not illegal.''\n  The Church Committee's final report, ``Intelligence Activities and \nthe Rights of Americans,'' put the case powerfully\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nindeed. Allow me to quote from that final report:\n\n       The critical question before the Committee was to determine \n     how the fundamental liberties of the people can be maintained \n     in the course of the Government's effort to protect their \n     security.\n       The delicate balance between these basic goals of our \n     system of government is often difficult to strike, but it \n     can, and must, be achieved.\n       We reject the view that the traditional American principles \n     of justice and fair play have no place in our struggle \n     against the enemies of freedom. Moreover, our investigation \n     has established that the targets of intelligence activity \n     have ranged far beyond persons who could properly be \n     characterized as enemies of freedom. . . .\n       We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes \n     and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes.\n       We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as ``vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n\n  The Senators concluded:\n\n       Unless new and tighter controls are established by \n     legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n\n  What a strange echo, what an incredibly strange echo, we hear in \nthose words. The words I just read could have been written yesterday. \nThree decades ago our predecessors in this Chamber understood that when \ndomestic spying goes too far, it threatens to kill just what it \npromises to protect: an America secure in its liberty. That lesson was \ncrystal clear more than 30 years ago. Why is it so cloudy tonight? Why \nis it so cloudy on the eve of an important vote?\n  And before we entertain the argument that ``everything has changed'' \nsince those words were written, remember: The men who wrote them had \nwitnessed World War and Cold War. They had seen the Nazi and Soviet \nthreats and were living every day under the cloud of a nuclear \nholocaust.\n  Mr. President, I ask this: Who will chair the commission \ninvestigating the secrets of warrantless spying years from today? Will \nit be a young Senator sitting in this body today? Will it be someone \nnot yet elected? What will that Senator say when he or she comes to our \nactions, reads in the records of 2008 how we let outrage after outrage \nafter outrage slide with nothing more than a promise to stop the next \none? I imagine that Senator will ask of us: Why didn't they do \nanything? Why didn't they fight back? Why didn't they stand up? Why \ndidn't they vote down retroactive immunity? What were they thinking? \nWhat more do you need to know? How many instances of abuse do you have \nto learn about? When do you stop? When do you say enough is enough? In \nFebruary of 2008, when no one could doubt any more what the \nadministration was doing, why did they sit on their hands? Why did they \nsit on their hands? Why did they pass by as if nothing had ever \nhappened and grant retroactive immunity?\n\n  Since the time of the Church Commission the threats facing our Nation \nhave multiplied and grown in complexity, but the lesson has been \nimmutable: Warrantless spying threatens to undermine our democratic \nsociety, unless legislation brings it under control. In other words, \nthe power to invade privacy must be used sparingly, guarded jealously, \nand shared equally between the branches of Government.\n  Or the case can be made pragmatically, as my friend Harold Koh, dean \nof Yale Law School, recently argued:\n\n       The engagement of the three branches tends to yield not \n     just more thoughtful law, but a more broadly supported public \n     policy.\n\n  Three decades ago, Congress embodied that solution in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. FISA confirmed the President's \npower to conduct surveillance of international conversations involving \nanyone in the United States, provided--provided--that the Federal FISA \nCourt issued a warrant ensuring that wiretapping was aimed at \nsafeguarding our security and nothing else.\n  The President's own Director of National Intelligence, Mike \nMcConnell, explained the rationale in an interview this summer. The \nUnited States, he said:\n\n     . . . did not want to allow the intelligence community to \n     conduct electronic surveillance of Americans for foreign \n     intelligence unless you had a warrant, so that was required.\n\n  As originally written in 1978, and as amended many times since, FISA \nhas accomplished its mission. It has been a valuable tool for \nconducting surveillance of terrorists and those who would harm our \nbeloved Nation. And every time Presidents have come to Congress openly \nto ask for more leeway under FISA, Congress has worked with them. \nCongress has negotiated it together. Congress and Presidents have \nstruck a balance that safeguards America while doing its utmost to \nprotect Americans' privacy.\n  This summer, Congress made a technical correction to FISA, enabling \nthe President to wiretap without a warrant conversations between two \nforeign targets, even if those conversations are routed through \nAmerican corporate computers. For other reasons, I felt this summer's \nlegislation went too far, and I opposed it, but the point is Congress \nonce again proved its willingness to work with the President on foreign \nintelligence surveillance.\n  Isn't that enough?\n  This past October and November, as we have seen, the Senate \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees worked with the President to \nfurther refine FISA and ensure, in a true emergency, the FISA Court \nwould do nothing to slow down intelligence gathering.\n  Isn't that enough?\n  As for the FISA court? Between 1978 and 2004, according to the \nWashington Post, the FISA Court approved 18,748 warrants and rejected \n5. Let me repeat that. The FISA Court, according to the Washington \nPost, approved 18,748 warrants and rejected 5. The FISA Court has sided \nwith the executive branch 99.9 percent of the time.\n  Isn't that enough?\n  Is anything lacking? Have we forgotten something? Isn't all this \nenough to keep us safe?\n  We all know the answer we received. This complex, fine-tuned \nmachinery, crafted over three decades by 3 branches of Government, 4 \nPresidents, and 12 Congresses was ignored. It was a system primed to \nbless nearly any eavesdropping a President could conceive, and spying \nstill happened illegally.\n  If the shock of that decision has yet to sink in, think of it this \nway: President Bush ignored not just a Federal court but a secret \nFederal court. Not just a secret Federal court but a secret Federal \ncourt prepared to sign off on his actions 99.9 percent of the time. A \nmore compliant court has never been conceived. Still, that wasn't good \nenough.\n  So I will ask the Senate candidly, and candidly it already knows the \nanswer: Is this about security or about power? Why are some fighting so \nhard for retroactive immunity? The answer, I believe, is immunity means \nsecrecy, and secrecy means power.\n  It is no coincidence to me that the man who proclaimed ``If the \nPresident does it, it is not illegal''--Richard Nixon--was the same man \nwho raised executive secrecy to an art form. The Senators of the Church \nCommittee expressed succinctly the deep flaw in the Nixonian executive: \n``Abuse thrives on secrecy.'' And in the exhaustive catalogue of their \nreport, they proved it.\n  In this push for immunity, secrecy is at its center. We find proof in \nimmunity's original version: a proposal to protect not just telecoms \nbut everyone involved in the wiretapping program. In their original \nproposal, that is what they wanted, to immunize themselves and \nabsolutely everyone involved in this program. Not just the companies \nbut everyone from the executive branch on down. They wanted to immunize \nevery single human being.\n  Think about it. It speaks to their fear and perhaps their guilt--\ntheir guilt that they had broken the law and their fear in the years to \ncome they would be found liable or convicted. They knew better than \nanyone else what they had done, and they must have had good reason to \nbe afraid. Thankfully, immunity for the President is not part of the \nbill before us, and on previous occasions I have commended Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond and the committee members for not agreeing \nto the administration's request for granting immunity for every single \nperson. But remember, they made the request. That is what they wanted. \nWhile it is not in the bill, it ought to be instructive. If anybody\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\nwonders what this is all about, when you go back and remember that this \nadministration requested of this committee that every single human \nbeing involved in the surveillance program be immunized and protected \nby the act of Congress, that is instructive. That is enlightening as to \nwhat the true intent of this administration has been when it comes to \nthis program.\n\n  As I said: Thankfully, immunity for the executive branch is not part \nof the bill before us, but the original proposal tells us something \nvery important. This is, and always has been, a self-preservation bill. \nOtherwise, why not have a trial and get it over with? If the proponents \nof retroactive immunity are right, the corporations would win in a \nwalk. After all, in the official telling, the telecom industry was \nordered to help the President spy without a warrant and they \npatriotically complied. We have even heard on this floor the comparison \nbetween the telecom corporations to the men and women laying their \nlives on the line in Iraq.\n  But ignore that. Ignore for a moment the fact that in America we obey \nthe laws, not the President's orders. Ignore that not even the \nPresident has the right to secure a bully into breaking the law. Ignore \nthat the telecoms were not unanimous; one, Qwest, wanted to see the \nlegal basis for the order, never received it, and so refused to comply. \nIgnore that a judge presiding over the case ruled:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  Ignore all of that. If the order the telecoms received was legally \nbinding, then they have an easy case to prove. The corporations only \nneed to show a judge the authority and the assurances they were given \nand they will be in and out of court in less than 5 minutes.\n  If the telecoms are as defensible as the President says, why doesn't \nthe President let them defend themselves? If the case is so easy to \nmake, why doesn't he let them make it? It can't be that he is afraid of \nleaks. Our Federal court system has dealt for decades with the most \ndelicate national security matters, building up expertise and \nprotecting classified information behind closed doors--ex parte, in \ncamera. We can expect no less in these cases. No intelligence sources \nneed be compromised. No state secrets need to be exposed. After \nlitigation, at both the district court and circuit court level, no \nstate secrets have been exposed.\n  In fact, Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker, a Republican \nappointee, I might add, has already ruled the issue can go to trial \nwithout putting state secrets in jeopardy. He reasonably concluded that \nthe existence of a terrorist surveillance program is hardly a secret at \nall, and I quote him.\n\n       The government has already disclosed the general contours \n     of the ``terrorist surveillance program,'' which requires the \n     assistance of a telecommunications provider.\n\n  As the state secrets privilege is invoked to stall these high-profile \ncases, it is useful to consider that privilege's history. In fact, it \nwas tainted at its birth by a President of my own party, Harry Truman. \nIn 1952, President Truman successfully invoked the new privilege to \nprevent public exposure of a report on a plane crash that killed three \nAir Force contractors.\n  When the report was finally declassified some 50 years later, decades \nafter anyone in the Truman administration was within its reach, it \ncontained no secrets at all; only facts about repeated maintenance \nfailures that would have seriously embarrassed some important people. \nAnd so the state secrets privilege began its career not to protect our \nNation but to protect the powerful.\n  In his opinion, Judge Walker argued that, even when it is reasonably \ngrounded:\n\n       the state secrets privilege still has its limits. While the \n     court recognizes and respects the executive's constitutional \n     duty to protect the Nation from threats, the court also takes \n     seriously its constitutional duty to adjudicate the disputes \n     that come before it. To defer to a blanket assertion of \n     secrecy here would be to abdicate that duty, particularly \n     because the very subject matter of this litigation has been \n     so publicly aired. The compromise between liberty and \n     security remains a difficult one. But dismissing this case at \n     the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent \n     enhancement of security.\n\n  And that ought to be the epitaph for the last 6 years--sacrificing \nliberty for no apparent enhancement of security. Worse than selling our \nsoul, we are giving it away for free.\n  It is equally wrong to claim that failing to grant this retroactive \nimmunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate with \nsurveillance in the future. The truth is, that since the 1970s, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act has compelled telecommunications \ncompanies to cooperate with surveillance, when it is warranted. What is \nmore, it immunizes them. It has done that for 25 years.\n  So cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today. \nCollusion in warrantless wiretapping is. The warrant makes all the \ndifference in the world because it is precisely the court's blessing \nthat brings Presidential power under the rule of law.\n  In sum, we know that giving the telecoms their day in court, giving \nthe American people their day in court, would not jeopardize an ounce \nof our security. And it could only expose one secret: The extent to \nwhich the rule of law has been trampled upon. That is the choice at \nstake this evening and tomorrow when we vote on this matter: Will the \nsecrets of the last years remain closed in the dark or will they be \nopen to the generations to come, to our successors in this Chamber, so \nthey can prepare themselves to defend against future outrages of power \nand usurpations of law from future Presidents, of either party, as \ncertainly they will come? As certainly they will come.\n  Thirty years after the Church Committee, history repeated itself. \nEven though I probably thought in those days, this will never happen \nagain. Well, here we are again. As certain as I am standing here this \nevening, at some future time, there will be an executive, a President, \nwho will seek to compromise the very same principles. And just as we \nreached back 30 years ago during this debate to a hallowed time when \nanother Senate, faced with similar challenges, reached entirely \ndifferent conclusions than we are about to make, some future generation \nwill reach back to ours and ask: What did they say? What did they do? \nHow did they feel about this? What actions did they take?\n  The idea that this body would grant retroactive immunity in the face \nof these challenges and deny the courts an opportunity to determine \nwhether, at the mere request of a President, major companies, for years \non end, can sweep up, vacuum up--to use the Church Committee's \nlanguage--every telephone conversation, every fax, every e-mail of \nmillions and millions of Americans, is a precedent I don't think we \nwant as part of our heritage for coming generations.\n  And believe me, they will look back to it. If those who come after us \nare to prevent it from occurring again, they need the full truth.\n  Constitutional lawyer and author Glenn Greenwald expressed the high \nstakes this way:\n\n       The Bush administration will be gone in 11 months. But--in \n     the absence of some meaningful accountability--all of this \n     will remain . . . If . . . these theories remain undisturbed \n     and unchallenged, and . . . all of these crimes go \n     uninvestigated and unpunished, that will have a profound \n     impact on changing our national character, in further \n     transforming the type of country we are.\n\n  That is why we must not see these secrets go quietly into the good \nnight. I am here this evening because the truth is no one's private \nproperty. It belongs to every one of us, and it demands to be heard.\n  ``State secrets,'' ``patriotic duty'': Those, as weak as they are, \nare the arguments the telecoms' advocates use when they are feeling \nhigh-minded. When their thoughts turn baser, they make their arguments \nas amateur economists.\n  Here is how Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell put it.\n\n       If you play out the suits at the value they're claimed, it \n     would bankrupt these companies. So . . . we have to provide \n     liability protection to these private sector entities.\n\n  That is an incredible statement. It is amazing that a person in high \nGovernment would suggest that no matter how warranted this \ninvestigation may be, there is a higher calling, that we should not put \nthese companies in any kind of financial jeopardy, that we have to \nprovide liability protection to these private sector entities because \nit might bankrupt them.\n  To begin with, it is a clear exaggeration. First and foremost, we are \ntalking about some of the most successful\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\ncompanies in the United States, not only today but ever. Some of these \ncompanies have continued to earn record profits and sign up record \nnumbers of subscribers at the same time as this very public litigation, \ntotally undermining the argument, I might add, these lawsuits are doing \nthe telecoms severe reputational damage.\n  Remember, the discussion about these telecoms has now gone on for \nmonths. And yet in the public debate about whether the courts ought to \nbe able to examine these issues, there are reports that these companies \nhave been accumulating record profits. Companies that size could not be \ncompletely wiped out by anything but the most exorbitant and unlikely \njudgment. To assume that the telecoms would lose and that the judges \nwould hand them down such back-breaking penalties is already to take \nseveral leaps.\n  The point, after all, has never been to finally cripple our \ntelecommunications industry. That is not the point here at all. In \nfact, some have said: Look, I will support you striking this immunity, \nprovided you put a cap on damages these companies would suffer if in \nfact the plaintiffs prove to be correct. And I am more than happy to \nentertain that. I do not believe it is necessary, but if that is the \nargument, a damages cap would answer all of Mike McConnell's concerns, \nwithout even having to bring up immunity. I am prepared to agree to any \nkind of a cap you want--because the point to me is not the damages they \npay, but the damage they have done.\n  But to suggest somehow that there is a pricetag companies would have \nto pay which is more valuable than protecting people's privacy is a \nstunning, breathtaking comment from a high Government official, in my \nview. It is extremely troubling that our Director of National \nIntelligence even bothers to pronounce on ``liability protection for \nprivate sector entities.'' How did that even begin to be relevant to \nletting this case go forward? Since when do we throw entire lawsuits \nout because the defendant stood to lose too much? In plain English, \nhere is what Admiral McConnell is arguing: Some corporations are too \nrich to be sued. Even bringing money into the equation puts wealth \nabove justice, above due process. Rarely in public life in the years I \nhave served here have I ever heard an argument as venal as that on a \nmatter as serious as this one. It astounds me that some can speak in \nthe same breath about national security and the bottom line. Approve \nimmunity and Congress will state clearly: The richer you are, the more \nsuccessful you are, the more lawless you are entitled to be. A suit \nagainst you is a danger to the Republic! And so, at the rock bottom of \nits justifications, the telecoms' advocates are essentially arguing \nthat immunity can be bought.\n  The truth is exactly, of course, the opposite. The larger the \ncorporation, frankly, the greater the potential for abuse. Not that \nsuccess should make a company suspect at all; companies grow large, and \nessential to our economy because they are excellent at what they do. I \nsimply mean that size and wealth open the realm of possibilities for \nabuse far beyond the scope of the individual.\n  After all, if everything alleged is true, we are talking about one of \nthe most massive violations of privacy in American history. If \nreasonable search and seizure means opening a drug dealer's apartment, \nthe telecoms' alleged actions would be the equivalent of strip-\nsearching everyone in the building, ransacking their bedrooms, prying \nup all the floorboards. The scale of these cooperations opens \nunprecedented possibilities for abuse, possibilities far beyond the \npower of any one individual.\n  If the allegation against the telecoms is true, it constitutes one of \nthe most massive violations of privacy in American history. And it \nwould be inconceivable without the size and resources of a corporate \nbehemoth, the same size that makes Mike McConnell fear the \ncorporations' day in court. That is the massive scale we are talking \nabout, and that massive scale is precisely why no corporation must be \nabove the law.\n  On that scale, it is impossible to plead ignorance. As Judge Walker \nruled:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  Again, from a Republican appointee to the Federal bench. But the \narguments of the President's allies sink even lower. Listen to the \nwords of a House Republican leader spoken on Fox News. Candidly, they \nare shameful.\n\n       I believe that [the telecoms] deserve immunity from \n     lawsuits out there from typical trial lawyers trying to find \n     a way to get into the pockets of American companies.\n\n  Of course, some of the ``typical greedy trial lawyers'' bringing \nthese suits work for a nonprofit. And the telecoms that some want to \nportray as pitiful little Davids actually employ hundreds of attorneys, \nretain the best corporate law firms, and spend multimillion dollar \nlegal budgets.\n  But if the facts actually matter to immunity supporters, we would not \nbe here. For some, the prewritten narrative takes precedence far above \nthe mere facts; and here, it is the perennial narrative of the greedy \ntrial lawyers.\n  With that, some can rest content. They conclude that we were never \nserious about the law, or about privacy, or about checks and balances; \nit was about the money all along.\n  But we will not let them rest content. We are extremely serious. \nThere can no longer be any doubt: One by one the arguments of the \nimmunity supporters, of the telecoms' advocates, fail.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes and detail these claims and their \nfailures, if I may. The first argument from immunity supporters says:\n\n       The President has the authority to decide whether or not \n     telecoms should be granted immunity.\n\n  That is the first argument. The President has that implicit \nauthority. But the facts in this case belong in the courts. The \njudiciary should be allowed to determine whether the President has \nexceeded his powers by obtaining from the telecoms wholesale access to \nthe domestic communications of millions of ordinary Americans.\n  Whatever the arguments may be, let us assume for a second they are \ngoing to make this argument. Well, you can make an argument. Where is \nthe place you make that argument? Here in the legislative body or in \nthe courts? I think the simple answer is, if you have been to law \nschool for a week, the courts.\n  We are a government of three parts, coequal: executive, legislative, \nand judicial. The executive branch says: I have the right to do this. \nThe Congress can debate and certainly discuss it. But only in the \ncourts can we determine the constitutionality of that action.\n  Neither this body nor the other that comprise the legislative branch \nare charged with the responsibility of determining constitutionality. \nWhen Congress passes a law, the courts decide whether it is \nconstitutional. When the President acts, the courts decide whether it \nis constitutional. The executive branch does not decide whether we have \nacted constitutionally, and we do not decide whether the President has \nacted constitutionally. That is what the courts are for. This is basic \n101 stuff. This is basic stuff. You go to the courts to determine this \nquestion. And yet if we pass retroactive immunity--gone.\n  That is a great precedent. That is what future Congresses will look \nto, when deciding when some future President overreaches: What did the \nprevious Congresses do? And you will hear the argument in this Chamber \nyears hence: Well, back in 2008, when confronted with that question, \nthe Senate said that, frankly, the courts had no business with that, in \neffect, sanctioning what had occurred.\n  How else can you read this but as a sanction? If a majority of \nSenators here decides that retroactive immunity is warranted, what \nother conclusion can history draw from that, except we agreed with the \nPresident that he had the right to do what he did, and we will never \nknow the legal answer to the question. We will deprive the courts of \nthe opportunity to decide it.\n  We are overstepping our bounds incredibly by doing this, and hence \nthe reason for the first time in my more than a quarter century in this \nbody I am engaging in extended debate, because this is that important.\n  To allow a President, any President of any party, to mandate or \nrequire a public or private entity to invade the privacy of Americans \nto the extent that has occurred here, one of the most massive alleged \nviolations of privacy in\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nhistory, and not challenge it and have the courts determine the \nlegality or illegality of it, is an incredible precedent of historic \nproportions. It is not a small vote tomorrow. It is not a minor issue. \nIt is about as important and as basic and as fundamental as anything we \ncan ever do.\n  Remember that the administration's original immunity proposal \nprotected everyone. That is what they wanted. And executive immunity is \nnot in this bill only because Jay Rockefeller and Kit Bond and the \nother members of the committee said No. But do not forget that is what \nthey wanted. The administration came to the committee, and said: We \nwant you to grant immunity to everyone--the executive branch, the \ntelecoms, Justice Department, anyone else involved.\n  The committee turned them down. But they asked for it. They asked for \nit. And that has to be a part of this debate and discussion. It is not \nirrelevant. It is not insignificant that the President of the United \nStates asked the Intelligence Committee of the Senate to grant them and \neveryone else involved in this issue total immunity. What more do you \nneed to know about what the motives are? How much more do you need to \nfind out? The origin of immunity tells us a great deal about what is at \nstake here. It is self-preservation.\n  I have my own opinions about warrantless surveillance, about what \nwent on. But my opinions should not bear the weight of law. I think \nwhat these companies did was wrong. But I would be a fool to stand \nbefore you this evening and say I have the right to make that \ndetermination. But they should have not the right, either, to decide if \nit was legal. And that is what we are doing, in effect, by granting \nretroactive immunity.\n  The second argument is that only foreign communications are targeted.\n  Immunity supporters claim that only foreign communications were \ntargeted, not Americans' domestic calls. But the fact is that clear \nfirsthand evidence authenticated by these corporations in court \ncontradicts that claim. ``Splitters'' at AT's Internet hub in San \nFrancisco diverted into a secret room controlled by the NSA every e-\nmail, every text message, every phone call, foreign or domestic, \ncarried over the massive fiber optic lines of 16 separate companies for \nover 5 years.\n  Third, the Senate Intelligence Committee has preserved the role of \nthe judiciary so there is ample oversight. But the fact is, the role \nwould be empty. The Intelligence version of the bill before us would \nrequire the cases to be dismissed at a word from the Attorney General. \nThe central legal questions raised by these cases would never be heard. \nThe cases would never be fully closed. We would never really truly know \nwhat happened in these matters. So from a mere word of the Attorney \nGeneral, that is the end of it.\n  The fourth argument we have been hearing over the last number of \nmonths: A lack of immunity would compromise future cooperation between \nthe U.S. Government and the telecom industry. But remember: Since the \n1970s the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has compelled telecoms \nto cooperate with warranted surveillance, and it has immunized them \nentirely. They don't have a choice, in effect. If you are compelled by \na warrant to turn over the evidence, you don't have the choice of \ncooperating or not. The idea that the companies will say: We are just \nnot going to share that information with you--you don't have that \nluxury. When a court order comes and says: Turn over the evidence, you \nhave to turn it over. But, of course, the companies say: We don't want \nto because we will end up with a lot of lawsuits. To handle that very \nlegitimate issue raised initially by AT, which was part of drafting \nFISA in 1978, we said: Don't worry about that. We will immunize you so \nthere won't be any lawsuits that can be brought against you for doing \nwhat you are compelled to do by court order and a warrant.\n  So the argument that somehow we won't be cooperative with you is just \non its face factually wrong. You don't have the choice not to \ncooperate. What we do grant to you with that warrant is the fact that \nyou cannot be sued, which is a legitimate request to make.\n  That is not, of course, what happened here. The decision was made to \nturn over the evidence without a warrant, without a court order.\n  I pointed out before that according to the Washington Post, since \n1978 there have been over 18,700 court orders requested of the FISA \nCourt, and only 5 have been rejected in 30 years; 18,700-plus cases \nbefore the court, that secret, private Federal court, and in 99.9 \npercent of the cases, they have been approved. Only five have been \nrejected. But when you are receiving a court order, when the warrant \narrives and you are complying with it, as you are required, you also \nreceive immunity from legal prosecution or from lawsuits. So the \nargument somehow that these companies won't be as cooperative, if it \nweren't so sad, would almost be amusing.\n  This was a pay deal, by the way. It wasn't just patriotic duty. There \nwas a cost involved. We were writing checks to the telecommunications \nindustry. For whatever reason, when the Government stopped paying the \nchecks to the telecom industry, these great patriotic institutions \ndecided to stop the surveillance. Were they under a court order, had \nthere been a warrant insisting upon their compliance, they wouldn't \nhave the luxury of deciding not to comply. Only under this fact \nsituation we are debating this evening would these corporations have \nany ability to all of a sudden stop complying with the law or complying \nwith the request. So the irony of the argument is that the reverse is \nactually true. If you don't have a warrant and a court order, it is \nless likely you are apt to get that continual cooperation from these \nvery companies that can provide the information we need to keep us more \nsecure.\n  The fifth argument immunity supporters make is that telecoms can't \ndefend themselves because of the state secrets provision. I made this \ncase a while ago, but let me repeat it. The fact is that Federal \ndistrict court Judge Vaughn Walker has already ruled that the issue can \ngo to trial without putting state secrets in jeopardy. Judge Walker \npointed out that the existence of the warrantless surveillance program \nis hardly a secret at all.\n  I will quote him again. He said:\n\n       The Government has [already] disclosed the general contours \n     of the ``terrorist surveillance program,'' which requires the \n     assistance of a telecommunications provider.\n\n  So the argument that they can't defend themselves without exposing \nstate secrets has already been debunked.\n  The sixth argument that is made by those who support immunity is that \ndefendants are already shielded by common law principles. This is an \ninteresting one. Immunity supporters claim that telecoms are protected \nby common law principles, but the fact is that common law immunities do \nnot trump specific legal duties imposed by statute such as the specific \nduties Congress has long imposed on telecoms to protect customer \nprivacy and records.\n  In the pending case against AT, the judge already has ruled \nunequivocally that ``AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable \nentity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \ndragnet was legal.'' Even so, the communications company defendants can \nand should have the opportunity to present these defenses to the courts \nand the courts--not the Congress preemptively--should decide whether \nthey are sufficient.\n  The seventh argument that is being made by the supporters of immunity \nis that information leaks may compromise state secrets and national \nsecurity. I have heard this argument over and over and over again. The \nfact is, our Federal court system, in decade after decade of dealing \nwith delicate national security matters, has built up the expertise it \ntakes to secure that information behind closed doors. If we are still \nconcerned about national security being threatened as a result of these \ncases, we can simply get the principals a security clearance.\n\n  We can be increasingly confident that these cases will not expose \nstate secrets or intelligence sources, because after the extensive \nlitigation that has already taken place at both the district court and \ncircuit court level, no sensitive information has been leaked.\n  This is a red herring issue. It is one that they are going to fall \nback on over and over again. But it is no secret about what has been \ngoing on. It has been widely reported. The only thing we are talking \nabout is methods and means. Yet, over the decades, our Federal courts, \nin very sensitive matters,\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nhave protected that information. So this is a phony argument and ought \nnot to carry the day.\n  The eighth argument from those who support immunity: A lack of \nimmunity will harm the telecom companies. This is not unlike Admiral \nMcConnell's argument about finances. There will be reputational damage \nto the telecom industry. The fact is, there is no evidence that this \nlitigation has reduced or will reduce the defendant companies' bottom \nlines or customer base. These companies can only be harmed if they have \ndone something wrong. If they have not, they have nothing to worry \nabout. But the suggestion somehow that we should not go forward because \nyour reputation may be damaged is an insulting argument. It is \noffensive to suggest that we should harm the people's right to privacy \nbecause to prevent some reputational damage--they should be embarrassed \nto make that argument. After all, there is nothing to be damaged if you \nhave done nothing wrong. If you have done something wrong, then, of \ncourse, there will be some damage. And why shouldn't there be, if you \nhave done wrong? The courts are the ones to properly determine that.\n  The ninth argument: The magnitude of liability will bankrupt the \ntelecoms. I have addressed this already, but I will briefly respond to \nit as well.\n  As we have seen, huge corporations could only be wiped out by most \nenormous penalties and also the most unlikely penalties that could be \nimposed. It would take several leaps to assume that the telecoms would \nlose and that they will be slapped with huge judgments. But on another \nlevel, immunity supporters are staking their claim on a dangerous \nprinciple, that a suit can be stopped solely on the basis of how much \nthe defendant stands to lose. If we accept that premise, we could \nconceive of a corporation so wealthy, so integral to our economy, that \nits riches place it outside of the law altogether. That is a deeply \nflawed argument.\n  We see that none of these arguments for immunity stand. There is \nabsolutely no reason to halt the legal process and to bar the \ncourthouse door.\n  I think it is important at this moment to share with those who may be \nfollowing this discussion, how we got to this point. How did we find \nout about all of this? I said earlier that we would not be here \ndebating this this evening had it not been for a whistleblower, had it \nnot been for reports in the media about what was going on, that a 5-\nyear violation of privacy rights would have now turned into a 7- or 8-\nyear violation, unabated, unstopped--every phone conversation, fax, e-\nmail being literally swept up, from millions and millions of people.\n  But we got knowledge of this because of a gentleman by the name of \nMark Klein who was a former AT telecommunications technician who came \nforward to provide evidence of the company's collaboration with the \nNSA. Mark Klein is a remarkable individual, a person of knowledge and \nability when it comes to these matters. Let me read from Mark Klein's \ntestimony because I think it is important. This is all from him. These \nare not my words. These are words from Mark Klein, a person who worked \nat AT for more than 20 years as an employee and a technician who came \nforward to provide this information. Let me read his comments, if I \nmay, and put them into this debate.\n\n       For about 5 years, the Bush administration's National \n     Security Agency, with the help of the country's largest \n     telecommunications companies, has been collecting your e-\n     mail, accumulating information on your Web browser, and \n     gathering details about your Internet activity, all without \n     warrants and in violation of the U.S. Constitution and \n     several Federal and State laws. Even after the program was \n     exposed by the New York Times in December of 2005, the \n     President and other government officials consistently \n     defended the NSA's activities, insisting that the NSA only \n     collects communications into or from the United States where \n     one party to the communication is someone they believe to be \n     a member of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization. \n     But these claims are not true. I know they are not true, \n     because I have firsthand knowledge of the clandestine \n     collaboration between one giant telecommunications company \n     and the NSA to facilitate the most comprehensive spying \n     program in history. I have seen the NSA's vacuum cleaner \n     surveillance infrastructure with my own eyes. It is a vast \n     government-sponsored, warrantless spying program.\n       For over 22 years, I worked as a technician for AT While \n     working in San Francisco in 2002, I learned that a management \n     level technician, with AT's knowledge, had been cleared by \n     the NSA to work on a special but secret project, the \n     installation and maintenance of Internet equipment in a newly \n     constructed secure room in AT's central office in San \n     Francisco. Other than the NSA-cleared technician, no \n     employees were allowed in that room.\n       In October of 2003, I was transferred to that office and \n     was in particular assigned to oversee AT operations. As \n     part of my duties, I was required to connect circuits \n     carrying data to optical splitters which made a copy of the \n     light signal. But the splitters weakened the light signal \n     causing problems I had to troubleshoot. After examining \n     engineering documents given to the technicians which showed \n     the connections to the splitters, I discovered that there \n     they were hard wired to the secret room. In short, an exact \n     copy of all traffic that flowed through critical AT \n     cables--e-mails, documents, pictures, Web browsing, voiceover \n     Internet phone conversations--everything was being diverted \n     to equipment inside the secret room. In addition, the \n     documents revealed the technological gear used in their \n     secret project, including a highly sophisticated search \n     component capable of quickly sifting through huge amounts \n     of digital data, including text, voice, and images in \n     real-time, according to preprogrammed criteria. It is \n     important to understand that the Internet links which were \n     connected to the splitter contained not just foreign \n     communications, but vast amounts of domestic trafficking \n     all mixed together.\n       Furthermore, the splitter has no selective abilities. It is \n     just a dumb device which copies everything to the secret \n     room. And the links going through the splitter are AT's \n     physical connections to many other Internet providers; e.g., \n     Sprint, Qwest, Global Crossing Cable and Wireless, and the \n     critical west coast exchange point known as Mae West. Since \n     these networks are interconnected, the government's \n     surveillance affects not only AT customers, but everyone \n     else--millions of Americans.\n\n  I repeat again, I am reading the testimony of Mark Klein who was the \nwhistleblower who revealed this 5-year-long warrantless surveillance \nprogram. Mark Klein goes on:\n\n       I also discovered in my conversations with other \n     technicians that other secret rooms were established in \n     Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego. One of the \n     documents I obtained also mentioned Atlanta, and the clear \n     inference and the logic of this setup and the language of the \n     documents is that there are other such rooms across the \n     country to complete the coverage--possibly 15 to 20 more. So \n     when reports of the government's extensive wiretapping \n     program surfaced in December of 2005, after I had left AT, \n     I realized two things. First, that I had been a witness to a \n     massive spying effort that violated the rights of millions of \n     Americans; and second, that the government was not telling \n     the public the truth about the extent of their \n     unconstitutional invasion of privacy.\n       In the spring of 2006, I became a witness for the \n     Electronic Frontier Foundation's lawsuit against AT The \n     New York Times on April 13 of 2006 reported that four \n     independent technical experts who examined the AT documents \n     all said that the documents showed that AT had an agreement \n     with the Federal Government to systematically gather \n     information flowing on the Internet.\n\n  That is the testimony of Mark Klein.\n  I think it is important as well to share with my colleagues the \ntestimony of Brian Ried, currently the Director of Engineering and \nTechnical Operations at Internet Systems Consortium, a nonprofit \norganization devoted to supporting a nonproprietary Internet. This is a \nperson of extensive knowledge. I am going to read his testimony about \nthe technical arrangements. This is clearly above my pay grade to \nunderstand all of this with this gray head of hair I have, but to those \nwho are listening or watching any of this, this will explain how this \nactually worked. So I am going to read this as if I actually know what \nI am talking about. So let me read exactly the words of Brian Ried, the \nstatement of telecommunications expert Brian Ried, an AT \nwhistleblower, about Mark Klein's revelations.\n\n       I am a telecommunications and data networking expert.\n\n  That is again Brian Ried speaking here who has been involved in the \ndevelopment of several critical Internet technologies.\n\n       I was a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford \n     University and of computer sciences at Carnegie Melon \n     University West. I have carefully reviewed the AT \n     authenticated documents and declaration provided by Mark \n     Klein and the public redacted version of the expert \n     declaration of Jay Scott Marcus, both filed in the Hepting v. \n     AT litigation. Combining the information contained in those \n     declarations and documents with my extensive knowledge of the \n     international telecommunications infrastructure and the \n     technology regularly used for lawful surveillance pursuant to \n     warrants\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\n     and court orders, I believe Mr. Klein's evidence is strongly \n     supportive of widespread, untargeted surveillance of ordinary \n     people, both AT customers and others.\n       The AT documents describe a technological setup of the \n     AT facility in San Francisco. This setup is particularly \n     well suited to wholesale dragnet surveillance of all \n     communications passing through the facility, whether \n     international or domestic. These documents describe how the \n     fiberoptic cables were cut and splitters installed at the cut \n     point. Fiberoptic splitters work just like ordinary TV \n     splitters. One cable feeds in and two cables feed out. Both \n     cables carry a copy of absolutely everything that is sent, \n     and if the second cable is connected to a monitoring station, \n     that station sees all traffic going over the cable.\n       Mr. Klein stated that the second cable was routed into a \n     room at the facility which access was restricted to AT \n     employees having clearances from the National Security \n     Agency. The documents indicate that similar facilities were \n     being installed in Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San \n     Diego. The documents also reference a somewhat similar \n     facility in Atlanta. This infrastructure is capable of \n     monitoring all traffic passing through the AT facility, \n     some of it not even from AT customers, whether voice or \n     data or fax, international, or domestic. The most likely use \n     of this infrastructure is wholesale, untargeted surveillance \n     of ordinary Americans at the behest of the NSA. NSA \n     involvement undermines arguments that the facility is \n     intended for use by AT in protecting its own network \n     operations.\n       This infrastructure is not limited to, nor would it be \n     especially efficient for targeted surveillance or even an \n     untargeted surveillance aimed at communications where one of \n     the ends is located outside of the United States. It is also \n     not reasonably aimed at supporting AT operations and \n     security procedures. There are 3 main reasons. \n     The technological infrastructure is far more powerful and \n     expansive than that needed to do targeted surveillance or \n     surveillance aimed at only international or one end \n     foreign communications. For example, it includes a Narus \n     6400, a computer that can simultaneously analyze huge \n     amounts of information based on rules provided by the \n     machine operator, analyze the content of messages and \n     other information--not just headers or routing \n     information--conduct the analysis in real-time rather than \n     after a delay, correlate information from multiple \n     sources, multiple formats, over many protocols and through \n     different periods of time in that analysis.\n       The documents describe a secret private backbone network \n     separate from the public network where normal AT customer \n     traffic is carried and transmitted. A separate backbone \n     network would not be required for transmission of the smaller \n     amounts of data captured by a targeted surveillance. You \n     don't need that magnitude of transport capacity if you are \n     doing targeted surveillance.\n       The San Francisco facility is not located near an entry-\n     exit point for international communications that happened to \n     be transmitted through the United States either through under \n     sea cable or via satellite. As a result, it would not be a \n     sensible place to locate aimed at simply monitoring traffic \n     to or from foreign countries.\n\n  I apologize for reading these technical documents, but I think they \nshed some light. We are talking about very knowledgeable, expert people \ndescribing technically what was done, the magnitude of it, the capacity \nof it, the effort that was made, obviously, to see to it, as Mr. Klein \ncalls it, a dumb machine that would not discriminate between \ninformation that might only be used to protect us from al-Qaida, and \nwholesale invasion of privacy.\n  But putting aside all that--had they sought a warrant and a court \norder, as they should have done, then arguably AT and others involved \nwould be protected today and be immunized against lawsuits, if it had \nbeen done under the FISA legislation. The fact that the administration \ndecided to totally disregard 30 years of legislation, of working courts \nthat have provided, in over 18,700 examples, approval of such requests, \nrejecting only 5, shows an arrogance that shouldn't be ignored.\n  So again, tomorrow when the votes occur on cloture and the votes \noccur on these amendments, we will may sanctioning this activity--\nsetting the unprecedented precedent of a Congress actually providing \nimmunity from the courts even examining whether warrantless spying is \nlegal and right. Hence, in future years, this will be cited, I am \nconfident, by those who want to undermine the FISA Courts, deprive the \ncourts the opportunity to make sure there is a justification, an \nargument, a legal basis for granting these warrants. The argument will \nbe made: You don't need the courts, because back in 2008, \ntelecommunications companies, at the mere request of a President, were \nable to go forward and spend more than 5 years invading the privacy of \nmillions of Americans, and when the Senate had an opportunity to \nsanction that activity, it decided to do so, rather than allow the \ncourt to determine whether that action was legal.\n  The word of the Senate should be a valued--I can hear the argument \nyears hence. They listened to the debates, they listened to that fellow \nDodd get up and talk for hours about the issue of immunity and why it \nshouldn't be granted retroactively and they turned him down. That will \nbe the precedent cited when faced with similar allegations involving \nfuture administrations that may decide that financial information, \nmedical information, highly private, personal, family information may \nbe the subject of unwarranted surveillance to allegedly protect our \ncountry and keeping us safe. If that is the case, I am confident this \ndebate and these votes will be cited as a justification for allowing \nthat kind of activity to go forward without receiving the legal \nauthority to do so. We will have denied the courts the opportunity to \ndecide whether this activity that was the most serious invasion of \nprivacy ever maybe in our country was legal or illegal. By granting \nretroactive immunity, we will have made a decision to deprive the \ncourts of that responsibility.\n  Ultimately, all I am asking for is a fair fight. To reject immunity \nwould mean to grab hold of the closest thread of lawlessness we have at \nhand and to pull until the whole garment unravels. But ensuring a day \nin court is not the same as ensuring a verdict. When that day comes, I \nhave absolutely no investment in the verdict, either way. It may be the \nFederal Government broke the law when they asked the telecoms to spy \nbut that the telecoms' response was an innocent one. It may be the \nGovernment was within the law and that the telecoms broke it. Maybe \nthey both broke the law. Maybe neither did.\n  But just as it would be absurd to declare the telecoms clearly \nguilty, it is equally absurd, I would argue, to close the case in \nCongress without a decision. That is what immunity does: It closes the \ncase without a decision. Throughout this debate, the telecoms' \nadvocates have needed to show not just that they are right but that \nthey are so right and that we are so far beyond the pale that we can \nshut down the argument right here, today. That is a burden they have \nclearly not met, and they cannot expect to meet it when a huge majority \nof Senators who will make the decision have not even seen the secret \ndocuments that are supposed to prove the case for retroactive immunity.\n  My trust is in the courts, in the cases argued openly, in the judges \nwho preside over them, and in the juries of American citizens who \ndecide them. They should be our pride, not our embarrassment, and they \ndeserve to do their jobs.\n  As complex, as diverse, as relentless as the assault on the rule of \nlaw has been, our answer to it is a simple one. Far more than any \nPresident's lawlessness, the American way of justice remains deeply \nrooted in our character; that no President can disturb or should be \nallowed to do so.\n  So I am full of hope. Even on this dark evening, I have faith that we \ncan unite security and justice because we have already done it for 30 \nyears. My father, Senator Tom Dodd, was the number two American \nprosecutor at the famous Nuremburg trials, which may have something to \ndo with the passion I feel about this issue--the rule of law.\n  I have never forgotten the example he and Justice Robert Jackson and \nothers set at Nuremberg more than 60 years ago.\n  As Justice Robert Jackson said in the opening statement at \nNuremberg--in fact, I have written it down, but I memorized this years \nand years ago. Robert Jackson's opening statement, speaking to the \ncourt, talking about the Soviet Union, the British, the French, and \nAmerica, he made the following argument:\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily \n     submitting their captive enemies to the judgment of the law \n     is one of the most significant tributes that power ever paid \n     to reason.\n\n  That is a great sentence when you think of it. Here we are staying \nthe hands of vengeance and power, paying tribute to reason. At \nNuremberg, there were 21 initial defendants. Madam President, 55 \nmillion people had died, 6\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\nmillion Jews were incinerated, and 5 million others had the same fate \nbefall them because of their politics, religion, or sexual orientation. \nThese were some of the greatest crimes in recorded history. Winston \nChurchill wanted to summarily execute every one of them. The Soviets \nwanted a show trial for a week and then to kill them all. Robert \nJackson, Harry Truman, Henry Stinton, the Secretary of War in \nRoosevelt's Cabinet--this handful of people said: The United States is \ndifferent. We are going to do something no one else has ever done \nbefore. We are going to give these defendants, as great violators of \nhuman rights as they are, a day in court. It was unprecedented.\n  Here they are, the war still raging in the Pacific, gathering in \nNuremberg, Germany, which had 30,000 people buried in the rubble of the \ncity. Prosecutors, judges, and lawyers for these individuals gathered \ntogether and gave them a day in court that went on for a year.\n  And the United States gained the moral high ground. Never before in \nhistory had the victors given those guilty of the worse atrocities \nimaginable a day in court.\n  I cannot believe this country, at this hour, would walk away from the \nrule of law when we stood for it so proudly in the 20th century. In \nfact, that experience at Nuremberg gave birth to a half-century of \nmoral authority. It paved the way for the Marshall Plan and for the \ninternational structures that gave the world relative peace for more \nthan a half century. For so many years, both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations stood up for them and defended them. The international \ncriminal courts and others--none of these institutions would have \nexisted were it not for the United States leading.\n  Today, when we find ourselves at this moment in this body--of all \nplaces--walking away from the rule of law, I think it is a dark hour. \nAgain, my hope is that by tomorrow reason will prevail here, and we \nwill arrive at a different decision and reject this idea that \nretroactive immunity is warranted.\n  What is the tribute that power owes to reason? That when America goes \nto war, it doesn't fight for land or for treasure or for dominance but \nfor a transcendent idea--the idea that laws should rule and not men; \nthe idea that the Constitution does not get suspended for vengeance; \nthe idea that this great Nation should never tailor its eternal \nprinciples to the conflict of the moment because, if we did, we would \nbe walking in the footsteps of the enemies we despised.\n  The tribute that power owes to reason: More than ever before, that \ntribute is due today. If we cannot find the strength to pay it, we will \nhave to answer for it.\n  There is a famous military recruiting poster that comes to mind. A \nman is sitting in an easy chair with his son and daughter on his lap, \nin some future after the war has ended. His daughter asks him: Daddy, \nwhat did you do in the war?\n  His face is shocked and shamed, because he knows he did nothing.\n  My daughters, Grace and Christina, are 3 and 6 years old. They are \ngrowing up in a time of two great conflicts: one between our Nation and \nenemies, and another between what is best and worst in our American \nsoul. Someday soon I know I am going to hear the question: What did you \ndo?\n  I want more than anything else to give the right answer to that \nquestion. That question is coming from every single one of us in this \nbody. Every single one of us will be judged by a jury from whom there \nis no hiding: our sons and daughters and grandchildren. Someday soon \nthey will read in their textbooks the story of a great nation, one that \nthrew down tyrants and oppressors for two centuries; one that rid the \nworld of Naziism and Soviet communism; one that proved that great \nstrength can serve great virtue, that right can truly make might. Then \nthey will read how, in the early years of the 21st century, that Nation \nlost its way.\n  We don't have the power to strike that chapter. We cannot go back. We \ncannot undestroy the CIA's interrogation tapes. We cannot unpass the \nMilitary Commissions Act. We cannot unspeak Alberto Gonzales' \ndisgraceful testimony. We cannot untorture innocent people. And, \nperhaps, sadly, shamefully, we cannot stop retroactive immunity. We \ncannot undo all that has been done for the last 6 years for the cause \nof lawlessness and fear. We cannot blot out that chapter. But we can \nbegin the next one, even today.\n  Let the first words read: Finally, in February 2008, the Senate said: \nEnough is enough.\n  I implore my colleagues to write it with me. I implore my colleagues \nto vote against retroactive immunity. I implore them to reject it, and \nif we fail to do that, to vote against cloture.\n  I have shared my thoughts and views at some length now. But there are \nothers who have spoken eloquently on this subject. I think their words \ndeserve to be heard because they state far more eloquently than I could \nthe importance of all of this and why this is such a compelling case \nand deserving of our attention. Let me share a few of these words from \nthe New York Times:\n\n       Even by the dismal standards of what passes for a national \n     debate on intelligence and civil liberties, last week was a \n     really bad week.\n       The Senate debated a bill that would make needed updates to \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--while needlessly \n     expanding the president's ability to spy on Americans without \n     a warrant and covering up the unlawful spying that President \n     Bush ordered after 9/11.\n       The Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, \n     John Rockefeller of West Virginia, led the way in killing \n     amendments that would have strengthened requirements for \n     warrants and raised the possibility of at least some \n     accountability for past wrongdoing. Republicans declaimed \n     about protecting America from terrorists--as if anyone was \n     arguing the opposite--and had little to say about protecting \n     Americans' rights.\n       We saw a ray of hope when the head of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency conceded--finally--that waterboarding was \n     probably illegal. But his boss, the 'director of national \n     intelligence, insisted it was legal when done to real bad \n     guys. And Vice President Dick Cheney--surprise!--made it \n     clear that President Bush would authorize waterboarding \n     whenever he wanted.\n       The Catch-22 metaphor is seriously overused, but consider \n     this: Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Congress there \n     would be no criminal investigation into waterboarding. He \n     said the Justice Department decided waterboarding was legal \n     (remember the torture memo?) and told the C.I.A. that.\n       So, according to Mukaseyan logic, the Justice Department \n     cannot investigate those who may have committed torture, \n     because the Justice Department said it was O.K. and Justice \n     cannot be expected to investigate itself.\n       As it was with torture, so it was with wiretaps.\n       After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the President decided to \n     ignore the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, \n     and authorized wiretaps without a warrant on electronic \n     communications between people in the United States and people \n     abroad. Administration lawyers ginned up a legal \n     justification and then asked communications companies for \n     vast amounts of data.\n       According to Mr. Rockefeller, the companies were ``sent \n     letters, all of which stated that the relevant activities had \n     been authorized by the President'' and that the Attorney \n     General--then John Ashcroft--decided the activity was lawful. \n     The legal justification remains secret, but we suspect it was \n     based on the finely developed theory that the government \n     cannot be sued for doing so if they were obeying a warrant--\n     or a certification from the Attorney General that a warrant \n     was not needed--and all federal statutes were being obeyed.\n       When Mr. Bush started his spying program, FISA allowed \n     warrantless eavesdropping for up to a year if the president \n     certified that it was directed at a foreign power, or the \n     agent of a foreign power, and there was no real chance that \n     communications involving United States citizens or residents \n     would be caught up. As we now know, the surveillance included \n     Americans and there was no ``foreign power'' involved.\n       The law then, and now, also requires the attorney general \n     to certify ``in writing under oath'' that the surveillance is \n     legal under FISA, not some fanciful theory of executive \n     power. He is required to inform Congress 30 days in advance, \n     and then periodically report to the House and Senate \n     intelligence panels.\n       Congress was certainly not informed, and if Mr. Ashcroft or \n     later Alberto Gonzales certified anything under oath, it's a \n     mystery to whom and when. The eavesdropping went on for four \n     years and would probably still be going on if The Times had \n     not revealed it.\n       So what were the telecommunications companies told? Since \n     the administration is not going to investigate this either, \n     civil actions are the only alternative.\n       The telecoms, which are facing about 40 pending lawsuits, \n     believe they are protected by a separate law that says \n     companies that give communications data to the government \n     cannot be sued for doing so if they were obeying a \n     warrant--or a certification from the attorney general that \n     a warrant was not needed--and all federal statutes were \n     being obeyed.\n       To defend themselves, the companies must be able to show \n     they cooperated and produce that certification. But the White \n     House does\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\n     not want the public to see the documents, since it seems \n     clear that the legal requirements were not met. It is \n     invoking the state secrets privilege--saying that as a matter \n     of national security, it will not confirm that any company \n     cooperated with the wiretapping or permit the documents to be \n     disclosed in court.\n       So Mr. Rockefeller and other senators want to give the \n     companies immunity even if the administration never admits \n     they were involved. This is short-circuiting the legal \n     system. If it is approved, we will then have to hope that the \n     next president will be willing to reveal the truth.\n       Mr. Rockefeller argues that companies might balk at future \n     warrantless spying programs. Imagine that!\n       This whole nightmare was started by Mr. Bush's decision to \n     spy without warrants--not because they are hard to get, but \n     because he decided he was above the law. Discouraging that \n     would be a service to the nation.\n       This debate is not about whether the United States is going \n     to spy on Al Qaeda, it is about whether it is going to \n     destroy its democratic principles in doing so. Senators who \n     care about that should vote against immunity.\n\n  Madam President, if I can, I will read from the USA Today, which also \nhad a good editorial on this subject matter, dated October 22, 2007. It \nis entitled, ``Our View On Your Phone Records: Immunity Demand For \nTelecoms Raises Questions.''\n\n       As history shows, mass snooping can sweep up innocent \n     citizens.\n       Anyone who has ever watched TV's Law & Order: SVU knows how \n     easy it is for police to get the bad guys' LUDs--``local \n     usage details,'' better known as telephone calling records. \n     They only need to get a prosecutor to sign a subpoena.\n       Eavesdropping on calls or reading e-mails is a bit tougher. \n     A warrant must come from a judge, and stronger evidence is \n     needed. Even so, it is an efficient process that serves law \n     enforcement's needs while guarding against arbitrary \n     intrusions into the privacy of innocent people.\n       But whether those protections still exist in national \n     security cases is very much in doubt.\n       Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration has \n     repeatedly bypassed the special court set up to preserve \n     balance. Now, with Congress threatening to restore some level \n     of protection, the administration is insisting on legal \n     immunity for telecommunications companies that might have \n     turned over records improperly. Last week, a key Senate \n     committee agreed.\n       The request alone is enough to raise suspicion, \n     particularly given the nation's history.\n       In the 1960s and '70s when law enforcement and spy agencies \n     launched mass snooping against U.S. citizens, some of the \n     data ended up being used for nefarious purposes, such as IRS \n     tax probes, that had nothing to do with protecting the \n     nation.\n       That is the danger when an administration can tap into \n     phone records without court oversight, and it is what's at \n     issue now.\n       The administration has repeatedly bypassed the special \n     national security court, arguing that the urgency of the war \n     on terrorism justified its actions.\n       In one particularly troubling intrusion, the National \n     Security Agency (NSA), a Pentagon-run spy agency, built a \n     database--with cooperation from some telecom companies--that \n     includes America's domestic calls. The extent of the program \n     remains hidden, one reason many in Congress are reluctant to \n     grab the company's immunity.\n       According to the account of one former CEO, the NSA foray \n     has already led to abuse. When Qwest, one of the nation's \n     largest telecom companies, refused to go along with the NSA \n     program--because Qwest lawyers considered it illegal--the NSA \n     allegedly retaliated by denying Qwest other lucrative \n     government contracts. Further, the requests to participate, \n     according to former Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio, \n     came six months before the 9/11 attacks. Nacchio's \n     allegations are in court findings unsealed this month that \n     are part of his battle over a conviction of insider trading.\n       If the Senate measure becomes law, telecom companies will \n     get immunity from nearly 40 lawsuits without the public \n     knowing what the companies or the government did. Never mind \n     that six of the lawsuits were brought by state officials--\n     from New Jersey to Missouri--concerned about possible \n     violation of citizens' privacy.\n       There might be some valid reason to grant immunity. The \n     Senate committee agreed after seeing details. But even if \n     there is, the companies should be compelled to tell the \n     public the precise nature and reach of the program, and the \n     program should be put firmly under court review.\n       The Senate measure also would place minimal court \n     supervision over future surveillance ventures. A far more \n     sensible House Democratic measure would give the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court a greater role.\n       That system works well, even in emergencies. In the \n     harrowing minutes after the Pentagon was attacked on 9/11, \n     the court's chief judge, stuck in his car, granted five \n     surveillance warrants from his cell phone.\n       Speed, obviously, is important. Nevertheless, it can be \n     achieved without discarding protections that long ago proved \n     their worth.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News had a good article as well on Friday, October \n19, of last year, entitled ``Beck and Call: Verizon too eager to \nsurrender phone records'':\n\n       Verizon's willingness to turn over customer telephone \n     records when the government asks--even though investigators \n     often make such requests without a court order--is a \n     troubling practice.\n       The company may be motivated by a desire to help--or to \n     avoid government confrontation. But Verizon's approach, \n     disclosed in a letter to Congress this week, is the wrong way \n     to go about this.\n       The burden of proof rests with the federal government to \n     prove its need for the records. Except in rare instances, \n     investigators must take their records requests to a judge who \n     then can determine whether to issue a warrant. The \n     Constitution intends just that, in language that fairly \n     balances privacy fears and law enforcement.\n       Yet the Bush administration insists on continuing to push \n     the post-9/11 civil liberties vs. security debate in the \n     wrong direction. Because telecom companies that have complied \n     with its requests now face huge lawsuits from citizens-rights \n     groups, the administration wants a law to grant immune \n     businesses sued for disclosing information without court \n     authorization.\n       Congress is right to look at the immunity proposal with a \n     skeptical eye, especially since the administration has been \n     reluctant to explain details of its controversial \n     surveillance program to lawmakers. The law would further \n     erode the privacy firewall and remove another layer of checks \n     and balances.\n       The phone companies, meanwhile, have refused to tell \n     relevant congressional committees whether they participated \n     in the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping \n     program. Their silence is based on concerns that they might \n     illegally divulge classified information if they talk to \n     Congress in too much detail.\n       Yet Congress and the courts have legitimate oversight roles \n     in issues of privacy and national security. Due process is \n     necessary to promote transparency and accountability in a \n     democracy. These are foundational principles, even in the \n     more dangerous post-9/11 world.\n\n  There is a further piece I think is worthy of reading, written in \nDecember of 2005 by a former majority leader of this great body, Tom \nDaschle. It's called ``Power We Didn't Grab.'' Tom Daschle was deeply \ninvolved, I should point out, in the negotiations dealing with many of \nthese matters, particularly in the wake of the resolution that was \ndrafted granting the President the authority to go after al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan. Alberto Gonzales later argued that with the adoption of \nthat resolution, Congress was granting the President authority to \nconduct the warrantless surveillance that is the subject of our \ndiscussion this evening.\n  That resolution was the subject of some negotiation over several days \nbefore it was presented for a final vote in this body. So it is worthy \nof consideration that Tom Daschle would write a piece in the Washington \nPost when Alberto Gonzales made the argument that the President's \nauthority to require the phone companies to comply with his request \nwithout a court order was, in fact, never the subject of those \nnegotiations.\n  I will read Tom Daschle's words on December 23, 2005:\n\n       In the face of mounting questions about news stories saying \n     that President Bush approved a program to wiretap American \n     citizens without getting warrants, the White House argues \n     that Congress granted it authority for such surveillance in \n     the 2001 legislation authorizing the use of force against al \n     Qaeda. On Tuesday, Vice President Cheney said the president \n     ``was granted authority by the Congress to use all means \n     necessary to take on the terrorists, and that's what we've \n     done.''\n       As Senate majority leader at the time, I helped negotiate \n     that law with the White House counsel's office over two \n     harried days. I can state categorically that the subject of \n     warrantless wiretaps of American citizens never came up. I \n     did not and never would have supported giving authority to \n     the president for such wiretaps. I am also confident that the \n     98 senators who voted in favor of authorization of force \n     against al Qaeda did not believe that they were also voting \n     for warrantless domestic surveillance.\n       On the evening of Sept. 12, 2001, the White House proposed \n     that Congress authorize the use of military force to ``deter \n     and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression \n     against the United States.'' Believing the scope of this \n     language was too broad and ill defined, Congress chose \n     instead, on Sept. 14, to authorize ``all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations or \n     persons [the president] determines planned, authorized, \n     committed, or aided'' the attacks of Sept. 11. With this \n     language, Congress denied the president the more expansive \n     authority he sought and insisted that his authority be used \n     specifically against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\n       Just before the Senate acted on this compromise resolution, \n     the White House sought one last change. Literally minutes \n     before the Senate cast its vote, the administration sought to \n     add the words ``in the United States and'' after \n     ``appropriate force'' in the agreed-upon text. This last-\n     minute change would have given the president broad authority \n     to exercise expansive powers not just overseas--where we all \n     understand he wanted authority to act--but right here in the \n     United States, potentially against American citizens. I could \n     see no justification for Congress to accede to this \n     extraordinary request for additional authority. I refused.\n       The shock and rage we all felt in the hours after the \n     attack was still fresh. America was reeling for the first \n     attack on our soil since Pearl Harbor. We suspected thousands \n     had been killed, and many who worked in the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon were not yet accounted for. Even so, \n     a strong bipartisan majority could not agree to the \n     administration's request for an unprecedented grant of \n     authority.\n       The Bush administration now argues those powers were \n     inherently contained in the resolution adopted by Congress--\n     but at the time, the administration clearly felt they weren't \n     or it wouldn't have tried to insert the additional language.\n       All Americans agreed that keeping our nation safe from \n     terrorists demands aggressive and innovative tactics. This \n     unity was reflected in the near-unanimous support for the \n     original resolution and the Patriot Act in those harrowing \n     days after Sept. 11. But there are right and wrong ways to \n     defeat terrorists, and that is a distinction this \n     administration has never seemed to accept. Instead of \n     employing tactics that preserve Americans' freedoms and \n     inspire the faith and confidence of the American people, the \n     White House seems to have chosen methods that can only breed \n     fear and suspicion.\n       If the stories in the media over the past week are \n     accurate, the president has exercised authority that I do not \n     believe is granted to him in the Constitution, and that I \n     know is not granted to him in the law I helped negotiate with \n     his counsel and that Congress approved in the days after \n     Sept. 11. For that reason, the president should explain the \n     specific legal justification for his authorization of these \n     actions, Congress should fully investigate these actions and \n     the president's justification for them, and the \n     administration should cooperate fully with that \n     investigation.\n       In the meantime, if the president believes the current \n     legal architecture of our country is sufficient for the fight \n     against terrorism, he should propose changes to our laws in \n     the light of day.\n       That is how a great democracy operates. And that is how \n     this great democracy will defeat terrorism.\n\n  Those were eloquent words from our former majority leader who was, as \nI said, deeply involved in the negotiations crafting the resolution \nthat was adopted almost unanimously, allowing us to attack al-Qaida, to \ndefeat them in Afghanistan. Regrettably, Osama bin Laden and too many \nof his operatives are still on the loose. But that language gave the \nPresident the authority to act against them. He specifically wanted \nmore authority at home. The majority leader and those who worked with \nhim rejected that argument and that resolution adopted in 2001, 48 \nhours after the attack, specifically excluded the kind of activity that \nAlberto Gonzales and Vice President Cheney claimed was granted in that \nresolution.\n  It was worthy to note the language of Senator Daschle during that \ndebate.\n  I am going to read one more piece, if I may, again going back to \nOctober. It is ``Immunity for Telecoms May Set Bad Precedent, Legal \nScholars Say. Retroactive problems could create problems in the \nfuture.'' This is by Dan Eggen. This was written in October of 2007.\n  I made the argument earlier that I was concerned about the precedent-\nsetting nature of what we are doing. This evening I have been reaching \nback 30 years to language used by our predecessors in this Chamber, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who were part of the Church Commission that \ncrafted the FISA legislation and the language they used, which easily \ncould have been written yesterday and describing the debate we are \nhaving these days. We are calling upon them to guide us as we make our \ndecisions about how to proceed in this day's work with the different \nthreats we face, but the threats our predecessors faced were not small \nthreats--the Soviet Union, a nuclear holocaust, significant problems of \nsurveillance. They had the courage and the wisdom to step back and to \ncreate a structure that allowed us to maintain that balance between \nsecurity and liberty.\n  So it is important because I am concerned that at some future date \nthat the votes tomorrow may give a strong precedent to those who have \nnever liked the idea of Federal courts granting warrants to conduct \nsurveillance but prefer this be done at the mere request of an American \nPresident.\n  I made the case that when the Framers fashioned this Republic of \nours, had efficiency been their goal, they never would have established \na written system that had so many inefficiencies in it. In fact, \nrequiring the checks and balances of an executive, judicial, and \nlegislative branch with all of the requirements that we insist upon \nmake this system terribly inefficient in many ways. But the Founders of \nthis Republic were not only concerned about what we did but how we did \nthings. It is terribly important to be mindful of that in these \ndebates. Clearly, we need to gather information, and we need to be able \nto do it in an expeditious fashion. But we also need to make sure that \nhow we do that is not going to violate more than 220 years of history, \nof guaranteeing the rights and liberties of individual citizens.\n\n  Thirty years ago, a previous Senate found a way to do that with the \nestablishment of the secret Federal courts. These courts are \nestablished by the Chief Justice of the United States, who appoints \nsitting Federal judges anonymously to serve on these courts. None of us \never get to know who they are. But as I pointed out earlier, even on 9/\n11, a cell phone one of these secret FISA judges was able to respond \ninstantaneously to the request being made to conduct surveillance \nnecessary in the minutes after 9/11.\n  So it is important not only what we do about today's problem but the \nmessage we send, the precedent we set for future Congresses when \nconfronted in their day, as they will be, with challenges regarding the \nbalance between security and liberty.\n  So this article, written by Dan Eggen, I think has value, talking \nabout how retroactive protection could create problems in the future.\n\n       When previous Republican administrations were accused of \n     illegality in the FBI and CIA spying abuses of the 1970s or \n     the Iran Contra affair of the 1980s, Democrats in Congress \n     launched investigations or pushed for legislative reforms.\n       But last week, faced with admissions by several \n     telecommunication companies that they assisted the Bush \n     administration in warrantless spying on Americans, leaders of \n     the Senate Intelligence Committee took a much different tack, \n     opposing legislation that would grant those companies \n     retroactive immunity from prosecution or lawsuits.\n       The proposal marks the second time in recent years that \n     Congress has moved toward providing legal immunity for past \n     actions that may have been illegal. The Military Commissions \n     Act, passed by the GOP-led Congress in September of 2006, \n     provided retroactive immunity for CIA interrogators who could \n     have been accused of war crimes for mistreating detainees.\n       Legal experts say the granting of such retroactive immunity \n     by Congress is unusual, particularly in a case involving \n     private companies. Congress, on only a few occasions, has \n     given some form of immunity to law enforcement officers, \n     intelligence officials, or others within the government, or \n     to some of its contractors, experts said. In 2005, Congress \n     also approved a law granting firearms manufacturers immunity \n     from lawsuits by victims of gun violence.\n       ``It's particularly unusual in the case of the telecoms, \n     because you don't really know what you are immunizing,'' said \n     Louis Fisher, a specialist in constitutional law with the Law \n     Library of the Library of Congress. ``You don't know what you \n     are cleaning up.''\n       As part of a surveillance package approved Thursday by the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee, some telecommunications \n     companies would be granted immunity from about 40 pending \n     lawsuits that allege they violated Americans' privacy and \n     constitutional rights by aiding a warrantless wireless \n     surveillance program instituted after the September 11, 2001, \n     attacks.\n\n  I might point out here--and I will digress for a second--that we \nheard earlier testimony that this program may have actually started \nprior to the attacks of 9/11. There has been testimony submitted in \ncourts by one of the telecoms, Qwest's CEO, that in fact a request was \nmade of them to actually provide warrantless surveillance in January of \n2001, when the administration took office, long before the attacks of \n9/11. So it seems to me that alone ought to be the subject of some \ninquiry.\n  We have all accepted the notion that immediately after 9/11, whether \nwe liked it or not, it was understandable how in the emotions of the \nmoment, that companies, at the request of an administration, even here \nan administration requesting warrantless surveillance, might have \nacted. Not that we\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nwould agree or like it but most would understand it.\n  My objection, as I said earlier, is not that it went on but that it \nwent on for the next 5 years and would still be ongoing were it not for \nthe whistleblower and the reports in the media. But what is troubling \nto me is we are assuming this all began after 9/11. There may now be \nsome evidence it began before 9/11, which would debunk a lot of \narguments given on why we should grant retroactive immunity. I merely \npoint this out because we read earlier in testimony here that suggested \nthis might have been done earlier.\n  At any rate, I will continue from Mr. Eggen's article talking about \nthe provision we are talking about here.\n\n       The provision is a key concession to the administration and \n     the companies, which lobbied heavily for it.\n\n  Referring to the retroactive immunity.\n\n       Supporters argue the legislation is needed to avoid unfair \n     punishment of private firms that took part in good-faith \n     efforts to assist the government.\n       In arguing in favor of such protections earlier this month, \n     President Bush said any legislation ``must grant liability \n     protection to companies who are facing multibillion dollar \n     lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in \n     the efforts to defend our Nation following the 9/11 \n     attacks.''\n       The head of the intelligence panel, Sen. John D. \n     Rockefeller, made a similar argument after the bill was \n     approved last week. ``The onus is on the administration, not \n     the companies, to ensure that the request is on strong legal \n     footing,'' he said.\n       Jeffrey H. Smith, a CIA general counsel during the Clinton \n     administration who now represents private companies in the \n     national security area, said the risk of litigation poses \n     an unfair threat to government officials or others who \n     have good reason to believe they are acting legally. He \n     noted that many intelligence officers now feel obliged to \n     carry liability insurance.\n       ``It seems to me that it's manifestly unfair for the \n     officers that conducted that program and the telecoms to now \n     face prosecution or civil liability for carrying out what was \n     on its face a totally lawful request on the part of the \n     government,'' Smith said. ``It's not the same as Abu Ghraib \n     or a CIA officer who beats someone during an interrogation.''\n       But civil liberties groups and many academics argue that \n     Congress is allowing the government to cover up possible \n     wrongdoing and is inappropriately interfering in disputes the \n     courts should decide. The American Civil Liberties Union last \n     campaigned against the proposed Senate legislation, saying in \n     a news release Friday that ``the administration is trying to \n     cover its tracks.''\n       Sen. Russell Feingold said in a statement last week that \n     classified documents provided by the White House ``further \n     demonstrate that the program was illegal and that there is no \n     basis for granting retroactive immunity to those who \n     allegedly cooperated.'' His office declined to elaborate on \n     the records, which were reviewed by a Feingold staffer.\n       Retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, dean and president of the \n     Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, N.H., said he is \n     concerned about the precedent a new immunity provision might \n     set.\n\n  The article quotes him.\n\n       ``The unfortunate reality is that once you've done it, once \n     you immunize interrogators or phone companies, then it's easy \n     to do it again in another context. It seems to me that as a \n     general rule retroactive immunity is not a good thing . . . \n     It's essentially letting Congress handle something that \n     should be handled by the Judiciary.''\n\n  These are, I think, very good articles that shed light on some of the \nimportant issues we need to be looking at.\n  Let me, if I can, go back and talk about the Church Commission. I \nthink it is important because we are relying so heavily on the work \nthey have done and the establishment in the immediate aftermath of the \nChurch Commission of the FISA Courts. I have quoted from some of them \nearlier this evening, but I think it is worthwhile to go back and \nlisten to their words. Again, I want you to know these words were \nwritten 30 years ago, but I think people can appreciate how timely the \nlanguage is when you consider the debate we are having. It is hard not \nto wonder how these words weren't prepared less than 24 hours ago, in \npreparation for this debate. I think their warnings and admonitions \nhave a timeliness to them that are worthy of including in this \ndiscussion at this moment. So let me quote from the Church report:\n\n       Americans have rightfully been concerned since before World \n     War II about the dangers of hostile foreign agents likely to \n     commit acts of espionage. Similarly, the violent acts of \n     political terrorists can seriously endanger the rights of \n     Americans. Carefully focused intelligence investigations can \n     help prevent such acts.\n       But too often intelligence has lost its focus and domestic \n     intelligence activities have invaded individual privacy and \n     violated the rights of lawful assembly and political \n     expression. Unless new and tighter controls are established \n     by legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n       A tension between order and liberty is inevitable in any \n     society. A government must protect its citizens from those \n     bent on engaging in violence and criminal behavior or in \n     espionage or other hostile foreign intelligence activity. \n     Intelligence work has, at times, successfully prevented \n     dangerous and abhorrent acts, such as bombings and foreign \n     spying, and aided in the prosecution of those responsible for \n     such acts.\n       But intelligence activity in the past decades has, all too \n     often, exceeded the restraints on the exercise of \n     governmental power which are imposed by our country's \n     constitution, laws, and traditions.\n       We have seen segments of our government, in their attitudes \n     and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes. We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as ``vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n       That these abuses have adversely affected the \n     constitutional rights of particular Americans is beyond \n     question. But we believe the harm extends far beyond the \n     citizens directly affected.\n       Personal privacy is protected because it is essential to \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Our constitution checks \n     the power of government for the purpose of protecting the \n     rights of individuals, in order that all our citizens my live \n     in a free and decent society. Unlike totalitarian states, we \n     do not believe that any government has a monopoly on truth.\n       When government infringes on these rights instead of \n     nurturing and protecting them, the injury spreads far beyond \n     the particular citizens targeted to untold number of other \n     American citizens who may be intimidated.\n       Abuse thrives on secrecy. Obviously, public disclosure over \n     matters such as the names of intelligence agents or the \n     technological details of collection methods is inappropriate. \n     But in the field of intelligence, secrecy has been \n     extended to inhibit review of the basic programs and \n     practices themselves.\n       Those within the executive branch and the Congress who \n     would exercise their responsibilities wisely must be fully \n     informed. The American people as well should know enough \n     about intelligence activities to be able to apply its good \n     sense to the underlying issues of policy and morality.\n       Knowledge is the key to control. Secrecy should no longer \n     be allowed to shield the existence of constitutional, legal \n     and moral problems from the security of all three branches of \n     government or from the American people themselves.\n\n  Those are incredible words that could. None of us could say it more \neloquently than our colleagues did 30 years ago.\n  I can't tell you all the names of the Republicans and Democratic \nSenators who wrote this language, but they came from all parts of the \ncountry. They were, many of them, veterans of World War II, had served \nin Korea. Dan Inouye was here. I know that. Senator Byrd, whom I sit \nnext to, was here. Senator Ted Kennedy was here. Senator Ted Stevens \nwas here for those debates. Those are the Members I can think of off \nthe top of my head who were probably Members back in 1978 when this was \nwritten. Joe Biden was here as part of that debate. Patrick Leahy was \nhere in 1978. I think Carl Levin and John Warner had just arrived. I \nthink they had been elected that year. I am not sure.\n  But these are wonderful Members who sat and realized we needed to set \nup that balance between security and liberty and gave us the FISA \nCourts, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Tonight, as we \nconsider whether to grant immunity to the telecom companies and close \nthe door on determining the legality or illegality of their actions, I \nthink these words have tremendous relevance. Every Member ought to take \nthem and read them and think about them.\n  I hear the words of the President, and I am disappointed he said he \nwould veto the bill if we strip immunity. I have listened to Senator \nMcConnell, my good friend from Kentucky, saying we have to adopt this \nbecause the President will veto the bill otherwise. That is not the \nbasis upon which the Congress ought to act. I have rarely heard that \nargument made here. You can raise it, certainly, as a point, but the \nsuggestion that Congress or this body ought to act differently because \nthe President is going to veto something or threatens a veto is not the \nbasis upon which we ought to make decisions, particularly when it comes \nto\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nmatters involving the rule of law and the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Those issues of the Constitution and the rule of law ought to trump \nthe reputational damage. The issues of the Constitution and the rule of \nlaw ought to trump the arguments somehow that the telecom companies \nwill be less willing to step forward and help conduct the surveillance \nof our country when we are threatened by outsiders.\n  I cannot undo some of the things that have been done already. I wish \nI could undo the Military Commissions Act. I wish I could the outrages \nthat occurred at Abu Ghraib. I wish I could undo what has happened at \nGuantanamo Bay. I wish I could undo secret prisons and extraordinary \nrenditions. But there is a pattern here. It is not just the one event \nor two, it has been a pattern of behavior almost from the very \nbeginning that ought to be deeply troubling to every single one of us.\n  So while I cannot undo those actions, why would I then add to that \nlist by granting this retroactive immunity? What more do we need to \nknow? Why are we being asked to do this? Why did this administration \nask this committee to grant broad-based immunity to every single \nindividual in our Government and our agencies, as well as to the \ntelecom companies? What was behind that request? What did they fear \nwhen they sought that kind of unprecedented immunity, for both the \nprivate companies and every official involved in the decision to grant \nor insist upon this compliance? Why were they asking us to do that?\n  So I know, while others have written about this here, I find it \ndeeply troubling that we can once more add this to the destruction of \ntapes and the CIA, the U.S. attorneys scandal involving the Department \nof Justice and U.S. attorney's offices. All of these matters, again, \nare in and of themselves individual cases, and yet, when you step back \nand think about the totality of them, why would this Congress, at this \nhour, decide we are going to yet once again say: OK, we'll let you get \naway with it one more time.\n  I wish I could go back and undo all of those abuses. I cannot. But we \nhave the opportunity not to do this. All it will take is 39 other \nSenators.\n  All it will take is 40 of us here decide that at this moment in our \nhistory that we are going to stand up for the rule of law, we are going \nto stand up for the Constitution. No other issue we can get to is as \nimportant as the Constitution of the United States, no other issue is \nas important to me, ought to be to all Members, as the rule of law. And \nas I have done on five separate occasions since January 3, 1981, when \nas a 36-year-old I stood over here on the floor of the Senate, with \nLowell Weicker standing beside me--I raised my right hand and took an \noath to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am \nproud to have done it five different times, as every Member here has \ndone at least once. What matter, what issue, would be more important \nthan defending the Constitution of the United States?\n  So tomorrow we may have the chance--40 of us--to not invoke cloture \nand to insist that we are going to fight for this principle of the rule \nof law and not add to this litany that is going to be revisited over \nand over again: the Military Commissions Act, waterboarding, Abu \nGhraib, Guantanamo Bay, secret prisons, extraordinary renditions, U.S. \nattorneys scandal, Scooter Libby, destruction of CIA tapes. How many \nmore do you need? Why not add this: retroactive immunity to the telecom \nindustry, at the request of a President who did not want the courts to \ndetermine the legality or illegality of the actions?\n  During a critical moment in American history, I for one am not going \nto allow that to happen.\n  I realize I have been talking a long time here. May I inquire how \nlong I have been speaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) Two hours 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. As I say, I have already spent over 20 hours on this. And \nas I say, I have never engaged in extended debate in my 27 years \nbecause the matters were handled by others or because we came up with a \nresolution of issues. But I stand here tonight, as I have over the last \nseveral months--as many of my colleagues know, I interrupted a \nPresidential campaign to come back and spend 10 hours on the floor here \nwhen this matter came up in December, to raise my concerns about this \nissue. I do not want to try the patience of the staff and others, \nincluding my colleague who is patiently sitting in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair with little or no relief. So more than 20 hours of \nmaking my case here is probably more than most people can tolerate. But \nI want people to know how much I care about this and how much I wish \nand hope and pray that this evening, Members, regardless of party, will \nstand up tomorrow for the rule of law.\n  So tonight, my fervent prayer and hope is that when this vote occurs, \nfirst of all, that I will be surprised and that 50 of our colleagues \nhere will join with Senator Feingold and myself and vote to strike this \nlanguage from the Intelligence Committee bill. That would be the best \nresult of all, and then we can send this bill to the other body and \nhave it resolved and sent to the President, hopefully, for his \nsignature. If that doesn't occur, then I hope 38 others would join \nSenator Feingold and me in voting against cloture in a historic moment \nand send this bill back to be revised to comply with the Judiciary \nCommittee's decision excluding the retroactive immunity. That would be \nthe second best result.\n  With that, Madam President, after almost 2\\1/2\\ hours and the hours \nbefore, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/11/senate-section/article/S878-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
