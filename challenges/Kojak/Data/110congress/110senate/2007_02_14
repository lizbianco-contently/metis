Madam President, I would like to say that this 110th \nCongress, when we came here, Democrats and Republicans alike had a real \nproblem because the last Congress only funded the Government until \nFebruary 15. With cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, \ndifficult negotiations took place, but it was a situation where \nSenators Cochran and Byrd, who lead us in the Appropriations Committee, \nworking with Chairman Obey on the other side of the Capitol, together \nwith all ranking members and all chairs of the subcommittees on both \nsides, worked through these difficult issues. And they were difficult. \nWe had not enough money to do all that is necessary to be done, but we \ngot it done without a single earmark. I know this was difficult.\n  There are issues that are so troubling. There is a Senator on the \nother side of the aisle, Johnny Isakson from Georgia. I don't know how \nyou could find a nicer person in the world than Johnny Isakson. He is \npleasant. He always has a smile on his face. He has an issue that is \nreally important to him concerning children and health--something that \nshould be in this bill. It is not.\n  Kay Bailey Hutchison, the senior Senator from Texas, has an issue \ndealing with BRAC that has bipartisan support. There are bases that we \nlegislated closure for, and communities are having difficult times as a \nresult of these base closures doing all that needs to be done, and we \npromised them money to allow these closures to go forward without as \nmuch concern and real hardship. But there wasn't anything we could do. \nIf we had a single amendment on this bill, it had to go back for \nconference.\n  As a result of that, it would mean that very likely we couldn't \ncomplete this by tomorrow night at midnight. I have made commitments to \na number of people that we are going to take care of these things in \nthe supplemental which should be here the last week in March, and I am \ngoing to do\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\neverything I can to make sure the process on the supplemental is as \nopen and free as people think it should be. We will be as patient as we \ncan be to work our way through this. I have told the distinguished \nRepublican leader that vehicle will be open to amendments.\n\n  So I think we have done very good work. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise and consensus building, and I appreciate very much the \nRepublicans supporting this. There were some who didn't and I \nunderstand that and I understand why. What we did yesterday in invoking \ncloture on this bill is a step forward to allowing us to get the \ncountry's financial affairs in order. I have talked to Senator Byrd. I \nhave spoken to Senator Cochran. I have spoken to the distinguished \nRepublican leader. We are all going to do our very utmost this year to \nget appropriations bills done. We are going to be able to do that now \nthat this CR is going to be out of the way either today early on or, if \nwe can't work anything out, when the time expires tonight.\n  So, again, I want to express my appreciation publicly to everyone who \nworked on this matter. There were people who voted against the bill who \nwere a part of the process of working things out. I have spent time on \nthis issue with the senior Senator from New Mexico. I have spent a lot \nof time with him. He and I did that Energy and Water Subcommittee for \nmany years as chairman and ranking member. We went back and forth. He \ndidn't get everything he wanted, but he got quite a bit. I am not going \nto go through the whole rollcall of others with whom we worked on this \nto try to make it as easy a slide as possible. But anyway I am glad it \nis done. It is good for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1930-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 574\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, on Monday the distinguished majority \nleader took to the floor and bemoaned the state of our economy, calling \nour economic future bleak. As surprised as I was by those comments, I \nthought it was even more important to come down to the floor and to \nrespond and to provide, I think, a much different picture than that \ndepicted by the distinguished majority leader.\n  It is ironic the same date those comments were made, the Associated \nPress reported a story that leads with this paragraph:\n\n       The deficit for the first four months of the current budget \n     year is down sharply from the same period a year ago as the \n     government continues to benefit from record levels of tax \n     collections.\n       The Treasury Department reported Monday that the deficit \n     for the budget year that began October 1 was down 57.2 \n     percent from the same period a year ago.\n\n  That same article goes on to say:\n\n       The continued strong growth in revenues reflects the record \n     profits corporations have been recording in recent years and \n     the low levels of unemployment, which means more Americans \n     are working and paying taxes.\n\n  If this is ``bleak'' economic news, I would love to see what good \neconomic news might look like.\n  I have a few charts that provide a more accurate picture of exactly \nwhere we stand in terms of the American economy today. This first chart \ndemonstrates for 21 consecutive quarters we have seen the U.S. economy \ngrow, including the latest quarter where the economy grew by 3.5 \npercent.\n  We have seen since August 2003, employment has expanded over 41 \nconsecutive months--creating 7.4 million new jobs in America. This \ntimeframe is not accidental. In 2003, we passed some of the tax relief \nwhich is largely responsible for giving the American worker greater \nincentive to work hard and to save their money and invest it in their \nsmall business, thus creating jobs and opportunity for all Americans. \nThis has created the sort of freedom that is always demonstrated in the \nstrength of our burgeoning economy. It is as a result of not Government \naction per se but, rather, the freedom we have given the economy and \nthe hard-working American taxpayer to keep more of what they earn and \ncreating an incentive for them to work hard and be able to earn more to \nsupport their family and their way of life.\n  The third chart demonstrates the economic picture is not as the \ndistinguished majority leader said, ``bleak'' but demonstrates that \nrevenue to the Federal Treasury has exceeded all historical precedent. \nIndeed, this last projection is that in 2007 we will see it increase by \n18.5 percent, and you can see above the line on this chart that \nrepresents historical averages. Each of the following years leading up \nto 2012 will exceed that historical average. Again, the economy is \nstronger than ever and continues to grow because of our current low tax \nand progrowth policies.\n  Unfortunately, this is a lesson that Washington sometimes forgets \nbecause when given the opportunity, the instinct of Washington is to \nincrease Federal revenue by increasing taxes. I don't think you need to \nknow much about human nature to know that high taxes decrease the \nincentive we all have to work hard. What that does is actually have a \nwet-blanket effect on the economy and on the ability of small \nbusinesses and employers to create jobs which create the kind of \neconomic growth and the kind of revenue our tax system generates as a \nresult of strong economic activity.\n  I am worried that even with the current continuing resolution that is \nin the Senate now that cuts $3.1 billion from defense spending at a \ntime when we are trying to bring our troops home from Europe and Asia \nand to provide them a place to come home to, that the solution offered \nby the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is \n``Don't worry, we will add that money back in when we get to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.''\n  The problem with that is the $3.1 billion that has been spent out of \nthe current continuing resolution or Omnibus appropriations bill on \nthings other than our military, that money has now been spent on other \nprograms that are favored by the new majority. What they are saying is, \ninstead of spending $3.1 billion, we will spend $6.2 billion--the $3.1 \non things other than defense, but we will come back later and make the \ndefense budget whole but in a way that aggravates the budget deficit.\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\n  Of course, the consequence of that kind of spending policy which has \na tendency to aggravate the deficit lays the groundwork for our \ncolleagues on the other side to say, the American people are not taxed \nenough. We need to actually raise taxes in order to generate more \nrevenue to pay for this additional spending.\n  This is exactly the kind of response we do not need. As demonstrated \nby the charts, as demonstrated by the booming economy, we have, as a \nresult of the low tax policy and the progrowth policies of the last 6 \nyears, the American economy could not be stronger or better.\n  I hope we will all be edified by this factual data demonstrated on \nthe charts and that the misimpression that the distinguished majority \nleader was under when he called the economy bleak will be now \ndisabused. I hope he will see from the charts and from my comments--not \nbecause I said it but because this is what the facts demonstrate--the \nlow tax and progrowth policies we have had over the last 6 years have \nserved the American people very well and that 7.4 million new jobs have \nbeen created in America since August 2003. That, indeed, should be what \nwe are all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate to speak about the \nforgotten America. That is the rural America which is a wide expanse of \nthe geographic area of these United States. When I came to the Senate 2 \nyears ago, I gave my maiden speech about forgotten America, the rural \nparts of our country which have been in decline decade after decade \nafter decade.\n  I did so because if you look at my own history, I come from a place \nthat is 300 miles to the south of Denver, a place that has the name of \nConejos, in English meaning rabbit county. It is one of the four \npoorest counties in the United States of America. In that county, as in \nso many counties across America, you see the kinds of problems that \ndescribe the two Americas we have. We have the America of prosperity, \nmuch of that part of America lying within the metropolitan areas of our \ngreat Nation, and we have the other America, the forgotten America, the \nAmerica that struggles on the vine every day to stay alive, the part of \nAmerica that has great disparity in terms of the kind of health care \nand the kind of education and the kind of economic opportunity that \nexists for them.\n  In my own State of Colorado, there were 64 counties, and out of the \n64 counties, even in the great boom of the 1990s when unemployment was \nnonexistent and our economy was growing at a very rapid pace, most of \nthose counties were withering on the vine. They were declining in \npopulation. Their population was aging. They were struggling with \nhealth care. They were struggling with a whole host of issues that \naffect those communities.\n  Out of the 64 counties in Colorado during the period of 2000 to 2005, \n21 of them actually declined in population. That is a third of my State \nthat was actually declining in population. The fact is that same \nstatistic can apply for many other States, including Nebraska, the \nDakotas, Idaho, and most of our States around the country.\n  I am very hopeful, as we move forward in the 110th Congress, that \nunder the great leadership of Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, we will be \nable to put together a farm bill that will help revitalize rural \nAmerica and will help us put the spotlight on what has been the \nforgotten America.\n  Even as we start the process of moving forward and addressing the \nissues set forth in the 10 titles of the farm bill, we already see some \nstatistics that to all of us should be alarming. At a hearing we had \nearlier this week, there was testimony provided to us that the per \ncapita investment in rural America is about $550 less than it is in \nurban communities. That is because the formulas we have for community \ndevelopment block grants and other investments the Federal Government \nmakes to help communities ends up, in a very disappointing way, \naffecting rural communities in these negative ways. I am hopeful, as we \nmove forward with the farm bill, we will be able to correct some of \nthese disparities and create new opportunities for rural America.\n\n  We will see one of those opportunities created with our efforts to \ngrow our way to energy independence. The fact of the matter is, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, are coming \ntogether to recognize the fact that growing our way to energy \nindependence is a matter of national security, a matter of economic \nsecurity, and a matter of environmental security. I am tremendously \noptimistic about what we can do with the new farm bill.\n  Mr. President, today I speak briefly about two pieces of legislation \nI have introduced or will soon be introducing that are part of that \nagenda to try to help rural America. The first, a bipartisan \nlegislation that creates a rural leasing institute. It is legislation \nwhich I am proudly sponsoring with Senator Pryor, my good friend and \nformer attorney general from Arkansas and Senator Chambliss and Senator \nIsakson.\n  This legislation creates a rural policing institute to make sure our \nlaw enforcement in rural communities has a similar kind of opportunity \nthat law enforcement has in the major metropolitan areas. In my State \nof Colorado, we have about 14,000 peace officers. I had the great honor \nas the attorney general of that State to serve as the chairman of the \nboard that certified all the law enforcement officers in my State for a \nperiod of 6 years. There is a big difference between the kind of \ntraining rural law enforcement officers get and the kind of training \nprovided to law enforcement areas in the metropolitan communities. Of \nthe 14,000 peace officers in Colorado, 7,000 of the people work in \ndepartments that have fewer than 15 officers. They cannot afford the \nkind of training to protect themselves and to protect the public safety \nthat other larger metropolitan police organizations can afford.\n  Therefore, our effort to move forward with this rural policing \ninstitute is to\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nallow our national Government to provide training opportunities to the \nthousands upon thousands of police officers who live in rural \ncommunities and who work every day to protect the public safety of \ntheir communities.\n  I hope our colleagues will join in the passage of this legislation. \nLast year, this legislation enjoyed the unanimous support of the \nSenate. I am hopeful we will again have that same kind of support.\n  In conclusion, let me say that the forgotten America is, indeed, much \nof rural America. It is that part of rural America which we know is so \nimportant to us because of the values we find there, the bedrock values \nof what America is all about. It is a pioneering spirit of the West. It \nis the place where the food security of our Nation so depends.\n  If you walk into my office, for many years I have had on my desk a \nsigh that says: No farms, no food. No farms, no food. I would hope, as \nwe make that statement--as I make that statement--we recognize we \nshould never compromise the food security of the United States of \nAmerica. We, obviously, have done that in a very negative and \ndisastrous way with respect to our energy dependence on foreign \ncountries today. We ought not to do the same thing with food security.\n  Our ability to revitalize rural America and to enact a farm bill that \nwill help us revitalize rural America is very much at the heart of how \nwe take care of this forgotten America.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Salazar pertaining to the introduction of S. 583 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the continuing \nresolution before the Senate, H. J. Res. 20, to point out some of the \nflaws in the bill. Because we have the potential for a Government \nshutdown, I believe it is my responsibility to vote for the \nlegislation.\n  I am reluctant to be in the position of voting for a $463 billion \nspending bill with no capability for amendment. We passed \nappropriations bills out of the Senate last year. They reflected the \nSenate's priorities. Yet this measure changes many of the priorities \nthat were set in last year's bills, and we haven't had the opportunity \nfor hearings, committee markups, or to offer any amendments from the \nfloor. That is not the way the Senate has done business, certainly not \nthe Appropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee has been \nquite bipartisan throughout the time I have been a member.\n  I don't like to see this type of precedent being set. The last time \nRepublicans took over from Democrats, there were 11 appropriations \nbills not yet finished. We didn't do a continuing resolution and fill \nup the tree so there couldn't be amendments. We did an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. We debated it for 6 days. We timed it so that \npeople had full access to amendments and the process. We had 100 \namendments. That was 2003. I am very concerned about this type of \nprocess. But we are now 1 day before the end of the previous continuing \nresolution, which means we could see a Government shutdown if we can't \ncome to agreement.\n\n  I said last week that we had time for amendments and to confer with \nthe House. The amendment I put forward with 27 cosponsors, the \nHutchison-Inhofe amendment, would have fully restored the $3.1 billion \nthat was taken out of military construction that was preparation for \nthe movement of troops home from overseas, as well as many other base \nchanges that were going to be made. I asked for the restoration of that \nwith 27 cosponsors, and my amendment was ruled out of order.\n  I know there was bipartisan support for those many military \nconstruction projects. And since I am the ranking member and previously \nthe chairman of that subcommittee, I know how important they are. I \nknow they were so important that the chairman of all the services, plus \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter saying: Please do not \nfund with a continuing resolution the military construction projects \nbecause there will not be enough to fully cover our needs. The \nSecretary of Defense said the same thing.\n  We are not going to be able to do what is right for our military \nbecause $3 billion was taken out of the Senate-passed appropriations \nbill and converted to other projects. It was spread around throughout \nthe other agencies, and the military construction was the pay-for. I \ntried to correct that, and I have to say that the distinguished \nmajority leader did make an effort to work with the House to make my \namendment in order. He was not able to do that. I accept that, and I \naccept that he tried. I do believe he tried. I think Senator Reid did \nmake an effort. But we have a process here which is not one anyone can \nbe proud of; that is, a $463 billion spending bill, taking $3 billion \naway from military construction, putting it into other priorities, and \nnot allowing amendments. It is not right, and I protested.\n  I am going to vote for the bill. I think we have to do it.\n  I am very concerned about the NASA funding. There is money taken out \nof the ongoing, very important priority of getting the crew return \nvehicle that is the successor to the shuttle online on time. I cannot \nimagine we would take money out of that program, which was done in this \nbill, which would potentially delay us years down the road from having \nthe crew return vehicle that is set to replace the shuttle. The shuttle \nis set to go out of existence in 2010, possibly 2011. We need the \nshuttle to finish the space station. But the Administrator, Michael \nGriffin, has said we need to retire the shuttle as soon as possible. We \nhave to finish the space station. The new crew return vehicle will not \nbe able to carry big parts up to the space station. It will not be \nheavy enough. But we need to close the gap so we don't have a time when \nthe United States is not able to send people into space, and that is \nwhat is going to happen if the crew return vehicle is not able to be \nproduced when the shuttle goes out of existence.\n  I think we are putting NASA in jeopardy. I met with Senator Bill \nNelson, the chairman of the NASA Subcommittee, of which I am ranking \nmember. We met with Michael Griffin and members of the staff of the \nAppropriations Committee who assured Michael Griffin he would have the \nability to transfer money out of other accounts to go there. But I am \nconcerned about it. Why was the money moved out of that account in the \nfirst place? That doesn't seem like the proper way to do business. But \nwe are going to watch that very carefully.\n  Senator Nelson and I are very bipartisan in our approach to NASA. We \nboth believe it is most important for us to have human spaceflight \ncapabilities for the United States of America. It is a national \nsecurity issue as well as a scientific issue that we stay in the \nforefront of science, and the lead we have had by going into space \nearly is unmatched by any other country. Our lead is so important for \nour national security and the dominance we have had in space. The \nability we have had to guide missiles from space is a phenomenal \nadvantage America has been able to achieve by conquering space. If we \ndon't have the ability to put humans in space for some period of time--\n3 to 5 years--what are we going to do? Are we going to go and beg the \nRussians? Who knows, by 2010 or 2011, whether the Russians would even \ngive us space on their shuttles, much less give us the accommodations \nwe would need and perhaps the secrecy we would need.\n  I am concerned about this bill. If we were not facing a potential \nshutoff of the Government and many important programs, including \nbenefits to veterans and military pay, I would vote no, just as I did \nvote against cloture because I thought we still had time to do this \nright. We should have had time\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\nto do it right, but we didn't, so we are faced with the Hobson's choice \nof shutting down the Government or trying to do this bill in the right \nway with no amendments. I don't consider it a good choice.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the bill. I do not think this is the \nSenate's finest hour. I do believe the Senate majority leader made an \neffort. I think he heard the merits of our bipartisan amendment with 27 \nsponsors. I hope he will, as he has promised, work with us to get the \nfull funding of these military construction projects in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. However, we have the chance right \nnow. I hate to give up the bird in the hand for one that might see some \ndelays, that might see many changes. I will be right on top of it. As \nthe ranking member of this subcommittee, I will certainly expect that \nwe have the ability to amend the appropriations bill that comes forward \nas a supplemental, just as we have always had in this body. I hope we \nwill not have to worry that we are going to have a filled up amendment \ntree and cloture filed on the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  We can do business the right way in the Senate. We have for most of \nthe years of this great institution. I will be disappointed if we start \nseeing us bring bills to the floor and not allow amendments--there is \nno reason to have 100 Members if that is the way we are going to do \nbusiness. We could just have 51 or we could just have 1 if all the \ndecisions are going to be made in that fashion.\n  That is not what the Constitution intended, and I hope it is \ncertainly not what the new majority intends as a way to do business.\n  I am going to hold out hope that the word is kept, that we can have \nthe amendment process, that we can fund the military construction \nprojects that are so important for quality of life and training \ncapabilities for the great men and women who are serving our country \nand putting themselves forward to give up their lives, if necessary, \nfor freedom for future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                        Alternative Minimum Tax\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think it was 48 hours ago I opened a \ndiscussion with my fellow Senators on the alternative minimum tax. As I \npointed out at that time, it is generally recognized that the \nalternative minimum tax is a policy failure.\n  Created in 1969, in response to the discovery that 155 wealthy \ntaxpayers--and let me emphasize that I am talking about 155 wealthy \ntaxpayers--were able to eliminate their entire tax liabilities through \nlegal means, the AMT has now evolved into a place where, because it \nwasn't indexed, it has captured more than 3 million middle-class \nAmericans as of 2004. The AMT was never supposed to affect anyone \nexcept the very wealthy people.\n  I am using 2004 numbers because 2004 is the most recent year we have \ncompleted data. Three million people in that year were hit by AMT, even \nthough since 2001 we have had in place a tax policy that no additional \npeople should be hit by the alternative minimum tax.\n  At the time I was visiting with my colleagues 2 days ago, I cited the \nwidespread observation that the most significant structural flaw \nafflicting the AMT is the failure to index its rates and exemptions for \ninflation. This failure, then--and I alluded to this a minute ago--has \nresulted in the gradual encroachment of the alternative minimum tax to \nhit middle-class taxpayers who were never intended to pay this tax.\n  Despite the widespread agreement that something needs to be done with \nthe alternative minimum tax, agreement on what exactly to do is not so \nwidespread. A major factor in the disagreement relates to the massive \namount of money the alternative minimum tax brings to the Federal \nGovernment. In 2004, from these 3 million taxpayers hit by this tax, \nmore than $12.8 billion was paid into the Federal Treasury. If we don't \nextend the most recent alternative minimum tax hold-harmless that \nactually expired at the end of 2006, the amount paid by those 3 million \ntaxpayers is expected to balloon to a much greater amount. And, of \ncourse, when you go beyond that, into the long-term budget forecast, it \nis going to continue to grow and grow, with middle-class taxpayers \npaying a tax that was meant to be for 155 wealthy people.\n  When forecasters put their projections together, they are working \nunder the assumption that the hold-harmless that was extended in last \nyear's tax bill will not be extended because they base their \nassumptions on current law. This means the hold-harmless provisions \nended December 31, 2006, and money being earned right now is going to \nhit millions more people.\n  People who guesstimate how much money comes into the Federal \nTreasury--and we have people both in the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch who have that as their responsibility, so we can \nmake good tax policy--take into consideration what is current law, and \nthey are planning on these millions of middle-class taxpayers paying \nthis alternative minimum tax, even though they were never intended to \npay it. Because of this, budget planners make the assumption that \nrevenues will be much higher than everyone who is frustrated with the \nAMT thinks that amount of money ought to be, as well as the number of \npeople who are going to be paying it.\n  The reason for that is the alternative minimum tax tremendously \nballoons the revenue base, as it is projected to increase revenues as a \npercentage of gross domestic product. There is a great deal of evidence \nto support this.\n\n  On a side note, a senior, well-respected tax lawyer on the other side \nof the aisle in the other body took exception to my use of the term \n``ballooning.'' The staffer wrote an article and criticized me for that \nterm. Well, I am not used to staff writing articles criticizing Members \nof Congress, so I happened to respond to that staffer's criticism \nthrough my own staff. The essence of the senior staffer's criticism was \nthat the term ``ballooning'' ignored the accounting for the interaction \nof bipartisan tax relief with AMT costs. As we pointed out, ballooning \nrevenue from the AMT occurs in the outyears, whether the bipartisan tax \nrelief is extended or made permanent. I will talk more about that in a \nfew minutes.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has consistently forecast \nthis ballooning year after year. This chart which I have before me now \nfor you to look at, reproduced from the Congressional Budget Office's \nlong-term budget outlook, was published in December 2005 and shows how \nFederal revenues are expected to push through the 30-year historical \naverage and then keep going up.\n  You can take that historical average back 30 or 40 years for sure, \nand maybe longer than that, but the historical average is here and \ncurrent law is actually going to bring in this much revenue, and that \nincludes the ballooning of the alternative minimum tax.\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n  I want to note that although the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law after this analysis was \npublished, the 2006 tax bill extended the AMT hold-harmless through \nDecember 31 last year, and this chart shows Federal revenues all the \nway through to the year 2050. It is important to note the long-term \neffects then of the alternative minimum tax on the revenue base.\n  There may be some doubters who hesitate to attribute this ballooning \nof revenues to the alternative minimum tax, but this chart illustrates \nthe drastic expansion of the AMT under current law over the next 43 \nyears. Over the next 43 years. This is also from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. You can clearly see that the share of \nhouseholds subjected to the alternative minimum tax is alarmingly \naround 65 percent.\n  Let's go through that again. You can see from the new chart which I \nhave put up here that the share of households subjected to the \nalternative minimum tax increases by the year 2050 to about 65 percent \nof taxpayers. The reason why this 65 percent--or even going back to \nhere, or even back to here--is significant is because, as I told you 48 \nhours ago, and as I tell my colleagues now, this alternative minimum \ntax was put in the tax law to hit wealthy taxpayers, 155 at that year, \nwho didn't pay any tax whatsoever.\n  It was felt that everybody, particularly wealthy people living in \nthis country and who benefit from this country, ought to pay some sort \nof a tax. It was never intended to hit this percentage of taxpayers, or \nthis percentage of taxpayers, and surely not this percentage of \ntaxpayers. And if we do nothing, it is going to be 65 percent. I don't \nknow what the population of this country is going to be in 43 years, \nbut I know that 65 percent of the population in 2050 will be more, \nquite obviously more than the 155 taxpayers the AMT was intended to \ntarget.\n  This chart also shows how the AMT will consume a greater and greater \nshare of the total individual income tax liability. The Congressional \nBudget Office report states:\n\n       By 2050, roughly 15 percent of the individual income tax \n     liability would be generated by the alternative minimum tax \n     compared with about 2 percent today.\n\n  This is what will happen if we don't do anything. This is going to \nhappen. The analysis done by the Congressional Budget Office clearly \nshows an upcoming ballooning of Federal revenues, accompanied by a \ncorresponding bloating of the share of households and the share of \ntotal liability attributed to a tax that was only intended to hit 155 \npeople 39 years ago.\n  A particularly wrongheaded argument that has been advocated is that \nthe Bush tax cuts are responsible for increases in the number of people \nhit by the alternative minimum tax. Some think the Bush tax cuts are \nincreasing some people's income so much that they are subject to the \nalternative minimum tax and that making the tax cuts permanent will \nonly make those problems worse. This sort of reasoning is deceptive and \ncould not be more wrong. First, the analysis that I presented--done by \nthe Congressional Budget Office--looks forward all the way to 2050, and \nthe Bush tax cuts under current law sunset in 2010. As I previously \nsaid, the AMT's greatest flaw is that it is not indexed for inflation, \nand inflation is going to continue whether the Bush tax cuts are \nextended or not. Inflation is going to be there.\n\n  This next chart from the Congressional Budget Office illustrates how \nthe alternative minimum tax will continue to be a money machine, \nregardless of any other factors. The bottom line illustrates individual \nincome tax liabilities if the Bush tax cuts are made permanent and the \nAMT is modified, the middle line illustrates current law with the \npermanence of the Bush tax cuts, and the very top line--current law. If \nthe Bush tax cuts are allowed to sunset and the AMT is allowed to grow \nand consume our middle class, the AMT will still balloon revenues \nanyway. Any argument that making the Bush tax cuts permanent will \nworsen our AMT problem is completely false, and this chart proves that. \nThe AMT is a problem all by itself.\n  As I said earlier, the problem with all of the projections showing \nthe AMT ballooning revenues is that these projections are used to put \ntogether budgets. This means the central problem in dealing with the \nAMT is money. There are some people who say we can only solve the AMT \nproblem if offsetting revenue can be found to replace the money that \nthe AMT is currently forecast to collect. Anyone who says this sees the \nforecasts showing revenue being pushed up as a percentage of GDP--and \nthey are high-tax people and yet higher tax people to satisfy them--and \nthey want to keep it there. These arguments are especially ridiculous \nwhen one considers that the alternative minimum tax was never meant to \ncollect so much revenue and collect it from the people who are going to \nend up paying it, the middle class people, if we don't do something \nabout it.\n  As a policy instrument, the alternative minimum tax has been and \ncontinues to be a complete failure, as I discussed 48 hours ago. The \nalternative minimum tax was originally conceived as a means to ensure \nthat extremely wealthy taxpayers were not able to game the system and \nto avoid their entire tax liability. In 1969, the alternative minimum \ntax was calculated to hit only one out of a half a million people. \nThere is absolutely no way anyone can call the AMT anything close to a \nsuccess. The alternative minimum tax has even failed in its objective: \nto ensure that no citizen, regardless of how wealthy, was able to \ncompletely avoid paying at least a little bit of Federal income tax \nbecause we have this anomaly.\n  In 2004, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mark \nEverson, informed the Finance Committee that the same number of \ntaxpayers, as a percentage of the tax-filing population at large, \ncontinues to pay no Federal income tax.\n  So even to hit the people who were supposed to be hit, there are \npeople in a tax situation, legally, able to avoid not only the regular \nincome tax but to avoid the alternative minimum tax. So it is a failure \nby its own reason for existence.\n  According to an IRS analysis of the tax year 2003 data, we had 2,366 \ntaxpayers with incomes above $200,000 or more who did not use the \nmedical or dental expense deduction and had no income tax.\n  The AMT has failed in every way except for the ability to raise very \nlarge sums of money, and it was never intended to be a tax-producing \nmachine. It was only intended to hit people who were not going to pay \nany income tax and ought to pay a little bit for the privilege of \nliving in America. While it may be hard for some to turn down \ntaxpayers' money, whether we are supposed to collect it or not, no one \nseems to have trouble spending it. This means that some want the \ntaxpayer to pay the price for a tax that was designed poorly and \nthrough the comedy of errors was allowed to flourish.\n  It is simply unfair to expect taxpayers to pay a tax they were never \nintended to pay--and that means middle class America. And it is even \nmore unfair to expect them to continue paying for that tax once we get \nrid of it. The reform or repeal of the AMT should not be offset because \nit is money we were never supposed to collect in the first place.\n  The way to solve this problem is to look on the other side of the \nledger, the spending side. Budget planners need to take off their rose-\ncolored glasses when looking at long-term revenue projections that \ninclude a tax by middle class people who were never intended to pay \nthat tax, the alternative minimum tax, and to read the fine print. In \ngeneral, it is a good idea to spend money within your means. That is \ntrue in this case as well. If we start trying to spend revenues we \nexpect to collect in the future because of the AMT, from people who \nwere never expected to pay it, it was never supposed to come in the \nfirst place, we will be living beyond our means. We need to stop \nassuming that record levels of revenue are available to be spent and to \nrecognize that the AMT is a phony revenue source.\n  As we consider how to deal with the AMT, we must first remember that \nwe do not have the option of not dealing with it unless we want to kill \nthe middle class. The problems will only get worse every year and make \nany solutions more difficult. We must also be clear that the revenue \nthe AMT would not collect as a result of repeal or reform should not be \noffset as a condition for repeal or reform. We should not call\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nit lost revenue because it is revenue that the middle class was never \nexpected to pay. Making the offsetting of the AMT's ill-gotten gains a \ncondition of the AMT fix is to punish the American taxpayers for an \nill-conceived and poorly executed policy that has been a total failure.\n  Aside from not increasing the proportion of wealthy taxpayers who pay \nincome taxes, the AMT is projected to balloon Federal revenues over \nhistorical averages and to become a greater source of revenue than even \nthe regular income tax. Budget forecasters need to recognize that the \nAMT is not a legitimate source of revenue, and Congress needs to be \ndisciplined enough to show restraint on spending so that an AMT \nsolution doesn't boil down to the replacement of one misguided policy \nby another misguided policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, Senator Brown of Ohio and Senator Chambliss of Georgia be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iranian Threat\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, at this moment of challenge for our \nNation, the vantage point of this august Chamber, we look onto a world \nfilled with danger, deeply complex threats against our troops and our \nnational interests abroad, and genuine risks to our security at home. \nKeeping our Nation strong and our people safe requires that we employ \nthe best and smartest strategies available.\n  In confronting enemies and threats we are fortunate to possess a \ngreat many assets, all of which we must wisely deploy, including our \nmilitary, diplomatic, economic, and cultural assets. Our strongest \nasset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as \nMembers of the Senate and as representatives of our constituents. Our \ndemocratic institutions, under our Constitution, balance one another \nand check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us \nwrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way. This \nconstitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national \nsecurity but the example that we should project to the world. Our \ndemocracy, with its tradition of accountable power and open debate, is \nAmerica at its best. That is what we need, America at our best, as we \ndeliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the Iranian \nregime.\n  Make no mistake, Iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests \nin the region and beyond, including the United States. The Iranian \nPresident has held a conference denying the Holocaust and has issued \nbellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for Israel and \nthe United States to be wiped off the map. His statements are even more \ndisturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime's quest \nto acquire nuclear weapons. The regime also uses its influence and \nresources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack \nIsrael. Hezbollah's attack on Israel this summer, using Iranian \nweapons, clearly demonstrates Iran's malevolent influence, even beyond \nits borders.\n  We also have evidence, although it is by no means conclusive, of \nattacks using Iranian-supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own \nAmerican soldiers. As I have long said, and will continue to say, U.S. \npolicy must be clear and unequivocal. We cannot, we should not, we must \nnot permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons. In dealing with \nthis threat, as I have also said for a long time, no option can be \ntaken off the table. But America must proceed deliberately and wisely, \nand we must proceed as a unified nation. The smartest and strongest \npolicy will be one forged through the institutions of our democracy. \nThat is the genius of our American system and our constitutional duty.\n  We have witnessed these past 6 years, until the most recent election \nof a new Congress by the American people, the cost of congressional \ndereliction of its oversight duty--a vital role entrusted to Congress \nby our constituents and enshrined in and even required by our \nConstitution. So we are here today because the price that has been paid \nin blood and treasure through the rush to war in Iraq and the \nincompetence of its execution and managing the aftermath, in the \nexcesses of military contracting abuses and the inadequate supply of \nbody armor and armored vehicles on the ground, have led to a loss of \nconfidence in this administration among our allies and the American \npeople.\n  Therefore, we cannot and we must not allow recent history to repeat \nitself. We continue to experience the consequences of unchecked \nPresidential action. Sunlight is the best disinfectant but this \nPresident was allowed, for too long, to commit blunder after blunder \nunder cover of darkness provided by an allied Republican Congress.\n  In dealing with the threats posed by the Iranian regime, which has \ngained its expanding influence in Iraq and the region as a result of \nthe administration's policies, President Bush must not be allowed to \nact without the authority and oversight of Congress. It would be a \nmistake of historical proportion if the administration thought that the \n2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for \nthe use of force against Iran without further congressional \nauthorization. Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution \nauthorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in any way \nauthorizes force against Iran.\n  If the administration believes that any--any--use of force against \nIran is necessary, the President must come to Congress to seek that \nauthority.\n  I am deeply concerned by the recent statements coming out of the Bush \nadministration. The administration has asserted evidence of the Iranian \nregime's complicity at the highest levels for attacks within Iraq. Yet, \nat the same time, GEN Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, questions these assertions--in particular, the culpability and \nintentions of the Irani Government. In this delicate situation, while \nmaking disturbing comments, the administration has also announced it is \nsending a third aircraft carrier to the gulf. The President owes an \nongoing consultation to this Congress and owes straight talk to the \ncountry. We have to get this right. The Congress should debate our \ncurrent course, including the current silent-treatment policy toward \nour adversaries.\n  I believe we can better understand how to deal with an adversary such \nas Iran if we have some direct contact with them. I think that can give \nus valuable information and better leverage to hold over the Iranian \nregime. And if we ever must, with congressional agreement, take drastic \naction, we should make clear to the world that we have exhausted every \nother possibility.\n  I welcome the agreement announced yesterday between the United States \nand North Korea. It demonstrates the central value of using every tool \nin our arsenal to achieve our objectives. I only wish the \nadministration had pursued this course 6 years ago when an agreement \nwith North Korea was within reach. The wasted time has allowed North \nKorea to develop nuclear weapons in the interim.\n  Failure to use diplomacy has damaged our national security interests. \nThe important step forward our country has made with North Korea raises \nthe obvious question: Why will the President refuse to have any kind of \nprocess involving Iran, as I and others have urged? The United States \nengaged in talks with North Korea within a multilateral process but \nalso had ongoing bilateral discussions. We should have such a process \nof direct engagement with Iran as recommended by many, including the \nIraq Study Group. We need friends and allies to stand with us in this \nlong war against terrorism and extremism and to contain and alter the \nregimes that harbor and support those who would harm us. During the \nCold War, we spoke to the Soviet Union while thousands of missiles were \npointed at our cities, while its leaders threatened to bury us, while \nthe regime sowed discord and military uprisings and actions against us \nand our allies. That was a smart strategy used by Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents alike, even though it was often a difficult one.\n  As we discuss potential evidence of Iranian complicity in supplying \narms to insurgents along with the refusal to suspend their nuclear \nambitions, we need to deliver a strong message to Iran that we will not \nstand by and tolerate this behavior. However, we need\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nto deliver that message forcefully through direct talks. The lives of \nAmerican soldiers are at risk, and we should not outsource our \ndiscussions with the Iranians on this and other issues. When I say no \noption should be taken off the table, I include diplomacy.\n  Currently, our intelligence on Iran is of uncertain quality. We need \nto examine the facts closely and carefully. No action can or should be \ntaken without explicit congressional authorization. And knowing what we \nknow now, this body needs a steady stream of real, verifiable \nintelligence. We in the Congress cannot do our part in deciding what \nneeds to be done if we do not know what is happening, and it does not \nappear that the administration has any real grasp on the facts on the \nground, even after all these years. The public unclassified sections of \nthe NIE recently issued made it very clear in their conclusions that \nsectarian violence would still exist in Iraq absent Iran.\n  So we have a lot to sort out. We have all learned lessons from the \nconflict in Iraq, and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations \nthat are being raised about Iran because what we are hearing has too \nfamiliar a ring, and we must be on guard that we never again make \ndecisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty. If \nwe find evidence of potential Iranian complicity, we will take \nappropriate action, but that requires a partnership to defend and \nprotect America's national security interests between the Congress and \nthe President.\n  Oversight will also lead to a consensus approach that brings together \nthe best judgment and strategies of our Nation and will examine the \nconsequences of action, the reality of any perceived or alleged threat, \nand the consequences of taking action. I sometimes fear that the word \n``consequence'' has been taken out of the vocabulary of this \nadministration. We have to look over the horizon. We have to make hard \nchoices among difficult options.\n  So there are no easy answers to the complex situations we confront in \nthe world today. But if we do face threats, the congressional \nconsultation and authorization will bring the American people into the \ndebate. Whatever steps, if any, may be required should be taken by our \nNation, not just by our President. We must act as Americans, not as \nmembers of one party or another. Our Nation has been divided by a \nfailed policy and the relentless pursuit of it. We are facing that \nagain with the escalation policy the President is pursuing today.\n  Mr. President, if we face up to our constitutional responsibilities \nas the Congress, if we conduct the oversight that is required, if we \nexercise our checks and balances, then we are likely to reach a better \nconclusion than we have thus far. We must be tough and smart, \ndeliberative and wise, and we must look at all of our assets, not just \nthe brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country. To \nimplement the best policy, we should start by employing our best \nvalues: the democratic values that give strength to our Nation and our \ncause and that serve as an example and beacon to people who wish to \nlive in peace and freedom and prosperity around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                       Building Economic Security\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today before the Senate Banking Committee, \nthe Federal Reserve Chairman testified that the economy is doing well. \nI was joined by my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, \nwho is in the chair. He told us that consumer spending is up, \nproductivity is up, and that the labor market will stay healthy. At the \nvery moment that the Chairman delivered a rosy prediction for our \nNation's economy, an AP story broke that Chrysler is cutting 13,000 \njobs. One hundred of those jobs are in Cleveland. Those aren't just \nnumbers; those are 100 families.\n  Two weeks ago, before the same Senate Banking Committee, the Treasury \nSecretary testified that the economy was doing well. He repeated many \ntimes that the GDP had grown in excess of 3 percent. Earlier that same \nmorning, at the Senate Agriculture Committee, Rhonda Stewart, a single \nmother from Hamilton, OH, testified that despite working full time, \ncaring for her 9-year-old son Wyatt, and even serving as president of \nthe PTA and a leader in the Boy Scouts, she and her son must rely on \nfood stamps to survive. At the end of each month, she told us, she must \nforgo dinner so her son can eat because the food stamps just don't go \nfar enough.\n  Worker productivity is up, profits are up, the stock market is doing \nwell, and millionaires are enjoying exorbitant tax breaks. Thirteen \nthousand more workers are about to lose their jobs, and a single mother \nworking full time, involved in her community, doing her best, can't \nafford to eat dinner. There is a clear disconnect between the \ncorporate-driven myopia of this administration on our Nation's economy \nand the real-world economic conditions working families in Ohio \nstruggle through every day.\n  Our middle class is shrinking in large part because our policies in \nWashington have betrayed the values of working families across our \ncountry, which is why we must revamp our economic and trade policies so \nthat we invest in our middle class. We must shrink income inequality, \ngrow our business community, and create good-paying jobs. We must \nestablish trade policy that builds our economic security. That is not \nwhat we have now.\n  Job loss does not just affect the worker or even just the worker's \nfamily; job loss, especially job loss in the thousands, devastates \ncommunities. It hurts the local business owners--the drugstore, the \ngrocery store, the neighborhood restaurant. When people are out of \nwork, they can't support their local economy, which forces owners to \nclose, in too many cases, their small businesses. That means lost \nrevenues to the community, which hurts schools, which hurts fire \ndepartments, which hurts police departments. The trade policies we set \nin Washington and negotiated across the globe have a direct impact on \nplaces such as Toledo and Steubenville, Cleveland and Lima, Zanesville \nand Portsmouth.\n  We hear the word ``protectionist'' thrown around by those who insist \non more of the same failed trade policies. It is considered \n``protectionist'' by some of them to fight for labor and environmental \nstandards, but they call it free trade when we pass trade agreements to \nprotect drug company patents and Hollywood DVDs. If we can protect \nintellectual property, as we should, if we can protect intellectual \nproperty rights with enforceable provisions in trade agreements, we can \ncertainly do the same for labor and environmental and food safety \nstandards. It is not a question of if we trade, it is how we trade and \nwho benefits from that trade.\n  While it is unclear whether the administration will ever acknowledge \nthat our trade policy has failed, it is very clear that this Congress \nis already at work. Republicans and Democrats are working cooperatively \nto revamp our trade policy. We are working cooperatively to raise the \nminimum wage. We will work cooperatively to make education more \naffordable for middle-class families and to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs for our Nation's seniors, and we will work \ncooperatively to invest in new technology and new industry.\n  In my State of Ohio, we have a talented and hard-working labor force \nand an entrepreneurial spirit second to none that needs only the \ninvestment dollars, predictable tax policy, and commitment from our \nGovernment to realize our economic potential.\n  Oberlin College, in the county in which I live, Lorain County, has \nthe largest building on any university campus in the country fully \npowered by solar energy. However, the builder had to buy the solar \npanels from Germany and Japan because we do not make enough of them in \nour country.\n  Through investment and alternative energy, we can not only create \njobs, we can grow industry, and we can grow industry through biomedical \nresearch and development. Now is the time for Government to do its part \nand direct our priorities from favoring the wealthiest 1 percent to \ngrowing our Nation's middle class.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, I would like to take this \nopportunity to wish my wife Connie, who is home in Ohio under several \nfeet of snow, a happy Valentines Day.\n  Connie, I am blessed to have you as my wife.\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             SCHIP Funding\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to wish my colleague a \nhappy Valentines Day, also. I am sorry his wife is under all that snow. \nIt is 70 degrees in south Georgia, so you should come south this year.\n  I rise today to bring to the attention of this body once again an \namendment Senator Isakson and I filed to the continuing resolution. The \namendment is very simple. It is very straightforward. We have a program \ncalled SCHIP that everybody in this body is familiar with, and it has \nbeen a very valuable program to every State in the country because what \nit does is provide children all across America who are above the \nMedicaid limit but not able to afford health insurance the opportunity \nto be covered by medical insurance. It is called the SCHIP program, and \nit is exactly what it says it is: health insurance assistance for \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, the money that is block-granted under this program has \ncreated some shortfalls in several States. The shortfalls vary with the \ntiming of the shortfalls, and the reasoning for the shortfalls differs \nin each of the States where we are about to run out of money for these \nchildren and then these children will no longer have health insurance \ncoverage.\n  The amendment that Senator Isakson and I have proposed will come up \nwith an alternative that allows those States which have an excess \namount of money to put that money into a pool of money from which the \n13 States that have a shortfall in the SCHIP program.\n  Mr. President, in this amendment, for the 13 States that will have a \nshortfall, we take money from States that have an excess amount of \nmoney, money they cannot possibly use in their SCHIP program because \nthis program expired at the end of this fiscal year. We allow them \nplenty of room for any emergency-type situation that might arise \nbetween now and the end of the fiscal year, and we give them the \nfunding they need to cover the children in their States. We utilize \nthat money to fund the shortfalls in States such as Georgia, where \n273,000 children participate in SCHIP.\n  Frankly, the main reason we have a shortfall in Georgia is because \nfollowing Hurricane Katrina last year we had an influx of some 40,000 \nchildren who came from the hurricane-devastated areas of Louisiana and \nMississippi into Georgia. They are now participating in the SCHIP \nprogram, and they should be allowed to have that coverage.\n  We now have the opportunity, in this Senate--whether it is today when \nwe vote on the continuing resolution, whether it is tomorrow or whether \nit is Friday--to look after these children who are very soon going to \nhave this insurance safety net jerked out from under them. I implore my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to encourage the Democratic \nleadership to allow the amendment to come forward, let us have a vote \non this amendment to make sure all of these children who participate in \nthe SCHIP program in Georgia as well as the other 13 States that are \ngoing to experience a shortfall between now and the time we reauthorize \nthis program before the end of the year, can continue to have that \nhealth care coverage they deserve and that they so badly need. It is a \nvery simple request we are making of the Democratic leadership that we \nallow this amendment to come forward.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Cardin be \nrecognized at 3 p.m., and when Senator Sanders is recognized today, he \nbe permitted to speak up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Federal budget is more than a long \nlist of numbers which, in this case, adds up to about $2.9 trillion. \nThe Federal budget, similar to any family budget or any company budget, \nis a statement of values and priorities. In fact, the Federal budget, \nin many ways, is a statement of what our country is all about.\n  We would all find it irresponsible and strange if a family we knew \nspent all of its money on an expensive vacation but forgot to put aside \nmoney for the mortgage or the rent and suddenly the family and their \nkids found themselves out on the street. We would say: My goodness, \nthat is irresponsible. The family was spending money where they \nshouldn't have been and not spending it where they should.\n  Preparing the Federal budget and analyzing the Federal budget is \nexactly the same process. It is about spending the money of the people \nof the United States of America. It is about deciding where we should \nspend it and where we should not spend it. It is looking at the \nAmerican people as a family. It is about taking a hard look at the \nneeds of our people and prioritizing the budget in an intelligent and a \nrational way.\n  Let me take a quick glance at the economic reality facing the middle \nclass, the working families of our country, tens and tens of millions \nof Americans and their kids.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, more than 5 million \nAmericans have slipped into poverty, including over 1 million children. \nNot only does the United States of America have the highest rate of \npoverty of any major country on Earth, we also shamefully have the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, with \nalmost 18 percent of our children living in poverty. Today, 37 million \nAmericans live in poverty and 13 million are children.\n  Last year, in the richest Nation in the history of the world, 35 \nmillion of our fellow Americans struggled to put food on the table. The \nAgriculture Department recently reported that the number of the \npoorest, hungriest Americans keep rising. In America today, hunger is a \ngrowing problem.\n  We have a crisis in our Nation in terms of affordable housing. \nMillions of working families in my State of Vermont and all over this \ncountry are paying 50 to 60 percent of their limited incomes for \nhousing. And there are, as we well know, other families who are either \nliving in their cars or living out on the streets--in some cases, with \ntheir children--in America.\n  Last year, there were 1.2 million home foreclosures in this country, \nan increase of 42 percent since 2005.\n  The cost of energy has rapidly risen since President Bush has been in \noffice. Oil prices have more than doubled and gasoline prices have gone \nup by 70 percent since January of 2001. This increase in energy prices, \nin gas prices, is putting a huge strain on people from all over this \ncountry, including workers from rural States such as Vermont, who have \nto travel long distances to get to their jobs.\n  As is well known, many middle-class families in our country today are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to afford the escalating costs of a \ncollege education with average tuition and other costs increasing \nrapidly with the result that many families are now saying: We can't \nsend our kids to college, while other young people are graduating \ncollege deeply in debt.\n  In America today, millions of our workers are working longer hours \nfor lower wages, and median income for working-age families has \ndeclined for 5 years in a row. Today, incredible as it may sound, the \npersonal savings rate is below zero, which has not happened since the \nGreat Depression. In other words, all over this country working people \nand people in the middle class are purchasing groceries, they are \npurchasing gas at the pump, they are purchasing other basic necessities \nthrough their credit cards and, in the process, are going deeper and \ndeeper into debt.\n  Over the last 6 years, we have lost in this country 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs, often good-paying manufacturing jobs, including \n10,000 in my small State of Vermont. Many of the new jobs that are \navailable to those displaced workers, if they are lucky enough to find \nnew jobs, will pay wages and benefits substantially lower than the jobs \nthey have lost.\n  It is no secret that in America today our health care system is \ndisintegrating. There is little dispute about that. Health care costs \nare soaring. Today, we have 46.6 million Americans with zero health \ninsurance, an increase of 6.8 million since President Bush has been in \noffice.\n  Today, 3 million fewer American workers have pension coverage than \nwhen President Bush took office and\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nhalf of private-sector American workers have no pension coverage \nwhatsoever.\n  Throughout our country, American workers who now work the longest \nhours of any people in the industrialized world--husbands working long \nhours, wives working long hours, people being stressed out by having to \nwork so hard to earn the living they need to pay for their basic \nneeds--are finding it harder and harder to come up with jobs, to get \njobs which provide them a decent amount of vacation time. The 2-week \nvacation is something many workers no longer can have in this country.\n  While the middle class is shrinking and while poverty is increasing \nin our country, there is another reality taking place. That is that the \nwealthiest 1 percent, the people at the very top of the economic \nladder, have not had it so good since the 1920s. The middle class is \nshrinking, poverty is increasing, and the people on the top are doing \nphenomenally well.\n  According to Forbes magazine, the selective net worth of the \nwealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 \ntrillion; 400 families, $1.25 trillion in worth. The 400 wealthiest \nAmericans are worth an unbelievable amount of money and their wealth is \nsoaring.\n  Sadly, however, the United States today has the most unfair \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country and the gap \nbetween the very wealthy and everyone else is growing wider. This was a \ncountry formed around egalitarian principles--we are all in it \ntogether. When one goes up, others go up. Yet what we are seeing today \nin an almost unprecedented way is the people on the top making out like \nbandits, earning huge increases in their incomes, in their wealth, \nwhile the middle class shrinks and poverty is increasing.\n  Today the wealthiest 13,000 families in our country own nearly as \nmuch income as do the bottom 20 million families. That is 13,000 \ncompared to 20 million. And the wealthiest 1 percent own more wealth \nthan the bottom 90 percent.\n  I have given a brief sketch of the economy in terms of how it impacts \nthe middle class and working families of our country. Let me, within \nthat context of what is happening to tens of millions of Americans, \ntake a look at the President's budget.\n  At a time of a major health care crisis, with more and more Americans \nuninsured or underinsured, the President's budget would cut Medicare \nand Medicaid by $280 billion over the next decade, lowering the quality \nof health care for approximately 43 million senior citizens and people \nwith disabilities who depend on Medicare and more than 50 million \nAmericans who rely on Medicaid.\n\n  At a time when our childcare and early childhood education system are \ntotally inadequate to meet the needs of working parents, the Bush \nbudget reduces the number of children receiving childcare assistance by \n300,000. Childcare in crisis. The President's response: Deny childcare \nto 300,000 children.\n  In addition, the President's budget provides a $100 million cut for \nthe Head Start program at a time when only about one-half of the \nchildren eligible for this important and excellent program actually \nparticipate in it due to a lack of funding. Huge numbers of kids cannot \nget into Head Start. The President's response: Cut Head Start funding.\n  While hunger in this country, as I mentioned earlier, is shamefully \nincreasing, the President's budget denies food stamps to 280,000 \nfamilies and eliminates nutrition assistance to over 400,000 senior \ncitizens, mothers, and newborn children.\n  We are in a war in Iraq. We are in a war in Afghanistan. The number \nof our veterans is increasing. Twenty-two thousand have been wounded, \nmany seriously. Many will come back to this country with post-traumatic \nstress disorder. Yet the President has significantly cut funding for \nthe VA over a period of years, and some years ago made hundreds of \nthousands of veterans ineligible to get VA health care.\n  In this great country, with so many people struggling desperately to \nkeep their heads above water, we should not be cutting back on health \ncare. We should not be cutting back on nutritional benefits. We should \nnot be cutting back on Head Start, affordable housing, the needs of our \nveterans, and educational opportunities for middle-class families. That \nis what we should not be doing.\n  This is especially true when the President's budget provides $739 \nbillion in tax breaks over the next decade to households with incomes \nexceeding $1 million per year. The average tax break for this group of \nmillionaires will total $162,000 by the year 2012.\n  Let me be very blunt. In my view it is wrong, in my view it is \nimmoral to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires--the \npeople who need them the least--while cutting back on the needs of the \nmiddle-class and working families of our country. That is wrong.\n  Is this budget, the President's budget, a reflection of the values of \nthe people of our country? I do not believe that. I do not believe \nordinary Americans think it is right and appropriate to give tax breaks \nto billionaires and then provide inadequately for our veterans, for our \nchildren, and for our seniors. That is not, in my view, what America is \nabout.\n  We are told over and over again we do not have the money to reduce \nchildhood poverty in this country. We are told we do not have the funds \nto wipe out the disgrace of hunger in America. We are told we do not \nhave enough money to make sure the young people who graduate from high \nschool in this country, who are excited about going to college, will be \nable to do so without coming out deeply in debt.\n  We do not have the money to help those families. Yet--yet--while we \nturn our backs on the middle-class and working families of our country, \nit appears we have plenty of money for the millionaires and \nbillionaires of this country. We have tens of billions, in fact, to \nshower on those who need it the least, yet we have nothing, and we are \ncutting back on the programs, for those who need it most.\n  Included in the President's budget, amazingly, is the complete repeal \nof the estate tax which would take effect at the end of 2010. As you \nknow, the complete repeal of this tax would benefit only the top two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the American people. Let me repeat that. The \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax would benefit solely the upper two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the American population.\n  These are families, of course, who already are millionaires and \nbillionaires, and these are families who in the current economy have \nbeen doing exceedingly well. In other words, 99.8 percent of Americans \nwould not benefit by one nickel from the complete repeal of the estate \ntax, as proposed by the President.\n  According to the President's budget, this repeal of the estate tax \nwould reduce receipts for the Treasury by more than $91 billion over \nthe next 5 years and more than $442 billion over the next decade. But \nthe long-term damage to our fiscal solvency is even worse.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, repealing \nthe estate tax would cost over $1 trillion from 2012 to 2021--over $1 \ntrillion. In other words, if the President's plan to permanently repeal \nthe estate tax succeeds, the children and family members of the very \nfew most privileged families in America will reap a massive tax break. \nInstead of closing the gap between the rich and the poor, instead of \naddressing the huge national debt and deficit problems we have, we make \nboth situations worse by fully repealing the estate tax.\n\n  I have brought with me a few charts to demonstrate who are the \nwinners and losers in the President's budget. Obviously, fortunes go up \nand down, and we do not know what anyone is going to be worth tomorrow, \nlet alone in the coming years. And the estimates I am giving to you and \nthe charts I am using are based on two reports.\n  The first is an April 2006 report by United for a Fair Economy and \nPublic Citizen, entitled ``Spending Millions to Save Billions,'' \nreflecting the financial position of the wealthiest 400 Americans in \nthis country as compiled by Forbes magazine from the year 2005.\n  The second is a May 30, 2006 report from the House Government Reform \nCommittee, entitled ``Estimated Tax Savings of Oil Company CEOs.''\n  Of course, no one can predict what the numbers will be in the years \nto\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\ncome. But these are the best figures available to us at this time.\n  Let me go to the first chart. The granddaddy of all of the winners \nunder the Bush budget is none other than the heirs to the Wal-Mart \nfortune. If the estate tax was completely repealed, the entire Walton \nfamily would receive an estimated tax break of $32.7 billion--that is \nwith a ``B''--$32.7 billion in tax relief for one family which today \nhappens to be one of the wealthiest families in this country already.\n  Meanwhile, in contrast, the President's budget proposes to cut \nMedicaid by $28 billion over the next decade, driving up the cost of \nhealth care for tens of millions of Americans. In other words, while \none of the wealthiest families in this country gets a tax break of over \n$30 billion, tens of millions of Americans--children, seniors--will \nsuffer. Now, that may make sense to someone, that may appear to be fair \nto someone, but it sure does not make sense to me. In other words, if \nthe President's proposed budget passes, millions of Americans will \nlose, including some of the most vulnerable people in our country, \nwhile one very wealthy family wins.\n  A second major beneficiary of the President's tax cuts is the heirs \nof the Mars candy bar fortune. Now, I like Snickers as much as anybody. \nAnd I do not want to be seen here as attacking Snickers, one of the \nbasic food groups of American society. But the family that owns Mars is \nslated to receive an estimated $11.7 billion tax break if the estate \ntax is fully repealed.\n  Mr. President, $11.7 billion for the Mars family. They are winners. \nYet, who are the losers? As I mentioned earlier, all over this country \nthere are waiting lines for veterans to get into VA hospitals. We are \nnot keeping our promises to the veterans. Veterans lose while one \nfamily wins big time. I think that is wrong.\n  Another major winner in the President's budget is the Cox family. \nThey are the heirs to the Cox cable fortune. They will gain $9.7 \nbillion if the estate tax is repealed. Meanwhile, while the Cox family \nwould receive almost $10 billion in tax breaks, the President wants to \ncut funding for education by $1.5 billion.\n  The President keeps talking about No Child Left Behind while his \nbudget continues to leave, in fact, millions of children behind. In \nVermont and all over this country, school districts are struggling with \ngrossly inadequate funding for special education, which the President \nalso wants to cut. We do not have the money to fund special education \nto improve public education in America. We do not have that money. But \nwe do have $9.7 billion for one family, the Mars family.\n  Another major beneficiary of the President's budget is the Nordstrom \nfamily, owners of the upscale department store chain. By repealing the \nestate tax, the Nordstrom family stands to receive an estimated $826 \nmillion tax break, according to the April 2006 report from United for a \nFair Economy. Tax breaks of over $800 million for an enormously wealthy \nfamily, and yet we see a $630 million cut in the President's budget for \nthe Community Services Block Grant Program.\n  As you know, the Community Services Block Grant Program provides the \ninfrastructure necessary to deliver services to 15 million of the \nlowest income people in our country. These are people who are hungry. \nWhen they are hungry, they go to the community action program. When \nthey are homeless, they go to the community action program. When they \ndo not have any money to buy food, they go to the community action \nprogram. We are going to cut back on that program, but we do have $826 \nmillion in tax breaks for the Nordstrom family.\n  Another major beneficiary of the Bush budget is the family of Ernest \nGallo, who would receive a $468 million tax break--$468 million. \nMeanwhile, the President proposes to cut $420 million from the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, the LIHEAP program.\n  According to the latest available data, 5.4 million senior citizens \non fixed incomes and low-income families with kids receive help paying \ntheir heating bills through this program each and every year. In the \nState of Vermont, trust me, it gets very cold, and we have a lot of \npeople in Vermont and throughout this country who are dependent upon \nthe LIHEAP program. But, as a nation, the President suggests: No, no, \nwe have to cut $420 million from LIHEAP, which impacts the lives of \nlow-income senior citizens. But--guess what--we do have $468 million \navailable as a tax break for the Gallo family.\n  The former CEO of ExxonMobil does very well from the President's tax \nbreaks. As some will remember, while the cost of gas at the pumps was \nsoaring, while the profits of ExxonMobil were soaring, the company \ndecided, in its wisdom and generosity, to provide a $400 million \nretirement package for their departing CEO, Mr. Lee Raymond. Now the \nPresident wants to reward Mr. Raymond by providing his estate with an \nestimated $164 million tax break. On the other hand, there is a program \ncalled the Commodities Supplemental Food Program which provides a \npackage of high-quality, nutritious food to some 480,000 seniors, \nmothers, and children. The President wants to eliminate this program. \nHe is saying to the 4,000 seniors in Vermont who benefit from this \nprogram, the almost half a million seniors, mothers, and kids who \nbenefit from this package of food once a month: We in America don't \nhave enough money to provide for you who are hungry, for you who are \nold. We can't do it. But if you are the former CEO of ExxonMobil, if \nyou have a $400 million bonus at the end of your career, guess what. \nYour family will get a $164 million tax break.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it appears to me that the \nchoice we as a Congress are facing and that the American people are \nfacing is pretty clear. Do we continue to shower huge tax breaks on \nmillionaires and billionaires, people who are already doing \nphenomenally well, while we cut back on the needs of the middle-class \nworking families and the most vulnerable people in this country? It all \ncomes down to the phrase ``which side are we on.'' Are we on the side \nof those people who make huge campaign contributions to Congress and \nthe White House, or are we on the side of tens of millions of working \nfamilies, struggling hard to keep their heads above water?\n  That is the choice we face. As a member of the Budget Committee, I \nthink the answer is pretty obvious. I will not be voting to provide a \ntax break to the heirs of the Wal-Mart fortune. Rather, I will be \nfighting to substantially increase financial aid for low- and middle-\nclass families so that every American, regardless of income, can \nreceive a college education. I will not support another tax cut for the \nformer CEO of ExxonMobil and his family. Instead, I will be voting to \ngive support to working families all over this country who are \ndesperately seeking quality and affordable childcare.\n  If, as a nation, we are serious about addressing the long neglected \nneeds of the middle-class and working people and creating a fairer and \nmore egalitarian society, we have to invest in education, health care, \nhousing, and our infrastructure. We have to deal with the crisis of \nglobal warming and sustainable energy, as well as many other areas. We \nalso have to reduce our national debt. Given that reality, Congress \nmust develop the courage to stand up to the big money interests, to the \nwealthiest families. We must roll back the tax breaks given to the \nwealthiest 1 percent, and we must demand that fortunate people rejoin \nAmerican society and understand that like everybody else in this \ncountry, they are part of America and not a special breed. If we are to \nkeep faith with our children, our seniors, our veterans, and with those \npeople who have no health insurance, we can do no less. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to make sure we do just that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Access to Health Care\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak of an \nissue of great concern in my State of Alaska but also a concern we are \nseeing across the Nation, and this is access to health\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\ncare and, more specifically, access to the professionals who provide \nfor our very important health care needs.\n  In just 20 years, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years \nor older, a percentage larger than any other time in our Nation's \nhistory. And just as this aging population places the highest demand on \nour health care system, the Council on Graduate Medical Education \nstates that there will be a national shortage of over 100,000 \nphysicians in this country. Other experts look at it from a bit more \ndire perspective and predict a shortage closer to 200,000 physicians. \nIf that becomes a reality, 84 million patients will be left without a \ndoctor's care.\n  A dozen States already report physician shortages. Across the \ncountry, patients are experiencing, or soon will face, shortages in \nmany physician specialties, including cardiology, radiology, and \nseveral pediatric and surgical subspecialties. Demand for doctors is \naccelerating more rapidly than the supply, and yet the number of our \nmedical school graduates has remained virtually flat for over a quarter \nof a century.\n  During that same time period, the median tuition and fees at medical \nschools have increased by 750 percent in private schools and by nearly \n900 percent in public schools.\n  To add to that, much of the Nation's physician workforce also is \ngraying. They are simply getting older. They are heading for \nretirement. A third of the Nation's 750,000 active post residency \nphysicians are older than 55 and likely to retire just as this boomer \npopulation generation moves into its time of greatest medical need. By \nthe year 2020, physicians are expected to hang up their stethoscopes at \na rate nearly 2\\1/2\\ times the retirement rate of today.\n  A looming doctor shortage threatens to create a national health care \ncrisis by further limiting access to physicians, jeopardizing quality \nand accelerating cost increases. People are waiting for weeks to get \nappointments, and emergency departments have lines that fall out the \ndoor, literally. Many will go without care entirely, and we know the \nconsequence then in terms of the pressures on the health care system \nwhen they go without care. In rural America, patients have long gone \nwithout care. In fact, the shortage of physicians, especially primary \ncare physicians, in rural areas of the United States represents one of \nthe most intractable health policy problems of the past century. As a \nresult, rural patients are often denied both access to care and quality \nof care. One-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural America.\n  Yet only 9 percent of the Nation's physicians are practicing in these \nareas. Over 50 million of these rural Americans live in areas that have \na shortage of physicians to meet their basic needs.\n  Additionally, physician recruitment to rural America has also been a \nproblem. The high cost of medical school is in large part to blame. \nMost students, very severely in debt after medical school, are forced \naway from primary care and forced into more lucrative speciality \nmedicine. Rural areas and their community health centers across the \nNation report a declining ability to recruit primary care physicians.\n  Alaska, as my colleagues have heard me say on the floor of the Senate \nmany times, geographically is huge. It is a State larger than Texas, \nCalifornia, and Montana combined. In Alaska, ``rural'' really takes on \na new meaning. The physician shortage crisis in Alaska has long been \nmagnified. Health care delivery in the State is extremely difficult \nbecause, in part, there are fewer roads than in any other State. Even \nRhode Island has more roads than Alaska. This means that for the vast \nmajority of communities in Alaska, our medical supplies, our patients, \nand our providers all must travel by air, which adds to the cost.\n  Alaska's population is growing, especially its elderly population, \nwhich is the second fastest growing in the Nation.\n  People don't typically think of Alaska as having a fair number of \nseniors, but our senior population is growing at a very rapid rate. \nHowever, Alaska's physician workforce, as others across the Nation, is \naging. The number of new residents is not keeping up with attrition. \nMr. President, 118 physicians in Anchorage alone are expected to retire \nin the next 10 years.\n  Currently, Alaska has the sixth lowest ratio of physicians to \npopulation in the United States. Outside of Anchorage, the ratio is the \nworst in the Nation. To put it into perspective, if Alaska were to \nreach its national average of physicians to population, if we were to \nreach it by the year 2025, we would need a net increase of 980 \nphysicians statewide or 49 more physicians per year.\n  For some in States where their population base is significant, they \nmight say 980 physicians between now and 2025 isn't that bad. We only \nhave about 650,000 people in the State of Alaska. For us to find 980 \nphysicians, or 49 more physicians per year, is a tall order.\n  In Anchorage, many specialties are in serious or in critical \nshortage, including general internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, \nrheumatology, and infectious diseases. Patients wait for months to be \naccepted as new patients for general internal medicine. Others have to \nbe flown to Seattle for some critical specialties.\n  I need to repeat this because we are not just talking about ``I don't \nlike this particular doctor, and I want to find somebody else.'' We \ndon't have the physicians to see the patients, so a patient will wait \nfor months for an appointment or the other alternative is to fly \noutside to Seattle.\n  There is a bright spot, though, on the horizon. Even though Alaska \nhas only one residency training program--and I should also mention we \ndon't have any medical schools in the State of Alaska--our one \nresidency training program trains 12 family medicine residents each \nyear--clearly a number that is far fewer than our population needs. \nSeventy-seven percent of the residents choose to stay in Alaska--the \nhighest rate of return in the Nation. We know why it is. We figure we \nhave an awful lot to offer those who come to the State, but the problem \nis drawing them to the State in the first place.\n  In the last Congress, with great fanfare, we provided a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. But the question I was asking at that time \nis, What good is a prescription drug benefit if there is no physician \nto write prescriptions? In the 21st century, we cannot, as a \nGovernment, permit such dire access to care to continue. I do believe \nthe situation is intolerable. We cannot sit by while potentially \nmillions of patients go without care. That is why I am proposing a \nthree-pronged plan to alleviate the Nation's rural health care access \ncrisis.\n  Earlier in the year, I introduced the Rural Physician Relief Act. \nThis is legislation which would provide tax incentives for physicians \nto practice in our most rural and frontier locations in the country. \nToday, I am announcing a second step on improving access to health \ncare. Soon, I will introduce the Physician Shortage Elimination Act. \nThis is a strong step in improving access to our health system. Later, \nas the third prong of my plan, I will introduce comprehensive \nlegislation for improving the plight of the uninsured.\n  To get to the Physician Shortage Elimination Act, it essentially does \nfour things:\n  First and foremost, it doubles the funding for the National Health \nService Corps. This program has operated with 37 years of excellence, \nproviding primary care services to our most vulnerable populations. It \nis a solution to the many students who find the exorbitant cost of \nmedical school prohibitively expensive. However, the program is just \ntoo small to meet the great need in underserved America. Right now, \nover 4,000 National Health Service Corps clinicians provide primary \ncare to nearly 6 million people nationwide who otherwise would likely \nhave gone without care. Tragically, this still leaves some 50 million \npeople with extremely diminished access to health care. In fact, the \nAmerican Association of Medical Colleges said the current program only \nmeets 12 percent of the needs of the underserved. Yet this program is \nso popular with medical students that 80 percent of its applicants in a \ntypical year must be turned away.\n  This National Health Service Corps has a proven track record. Let us \nbuild on its success. Doubling our investment in the National Health \nService Corps is the most prudent, most cost-effective and expeditious \nway to meet the current needs and future needs of\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nAmerica's underserved. In fact, the former president of the AAMC stated \nthat the National Health Service Corps:\n\n        . . . is ideally positioned to alleviate the shortage of \n     physicians in many medically underserved areas but has only \n     had sufficient funding to accommodate only a fraction of \n     those young physicians who are prepared to practice in those \n     areas.\n\n  The second part of the bill will improve and expand current medical \nresidency programs. Half of all physicians practice medicine within 100 \nmiles of their residency. This means the residents who train in rural \nor underserved areas are likely to remain in those areas. The small \nAlaska Family Residency Program, which is a program designed to help \nmeet the needs in rural Alaska, is a great example of this. Of the 55 \ngraduates, 75 percent have stayed in Alaska upon completing their \nresidency--the highest return rate of any graduate medical program in \nthe country. Unfortunately, it is too small to meet the large needs of \nrural Alaska.\n  Rural and underserved residency programs must be allowed to flourish. \nWe have arcane barriers, and we have artificial caps on residency \nprograms that need to be removed. Students must be allowed to learn \ntheir craft in the most rural and underserved areas of the Nation. My \nlegislation will prevent residency programs from being penalized for \ntraining in locations where the need is greatest, such as the Indian \nHealth Service locations. Additionally, it will remove barriers that \nprevent programs from developing rural training rotations and rural \nexperiences in their curriculum. All the experts agree that this is \nlikely one of the most effective ways to prepare students for a rural \npractice.\n  Further, the legislation will reauthorize the Centers of Excellence \nProgram and the Health Careers Opportunity Program. This did not \nreceive funding for 2006, but these are important programs, and they \ntarget disadvantaged and minority students from as young as \nkindergarten on through high school. They target these young people to \ndevelop an interest in the health professions. The programs nurture the \nyouth in rural and underserved areas, and they create a pipeline to \ncareers in the health professions. This concept of ``growing your \nown,'' if you will, is the most effective way of achieving long-term \nretention in most rural locations.\n  Finally, my legislation will bolster the cornerstone of health care \nin rural America, which is the community health center. Community \nhealth centers provide quality community-based health care for millions \nof America's medically underserved and uninsured. This bill will help \nthem do their job. It will expand residency programs and primary care \nservices offered by community health service centers and offer grants \nto health centers to assist them in recruitment, technical assistance, \nand physician mentoring programs.\n  Mr. President, as a person coming from a rural area, you know a \nstrong commitment to our community health centers is a smart, cost-\neffective way of maximizing our health care dollars for our neediest \npopulations.\n  The prognosis for quality of health care in America right now does \nnot look good. The prognosis is poor. Fifty million Americans in \nunderserved areas across the Nation today already must do without care. \nSoon, we will have greater problems. We will have even greater \nphysician shortages, which will mean another 84 million patients will \nbe left without a physician's care.\n  We must act here in Congress. I ask my colleagues to take a look at \nthe legislation we are introducing, the Physician Shortage Elimination \nAct, and see if this isn't something we can join together to work on so \nwe can continue to provide the level of care Americans across the \ncountry, in both rural and urban areas, deserve and expect.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 p.m., \nthe Senate go into executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. \n25, the nomination of Nora Barry Fischer to be a U.S. district judge; \nthat there be 10 minutes for debate on that nomination equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and \n5 minutes under the control of Senator Casey; that at 4:45 p.m., the \nSenate vote on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then return to legislative session and resume \nconsideration of H. J. Res. 20; that all amendments and motions be \nwithdrawn, the joint resolution be read a third time, and the Senate \nvote on final passage, with the preceding all occurring without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 darfur\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the people of the Darfur region of Sudan \nare crying out for help during their time of despair. It is time for \nthe U.S. Government to exercise greater international leadership and \ntake greater strides to stave off a humanitarian disaster.\n  Darfur has been identified as genocide and the international \ncommunity is permitting it to continue. This is not acceptable.\n  It is not enough to posture and threaten the government in Khartoum. \nIt is time to exercise moral leadership and exercise more muscular \ndiplomacy in an area where so little has been accomplished for so many.\n  The conflict in Darfur has been raging for 4 years. Since 2003, the \nSudanese Government and its allied Janjaweed militia have been fighting \nthe rebel Sudanese Liberation Army--SLA, and the Justice and Equality \nMovement--JEM. The SLA and the JEM claimed their aim was to force the \nSudanese Government to address the underdevelopment and political \nmarginalization in the region.\n  In response, the government and the Janjaweed targeted the region's \ncivilian population and the ethnic groups from which the rebels draw \ntheir support.\n  Since the fighting began, over 200,000 people have been killed. \nApproximately 3 million people have fled to internal displacement camps \nwithin Darfur, or to neighboring Chad and the Central African \nRepublic--C.A.R. None of these options have shielded them from violence \nas the Janjaweed has patrolled outside the camps and Sudanese warplanes \nhave attacked inside Chad and C.A.R.\n  In the face of these horrendous conditions, an estimated 14,000 aid \nworkers risk their lives to provide basic human services and comfort to \none-third of the population in Darfur. The majority of these aid \nworkers are Sudanese nationals who have banded together to create an \nunprecedented relief operation.\n  For its part, the United States provides approximately $1 billion in \nfood aid to the Darfur region. This contribution is one of the few \npositive developments for the people in Darfur as we have been able to \nincrease the daily nutritional intake. Nonetheless, the violence rages \nand many aid agencies working in Darfur are unable to gain access to \nvast areas because of the fighting.\n  Thus far only the African Union--AU--has responded to the call to \nprotect civilians. Unfortunately, the AU troops have been deployed in a \nslow and limited manner.\n  The Darfur region is roughly 160,000 square miles, and the AU force \nis far too small to cover this vast territory. The AU should be \ncommended for shouldering the burden this long.\n  In August 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted \nResolution 1706, to expand the mandate of the U.N. mission in Sudan--\nUNIMIS--to include Darfur. The resolution ``invites the consent of the \nSudanese Government'' to allow U.N. forces into Darfur and ``authorizes \nuse of `all necessary means' to protect U.N. personnel and civilians \nunder threat of physical violence.''\n  Resolution 1706 calls for a total of 27,000 armed personnel for \nSudan. The breakdown includes the 7,000 AU soldiers, 17,000 U.N. blue \nhelmets and 3,000 police officers. This is a significant mission by the \nUnited Nations and one\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nthat underscores significant international concern about Darfur.\n  Without question, U.N. Resolution 1706 caused concern and then foot \ndragging by the Khartoum Government. Khartoum is wary of a robust U.N. \ntroop presence on its soil for two reasons. First, it fears the \ninvestigators from the International Criminal Court--ICC--who will have \ngreater latitude under a U.N. presence. Second, it fears the presence \nof the U.N. will force them to follow through on the oil revenue \nsharing agreement with the southern Sudanese.\n  Khartoum views a U.N. presence as a surrender of sovereignty. \nHowever, what it really fears is the ICC investigators being able to \ngather evidence within its borders. Since the ICC accepted the \nresponsibility of looking into genocide in Sudan, Khartoum has \nmaneuvered mightily to keep its investigators away, out of the country.\n  Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has resisted the U.N. force since \nits inception. As he has done repeatedly throughout the Darfur crisis, \nhe commits and later reneges on commitments and pledges of cooperation \nin Darfur. For this reason, former U.N. General Secretary, Kofi Annan, \ngave us a viable Plan A to implement the U.N. force in Sudan.\n  Plan A implements a hybrid U.N.-AU force which the government of \nSudan initially agreed to.\n  Plan A is a workable option and a win-win for everybody. \nUnfortunately, President al-Bashir has back pedaled from his initial \nembrace of Mr. Annan's plan. On November 18, 2006, it was reported \nSudan's U.N. ambassador declared ``there will be no U.N. peacekeepers \nin Darfur.''\n  The ambassador's comments came as Sudanese war planes and Sudanese-\nbacked militias staged fresh attacks in neighboring Chad and the \nCentral African Republic.\n  It is imperative the United States and the international community \nreinvigorate diplomacy with Sudan in order to move Khartoum to reason. \nThis is what I would describe as the administration's potential Plan B.\n  The immediate next steps for Darfur are complex, yet achievable. \nThese include securing a cease fire and protecting humanitarian relief \ncorridors, establishing the hybrid U.N.-AU peacekeeping operation and \nadvancing the political dialogue in Darfur.\n  Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \nmust place Sudan higher on the U.S.-Chinese agenda. Sudan produces some \n500,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil per day. China purchases 80 percent \nof this oil and invests heavily into Sudan's oil producing \ninfrastructure.\n  As China continues its diplomatic and economic courtship of African \nnations, she should be clear about how she intends to deal with \ndespotic and authoritarian governments. The international community has \nworked hard over the past 20 years for greater progress on democracy \nand human issues in Africa. Having China thumb its nose at these \naccomplishments would set a bad precedent for Africa and should have \nconsequences in the West.\n  China should be afforded an opportunity to become part of the \nsolution in addressing Sudan's humanitarian concerns.\n  Diplomacy and economic leverage should be applied to Sudan with the \ncooperation of China.\n  The United States has clearly shown what can be accomplished through \nsustained and concerted diplomatic efforts. After 21 years of fighting \nwe were able to persuade Khartoum to negotiate with the Sudanese \nPeople's Liberation Front--SPLF.\n  This administration was able to marshal international humanitarian \nsupport and the attention of the world to what is happening in Darfur. \nThe United States must provide the vision and the leadership to protect \ninnocent civilians in Darfur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement I am recognized until 4:15; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will try not to take that much time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  (A portion of the remarks of Mr. Coburn are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to turn to the bill in front of us \nand make a few remarks about how things change, but they never change. \nWe had an election this last fall. The election was based on changing \nthe control so we can control the spending, so we can secure the \nfuture, so we can eliminate wasteful Washington spending. I would put \nforth that the bill in front of us is more of the same--actually I want \nto guard the words I use--more of the same lack of clarity, lack of \ntransparency and game playing that Congress has been known for the last \n25 to 30 years.\n  The bill before us manipulates the numbers. The bill before us is \nuntruthful about the costs. The bill before us is put on the floor of \nthe Senate without any debate to bring forth transparency. No \namendments are going to be offered to bring forth transparency. No \namendments are going to be offered to offset the cost. This $3.1 \nbillion expense is going to go directly to our grandchildren because \nwhat is not spent for military construction and BRAC costs will be \nadded to the supplemental which we are going to be taking up in March. \nWe are going to be taking up more of the same games, so what you got \nfor what you thought was change is not a change at all. It is just a \nchange in name only. It is important for the American people to \nunderstand it is not Republican or Democrat, it is short-term vision \nversus long-term vision for our country.\n  We have a bill before us on the floor of the Senate that does a lot \nof things--a lot we should have gotten done. There is no question. The \nmajority is within its rights to do what it has done. The predicate \nthat Senator Reid used, that it was used on the Democrats before--there \nwas no complaint with that. It has been done. It is not a good process. \nBut what we are seeing is not what was promised. We thought we bought a \nnew car, and what we bought, what the American people bought, was a car \nthat had been wrecked and repainted and sold as new.\n  I want to talk about several of the problems, things that are wrong \nwith this bill. I want to raise the question why should we not fix it \nnow. I will start first with the BRAC money--$3.1 billion to move tens \nof thousands of troops out of Germany, back here. It is not going to \nhappen. The money may come with the omnibus but not in time to achieve \nthe savings that we were hoping to achieve through the BRAC process. So \nthere is a double cost. One is, if we took that money and we spent it \nto grow the Government--debatable. It is not debatable that some of the \nthings that are funded with that are not good--but are they the \npriority? We are going to grow the Government, No. 1, and then we are \ngoing to take that money and put it on the supplemental bill.\n  A supplemental bill is a bill that comes forward outside the budget \nparameters, so therefore any of the money spent doesn't have to be \nwithin the budget limits. That money goes directly to the credit card \nof your grandkids. There is $3.1 billion. Then we are going to lose the \nbenefits through delay of the BRAC closure process which is going to be \nanother $3 to $5 billion. So by playing the same games Washington has \nbeen known for for years, we are going to add $7 or $8 billion more to \nthe debt of our grandchildren.\n  If you thought things changed, they didn't. They changed in name \nonly. This game with this maneuver in it is a sham for our grandkids \nand anybody else who thinks we are going to be fiscally responsible \nwith your money.\n  The second thing it does is it destroys some of the help that was out \nthere to help the most vulnerable. There was a provision in the new \nRyan White AIDS bill that saves the life of newborn babies. We know it \nworks. The two States that have done it have reduced HIV infection in \nnewborn children by about 98 percent--for $85: $10 to test and $75 to \ntreat newborn children.\n  In New York they used to have 500 babies a year born who were \ninfected with HIV. Last year they had seven. Why? Because women who did \nnot know their status were given an opportunity to opt out of being \ntested. If they didn't want to be tested, they\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\ndidn't have to be. But if they did, they were given an opportunity to \nget tested. And if they didn't want to be tested, their baby was \ntested, so if, in fact, they were carrying HIV, we could prevent, 99 \npercent of the time, those children from becoming infected with HIV.\n  The money was taken out in this bill. This is a chart for the \ninfections, perinatal infections. Just in these States alone, for which \nwe have a record, these are going to be the preventable cases of \nnewborn baby AIDS that are going to not happen because of what this \nbill does. Thousands of babies are going to get infected with HIV \nbecause we are taking away the incentives. In terms of this bill, it is \nsmall numbers, $30 million--incentives to get States doing what New \nYork and Connecticut have done.\n  Shame on us, shame on us, to claim we care and then to take this and \neliminate it. They went so far as to talk to the administration about \nthis, hoping that they would have a letter coming that would say we \ndon't want the money. In fact, they want the money. It is in the \nPresident's budget. He wants the money. Why? Because it actually does \nsomething. Your dollars actually go to make a difference. How do they \nmake a difference? Not only do they save the life, the cost to treat a \nbaby over their life--their life expectancy is only 25 years if they \nget HIV. But that is a quarter of a million dollars versus $85, and the \nvast majority of that money is going to be paid by the American \ntaxpayers. So shame on us. Shame on us for doing that. These are, just \nin these States alone, the number of children who are going to get \ninfected with HIV without this program going forward.\n\n  Another amendment I wanted to offer so we could offer ways to try to \nchange these things is to delay the CR for 2 weeks and let's have the \ndebate about these issues, but we are not going to be allowed to even \noffer an amendment to continue it for 2 more weeks so we can actually \ndebate it. That is the majority's right. I respect their right. It was \nprobably done to them before I got here. It doesn't mean it is the \ncorrect process for our country to solve the big fiscal problems that \nare in front of us.\n  One of the items which Barack Obama and I got through the last \nCongress in coordination with several key Members in the House was the \nAccountability and Transparency Act of 2006. What that act says is by \nJanuary 1 of next year, you as the American taxpayer are going to start \nfinding out how we are spending the money. The whole idea behind it is \nif you know, we are going to be held to a higher standard. We are going \nto be held more accountable. Also the idea behind it is if you know the \nAmerican people are going to know, maybe you won't do some of the \nthings for your buddies you are up here doing.\n  But in this bill there are 40 reports that are demanded of the \nadministration that aren't available to you, that have nothing to do \nwith national security. I can't even get them. The President pro \ntempore of the Senate right now can't get them unless he sits on the \nappropriations subcommittees of those reports coming back. That is not \ntransparency. What that is is working in the dark so the American \npeople don't know what is going on. I have an amendment that says those \nreports ought to be made public to the American people. It is their \nmoney. It is our money. But we have--here we go--an appropriations bill \nthat has 40 reports from the Federal Government agencies to report back \nto Congress. Yet the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Oklahoma \ncannot see those reports, and neither can you. What is that all about? \nWhy shouldn't you be able to see those reports? You should be able to. \nBut that amendment is denied under this process. More of the same. More \nwork done in darkness without the light of day for the American people \nto see what is going on in their Government with their money. They \nshould reject that. We all should reject that. But change comes slowly.\n  The reason I am out here talking about it is I think the American \npeople ought to know what is going on in this bill. Yes, the threat is \nif we don't pass this, the Government will shut down. The Government \ndoesn't have to shut down. We could continue this for 2 weeks, but we \nare playing the game. Who will look worse if you vote against it. What \nthe American people care about is whether we have an open and \ntransparent government. That is what I am about: making sure we know \nthe cost of what we are doing, making sure we know who is responsible, \nand holding those accountable when they are not doing what is in the \nbest long-term interest of our country rather than what is in the best \nshort-term political interest of either political party or any \nindividual Member of Congress.\n  Another amendment I was going to offer but have been precluded from \ndoing so is we have thousands of people waiting for assistance with \ntheir drugs for HIV. As a matter of fact, there are several hundred, \n350-some in South Carolina alone who don't have any money, are not \ngetting treated, their HIV is progressing, they are going to AIDS, and \nthey are going to die. That number is in the thousands across the \ncountry right now, and although we have increased the AIDS drug \nassistance program, we haven't increased it enough to where we are \ntaking care of those who do not have any other resource with which to \nget the medicines to save their lives. That amendment is foregone. We \ncan't do that, not available.\n  Another amendment I had, which is certainly necessary--and we have \nhad the Senators from North Dakota and South Dakota talking about it--\nis the fact that we have had a disaster in the Central Plains of this \ncountry, in western Oklahoma and many other agricultural areas, where \nwe have a tremendous need--an agricultural disaster by any means that \nwe have addressed before. We tried to address it before we went home, \nbut we didn't want to pay for it. So that didn't go anywhere. That is \ngoing to go somewhere when the supplemental comes. It will be a part of \nthe supplemental package that comes out of the Appropriations Committee \nand we will pay $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion. It won't be \npaid for, we will charge it to our kids, and we will help these \nfarmers. There is $1 billion in my amendment that is paid for--paid \nfor; we don't have to charge it to our grandchildren--that will help \nimmediately those farmers who have suffered through this tremendous \ndrought in the Central Plains. We can not offer that amendment. We can \nnot help the people who need us to help right now because we are \nplaying games. We are playing the same old political games that were \nplayed when the Republicans were in charge. This isn't a new day; this \nis just a new manager under the same scams. It is a scam, and the \nAmerican people need to know it is a scam in terms of their money.\n  Finally, the money we are stealing from the BRAC, a portion of that \nwe are giving to the Global AIDS Fund. We are the largest contributor \nto the Global AIDS Fund--$300 million. We are going to bump that to \n$750 million, except there is no accountability in the Global AIDS \nFund. The Boston Globe recently released a report on some inside \nauditor work inside the Global AIDS Fund showing the slush funds, \nshowing the money that has been wasted. Yet we can't have access to \nthose reports. We are the largest contributor, but we are denied \naccess. I have an amendment that says if they want the money, then they \nhave to show us the internal transparent workings of that organization, \nsince we are the largest contributor. That is denied. That is common \nsense. If you were giving money to a charity and they were wasting it, \nyou would want to know how they were spending your money.\n  As a matter of fact, we make charities in this country show how they \nare spending their money. We actually audit them. We are precluded from \nknowing how $750 million of your money is going to be spent. And the \nwaste we have found out about in that program is denying the very \npeople we are hoping to help, those innocent young African children who \nare infected with HIV, with their medicines every day.\n  So the way to have great government is to have transparency. The way \nto get rid of wasteful Washington spending is to have transparency. The \nway to lower the taxes on everybody in this country is to get rid of \nthe waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication that is present within our \nGovernment. This bill does none of that. What this bill does is spend \nmore of your money and with sleight of hand and under the cover of \ndarkness transfer billions to\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\nour grandkids that they have shut out now but will ask for again when \nwe have a supplemental and, consequently, our children will be directly \nimpacted.\n\n  If you are born in this country today--if you go talk to David \nWalker, the Comptroller General, who is a nonpolitical person; he is a \nstraight shooter; he knows what we are facing is an impending crisis in \nthis country and that we are on a crash course toward fiscal \nbankruptcy. But here is what we know. If you are born today in this \ncountry, you have a birth tax of $453,000. That is what your share is \nof the unfunded liabilities we refuse to fix that we are adding to with \nthis bill--we are going to add $10 billion to $12 billion actually with \nthis bill when the new supplemental comes out--that is my prediction--\nat a minimum, $3 billion, probably $10 billion to $12 billion. What we \nare doing is going to add to that birth tax.\n  What is the great thing about our country? The great thing about our \ncountry is it was built on the sacrifice of one generation creating \nopportunity for the next. This bill does the opposite of that. This \nbill steals from the next generation to take care of us now. There is \nno long-term thinking in this bill; there is only short-term thinking. \nIs it partially my fault we are here? Sure. I will take that. But the \nprocess and the false claims that we are under a new day, that we are \nunder a new fiscal paradigm, is hogwash. There is no fiscal \nresponsibility in this bill. This bill actually claims that it \neliminates all the earmarks. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAs a matter of fact, hopefully today, I understand, the President is \ngoing to say they are not going to honor the unwritten earmarks. There \nis $17 billion worth of unwritten earmarks that will continue in this \nbill the way this bill is written.\n  Now, they get to claim in the press that they have a little section \nin the bill that says none of the earmarks in this bill carry the force \nof law. Well, that doesn't do anything. None of those earmarks carried \nthe force of law last year. None of those earmarks next year will carry \nthe force of law. It does nothing to eliminate those earmarks from \ncontinuing to be spent. We know what earmarks are. We know how they \ncreate conflicts of interest within this body and within the lobbying \ncommunity and individuals throughout this country. They ought to be \ngone. None of them should be honored, unless they are in the bill and \npeople are willing to stand up and defend those and they have been \nvetted by the committees of this Congress.\n  So bear in mind as I vote against this bill, it is not because I want \nto shut the Government down; it is because it is a vote saying it is \nmore of the same, American people. You didn't get what you bargained \nfor, again. Hold us accountable, come ask the questions, and don't take \nthe spin. The fact is there is a $453,000 birth tax for every child who \nis born this year in this country, and it is going to grow by over \n$1,000 with this bill. So it is going to go to $454,000. Now, imagine \nwhat you have to earn a year to pay the interest on that.\n  The fastest growing portion of our Government budget--what is it? It \nis not health care. It is interest. It is interest on the debt, and we \nhave perpetuated that with this bill.\n  I know none of my amendments will be made in order, but I am inclined \nto show the ridiculousness of this process. So with notice to the \nPresiding Officer, who I expect to object, as is his right as a Senator \nfrom Vermont, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and my amendment No. 234 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I do object.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request, \nwhich is that the pending amendments be set aside and that amendment \nNo. 235, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I \nobject.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 236 be called up and the pending amendments be set aside. This is \nan amendment that will allow us to continue to discuss this for 2 \nweeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I \nobject.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 250, which allows all report requests by the Appropriations \nCommittee--40 of them--be made public, that the pending amendments be \nset aside and that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I \nobject.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and my amendment No. 251 that will apply $1 \nbillion for the farmers who are in dire need in this country today be \ncalled up.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I \nobject.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and my amendment No. 252, which asks for the \ntransparency of our contributions into the Global AIDS Fund be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Vermont, I \nobject.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I went through that exercise, and I know \nthe Senator from Vermont does not disagree with all those amendments, \nbut he is doing what he has been instructed by the majority to do. The \nfact is we could have a debate, we could delay this for 2 weeks, and we \ncould make this bill far better. We could decide not to spend an \nadditional $3.1 billion of our grandkids' money if we allowed a true \ndebate.\n  In the last Congress I took a lot of criticism for going after my \nparty on fiscal issues. I am not going to quit going after my party on \nfiscal issues, but I will tell my colleagues, I am certainly not going \nto quit when the majority party claims--falsely claims--to be doing \nsomething in the best interests of this country in terms of fiscal \nresponsibility when, in fact, they are not.\n  There is no question what I have laid out here today is factual. \nThere is no question that what we are seeing is more of the same in \nWashington. It is time for it to stop. It is time for the American \npublic to hold everybody accountable, and we ought to be about America, \nnot the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. We ought to be \nnonpartisan for the long-term future of this country. We ought to be \nnonpartisan in order to restore the idea of sacrifice and service for \nthe next generation, rather than taking it for us today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding \nis that the matter before the Senate at this time is the continuing \nresolution and that Senators may address aspects of that resolution at \nthis point in time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senate has before it the continuing \nresolution which is an absolutely essential piece of legislation to \npermit our Government to go forward. We are about to have a vote, I \nunderstand, at 4:45 in relation to that resolution. The resolution has \nbeen consistent with the rules and precedent of the Senate, put before \nthe Senate in such a way as to make extremely restrictive the ability \nto amend that resolution.\n  Nevertheless, a group of Senators have felt ever so strongly about \nour initiative, which is contained in S. Con. Res. 7, a document that \nwas filed at the desk in connection with the debate on Iraq. We feel \nvery strongly that the program announced by the President on January 20 \nof this year contained therein aspects to which we could not give our \nfull concurrence. There is a range of differences of opinion between \nour group, and when I say ``our group,'' they have identified \nthemselves from time to time as being cosponsors and other Members of \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n  Speaking for myself, I felt the plan, as announced on January 20, did \nnot speak to the clarity I thought necessary, to say this operation \nshould be highly dependent on the Iraqi-trained military and other \nsecurity forces.\n  Our Nation, together with coalition partners over the period of this \nlong conflict--in the not-too-distant future months or so it will begin \na fifth year--have invested heavily in dollars and sacrifice and \notherwise to train the Iraqi forces to take on their own security \nobligations. The figure ``over 300,000'' has been frequently referred \nto in briefings and otherwise, that we have thus far, in one way or \nanother, trained and equipped.\n  As a member of the Committee on Armed Services in the course of \nbriefings and, indeed, in the Intelligence Committee, both of which I \nserve on, it has been represented through the years, most particularly \nthe last 2 to 2\\1/2\\ years, there has been a steady improvement in the \nquality and the professionalism of these Iraqi forces.\n  Now, 2\\1/2\\ years is a long time to train a military person. In the \nUnited States, we have prided ourselves since the days of World War II \nin taking a 17- or 18-year-old individual and training that individual \nto be a fighting person in 6, 8, 9 months and then some training with a \nunit and therein to a combat situation. Throughout our history, they \nhave discharged themselves with the highest degree of professionalism. \nMany of the forces we currently have in Iraq have followed that pattern \nof less than a year's training. How well we know the courage with which \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, with the \nstrong support of their families, have fought, suffered severe wounds, \nand died to enable the Iraqi people to have their freedom, to have a \nnation which is regarded as a sovereign nation today, to have a \ngovernment elected by themselves.\n  I find it highly perplexing that in that cadre of some 300,000, there \nare not those elements that could have been utilized to a far greater \ndegree in this campaign.\n  We have heard reports--within the last 2 days I received \nconfirmation--that those Iraqi contingents, those troop commitments to \nthis surge plan which is now in operation still fall short of the level \nof numbers in the commitment to have them in place.\n  Nevertheless, given the magnitude of that force, in our resolution, \nwe specifically say the President should charge--we use the word \n``charge''--hold them accountable for taking the lead, for taking the \npoint, for bearing the principal burden of this operation called \n``surge'' in Iraq as enunciated by the President on January 20. \nTherein, rests this Senator's grave concern about the utilization of \n21,500--and even a somewhat larger force than originally announced--in \nthis operation.\n  We gathered together individuals of honest thinking, clear thinking--\nnot by political motivation--and have tried to continuously push our \nresolution before this Senate such that each and every Senator could \nexpress his or her agreement, concurrence, or disagreement. We have not \nyet succeeded, but we are going to continue to press on. There is some \nrepresentation--I don't know whether it is final--that the Senate may \nsee after we come back from this recess the measure that will be \npresumably passed by the House this week and presented in what I'm told \ncould well be an identical form. We feel very strongly our resolution, \nS. Con. Res. 7, without any changes in it, should be brought up as a \nsubstitute amendment, but at the present time, given the few minutes \nremaining, I see my distinguished colleague who has joined me in this \neffort, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Ben Nelson. We \nhave put forward this S. Con. Res. 7, which requires the funding for \nthe Government.\n  At this time, I ask the pending amendment be set aside so I may offer \namendment numbered 259 which is our S. Con. Res. 7, in identical form, \nwhich is pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Missouri, I \nobject on behalf of the request of the leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I receive that with a great deal of \ndisappointment because I felt, in this critical period of time as this \noperation in Baghdad is getting underway, the constructive \nrecommendations to the President, as embraced in our resolution, should \nbe brought before this Senate for full discussion. I see my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. House Joint Resolution 20.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order and I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the Senate to comment on H.J. \nRes. 20, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2007 which, \nas I understand, is the pending business before the Senate.\n  I think most of us agree that funding the Federal Government should \nbe done through the regular order, not through a patchwork of \ncontinuing resolutions. The reality is that all but two Federal \nagencies are being funded through a measure to which no Member is being \npermitted to offer, debate or vote on a single amendment. That is \nwrong. We are not the House of Representatives. We are not the other \nbody, I say to my colleagues. We are the Senate, a deliberative body. I \nhope the Senate leadership on both sides will work to ensure we do not \nrepeat this fate.\n  I have been in this body for a little over 20 years. I have watched, \nover those 20 years, an increasing use of parliamentary procedures--the \nso-called filling up the tree and motions for cloture filed at the same \ntime the legislation is before the Senate increase to an ever-\naccelerating process.\n  I was very disturbed about that process being exercised when my side \nof the aisle was in the leadership, and I am even more concerned as I \nwatch the new majority conduct business in the Senate. I could submit \nfor the record the fact of literally every measure before the Senate \nthat at the same time a cloture motion is proposed, the tree is filled.\n  The Senate is here to debate and amend. The other body, \nunderstandably, has different rules. Given the mechanisms that are \nbeing put in place by the majority side, what is the difference? It \nseems to me that 20 years ago--and I would ask my friend from Virginia, \nwho has been here considerably longer than I have--the routine was a \npiece of legislation would be before the Senate, there would be \namendments proposed, debated, with second-degree amendments, if \nnecessary. And the process was something where literally every Member \nof the Senate, if a Member so chose, could come to the floor and debate \nand amend and improve the legislation, if that was a Member's desire.\n  Where are we now? We file cloture. We vote on cloture. We stand \naround for 30 hours or so. And then we vote up or down. This is a very \ndangerous process we are going through. So now we are examining a bill \nwhich funds all but two Federal agencies in a measure which no Member \nis permitted to offer, debate or vote on a single amendment. That is \nnot why I came here. That is not why. We are sent here--we are sent \nhere--to express the views and ambitions and hopes and dreams of our \nconstituents.\n  I have been in discussion with several other Members about how this \ntrend continues to accelerate and literally deprive this institution \nfrom being described as not the greatest deliberative body in the world \nbut a deliberative body.\n  And I say to the leadership, please sit down and work these things \nout. Have a reasonable number of amendments. Have debate. Agree to time \nagreements. Agree to time agreements. I had several amendments to this \nbill for which I would have agreed to an hour time agreement, which \nwould have been plenty of time to debate the amendments and render the \nSenate's judgment, which I would have respected whether it succeeded or \nfailed.\n  Now, there are many of us who are very unhappy because we think we \ncould have improved this legislation, which covers all but two--two--\nFederal agencies of the entire Federal Government. And we are going to \nconsider an up-or-down vote on it. That is not right. It is not fair to \nthe American people. And it is not fair to the hallowed traditions of \nthis institution.\n  I do not know exactly what to do about it. But there are some of us \nwho\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nare looking for ways, perhaps, to express our dissatisfaction on this \nissue. In all deference to my dear friend from Virginia, all I asked \nfor on this issue of the ``surge'' or ``change in strategy'' in Iraq \nwas 2 hours of debate on our amendment, with a time agreement and a \nvote. I do not think that is a lot to ask. I do not think that is a \ngreat deal. I do not think that is a huge request. The two leaders \nsitting down together could have--and, by the way, I know my friend \nfrom Virginia supported that. I am not in any way denigrating----\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would have it reflected in our colloquy that I did \nsupport that because it has always been my understanding, this being \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world's organization, \nlegislatures should have that as a fundamental precedent.\n  I supported the Senator, much to the risk--and I was defamed from \ncoast to coast--but I stood by the Senator's right to have his \namendment, along with mine, considered by this body.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Virginia. And let the record be \nclear, the Senator from Virginia supported the proposition that we \nwould consider more than one amendment.\n  Now, I am absolutely convinced--I hate to keep going on this aspect \nof it because I wish to discuss the continuing appropriations bill \nbefore us--but we could have sat down and said: OK, we will have four \namendments, a certain amount of time on each amendment for debate. Time \nagreements would have been entered into, and then everybody could have \nhad their say or certainly the majority of the Senate would have agreed \nto that.\n  Instead, unfortunately, we ended up without addressing the issue in a \ncomprehensive fashion, in fact at all, because of the process that went \nthrough. But equally as important--equally as important--I say to my \nfriend from Virginia--and I would ask him, when he first came here, \nwould he have ever seen a situation where the entire funding of the \nFederal Government was in a measure before this body without a single \namendment being allowed to it?\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I----\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the record, you might want to say how many years you \nhave been here.\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly recall, over a period of 29 years, the \nimportance of the continuing resolution and the greater utilization, \nregrettably, of the necessity for leaders on both sides to resort to \nthat. But I would have to say to my good friend, the imperative of the \nability for our Government to function requires the flow of money. And \nunless this particular continuing resolution is acted upon by this body \nwithin the next few days, it will, indeed, impair the ability of our \nGovernment to function. So we have to take into consideration those \nthings.\n  Madam President, might I ask my friend, our good friend from Nebraska \nwas to have had 2 minutes to rejoin in my effort to get the amendment \nup. At some point, might he be recognized and----\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that without \nlosing the floor, my friend from Nebraska be recognized for 3 minutes \nto make a statement on the issue which has been raised by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, which I heartily disagree with.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \nusual good humor and courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank my friends from \nVirginia and Arizona for the courtesy being extended to me and I \nappreciate their forbearance.\n  Madam President, the Senate is about to embark on a weeklong recess \nin the next couple days, and I would be remiss to allow this week to \nend without at least trying with my colleague from Virginia one more \ntime to get the Senate to consider our resolution on the Iraq troop \nsurge.\n  For days we have seen Senators deliver speeches on this floor, some \nfor a vote, others against allowing a vote. We have heard great calls \nto action, and we have heard that doing nothing would be better than \ndoing something. We even had Senators participate in an exercise to \nblock an up-or-down vote on a resolution, some for reasons they think \nwere certainly important.\n  But I am not a believer in doing nothing, and I believe the Senate \nhas an obligation to lead. I have said that before, and I will say it \nagain. The Senate is not only a deliberative body, but it is a \ngoverning body and has oversight interests. Each Senator, as a Member \nof the body, has an obligation to lead.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues, the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Maine, for exhibiting great leadership and courage in \nforging this resolution that includes many important issues that need \nto be covered in a vote of this magnitude. Both of my colleagues and \nothers have overcome fierce political pressures, including the \nPresiding Officer. But we have come together to do the right thing.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, from Michigan, my colleague from Nebraska, and the \nother Senators who have signed on in support of our resolution. \nTogether, we are able to begin the process of oversight, the process of \nleadership, the process of living up to our obligations.\n  And we are here today to try to continue to do the right thing. The \nHouse of Representatives is engaged in a historic debate today over a \nresolution that does, in part, what our resolution does. It expresses \nopposition to the President's planned surge of troops in Iraq.\n  Although their resolution and our resolution come at it from \ndifferent directions and points of view, in essence, they have some \nsimilarity. But I would prefer the Senate to take up the Warner-Nelson-\nCollins resolution because we have spent considerable time and energy \ndrafting a complete and comprehensive resolution that includes many of \nthe priorities Senators have expressed over the duration of that war.\n  Our resolution includes the need to establish benchmarks for the \nIraqi Government to meet in order to continue involvement of the United \nStates in Iraq. It includes the desire to continue fighting the \nterrorists in Anbar Province. It expresses clear opposition to the \nPresident's proposal to deposit 21,000 troops at the crossroads of \ncivil war in Baghdad.\n  The House resolution does express opposition to the President's plan, \nbut it does not include these other important measures which we think \nare very important.\n  So I hope we can resolve our differences and vote on this resolution \nin a timely fashion. The American public deserves an up-or-down down \nvote on this most important issue of today. The time is now to express \nour opposition to the troop surge and the use of American soldiers to \nstop civil war in Iraq.\n  Thank you, Madam President. And I thank my colleague and friend from \nArizona and my colleague and friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might be recognized to thank my \ncolleague from Nebraska and then thank our colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have to insist on the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I understand at 4:15 we are turning to a judge. I \nask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, before we do that, I was under the \nimpression I might be able to speak for about 5 minutes or so at around \n4:15. If I could add another 5 minutes at the end of that so we each \nhave 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for executive session is not until \n4:30.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Meaning we have time? OK.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I was misinformed.\n  Madam President, I will not go on, on this issue, but I believe we \nneed to, as a body, sit down and try to fix this unfortunate situation \nwhere we are not allowing amendments nor sufficient examination of \nlegislation before the body.\n  Madam President, there is one silver lining to the measure pending \nbefore us. It is largely free of wasteful earmarking and porkbarrel \nspending. This is the first time during my years in Congress I have \nwitnessed such an occurrence. Compare this to the last fiscal year, \n2006. According to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service, \nthe appropriations bills and accompanying reports for the last fiscal \nyear included $64 billion in earmarks--the largest earmarked funding in \nhistory.\n  So again, this CR, which does not have an accompanying report where \nhistorically 95 percent of earmarks are included, is a welcomed change. \nI can only urge the Appropriations Committee to let this be a guide for \nfuture appropriations measures when it comes to earmarks: Do not \ninclude them and do not waste the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I was pleased to join with several of my colleagues in writing the \nPresident last week to urge his leadership on this issue and ensure his \nadministration understands clearly and fully that it is under \nabsolutely no obligation to continue to fund earmarks that were \nincluded in past committee reports or urged by Members of Congress or \ntheir staff. As stated by the President in his State of the Union \nAddress last month, when it comes to earmarking, ``The time has come to \nend this practice.'' Now it is up to the administration to abide by the \nPresident's directive, and I assure you, we will be watching.\n  Also, last week, Senator Coburn and I received a response from the \nDepartment of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman in response to our letter \nof the previous week stating our serious concerns about reports that \nthe Department may be planning ``business as usual'' and would fund \nconference report earmarks.\n  Fortunately, the Secretary has clarified his Department's position \nand will only fund programs or activities that, in his words, are \n``meritorious and effective'' and ``support and advance the \nDepartment's missions and objectives . . . ''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of our correspondence with the \nSecretary be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Despite what I have described as a positive consequence of this CR, \nthe measure is imperfect and, like many of my colleagues, I believe we \nshould have had an opportunity to improve it. I am particularly \nconcerned about underfunding the Base Realignment Closure, BRAC, \naccount, and was pleased to join in cosponsoring the amendment filed by \nSenators Hutchison and Inhofe to fund the account at the amount \nrequested by the President and the amount we authorized for 2007.\n  The 55 percent cut to the BRAC account, submitted without any type of \njustification or explanation, seriously jeopardizes the Department of \nDefense's ability to meet a statutory deadline to complete all BRAC \nactions by 2011. Congress imposed this 6-year deadline specifically to \nlimit the negative impact on the military units and local communities \naround the country affected by BRAC. Congress intended that a \nconcentrated period of investment would accelerate the economic \ndevelopment and recovery of communities affected by BRAC. This callous \ndecision to deny funds to the Department at this critical juncture \ndirectly harms these communities as much as it does the military units \nplaced in limbo by the sudden denial of funds.\n  The administration noted in its recent response to the CR that the \nBRAC cut will ``reduce BRAC savings, delay or postpone scheduled \nredeployments of military personnel and their families from overseas \nlocations to the United States, and negatively impact many communities \nthroughout the country that have begun making specific plans in \nresponse to BRAC.''\n  Surely our colleagues who developed this CR proposal did not intend \nto cause additional harm to the local communities that are already \ntrying to cope and recover from the BRAC decisions. Quoting Congressman \nDavid Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, about the \nCR, ``I don't expect people to love this proposal, I don't love this \nproposal, and we probably have made some wrong choices.''\n  So, why are we in the Senate not allowed an opportunity to correct an \nobvious mistake?\n  I've heard from the other side of the aisle during debate of H.J. \nRes. 20 that they understand this problem and that they plan to correct \nthis $3.1 billion BRAC underfunding in the fiscal year 2007 emergency \nsupplemental request of $93.4 billion. What kind of solution is that? \nSupplemental funds have been requested by the President for military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These funds are critically needed \nto purchase equipment for force protection and IED defeat initiatives. \nThese funds will be used to train and equip Iraqi security forces. \nSince when is BRAC an emergency related to the global war on terror?\n  Furthermore, we are having this discussion because my colleagues who \ndeveloped the resolution share with us the common goal to reduce \noverall Government expenditures. In that spirit, what critical \nwarfighting requirement will we cut in the supplemental to pay for the \nBRAC increase they propose? What do we deny to our front-line fighting \ntroops? While I have heard the idea of funding BRAC in the \nsupplemental, I have not heard one idea on how to pay for it. Do they \ninstead advocate for an increase to the supplemental? Why not just \nprovide the funds to BRAC by offsets in the pending measure before us, \nas proposed by the Hutchison amendment? We should be addressing full \nfiscal year 2007 funding for BRAC in this CR. Using budget gimmicks and \nshell games in a supplemental, which could have devastating results for \nthe military and local communities, is not the way to provide \nappropriations for critical military requirements.\n  Finally, I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague, \nDr. Coburn. He has been on the floor several times to discuss the very \nserious ramifications of the provision in this bill that will prohibit \nfunding for what is known as the ``baby AIDS'' program. I've often \ncommented that we need to start making tough fiscal decisions around \nhere among competing priorities. But I have yet to hear anyone defend \nor even attempt to explain the decision that was made to prohibit \nfunding for this critical program.\n  I completely agree with Dr. Coburn. This funding prohibition is \nregrettable, and may have far reaching and devastating consequences for \nthose helpless babies who could otherwise be given a better chance at \nhaving and keeping healthy lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2007.\n\n\n            MEMORANDUM FOR ALL PROGRAM SECRETARIAL OFFICERS\n\n     From: Jeffrey Kupfer, Chief of Staff, Office of the \n         Secretary.\n     Re: FY 2007 Funding.\n       As you know, the House of Representatives recently passed \n     H.J. Res. 20, which would provide funding for the Department \n     of Energy's programs through the remainder of FY 2007. Even \n     though the Senate has not yet acted on that legislation, we \n     must begin to evaluate how we would operate if it is enacted \n     into law.\n       One important matter that must be addressed in implementing \n     H.J. Res. 20 is how we will handle the matter of earmarks. As \n     President Bush noted in his recent State of the Union \n     address, special interest funding earmarks often are included \n     in committee reports that are never voted on by Congress or \n     presented to the President for approval, and these earmarks \n     cost the taxpayers billions of dollars each year across the \n     Federal Government.\n       There is no House or Senate committee report accompanying \n     H.J. Res. 20, and therefore there are no committee earmarks \n     for the funding it would provide. Furthermore, section 112 of \n     this proposed legislation states that ``[a]ny language \n     specifying an earmark in a committee report or statement of \n     managers accompanying an appropriations Act for fiscal year \n     2006 shall have no legal effect with respect to funds \n     appropriated by this division.'' Nonetheless, I understand \n     some of your offices have begun to receive requests from some \n     Congressional offices, asking that the Department continue to \n     fund programs or activities that received earmarked funds in \n     prior years.\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\n       Because the funding provided by H.J. Res. 20 will not be \n     subject to nonstatutory earmarks and the President's policy \n     on earmarks is clear, we must ensure that the Department only \n     funds programs or activities that are meritorious; the \n     Department itself is responsible for making those \n     determinations. As a result, and at the Secretary's \n     direction, any proposal by a recipient of an earmark in prior \n     years who seeks continued funding in FY 2007 needs to be \n     carefully reviewed and evaluated. Only those with meritorious \n     proposals or programs that effectively support and advance \n     the Department's missions and objectives, and who have \n     submitted appropriate advance documentation justifying their \n     request, should receive FY 2007 funding. Of course, all \n     funding-related decisions and actions must be made in \n     accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n       If H.J. Res. 20 is enacted into law, I will ask each of you \n     to submit a report containing your recommendations about \n     which, if any, earmarks from prior Congressional committee \n     reports you believe should continue to receive funding in FY \n     2007. No final decisions are to be made concerning those \n     potential recipients until after you have submitted your \n     report and received further guidance from the Secretary's \n     Office. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer will \n     provide instructions on the timing and the content of your \n     report.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2007.\n     Hon. John S. McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your February 2, 2007 \n     letter concerning H.J. Res. 20. In your letter, you inquire \n     whether the Department of Energy (DOE) intends to continue \n     funding earmarks that have appeared in committee reports \n     accompanying prior year appropriations bills. You note that a \n     recent press report, citing unnamed sources, states that DOE \n     has told Congressional appropriators it will continue to fund \n     earmarks despite H.J. Res. 20 language that says agencies are \n     not bound to continue funding prior year earmarks.\n       The press story cited in your letter does not accurately \n     reflect DOE policy or the direction that has been given to \n     DOE program offices. Late last week, the Department's Chief \n     of Staff issued a memorandum to all Program Secretarial \n     Officers concerning how they should evaluate earmarks that \n     appeared in Congressional committee reports accompanying \n     prior year appropriations bills. A copy of that memorandum is \n     enclosed.\n       Among other things, the memorandum states that DOE \n     officials must carefully review any requests for continued \n     funding of prior year earmarks. Only those project sponsors \n     ``with meritorious proposals or programs that effectively \n     support and advance the Department's missions and objectives, \n     and who have submitted appropriate advance documentation \n     justifying their request, should receive FY 2007 funding.'' \n     This means that DOE may continue funding some programs or \n     activities that have received earmarked funds in prior years, \n     but only if the programs or activities are meritorious and \n     effective. DOE is prepared to be fully accountable for making \n     those decisions.\n       As you know, H.J. Res. 20 has not yet been enacted into \n     law. We hope that Congress will act quickly on that \n     legislation so that necessary funds will be provided for the \n     remainder of Fiscal Year 2007, not only for DOE but for many \n     other federal agencies as well. If you have any further \n     questions, please call me or Jill L. Sigal, Assistant. \n     Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, at \n     202-586-5450.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Samuel W. Bodman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may make \nsome introductory remarks on S. 589, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard pertaining to the introduction of S. 589 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are to proceed to executive session at this \ntime.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, there is a vote coming up on the \nresolution. We already had one vote on a cloture motion. I have to say \npublicly one more time the reason I have so vigorously opposed this \nwhole concept, and it is because in a very partisan way, in a very \npartisan manner, the Democrats were successful in taking out the money \nthat would have implemented the fifth and last BRAC round.\n  BRAC is the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. In this BRAC \nround, we would have saved $20 billion by 2012, but by delaying it a \nyear, the costs are going to be far greater. There is $5.7 billion to \nimplement BRAC, and the Democrats took out effectively $4.1 billion and \nthen put $1 billion back--$3.1 billion out. That means we cannot \nimplement these BRAC policies and actually effect the savings.\n  The problem I have with this is they say this is going to come out of \nthe emergency supplemental, we will get it all taken out of that. That \nmeans it comes out of money that otherwise would have gone to our \nfighting troops in Iraq. This is not what I want to happen. Right now, \nwe are underfunded over there. We have great needs in armored vehicles, \noperating costs, and training costs for Iraqi security forces, and this \ntranslates into American lives.\n  To have $3.1 billion come out of this BRAC process to me is \nunconscionable when we are at war. This means the units that were \nplanning to return stateside will have to remain abroad. It means the \ntemporary and old housing will continue to be used, further increasing \nthe upkeep in costs. And it means it is going to cost a lot more to \nimplement it. Each week that goes by, each time it is delayed, it is \ngoing to cost additional money.\n  Here is the other problem we have, if we stop and think. All the \ncommunities that are surrounding our various military establishments \nhave participated in the BRAC process and have said: If you will do \nthis and expand this base, we will put in free housing, we will do \nhealth care for the children of our military people. All these very \ngenerous contributions which are made by the private sector very likely \nwill not even be made.\n  It is not too late to change our mind. I just wish I could reach a \nnumber of people here to convince the leadership, such as my good \nfriend from North Dakota. I know he is interested in accommodating the \nBRAC needs. If we could just get this one amendment in to allow us to \ndo the military construction and to pull that out of the continuing \nresolution, it would be appreciated very much by our troops who are \nfighting a very difficult battle.\n  I will make my one last appeal. We cannot take the $3.1 billion out \nand adequately support the military operation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Funding For Iraq: Refugees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend Senator Leahy, chairman of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, \nfor including an additional $20 million for Iraqi refugees in the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  More than 3 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homes, and \nmany of them have fled the country. America has a special obligation to \nhelp them and the neighboring countries in meeting their needs.\n  The UNHCR has made an international appeal for $60 million to deal \nwith this emerging crisis, and the United States plans to provide $20 \nmillion to that appeal.\n  Our invasion of Iraq led to this crisis, and we have a clear \nresponsibility to do more to ease it. We should provide at least half \nthe funding for this $60 million appeal to help this growing refugee \npopulation.\n  I believe $10 million of the funds in this bill should be for the \nUNHCR appeal, in an effort to raise the total U.S. contribution to $30 \nmillion. Is that the chairman's intent?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, it is. Senator Kennedy, who is the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Refugees, makes an important \npoint. I believe that the United States should contribute half of the \nfunds, and I will work with Senator Kennedy and with the State \nDepartment to ensure that those funds are provided. I agree that\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nAmerica should show greater leadership by providing at least half the \nfunds for this appeal.\n\n\n                                 NDIIPP\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have come to the floor to engage in a \ncolloquy with the ranking member of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, Senator Bennett of Utah.\n  In 2000, Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, came to \nmany Members of this Chamber with an urgent request. He wanted to begin \npreserving important cultural works which existed only in digital \nformat.\n  Soon after, Congress approved the creation of the National Digital \nInformation Infrastructure and Preservation Program, which is also \nreferred to as ``NDIIPP.''\n  Those of us in Congress secured $100 million over 10 years to start \nthis program. With the Library's guidance, NDIIPP quickly became a \nbroad-based coalition of Federal agencies, universities, non-profit \norganizations, and companies in the science and technology industries.\n  Today, the NDIIPP partnership includes 67 public and private \norganizations nationwide. But the future of this effort is in serious \njeopardy.\n  The House-passed fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution rescinds $47 \nmillion in NDIIPP funds--effectively destroying a program essential to \nour increasingly digital world.\n  If funding for NDIIPP is not restored, the Library of Congress risks \nlosing the resources which have already been invested--and the \nimportant work already completed--with regard to digital preservation.\n  The Library's partners in the private sector have committed $37 \nmillion in matching funds to this effort. If NDIIPP is eliminated, \nthese funds will also be lost.\n  NDIIPP is essential to our ability to identify, preserve, and provide \naccess to digital content. This program is helping to ensure future \ngenerations will be able to access information needed for research and \npolicymaking.\n  Madam President, our choice is clear. A number of digital works have \nalready disappeared. Many Web sites launched before 2000, for instance, \nwere never preserved and will never be recovered. If funding for NDIIPP \nis eliminated, many future works will likewise be lost forever. If \nfunding for NDIIPP is restored, we can help ensure these works do not \nsuffer a similar fate.\n  This project holds great possibilities, and I will work with my \ncolleagues to assure it receives the funding it deserves.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with the Senator from Alaska. Funding intended \nfor NDIIPP serves a vital purpose for our Nation. I will work with the \nSenator and our colleagues to restore these funds.\n  There is a wide assumption that digital materials will be available \ntomorrow and that we can put off taking measures to preserve them until \nsometime in the future. That is not the case. The average life of a Web \nsite is 44 days and material not saved today will be gone tomorrow. \nGeospatial information, including records of land elevation, weather \npatterns, water levels, LANDSAT imagery, State and local maps and other \nstatistical information about an area exist almost exclusively in \ndigital format today. If these materials are not actively preserved, \nthe vital information they contain will be lost. Outside of efforts \nbeing undertaken by government agencies such as the Library of Congress \nand its public and private sector partners, little is being done to \npreserve digitally created materials for the future use of the \nCongress. The expense is great, the technologies necessary for long \nterm preservation of digital information are in their infancy and the \nrisks of loss are not widely known or understood. The legislators of \nthe future will have access to only what we actively preserve today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Utah for his commitment to this \nimportant program.\n\n\n         Revised Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the Record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring of H.J. Res. 20, making revised \ncontinuing appropriations for fiscal year 2007.\n  The pending long-term continuing resolution appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2007, as passed by the House, provides discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2007 of $463.5 billion.\n  When combined with discretionary budget authority levels included in \nthe 2007 Defense and Department of Homeland Security conference \nreports, total 2007 nonemergency budget authority is $872.7 billion. \nThis level is $60 million below both the Appropriations Committee's \n302(a) allocation pursuant to the deeming resolution (Sec. 7035 of P.L \n109-234) and the President's requested level.\n  When funding levels contained in the bill are combined with \nnonemergency budget authority levels included in previously enacted \nbills, all subcommittees are at their 302(b) allocation with the \nexception of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, which is $60 million \nbelow its allocation. No points of order lie against the bill as passed \nby the House.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          H.J. Res. 20, Revised Continuing Resolution for 2007\n\n                     [Fiscal Year 2007; $ millions]\n\n                                                        General Purpose\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...........................................$463,456\n    Outlays.....................................................532,456\nPreviously-enacted bills:\n    Defense:\n      Budget Authority..........................................377,357\n      Outlays...................................................394,446\n    Department of Homeland Security:\n      Budget Authority...........................................31,905\n      Outlays....................................................38,714\nTotal:\n    Budget Authority............................................872,718\n    Outlays.....................................................965,616\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on two matters \nconcerning the 2007 continuing resolution.\n  First, as the chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, I want to let my \ncolleagues know exactly what this continuing resolution means for the \nagencies within my subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Second, I want to touch briefly on the appropriations process and why \nit is so important that Congress pass individual appropriations bills.\n  Let me go through some funding highlights for the agencies and \nprograms under my subcommittee's purview:\n  The President recently announced his new, National Parks Centennial \nInitiative. This will provide up to $3 billion over the next 10 years \nto improve our national parks in preparation for their centennial in \n2016. This continuing resolution contains the first $40 million of the \n$100 million installment the President requested in his 2008 budget.\n  The amount provided in the continuing resolution for basic operations \nat our national parks is $1.758 billion, a $40 million increase over \nlast year's level.\n  The continuing resolution also contains an increase of $70 million in \nthe Forest Service firefighting account. Of that amount, $51 million is \nprovided for basic fire suppression activities.\n  We have added $19 million to the hazardous fuels reduction account so \nthat important preventive work can continue as well.\n  The continuing resolution provides an additional $125 million for the \nIndian Health Service so that the critical medical care so desperately \nneeded in Indian country can be made available.\n  There is also $60 million for basic operational needs for the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. Together, these agencies manage a conservation and \nrecreation network that spans more than 550 million acres.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that under this continuing \nresolution, EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund will receive nearly \n$1.1 billion. That is $200 million more than the 2006 level, which will \nbe used to help local communities meet their wastewater infrastructure \nneeds.\n  But while there are some funding increases in this continuing \nresolution, the fact that we are now considering this on the floor \ntoday--over 4 months into fiscal year 2007--underscores the\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nproblem with not going through the regular appropriations process.\n  This resolution essentially provides the same level of funding as \nfiscal year 2006, with a few exceptions. But this means that dozens of \nprograms and projects did not receive an increase over 2006 levels or \ndid not receive funding at all.\n  There are, however, a few bright spots in what has otherwise been \ntough times.\n  For instance, there is an increase of $3.6 billion in veterans health \ncare and $1.2 billion to help care for our brave military personnel and \ntheir families; over a billion dollars for State and local law \nenforcement assistance grants; $399 million for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program, SCAAP, the same as fiscal year 2006; $1.2 \nbillion for Ryan White CARE grants, an increase of $75.8 million to \nfund at the newly authorized level; $4.5 billion for Global HIV/AIDS, \nan increase of $1.3 billion; a $502 million increase for section 8 \ntenant-based housing vouchers and the first increase in the maximum \nPell grant in 4 years, from the current $4,050 to $4,310; and full \nfunding of the Transportation Reauthorization bill for fiscal year \n2007.\n  Yet many programs will not receive increases. For example, in \nCalifornia there is no increase for CalFed. This program plays an \nimportant role in increasing California's water supply, restoring \nfisheries and delta levees, and improving the water quality of the San \nFrancisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n  Additionally, programs of a critical nature in my State that I fought \nhard to secure funding for will not receive the resources they deserve. \nThese include State agricultural pest detection, Perchlorate cleanup \nefforts, and important flood control projects.\n  That is why it is so significant that Congress does its job to fully \nconsider and approve each individual appropriations bill. This is the \nbest way to ensure that needed projects and programs are funded \nadequately.\n  For this reason, I am glad to serve on the Appropriations Committee \nunder the leadership of the Senator from West Virginia. Under his \ndirection, I believe we will pass all 12 bills for fiscal year 2008. \nFirst, however, we must dispose of the leftover business from last \nCongress.\n  The Chairman is proceeding the best he can, and I believe we need to \nsupport this effort and get this done. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthe passage of this continuing resolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, this joint funding resolution is not \nwhat anyone wanted. We are in this position because the last Congress \nfailed to do its job. We had no choice. We were determined to stay \nwithin strict spending limits while trying to address compelling needs. \nI believe we have done the best we can do. We were able to take care of \nthe most important priorities facing the nation without going over our \nspending limits.\n  In the Commerce, Justice, Science chapter of this resolution, we were \nable to increase funding for the Department of Justice by $1.4 billion \nover last year to ensure there were no cuts to the FBI and the war \nagainst terror. We provided the FBI with a $333 million increase over \nthe old CR which fully funds the FBI, U.S. attorneys and the Bureau of \nPrisons. More importantly, the additional $1.4 billion eliminates the \ncuts to State and local law enforcement proposed in the President's \nbudget. At a time when crime rates are going back up according to the \nmost recent FBI crime statistics, we fully fund the COPS program, as \nwell as programs to fight gangs and sexual predators. Protecting our \nneighborhoods and communities remains our No. 1 priority and this extra \nfunding is proof of our commitment to make America safer.\n  We were also able to make a down payment on our innovation and \ncompetitiveness agenda. We added $335 million to the National Science \nFoundation's research account to increase our commitment to basic \nresearch that will lead to new breakthroughs in science, technology and \nfuture innovation to keep America competitive in the global economy. In \naddition, we added $38 million to the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology to increase research grants and an additional $12 \nmillion to modernize their laboratory facilities. Finally, we gave the \nPatent and Trademark Office the full $1.7 billion called for in the \nPresident's fiscal year 2007 budget request and ensured that all patent \nfees stay with the Patent Office.\n  While I would have liked to have increased funding for NASA, there \nwas simply not enough extra funding available for us to do so. Within \nthe limits of NASA's fiscal year 2006 operating plan, we added an extra \n$460 million to exploration while protecting other critical NASA \nprograms in science and aeronautics. With only 7 months left in this \nfiscal year, I believe NASA will be able to manage their programs in \nexploration with minimal impact to the overall schedule.\n  This bill cuts $3.3 billion in Military Constructions funds required \nto implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round. By putting \nthe entire year's BRAC Military Construction program on hold, the \ncurrent situation has caused adverse disruptions to important military \nplanning. In Maryland alone, the Defense Department is unable to \nexecute over $300 million worth of projects, preventing the \nconstruction of badly needed facilities that directly support our \nwarfighters. This delay also has a huge impact on the economy of the \nState of Maryland, in the construction industry and other key support \nindustries. Finally, the continuing resolution blocks critical projects \nrequired to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, \nrecommendations, jeopardizing the ability of our military installations \nto complete required BRAC actions on time.\n  I, along with the other members of the Maryland congressional \ndelegation, have sent a letter to the Chairmen and ranking members of \nthe House and Senate Appropriations Committee, urging them to fully \nfund BRAC Military Construction in the fiscal year 2007 emergency \nsupplemental spending bill. Both the House and Senate majority leaders \nhave pledged their support for our effort. I will fight to add this \nvital funding to the emergency supplemental when it comes before the \nSenate in March.\n  So while this bill is not what anyone wanted, it is the best we could \ndo considering what we were left with. I will support this continuing \nresolution and I will fight to do better next year.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to clarify an \nissue of concern to communities in my home state of Florida, \nparticularly to those who have been affected by natural disasters in \nrecent years.\n  The continuing resolution, H.J. Res. 20, contains a revision to the \nformula for funding the critical section 8 tenant-based rental \nassistance voucher program. Inefficiencies in the voucher funding \nformula in place since 2004 have resulted in the loss of vouchers for \nan estimated 150,000 families nationwide. My understanding is that the \nrevised formula will provide sufficient funding for the number of \nfamilies assisted last year, and provides a $100 million pool to assist \nagencies who experience unusual circumstances during the transition.\n  However, due to the devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, several \nof our Florida communities helped unusually low numbers of families \nlast year. This is because the hurricanes devastated their housing \nstock they simply did not have the apartments and houses to rent. In \nsome areas, the amount of need did not decline; there was simply a \nshortage of affordable housing options.\n  I rise to confirm my understanding that the section 8 funds for \nhousing assistance payments already allocated by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, HUD, to a local housing authority will \nremain accessible.\n  If my understanding is correct, housing authorities may continue to \nuse the funds in their possession, along with their fiscal year 2007 \nfunds, to lease up to the authorized level of units under contract. \nThis will ensure that our hurricane damaged communities and others who \nhave seen losses in recent years due to unforeseen circumstances or the \ndislocations that have occurred since 2004 will be able to recover. As \nour communities rebuild, I want to make sure that our housing agencies \nwill continue to have access to the available resources needed to serve \nlow-income families.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I will vote in favor of the \ncontinuing resolution not because it is\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\nperfect but because it is the responsible course of action for Congress \nto bring some fiscal sanity back to our Federal budget. The \nalternative, letting Government come to a screeching halt and blocking \nservices to millions of Americans, is unacceptable.\n  The resolution we vote on today was drafted under the guidance of a \nRepublican Congress and Republican President. Yet that same Congress, \nthe 109th, refused to make difficult fiscal decisions and instead \nsimply passed the buck to the current 110th Congress. So today we meet \nour constitutional responsibility to determine the Nation's budget and \nprovide funding for programs that millions of hard-working Americans \nrely on to make ends meet.\n  Perhaps most unfortunate, today we are voting for appropriating funds \nfor fiscal year 2007 that for most agencies are the same as fiscal year \n2006 levels. In addition, it concerns me that this resolution gives too \nmuch power to Federal agencies. Under the formula prescribed in this \nresolution, each agency seemingly has wide discretion to determine \nwhich specific programs get slashed and which receive additional funds. \nI fear this widespread Federal discretion could have a negative impact \non programs critical to Maryland, like the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nSmall Watersheds Programs, the consolidation of the FDA Headquarters at \nWhite Oak, and the Ocean City hurricane protection project, to name \nonly a few. I encourage the agencies to do the right thing and allocate \nappropriate funds for programs with track records of success because \nCongress will be watching.\n  Despite the shortcomings in this resolution, it does include some \nmodest increases for important programs. In Maryland, scientists at the \nNational Institutes of Health are on the cutting edge of unlocking some \nof our most complicated and devastating diseases. The additional $620 \nmillion that this resolution allocates to NIH may lead to a \ngroundbreaking cure or vaccine.\n  We must continue to do more to make a college education a reality for \nall families, and I am pleased to see that Pell grants will be expanded \nto help students afford college. In Maryland, the cost of receiving a \npublic education has increased by nearly 40 percent at some State \nuniversities. A college education is key to achieving the American \ndream, and we must continue to make sure all children regardless of \nwhat zip code they live in or how much money their parents make have \nthat opportunity.\n  Although some of Maryland's environmental programs might be affected, \nthe increased funding in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund will \nenable Maryland communities to continue upgrading sewage treatment \nplants to help cleanup the Chesapeake Bay. This is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Maryland's transportation systems will also receive a much-needed \nboost, with an additional $86 million in highway funds and $14 million \nmore for transit funds. Amtrak will also receive much-needed funding so \nit can continue to help thousands of Marylanders get to work each day.\n  Again, this continuing resolution is far from perfect, and the \ncircumstances under which we are passing it are far from ideal. It is \nunfortunate that this Congress was forced to finish the work of the \nprior Congress, but it is our responsibility to do so. Therefore, I \nsupport the continuing resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1951-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1951-S1952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                  THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Nora Barry \nFischer, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Nora Barry Fischer is an accomplished and \nwell-respected attorney with over 30 years of legal experience. She is \nnominated to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. She received her law degree from Notre Dame \nUniversity Law School, and graduated magna cum laude from St. Mary's \nCollege, Notre Dame, with a B.A. in history and humanistic studies. She \nhas been an attorney with the law firm of Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, \nBebenek & Eck, where she quickly rose through the ranks. She is \ncurrently a partner with the Pittsburgh law firm of Pietragallo, Bosick \n& Gordon, cochairing the firm's Defense Litigation Group. Ms. Fischer \nbrings courtroom experience to the bench, having tried over 55 cases in \nState and Federal courts across the country. She has also served as a \nspecial master in state court and an arbitrator in Federal court on pro \nbono cases. She has been president of the Academy of Trial Lawyers of \nAllegheny County, served on the Executive Women's Council of \nPittsburgh, and worked with the Alleghany County Bar Association to \nprovide legal services to the underserved.\n  I thank Senator Casey for expediting his consideration of this \nnomination. As a courtesy to Senator Specter, I asked the former \nmajority leader to proceed to this nomination in December last year. \nRegrettably, Senator Frist chose not to do so and Senator Specter's \nchairmanship of the Judiciary Committee ended without this nomination \nhaving been confirmed. I am glad that, at long last, the Senate has \nturned its attention to this nomination and is granting its consent. I \nthank Majority Leader Reid for acting promptly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nfavor of the pending nomination of a distinguished Pennsylvania lawyer, \nMrs. Nora Barry Fischer, who is to be considered for the position of a \nU.S. district judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Senator Casey and I strongly endorse her confirmation. She is a \nPennsylvania native with a distinguished academic record. She graduated \nmagna cum laude from St. Mary's College with a B.A. degree in 1973 and \nreceived a law degree from Notre Dame Law School in 1976. She has had a \ndistinguished law practice with the Pittsburgh firm of Meyer, Darragh, \nBuckler, Bebenek & Eck and later at Pietragallo, Bosick & Gordon. She \nserved as an administrative partner in charge of recruitment and \ntraining and served as co-chair of the Defense Litigation Practice, \nwhich is Pietragallo Bosick's largest practice group. As Special Master \nfor the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, she handled \nconciliations, nonjury and jury trials by consent of the parties, which \ngives her a leg up on analogous judicial duties.\n  Mrs. Fischer is the recipient of a number of awards. The Pennsylvania \nBar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession awarded her the \nAnne X. Alpern Award for her efforts to promote women in the law. The \nPennsylvania Bar Association also recognized Mrs. Fischer for her work \nas co-chair of the Task Force on Health Care Delivery in Pennsylvania. \nShe was named the recipient of the 2006 Professionalism Award by the \nCivil Litigation Section of the Allegheny County Bar Association for \nher faithful adherence to the highest standards of legal \nprofessionalism. She has been recognized as a Pennsylvania Super Lawyer \nand as one of the Top 50 Women Super Lawyers in Pennsylvania.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mrs. Fischer \n``well qualified'' to serve as a federal district court judge.\n  She is precisely the type of nominee we are looking for, and I \nbelieve she will do very well in this very important position.\n  Madam President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, am I correct that there is a vote \nordered at 4:45 p.m.?\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And is the time between now and 4:45 p.m. allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is not here to take the time, let me take a moment. If he \nshows up, I certainly will yield to him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I will be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, especially since he called me the chairman.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was talking about the chairman who was about to show \nup, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I withdraw my consent.\n\n\n                                  BRAC\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to make a point. My colleague \nfrom Oklahoma was talking about the BRAC funding. I think everybody \nhere supports the BRAC funding. I certainly do. It is not a part of \nthis agreement, but it is not, as the Senator from Oklahoma suggested, \nthe Democrats' fault.\n  Just so people understand, we inherited a heck of a mess. We \ninherited a huge mess. What was the mess? The fact is, last year, 10 of \nthe appropriations bills never got to the floor of the Senate. We never \ngot here. They never had any discussion on them. Had that happened, we \nwould have had those appropriations bills passed and signed into law, \nand we wouldn't be discussing these issues.\n  As a result of inheriting an unbelievable mess, we had to put \ntogether something between the House and the Senate. Let me make this \npoint: That which was done between the House and the Senate included \ndiscussions with Republicans and Democrats on every single \nsubcommittee. We engaged the staff of the Republicans and the Democrats \nas this was put together.\n  I wanted to make that point. We inherited a mess. We have tried to \nmake the most of it.\n  This BRAC issue is going to get resolved. I support resolving it. The \nPresident is going to ask us for, apparently, $100 billion in the \ncoming couple of weeks.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my thought.\n  He is going to ask for $150 billion above that next year with respect \nto Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The point I am making is this: I understand that not just the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma but any number of Senators might come and say: I wish \nthis had been in it, I wish that had been in it. I personally wish a \nnumber of items had happened that didn't happen in this continuing \nresolution. But I was involved in working on it as chairman of the \nAppropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee. Last year, I was ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee. That bill didn't \nget to the floor of the Senate. The Energy and water bill didn't get to \nthe floor of the Senate. The bill that would have carried the BRAC \nfunding didn't get to the floor of the Senate. Why not? Don't blame \nthat on Democrats. We didn't control this Chamber last year.\n\n  But I don't come to blame one side or the other. I only come to say \nwe have tried to make the best of a bad situation. We were left with \nquite a mess. How did we make the best of this? We worked with the \nHouse and the Senate--bicameral; we worked with the staff of the \nRepublicans and the staff of the Democrats, bipartisan--to try to see \nif we could put together something that would allow us to put the \nfiscal year 2007 appropriations bills behind us and move ahead, because \nwe need to move immediately now to begin to put together the fiscal \nyear 2008 appropriations bills. We need to do that now.\n  So I only make the point that that is why we are here. No one likes \nit. We have done the best we could to make the best out of a bad \nsituation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a very \nfriendly question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We had authorized $5.7 billion to be spent this year on \nthe BRAC process and $4.1 billion was taken out, with $1 billion put \nback. My question to you is: Can we have that made up without taking it \nout of a supplemental that would be pulling it out of other wartime \nactivities? I would say that probably would work. That is my concern.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, reclaiming my time, it is not going to \nbe taken out of other funding in a supplemental. It will be added to a \nsupplemental, I presume. The President has proposed sending us $250 \nbillion in emergency funding in two tranches, the first for this fiscal \nyear and the second for the next fiscal year. My assumption is that \neveryone here believes those BRAC funds need to be dealt with and will \nbe dealt with in a supplemental, not by taking it away from other \nmilitary expenditures.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Nora Barry Fischer, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District \nJudge for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I was also happy to help expedite her nomination before \nthe Judiciary Committee to help ensure a speedy consideration by the \nfull Senate.\n  Ms. Fischer is a native of Homestead, PA, and a graduate of Notre \nDame Law School. In private practice, she has gained extensive \nexperience in litigation and mediation. Ms. Fischer will bring a wealth \nof knowledge to the bench, and I am confident that she will serve \nwestern Pennsylvania and the Nation well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1952-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority \nleader has agreed that during the break we are going to work among our \nstaffs--Senator Isakson and I have been in conversation with his staff \nalready--and we are going to continue to work with him, as well as with \nothers.\n  This is not a problem unique to Georgia. We are going to seek to come \nto a compromise on this issue. In about 10 days to 2 weeks or so, we \nwill have a cure or a fix for this problem that exists out there \nregarding the shortfall on SCHIP.\n\n  To Senator Reid, I say thank you for his cooperation on this and his \ncommitment to working together with us to find a solution for the \nchildren all across America to make sure these children do remain \ninsured. I say to my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, thanks \nfor his hard work and commitment on this issue as we have worked very \nclosely together.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since 1915, an oil portrait of Abraham \nLincoln has hong in the chambers of the Nevada Assembly. The painting \nof our 16th President serves as a reminder of Nevada's entrance to the \nUnion during his remarkable administration and of the special place his \nleadership will always hold in our State's history.\n  I want to pay tribute today to that man who rose to the highest \noffice in our country at one of the most turbulent times in our \nhistory. He is an example to all of a good, decent, honorable man, who \ncontributed more to the freedom we cherish today than we may ever fully \nunderstand.\n  February 12 was the 198th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth in a \nlog cabin in Kentucky. We all learned about ``Honest Abe'' in grade \nschool and his role in guiding this Nation through the Civil War.\n  But at the very essence of Abraham Lincoln was a man of great \nconviction who showed incomparable humility, a tested sense of \nmorality, and an ability to rise above personal pettiness. Learning \nabout Abraham Lincoln's life is a humbling lesson in leadership.\n  He was self-educated and had none of the advantages of a formal \neducation. He taught himself the law and never stopped learning along \nthe way. Whether it was studying history, philosophy, or military \nstrategy, what Lincoln lacked in classroom time, he made up for in \nfocus and determination.\n  And while moral fiber can be taught, that doesn't mean it will have \nits desired effect. It is said that trials don't build character, they \nreveal it. Abraham Lincoln had so many trials. His tremendous character \nwas revealed time and again. The stories are endless, but I want to \nshare a few examples of what a giant of a man President Lincoln really \nwas.\n  During his days practicing law, Lincoln would often ride the legal \ncircuit, which meant that he traveled with a band of lawyers and judges \nacross Illinois to try cases in every corner of the State. Lincoln was \nadmired and loved by his colleagues for his skill as a lawyer, and his \ngift for telling stories was legendary. It was during this time that \nfellow lawyers noted Lincoln's heartfelt conviction that no man was \nbetter than he. One lawyer pointed out:\n\n       He arrogated to himself no superiority over anyone. . . .\n\n  This sense of equality would remain consistent throughout Lincoln's \nlife--as a man and a public servant--and would extend to other \ncharacter strengths he exhibited. Lincoln was humble--to an astonishing \ndegree. In 1855, Lincoln withdrew his name for a seat in the U.S. \nSenate. Although he had the greater number of votes, it became apparent \nthat, if either he or the other anti-slavery candidate did not succumb, \nthe cause of slavery would be the true victor. Much to the dismay of \nhis loyal supporters, Lincoln advised the floor manager to drop his \nname, handing Lyman Trumball the win. Lincoln showed no hard feelings \nand shook Trumball's hand at his victory party.\n\n  Six months later, Lincoln suffered another blow to his morale when he \nbelieved that he was part of an important patent test case. Unbeknownst \nto him, he was not part of the case, but he continued to prepare as if \nhe were. When he approached the lawyers involved with the case, one of \nthem, Edwin Stanton, drew the other aside and asked why he had brought \nthe ``. . . long armed Ape here . . . he does not know any thing and \ncan do you no\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\ngood.'' Stanton treated Lincoln poorly in the days that followed, but \nsix years later, Lincoln asked Stanton to be his Secretary of War.\n  Lincoln's ability to put aside such losses--which for most people \nwould be terrible ego blows--was inspiring. Not only did he move \nforward, but he wasn't blinded by hate or rage and he didn't seek \nrevenge. Instead, he recognized the need to surround himself with the \nbest people who would make the greatest contributions to the mission at \nhand.\n  Lincoln's decision on who would join his cabinet was the perfect \nexample of what his assistant, John Nicolay, described as ``one of \ngreat courage and self-reliance.'' Lincoln did not fill these positions \nwith friends and loyal supporters who would agree with him and thought \nas he did. According to Lincoln:\n\n       We needed the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We \n     needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the \n     party over and concluded that these were the very strongest \n     men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their \n     services.\n\n  It took great strength of character to understand that--especially \nwhen three of those men were his rivals for the Republican nomination \nfor the presidency. These men: William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward \nBates, were stunned by their losses to Lincoln in the primary and each \nmaintained that he was the best man for the post well after their \nlosses. When Lincoln embraced them for the cabinet positions, they \nstill looked down on him as the lesser choice for president. However, \nLincoln was wonderfully gifted at transforming rivals to admirers.\n  Seward, who Lincoln named his Secretary of State, slowly came to \nrecognize the President's strong leadership abilities. He called the \nPresident's nobility ``almost superhuman.'' Seward was not alone.\n  But not everyone grew gradually fond of the President, as many saw \nhis promise and brilliance immediately. Nevada's first senator William \nStewart, whose seat I occupy today, described Lincoln's greatness.\n\n       President Lincoln was the greatest man this hemisphere has \n     produced. Without schooling he wrote the best English; \n     without education in rhetoric or logic he was the most \n     conclusive reasoner; without the slightest pretension to \n     oratory he was the most persuasive speaker of his time. He \n     was the kindest, most benevolent and humane man of his \n     generation. Whoever may be second as a scholar, as a \n     statesman and as a friend of humanity, Lincoln must be first.\n\n  Lincoln also touched the hearts of the soldiers who served under him. \nAfter one of his many visits to the troops on the battlefield, one \nsoldier wrote home that as the President passed them, his smile ``was a \nreal reflection of his honest, kindly, heart; but deeper, under the \nsurface of that marked and not all uncomely face, were the unmistakable \nsigns of care and anxiety . . . In fact, his popularity in the army is \nand has been universal.''\n  Lincoln's honest, kindly heart--that the soldier referenced--was also \napparent in his loyalty and willingness to take responsibility for his \nactions. Lincoln would not let a subordinate take the fall for a \ndecision he had made. In 1862, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was the \nvictim of an especially aggressive, brutal personal attack. He was \naccused of not providing all the backup troops to counter what turned \nout to be a battle of great loss to the Union. Lincoln took the \nunprecedented step of convening a Union meeting with all the government \ndepartments. The audience, gathered in front of the Capitol, was \ncomparable in size to that of a crowd at an inauguration. He explained \nthat, ``The Secretary of War is not to blame for not giving when he had \nnone to give. I believe he is a brave and able man, and I stand here, \nas justice requires me to do, to take upon myself what has been charged \non the Secretary of War.'' What a humbling story. This is what Harry \nTruman meant when he said, ``The buck stops here.''\n  Equal to his loyalty was Abraham Lincoln's courage. The Emancipation \nProclamation was described by one supporter as ``. . . the greatest act \nof justice, statesmanship, and civilization, of the last four hundred \nyears.'' The Executive Order, signed by President Lincoln, declared the \nfreedom of all slaves in those areas of the rebellious Confederacy that \nhad not already returned to Union control. By the summer of 1865, an \nestimated four million slaves had been freed. Hannah Johnson, the \nmother of a Northern Black soldier, wrote to President Lincoln about \nthe Emancipation Proclamation, stating:\n\n       When you are dead and in Heaven, in a thousand years that \n     action of yours will make the Angels sing your praises.\n\n  No doubt there are angels still singing, just 144 years later.\n  Lincoln never considered himself a champion for the slave. His \npriority was upholding and defending the Union and the Constitution \nupon which it stood. However, it was his vision and steady leadership \nthat ultimately brought down slavery in the United States. With this \ntransformation also came the respect and admiration of black \nabolitionist Frederick Douglass. Douglass has been a frequent critic of \nthe President's, trashing him publicly many times. However, the two \nagreed on the need to recruit and build black regiments to fight in the \nwar. It was a controversial move, but Lincoln understood the impact \nthat the soldiers would have on the rebellion. Douglass went to the \nWhite House to meet with Lincoln about some of the inequalities among \nblack and white soldiers. Just as he had won over countless rivals in \nthe past, Lincoln's ``humane spirit,'' as Douglass called it, won him \nover as well. The two formed a relationship, and Douglass came to \ngreatly admire Abraham Lincoln.\n  I wanted to talk about Abraham Lincoln because there is a timeless \nlesson in his style of leadership and his moral fiber. Today, we face a \npolitically divided government and country. However, the issues are not \nas dire as the Civil War that took the lives of what today would be \nfive million people. The United States is not on the brink of \nextinction. But we have an opportunity to rise above the political \ngames and the pettiness to make progress on some of the major issues \nfacing our Nation. We should all strive to show some of the humility, \nmoral conviction, courage, and honesty by which Abraham Lincoln lived \nhis life. This Nation paid a grave price in the name of freedom under \nhis watch. Not only did freedom survive but it flourished, and he led \nus to new and greater heights.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln lost his life in the name of that freedom. After \nbeing shot in the back of the head, Lincoln struggled for 9 hours \nbetween life and death. The Nation--north and south--mourned for this \nbeloved man, but those most inconsolable were the men who had first \nbeen Lincoln's rivals and who had later become his closest friends and \nadvisors. There is no greater praise than that of Secretary of War \nEdwin Stanton whose tribute from Lincoln's deathbed has proven true, \n``Now he belongs to the ages.''\n  President Lincoln told an Ohio regiment in 1864:\n\n       It is not merely for to-day, but for all time to come that \n     we should perpetuate for our children's children this great \n     and free government, which we have enjoyed all our lives.\n\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of one of \nour greatest Presidents by working together and challenging each other \nto lead as he did.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to take a few minutes first to \ntalk about someone who was a very dear friend whom I think was \nemblematic of what our forefathers thought about when they thought \nabout a U.S. Congressman. His name was Charlie\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nNorwood. He died yesterday. Charlie was a ``tell it like it is'' guy. \nHis motivations were always altruistic. They were never self-centered.\n  He had never been in politics. He was a dentist, and he got fed up. \nHe came here and had a tremendous impact in terms of his voice of \ncommon sense, reason, and compassion. The House of Representatives is \ngoing to miss that voice, but more important, the American people are \ngoing to miss one of the few voices of common sense that we have in \nCongress today. He leaves a wife, Gloria, and two sons, all supportive \nof his sacrifice to serve here.\n  There are a lot of stories told about Charlie. I won't go into that. \nHe was always fun to be around. He was always invigorating. And he \nnever quit believing in this wonderful thing we call the American \ndream.\n  He fought hard for what he thought was right on immigration. He \nrecognized that if we build a wall, it is not to keep people in; that \nthe opportunities here are so great, what has been created by our \nFounders and grew through the years is so tremendous, that we ought to \ncontinue to take advantage of it.\n  What I really liked about him was that he was a true citizen \nlegislator. He abandoned his practice and his easy life and came to do \nthe hard work of representing the people of Georgia with common sense \nand down-home, plain family values. He will be sorely missed. But he \nleaves a legacy, a legacy to everybody who is out there today who \nthinks we need to change the Congress of the United States. The legacy \nhe leaves is this: If you are willing to sacrifice and get into the \nfray, you can come here and make a difference. That is what he proved. \nHis life was not that of a career politician--although that is a \nwonderful service, and we have dedicated people throughout both Houses \nof Congress who have dedicated their lives to public service. But he \nbrought a freshness and he brought ideas because his experience was \nwhat everybody else in the country was experiencing, not what is \nexperienced among the political elite in this country.\n  The challenge that Charlie leaves for all of us who are not in \nCongress, who do not like things the way they are, is to actually get \ninvolved. That legacy will live on for a long time--I know in his \ndistrict in Georgia, and also through the State of Georgia--but also \nfor those of us who will continue to remember him and the sacrifices he \nmade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1955-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HARD WORK YIELDS WISE INVESTMENTS FOR AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Senate today gave final Congressional \napproval to a comprehensive $463.5 billion funding resolution. The vote \ntoday was the culmination of many weeks of determined effort by \nSenators and Members of the House from both parties, and from their \ntalented staffs.\n  I take a moment to thank Senators for their support for this \nlegislation, and to the members of the Appropriations Committee, \nDemocratic Senators and Republican Senators, for their determination \nand effort to reach this milestone.\n  This was not easy legislation to craft. Members and staff took on the \ndifficult task of wrapping the funding of every domestic department and \nagency into a single bill, without Congressional earmarks and within \nvery austere budget limitations. It was one of the most complex \nprocesses that the Appropriations Committee has undertaken in recent \nmemory. But it was a challenge that we met in a smart, innovative way.\n  I thank the Appropriations Committee staff: Staff Director Terry \nSauvain; Deputy Staff Director Charles Kieffer; Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, FDA clerk Galen Fountain; Commerce, Justice, Science clerk \nPaul Carliner; Defense clerk Charlie Houy; Energy and Water clerk Doug \nClapp; Financial Services clerk Marianne Upton; Interior clerk Peter \nKiefhaber; Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education clerk Ellen \nMurray; Legislative Branch clerk Nancy Olkewicz; Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs clerk Christina Evans; State and Foreign \nOperations clerk Tim Rieser; and Transportation and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment clerk Peter Rogoff; their associate staffs; Communications \nDirector Tom Gavin and Communications Coordinator Cindy Huber; Deputy \nChief Clerk Elnora Harvey; and professional staff members Jack Conway \nand Bob Knisely. Senators know the value of a strong staff, and this \nstaff is, in my opinion, the best on Capitol Hill. Each of these men \nand women devoted long hours to this legislation. But it was not just a \ncommitment of time; it also was the application of their years of \nexperience and their dedication to this country that helped to craft \nthis funding resolution and help see it through the Senate.\n  This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to pay tribute to Senator \nThad Cochran, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, his staff director Bruce Evans, and the Republican \nsubcommittee staffs. They were partners in producing this balanced \nfunding legislation, and their ideas and input were invaluable.\n  Not only was the writing of this legislation a bipartisan process, \nbut it also was a bicameral one. House Appropriations Chairman Dave \nObey and his staff, and Ranking Member Jerry Lewis and his staff, were \nintegral to the success of this legislation.\n  This final funding package is an example of how the Congress can work \ntogether, without regard to party lines or partisan positions. this \nlegislation focuses not on Democratic priorities or Republican \npriorities, but rather on national priorities of health care; law \nenforcement and counterterrorism efforts; education, medical care for \nour troops and our veterans; and energy independence. We invest \nresources wisely in an effort to meet the country's needs today while \nbuilding the foundation for a stronger America tomorrow.\n  I thank Senators for their support of this legislation, and I look \nforward to continuing this bipartisan effort on the Fiscal 2008 \nappropriations legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1955-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CENTRALIA HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the \nCentralia High School boy's basketball team for 100 years of remarkable \nsuccess.\n  The Centralia High Orphans have earned the distinction of being one \nof the ``winningest'' high school basketball teams in America. The \nCentralia basketball program began its winning career with a 2-and-2 \nrecord in its inaugural 1906-1907 season, less than a decade after the \nsport had been invented. In this their 100th season, the Orphans have \namassed more than 1,975 career wins.\n  During the past 100 years, Centralia High has witnessed many \nlegendary coaches and players. Coach Arthur Trout led the team to three \nState championships as well as an impressive 1941 season of 44 wins and \nonly 2 losses. Coach Trout has an honored place in Centralia High's \nhistory where the new school gym bears his name today. Even now, many \nfans fondly recall the Orphans' all-time leading scorer, Dwight \n``Dike'' Eddleman, who played for the team in the 1940s. Eddleman went \non to letter in three sports at the University of Illinois, won the \nsilver medal in the high jump at the 1948 Paris Olympics, and played in \nthe NBA. Other Orphans that represented Centralia in the NBA include \nBobby Joe Mason, Ken McBride, and Dick Garrett.\n  I am proud to be able to offer my congratulations to the Centralia \nHigh basketball team, Coach Randy Lincoln, and the town of Centralia, \nIL on reaching their 100th season, and I look forward to cherring on \nmany more successful seasons of Orphans basketball in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1955-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1955-S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CAMPBELLSVILLE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor a great \nKentucky institution, Campbellsville University, as it celebrates 100 \nyears of academic excellence.\n  Campbellsville University was originally founded in 1906 as the \nRussell Creek Academy and has proven itself to be an outstanding \ninstitution of higher education over the last 100 years. It has had an \nimmeasurable impact on thousands of young men and women and has helped \nadd to the academic excellence of our fine Commonwealth.\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n  In the beginning, the Russell Creek Academy began with training \ndepartments for teacher and pastor training. In 1907 the Russell Creek \nAcademy provided classes in music, art, and a diploma program for an \nenrollment of 200 students. Campbellsville University has now grown to \n2,300 students as of last fall, with 38 undergraduate programs and 9 \ngraduate programs, all while encompassing 75 acres of beautiful land \nnear Campbellsville, KY.\n  To make sure that the university will continue to grow and progress \nfor the next 100 years as it has this past century, many improvements \nare being made across the campus to add to its beauty and improve life \nfor students. For instance, great progress is being made on the 800-\nseat Ransdell Chapel and the new Heilman Student Center. With the new \nSchool of Nursing, new tennis courts and the 48-bed addition to the \nResident Village, Campbellsville University is looking forward to many \nnew projects to keep up the demand and growth of this institution.\n  Academically, the School of Nursing program began this year and is \noff to a great start. Campbellsville University has also expanded its \nmaster of business administration program, moving along with the \ntechnological revolution by offering the program online in addition to \nthe traditional MBA classes that the University has offered and been so \nwell-known for over the years.\n  The students enrolled at Campbellsville University are proudly \npreparing a time capsule to commemorate this centennial celebration \nthat will be opened in another 100 years, in 2107. The capsule will \nenable students 100 years from now to look at a time before they became \nstudents at Campbellsville University and compare its first 100 years \nto the next.\n  According to Dr. Michael V. Carter, the school's president, ``at \nCampbellsville University, faculty encourage students to grow stronger \nspiritually and find their true purpose in life, which is the greatest \ndiscovery of all.'' I hope that the history and tradition of this great \nschool, encapsulated in the time capsule that they are preparing, will \naid in that discovery for the students of today and a century to come.\n  Madam President, I ask that the entire Senate join me in \ncongratulating Campbellsville University on this auspicious occasion; \nwith 100 years of excellence in education behind us, we look forward to \nthe next 100 with high hopes and anticipation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1956-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Specialist Raymond ``Neal'' Mitchell, III\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the life of \nArmy SPC Raymond ``Neal'' Mitchell III. Specialist Mitchell gave his \nlife serving our Nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Although he may no \nlonger be with us, his legacy and spirit will live on through the lives \nhe touched and the example he set for others.\n  Originally from Tennessee, Specialist Mitchell moved to West Memphis, \nAR, in 2002 to live with his grandparents and attend West Memphis \nChristian School. While going to school, Mitchell helped his \ngrandparents with the business they had operated for more than 18 \nyears. Teachers at West Memphis Christian School remember Specialist \nMitchell for the tremendous strides they witnessed him make as a \nstudent and as a person. The quiet young man they knew came out of his \nshell and became involved in the school and the community. Specialist \nMitchell clearly valued the company of friends and family and \nconsidered returning one day to coach baseball. Upon graduating in \n2004, he enrolled at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro before \nenlisting in the U.S. Army in 2005.\n  While serving in the Army, Specialist Mitchell became an infantry \nman. Despite the ever-present danger, he courageously devoted his \nskills where he felt they were needed most--becoming the point man, or \nlookout, for his patrol. When asked why he became a point man he said, \n``I'm not the best shot . . . but I'm the fastest.'' It was a testament \nto his bravery, desire to serve his country and devotion to his fellow \nsoldiers. In August 2006, his unit deployed to Baghdad where he served \nas a driver and gunner for humvees while on patrol. Over Thanksgiving \nhe had the opportunity to return home on a 2-week leave from Iraq. \nDuring his leave, he spent time with his family in Tennessee and had a \nchance to visit his old school in West Memphis.

He was a great representative for the \npeople for the people of the 10th district of Georgia, and in his years \nof service he made a real difference in the Congress.\n  There is no doubt Charlie's leadership, his wisdom, and his wit will \nbe sorely missed.\n  Now is the time to keep Charlie's family in our prayers. But we \nshould also celebrate a life well-lived. Knowing Charlie Norwood like I \ndo, I am confident he would not have wanted it any other way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1956-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

In recognition of Black History Month, we \ngathered with residents of New Jersey to pay tribute to Mr. Jones on \nSaturday, February 10, 2007, at the Newark Museum in Newark, NJ, during \n``A Salute to Heroes.''\n  Raised in Newark, NJ, Reginald Jones has dedicated his life to \nserving our great Nation. First, as a proud marine, he defended the \nfreedoms and liberties we all hold dear as Americans.\n  It was while stationed in Guantanamo Bay that Reginald discovered \nboxing, a sport which led him to win the bronze medal at the 1971 Pan-\nAm Games in Cali, Colombia. In 1972, Reggie was selected as a member of \nthe U.S. Olympic Team in Munich, Germany. In a boxing match that led to \nmany changes in the sport, Reginald, a light middleweight, found \nhimself in the ring with Valerie Tebugov of the Soviet Union. Judging \ndiscrepancies did not allow Reginald to advance to medal rounds, but \nReginald received a good sportsmanship award for the dignity he \ndisplayed throughout the games, which he fondly recalled in a Star \nLedger article as an ``opportunity to make many friends.''\n  Now, as a caseworker with the New Jersey Division of Children and \nFamilies Services for more than 20 years,\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nReginald continues to serve our Nation, caring for and watching over \nthe neediest children, ensuring that future generations have access to \nthe same opportunities that helped Reggie reach his goals.\n  There is no doubt Reginald Jones is an exemplary leader and a \nprofoundly committed individual who is a true role model for the \nNation. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Reginald Jones, and \nknow my colleagues will join in wishing him continued success.\n\n\n                              TOMMIE SMITH\n\n  Madam President, I also rise today to join with my colleague, Senator \nFrank R. Lautenberg, and our House colleague Congressman Donald Payne \nto honor Tommie Smith, a distinguished and inspiring figure in African-\nAmerican history. In recognition of Black History Month we gathered \nwith residents of New Jersey to pay tribute to Dr. Smith on Saturday, \nFebruary 10, 2007, at the Newark Museum in Newark, NJ, during ``A \nSalute to Heroes.''\n  Tommie Smith was born to Richard and Dora Smith on June 6, 1944, in \nClarksville, TX. The 7th of his family's 12 children, he moved to \nCalifornia at a young age. His father was a sharecropper, and Tommie \nused to pick cotton at neighboring farms to help with the family \nfinances.\n  During high school he excelled at football, basketball, and track. He \nreceived his bachelor of arts degree from San Jose State University in \nsocial science, with double minors in military science and physical \neducation, and his masters degree in sociology from Goddard Cambridge \nin Boston, MA. As a sophomore college student, Tommie began breaking \nworld records in track and went on to tie or break a total of 13 world \nrecords. He is the only man in the history of track and field to hold \n11 world records simultaneously.\n  In 1968, Tommie was selected for the U.S. Olympic team for track and \nfield. The 19th Olympiad, held in Mexico City, witnessed Tommie Smith \nbreaking the world and Olympic records for the 200-meter race with a \ntime of 19.83 seconds. On October 16, 1968, as the ``Star Spangled \nBanner'' played, Tommie stood on the victory podium, draped with his \nOlympic gold medal, shoeless, and together with his teammate, John \nCarlos, raised a clenched fist, covered in a black leather glove, in \nwhat has come to be recognized as a historic stand for ``power, \nliberation and solidarity.'' Both Tommie and John were members of the \nOlympic Project for Human Rights. This silent act received both cheers \nand jeers, and Tommie was suspended by the U.S. Olympic Committee and \nordered to leave Mexico. But Tommie Smith was not dissuaded from his \ncommitment to championing the cause of oppressed people.\n  After the Olympics, Tommie returned to San Jose State University. \nUpon graduation, Tommie played professional football with the \nCincinnati Bengals for 3 years. But teaching and coaching were his true \ncalling, and he later became a track coach at Oberlin College, in Ohio, \nwhere he also taught sociology, and at Santa Monica College, in \nCalifornia. Now a resident of Georgia, Tommie has dedicated his time to \nspeaking to students across the country, urging them to stand up for \nwhat they believe in and to have ``faith and hope.''\n  Since 1968, Tommie Smith has been recognized for his actions in \ndefense of civil rights and for his athletic prowess by various \norganizations including the National Track & Field Hall of Fame, the \nCalifornia Black Sports Hall of Fame, the County of Los Angeles and the \nState of Texas. He was honored with the 2004 dedication of the Tommie \nSmith gymnasium in Saint-Ouen, France, and a 2005 honorary doctorate \ndegree of humane letters from San Jose State University.\n  There is no doubt Tommie Smith is an exemplary leader and a \nprofoundly committed individual who is a true role model for the \nNation. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Tommie Smith, and I \nknow my colleagues will join in wishing him continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1957-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMEMORATING ARIZONA'S STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. KYL.

At the time of \nstatehood, Arizona's population numbered in the hundreds of thousands, \nbut it was growing quickly, from around 200,000 in 1910 to over 330,000 \nin 1920. Today, it is the Nation's fastest growing State, with a \npopulation of more than 6 million.\n  Tourists flock to the State for its cultural heritage and scenic \nbeauty. Arizona is home to four national parks and many other national \nmonuments and historic sites. Many who visit these sites are heeding \nthe advice of Theodore Roosevelt, who said of the Grand Canyon, ``You \ncannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your \nchildren, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the \none great sight which every American should see.''\n  From its days as a rough Wild West territory to the dynamic State it \nis today, Arizona's beauty and culture has captivated those who have \nexperienced it. I wish the State a happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1957-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KANSAS AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the \naccomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, specifically the \n190th Air Refueling Wing which celebrates its 50th anniversary on \nFebruary 23, 2007. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of these \nheroic men and women reflects well on themselves, the 190th Air \nRefueling Wing, and the Kansas Air National Guard. They truly make all \nKansans proud.\n  This outstanding military organization began as the 117th Fighter-\nInterceptor Squadron located at the Hutchinson Naval Air Station in \nHutchinson, KS. The unit was federally recognized on February 23, 1957. \nOver the course of its 50-year history, the 190th has flown the F-80, \nB-57A, B-57G, RB-57, EB-57, KC-135A, KC-135D, KC-135E and currently the \nKC-135R. The unit was stationed at Hutchinson Naval Air Station--later \nthe Hutchinson Air National Guard Base--until 1967 when the unit was \ntransferred to Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, KS.\n  The 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field continues to be a leader \nin the Air National Guard. The unit recently received two prestigious \nawards--the Spaatz trophy--awarded to the overall outstanding Air \nNational Guard Flying Wing--and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. \nWe owe these brave servicemen, servicewomen, and their families a debt \nof gratitude. I thank them for their 50 years of service and extend my \nbest wishes to them for the next 50 years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/14/senate-section/article/S1957-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 742.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nto make grants for the development and operation of research centers \nregarding environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of \nbreast cancer; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Hatch, \nClinton, Murkowski, Sanders, and Snowe in introducing the Breast Cancer \nand Environmental Research Act of 2007. On behalf of the millions of \nAmericans who are affected by breast cancer, I urge all my Senate \ncolleagues to support this important bill.\n  Many of us are familiar with breast cancer's serious toll on the \nNation. Approximately 3 million women are living with the disease \ntoday, including an estimated 1 million who have not yet been \ndiagnosed. Moreover, anyone's mother, daughter, wife, sister, or friend \nis at risk. It is thought that breast cancer will strike one in eight \nAmerican women in her lifetime, with a new case diagnosed every 2 \nminutes. That means almost 275,000 new cases are expected to be \ndiagnosed annually, including over 1,600 in Nevada. More than 40,000 \nlives are lost to the disease every year.\n  Deanna Jensen, a lifelong Nevadan and tireless activist for breast \ncancer research, was one of those lives. Sadly, Deanna passed away this \nyear after her own heroic battle against breast cancer. Although the \nloss is most painfully felt by her loved ones, her legacy can be a \nreminder to us all that there are real people and real stories behind \nthe impersonal statistics.\n  There are many more women across the country whose stories go \nunrecognized. But they deserve more than recognition and appreciation. \nThey deserve answers to the same questions that many patients must \nsurely ask themselves: Why me? Why do I have breast cancer?\n  The search for those answers is the driving force behind the Breast \nCancer and Environmental Research Act. Unfortunately, we still do not \nknow what causes breast cancer, despite the remarkable progress \nachieved so far. Scientists have identified some risk factors, but \nthose factors can explain fewer than 30 percent of cases. Because many \nwomen, and men, have no family history or known genetic links to breast \ncancer, it is generally believed that the environment plays a role in \nthe development of breast cancer. However, we still do not understand \nthe extent of that role.\n  We do know that environmental toxins could be partly responsible for \nAmerica's high breast cancer rate. Studies have explored the effect of \nisolated environmental factors, such as diet, pesticides, and even \nelectromagnetic fields. In most cases, the results have been \ninconclusive. Furthermore, there are many other factors that are \nsuspected to play a role that have yet to be studied.\n  What is needed is not just a boost in the research investment on the \nrole of the environment in the development of breast cancer, which has \nbeen very limited so far. We also need a comprehensive, national \nstrategy to fully and effectively explore these issues. The Breast \nCancer and Environmental Research Act would address both needs, thereby \nspurring on promising research. The resulting discoveries could be \ncrucial to improving our knowledge of this complex illness, which could \nlead to new treatments and perhaps a cure one day.\n  Specifically, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act will \nauthorize $40 million each year for five years to establish multi-\ninstitutional, multi-disciplinary Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Centers of Excellence. Each Center would include institutions \nwith different areas of expertise working together to tackle the same \nproblems from different angles, as well as collaborating with community \norganizations in the area. Modeled after the tremendously successful \nBreast Cancer Research Program at the Department of Defense, grants \nwould be awarded under a competitive, peer-reviewed process that \ninvolves patient advocates.\n  Small studies sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental \nHealth Sciences are already underway to study the prenatal-to-adult \nenvironmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer. \nThis is a promising step in the right direction, but it is only a down \npayment on the task at hand. Moreover, the research strategy for these \ngrants does not follow the nationally-focused, collaborative, and \ncomprehensive model as outlined by the Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act. Now, more than ever, we need to see the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act signed into law.\n  If we miss promising research opportunities because Congress has \nfailed to act, millions more and their families will face difficult \nquestions about breast cancer. Every day, many of these Americans, like \nDeanna Jensen, rise to the challenge of fighting back against breast \ncancer. I encourage Congress to heed the national call to action as \nwell.\n  In the 109th Congress, 66 of my Senate colleagues and 262 members of \nthe House of Representatives joined me in doing so. I hope that my \ncolleagues in the 110th Congress will support the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This risk was about 1 in 11 in 1975. All women are \nat risk for breast cancer. About 90 percent of women who develop breast \ncancer do not have a family history of the disease. The most recent \navailable statistics show that 40 percent of all women diagnosed with \ninvasive breast cancer died from the disease within 20 years. These are \nfrightening statistics.\n  Furthermore, the disease is not limited by gender--in 2007, \napproximately 1,750 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be \ndiagnosed among men in the United States. In my home State of Utah, as \nindicated by the Utah Cancer Registry, breast cancer has the highest \nincidence rate of the ten leading cancer types. This disease has an \nimpact on nearly every American's life.\n  Breast cancer death rates have been dropping steadily since 1991; \nhowever, challenges still remain. The bottom line is that we still do \nnot know what causes this disease, or how to prevent it. Although \nscientists have discovered some risk factors for breast cancer, the \nknown risk factors account for only a small percentage about 30 \npercent--of breast cancer cases. There are no proven interventions to \nprevent breast cancer and there is no cure.\n  There is general belief within the scientific community that the \nenvironment plays a role in the development of breast cancer, but the \nextent of that role has been less-examined. Research has investigated \nthe effect of isolated environmental factors such as diet, pesticides, \nand electromagnetic fields; but, in most cases, there has been no \nconclusive evidence. Some scientists hypothesize that certain subgroups \nof women have genetic variants that may make them more susceptible to \nadverse environmental exposures.\n  In addition, a large study of twins demonstrated that the majority of \nbreast cancers cannot be explained by inherited factors. The incidence \nof breast cancer in Western industrialized countries, such as the \nUnited States, is much higher than the incidence in Africa and Asia. \nWhen women migrate from a country with low incidence to a country with \nhigh incidence, their daughters experience the breast cancer risk of \nthe new country's population. The discrepancy in incidence among \nvarious countries suggests that some of the differences in incidence \nmay be explained by environmental exposures.\n  In-depth study of these potential risks could provide invaluable \ninformation in understanding the causes of breast cancer, and could \nlead to new prevention strategies. Clearly, more research needs to be \ndone to determine the impact of environmental factors on breast cancer.\n  My colleagues and I are introducing the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act of 2007 to address this palpable need for \nresearch. It creates a national strategy to conduct research into the \npossible links between breast cancer and the environment. The time to \naddress these frightening statistics is now.\n  Specifically, the bill authorizes the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) at the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) to award grants for the development and operation of up to \neight centers for the purpose of conducting research on environmental \nfactors that may be related to breast cancer. These centers will work \nacross institutions, across disciplines, and with community \norganizations to study environmental factors that may cause breast \ncancer.\n  This legislation is modeled after the highly successful and promising \nDepartment of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program (DOD BCRP), which \noperates under a competitive, peer-reviewed grant-making process that \ninvolves consumers.\n  Isolated studies have been conducted to look at suspected \nenvironmental links to breast cancer; but these studies are only a \nsmall step toward the broad strategic research that is required. What \nis needed is a collaborative, comprehensive, nationally-focused \nstrategy to address this oversight a strategy like the one outlined in \nthis bill.\n  It is important to note that while we have made progress in the fight \nagainst breast cancer, we are still a long way from prevention or a \ncure--breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among \nwomen worldwide. Studies have shown that environmental factors that \ncause breast cancer may exist, but conclusive evidence is scarce. This \nbill will go a long way in helping the scientific community explore \nenvironmental triggers of breast cancer.\n  The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act had strong \nbipartisan support in the 109th Congress, with 66 Senate cosponsors. In \nthe House of Representatives, 262 Members supported the legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of breast cancer patients and their \nloved ones, and support this important bill. This Federal commitment is \ncritical for the overall, national strategy and the long-term \ninvestments required to discover the environmental causes of breast \ncancer so that we can better prevent it, treat it more effectively, \nand, ultimately, cure it.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Breast \nCancer and Environmental Research Act with Senator Reid and colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  This legislation would allow us to investigate the links between \nenvironmental exposures and breast cancer. Improving our ability to \ninvestigate the connection between pollutants and cancer incidence is \nthe first step in improving our overall response to environmental \nhealth concerns. Environmental hazards manifest themselves in \nunexpected cancers, tumors, and other diseases in ways that we are only \nnow beginning to understand.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women \nin the United States, and 3 million women in the United States are \ncurrently living with the disease 1 million of whom have not yet been \ndiagnosed. Each year, over 13,000 women in New York State are diagnosed \nwith this disease. Every one of us has been affected by breast cancer, \nwhether it is through our own personal battle or our experiences \noffering love and support to our friends, our mothers, and our sisters.\n  Since 2001, I have sought to raise awareness of the need for \nincreased research into the connections between\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nenvironmental factors and the incidence of chronic diseases like breast \ncancer. I have worked closely with advocates from New York on this \nissue, and hosted a field hearing of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in Long Island to discuss breast cancer and other \nenvironmental health concerns.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will expand the available \nresources for our scientists and expedite research in this area. The \nBreast Cancer and Environmental Research Act will create Centers of \nExcellence to engage in multidisciplinary research, carried out in \ncollaboration with the community, and learn more about how \nenvironmental factors may be linked to the more than 200,000 breast \ncancer cases diagnosed each year.\n  I am hopeful that in the not-too-distant future, the incidence of \nbreast cancer will be dramatically reduced, and in the handful of new \ncases that appear, we will be able to provide high-quality, highly \neffective treatment and save women's lives. But in order to achieve \nthose goals, we need to learn more about all the causes of breast \ncancer, including the environmental factors that contribute to this \ndisease.\n  Last year, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act was \nreported unanimously out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. I will work with my colleagues there to once again move it \nthrough the committee process quickly, so that we can pass this \nessential legislation in this session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 580. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to require the \nSecretary of the Interior to update the feasibility and suitability \nstudies of four national historic trails, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pioneer \nNational Historic Trails Studies Act which would update the feasibility \nand suitability studies of four national historic trails and allow \npossible additions to them. The trails in question are the Oregon, the \nMormon, the Pony Express, and the California National Historic Trails.\n  In 1978, the Oregon and Mormon trails were established by the \nNational Trails System Act which defined these trails as ``point A to \npoint B,'' limiting them to one beginning point and one final \ndestination. At that time, The Mormon Pioneer National Historic trail \nwas defined as the route Brigham Young took in 1846 through Iowa and \nthen to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. The Oregon Trail was defined \nnarrowly as the route taken by settlers from Independence, MO, to \nOregon City from 1841 to 1848. It was limited to a single trail with \nonly three variants as well. Unfortunately, we have come to realize \nthat this rigid definition precludes designation of some very important \nhistorical sites.\n  Congress passed an amendment for the establishment of the California \nand Pony Express National Historic Trails in 1992. This amendment \nbroadened the statute to include the possibility of trail variants for \nthe California Trail and provided a more accurate depiction of the \noriginal trail. The legislation I am introducing today will provide \nadditional authority for variation to these four trails to provide a \nmore accurate depiction of history.\n  To those of us in the West, these trails are the highways of our \nhistory. With this legislation, I hope to capture the important stories \nmade along the variations of these main trails. Since the enactment of \nthe National Trails System Act in 1978, there has been a great deal of \nsupport to broaden the Act to include these side roads of the trails.\n  Not every pioneer embarked on their journey from Omaha, NE, or \nIndependence, MO and not every great or tragic event took place along \nthe main routes. Tens of thousands of settlers began from other \nstarting points. These trail variations and alternate routes show the \ningenuity and adaptability of the pioneers as they were forced to \ncontend with inclement weather, lack of water, difficult terrain, and \nhostile Native American tribes.\n  The Act requires comprehensive management for the historic trails. In \n1981, such plans were completed for the Mormon and Oregon trails. Since \nthat time, however, endless hours of research by the Park Service and \ntrails organizations have produced a more complete picture of the \nwestward expansion. The National Park Service has determined, however, \nthat legislation is required to update the trails with this newfound \nhistory.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. This bill would \nauthorize the study of further important additions to the California, \nMormon Pioneer, Oregon, and Pony Express National Historic Trails and \nallow for a more complete story to be told of our history of the West.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

               \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 581. A bill to amend the Buy American Act to increase the \nrequirement for American-made content, to tighten the waiver \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp American workers and companies.\n  The bill that I am introducing, the Buy American Improvement Act, \nfocuses on the Federal Government's responsibility to support domestic \nmanufacturers and workers and on the role of Federal procurement policy \nin achieving this goal. The reintroduction of this bill, which I first \nintroduced in 2003, is part of my ongoing efforts to stem the flow of \nmanufacturing jobs abroad.\n  The Buy American Act of 1933 is the primary statute that governs \nFederal procurement. The name of this law accurately describes its \npurpose: to ensure that the Federal Government supports domestic \ncompanies and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. \nRegrettably, this law contains a number of loopholes that make it too \neasy for government agencies to buy foreign-made goods.\n  My bill, the Buy American Improvement Act, would strengthen the \nexisting law by tightening its waiver provisions. Currently, the heads \nof Federal departments and agencies are given broad discretion to waive \nthe Act and buy foreign goods with little or no accountability. We \nshould ensure that the Federal Government makes every effort to give \nFederal contracts to companies that will perform the work domestically. \nWe should also ensure that certain types of industries do not leave the \nUnited States completely, thus making the Federal Government dependent \non foreign sources for goods, such as plane or ship parts, that our \nmilitary may need to acquire on short notice.\n  I have often heard my colleagues say on this floor that American-made \ngoods are the best in the world. I could not agree more. Regrettably, \nnearly 90,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs have left my State since \n2000. And the country has lost around 3 million manufacturing jobs \nsince January 2001. This hemorrhaging of jobs shows that Congress needs \nto do more to support domestic manufacturers and their employees. One \nway to do this is to ensure that the Federal Government makes every \neffort to buy American-made goods.\n  There are five primary waivers to the Buy American Act, and my bill \naddresses four of them. The first of these waivers allows an agency \nhead to buy foreign goods if complying with the Act would be \n``inconsistent with the public interest.'' I am concerned that this \nwaiver, which includes no definition for what is ``inconsistent with \nthe public interest,'' is actually a gaping loophole that gives too \nmuch discretion to department secretaries and agency heads. My bill \nwould modify this waiver provision to prohibit it from being invoked by \nan agency or department head after a request for proposals, or RFP, has \nbeen published in the Federal Register. Once the bidding process has \nbegun, the Federal Government should not be able to pull an RFP by \nsaying that it is in the ``public interest'' to do so. This \ndetermination, sometimes referred to as the Buy American Act's national \nsecurity waiver, should be made well in advance of placing a contract \nup for bid. To do otherwise pulls the rug out from under companies that \nare spending valuable time and resources to prepare a bid for a Federal \ncontract.\n  The Buy American Act may also be waived if the head of the agency \ndetermines that the cost of the lowestpriced domestic product is \n``unreasonable,'' and a system of price differentials is used to assist \nin making this determination. My bill would modify this waiver to \nrequire that preference be given to the American company if that \ncompany's bid is substantially similar to the lowest foreign bid or if \nthe American company is the only domestic source for the item to be \nprocured.\n  I have a long record of supporting efforts to help taxpayers get the \nmost bang for their buck and opposing wasteful Federal spending. I \ndon't think anyone can argue that supporting American jobs is \n``wasteful.'' We owe it to American manufacturers and their employees \nto make sure they get a fair shake. I would not support awarding a \ncontract to an American company that is price gouging, but we should \nmake every effort to ensure that domestic sources for goods needed by \nthe Federal Government do not dry up because American companies have \nbeen slightly underbid by foreign competitors.\n  The Buy American Act also includes a waiver for goods bought by the \nFederal Government that will be used outside of the United States. \nThere is no question that there are occasions when the Federal \nGovernment needs to procure items quickly for use outside the United \nStates. However, there may be items that are bought on a regular basis \nand used at foreign military bases or United States embassies, for \nexample, that could reasonably be procured from domestic sources and \nshipped to the location where they will be used. My bill would require \nFederal agencies to compare the difference in cost for obtaining \narticles that are used on a regular basis outside the U.S., or that are \nnot needed immediately, between an overseas versus a domestic source--\nincluding the cost of shipping--before awarding the contract to the \ncompany that will do the work overseas.\n  The Buy American Act's domestic source requirements may also be \nwaived if the articles to be procured are not available from domestic \nsources ``in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities \nand of\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\na satisfactory quality.'' My bill would require that an agency or \ndepartment head, prior to issuing such as waiver, determine whether \ndomestic production can be initiated to meet the procurement needs and \nwhether a comparable article, material, or supply is available \ndomestically.\n\n  My bill would also strengthen the Buy American Act in four other \nways. It would, for the first time, make the Buy American requirement \napplicable to the United States Congress. The current definition of a \nFederal agency in the Act specifically exempts the Senate, the House, \nand the Architect of the Capitol, and activities under the direction of \nthe Architect. I believe that Congress should lead by example and \ncomply with the Buy American Act, a requirement that we have imposed on \nexecutive agencies.\n  Secondly, my bill would increase the minimum American content \nstandard for qualification under the Act from the current 50 percent to \n75 percent. The definition of what qualifies as an American-made \nproduct has been a source of much debate. To me, it seems clear that \n``American-made'' means manufactured in this country. This \nclassification is a source of pride for manufacturing workers around \nour country. The current 50 percent standard should be raised to a \nminimum of 75 percent.\n  In addition, my bill would put in place for the next five years the \nexpanded reporting requirement that I authored which was first enacted \nas part of the fiscal year 2004 omnibus spending bill and was included \nagain by this body as an amendment to the recent minimum wage bill. \nPrior to the enactment of these provisions, only the Department of \nDefense was required to report to Congress on its use of Buy American \nwaivers and purchases of foreign goods. It is virtually impossible to \nget hard numbers on the Federal Government's purchases of foreign--and \ndomestic--made goods and to ensure that there is disclosure and \naccountability in the waiver process. This reporting requirement seeks \nto hold agencies accountable by requiring agencies to report on their \nforeign-made purchases and make that information available to Congress \nand the American public.\n  The annual report to be submitted by agency heads will be required to \ninclude the following information: the dollar value of any items \npurchased that were manufactured outside of the United States; an \nitemized list of all applicable waivers granted with respect to such \nitems under the Buy American Act, including the type of waiver used; \nand a summary of the total procurement funds spent by the Federal \nagency on goods manufactured in the United States versus on goods \nmanufactured overseas. In addition, my bill also requires that the \nheads of all Federal agencies make these annual reports publicly \navailable on the Internet.\n  Finally, my bill would require the Government Accountability Office \nto report to Congress with recommendations for defining the terms \n``inconsistent with the public interest'' and ``unreasonable cost'' for \npurposes of invoking the corresponding waivers in the Act. I am \nconcerned that both of these terms lack definitions, and that they can \nbe very broadly interpreted by agency or department heads. GAO would be \nrequired to make recommendations for statutory definitions of both of \nthese terms, as well as for establishing a consistent waiver process \nthat can be used by all Federal agencies.\n  The gaping loopholes in the Buy American Act and the trade agreements \nand defense procurement agreements that contain additional waivers of \ndomestic source restrictions have combined to weaken our domestic \nmanufacturing base by allowing--and sometimes actually encouraging--the \nFederal Government to buy foreign-made goods. Congress can and should \ndo more to support American companies and American workers. We must \nstrengthen the Buy American Act and we must stop entering into bad \ntrade agreements that send our jobs overseas and undermine our own \ndomestic preference laws.\n  By strengthening Federal procurement policy, we can help to bolster \nour domestic manufacturers during these difficult times. As I have \nrepeatedly noted, Congress cannot simply stand on the sidelines while \ntens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs have been and continue \nto be shipped overseas. While there may be no single solution to this \nproblem one way in which Congress should act is by strengthening the \nBuy American Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senator Rockefeller and I are \nintroducing the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2007. This legislation \nwould reduce the tremendous economic and human losses that fire \ninflicts on the National economy and the quality of life.\n  In 2005, fire departments responded to about 1.6 million fires. These \nfires resulted in about 3,500 deaths and almost 18,000 civilian \ninjuries. Fire also caused over $10 billion in direct property damages \nin 2005.\n  Fire sprinklers can dramatically decrease loss of life and injury as \na result of fires. The National Fire Protection Association has no \nrecord of a fire killing more than two people in a completely \nsprinklered public assembly, educational, institutional, or residential \nbuilding where the system was properly installed and fully operational. \nFire sprinklers also mitigate economic losses resulting from fires. \nFire sprinklers are responsible for a 70-percent reduction in property \ndamage from fires in public assembly, educational, residential, \ncommercial, industrial, and manufacturing buildings.\n  The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act will provide an incentive for \nbusinesses to protect their buildings with fire sprinklers. Under \ncurrent law, the cost of retrofitting an existing building with \nautomatic fire sprinklers generally would be depreciated over a 39-year \nperiod. Our legislation would reduce the depreciation period to 5 \nyears, greatly reducing the economic burden of retrofitting a building.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleague Mr. \nSmith in the introduction of the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act. Two \nyears ago, we first introduced this legislation to help provide \nbusinesses with an important tax incentive to install lifesaving \nsprinkler systems, believing that the legislation would be one way to \nkeep our Nation's citizens, and the firefighters who dedicate their \nlives to fire safety, free from unnecessary fire-related injury. At \nthat time, I could not imagine that in 2007 West Virginia would suffer \none of the worst fire-related tragedies in many years. In January of \nthis year, a fire at the Emmons Junior Apartment Building in \nHuntington, WV, took the lives of nine individuals, including three \nteenagers\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nwho were all siblings and another unrelated child who was only seven \nyears old. My heart goes out to those families and to a devastated \ncommunity. We later learned that the complex was built in 1924 and was \nnot equipped with a sprinkler system. I cannot help thinking that if \nthe tax incentives provided by this legislation were already in effect, \nmany businesses including those operating apartment complexes might \nhave had enough financial incentive to allow them to make the decision \nto install life-saving sprinkler systems.\n  Fire safety is a national problem. The National Fire Protection \nAssociation (NFPA) indicates that in 2005 there were over 1.6 million \nfires reported in the United States, which caused 3,675 civilian \ndeaths, 17,925 civilian injuries, and $10.7 billion in property damage. \nAs a result, 80,100 firefighters were injured and another 87 died \nresponding to these fires in an effort to protect the lives of their \nfellow citizens. High-rise buildings and other living facilities that \nwere built under older codes often lack adequate fire safety protection \nand leave vulnerable those citizens who cannot as easily save \nthemselves from a fire, such as older adults, young children, and \npeople with disabilities. There were 511,000 structure fires in 2005, \nand 381,000 of those occurred in family home structures including \ndwellings, duplexes, manufactured homes, apartments, townhouses, \nrowhouses, and condominiums. These home structure fires accounted for \n82 percent of civilian fire-related fatalities and $6.7 billion in \ndirect property damage.\n  Protecting our citizens and first-responders from these fire-related \ninjuries and fatalities is of the utmost importance, and a real way to \nimprove fire safety exists in the use of automatic sprinkler systems. \nThese devices react quickly and save lives by dramatically reducing the \nheat, flames and smoke produced in a fire. The NFPA reports that when \nsprinklers are present, the chances of dying in a fire are reduced by \nbetween 50 and 75 percent and average property loss is cut by one-half \nto two-thirds. The NFPA also has no record of a fire killing more than \ntwo people in a building where a sprinkler system was properly \ninstalled and fully operational.\n  The benefits of fire sprinkler systems are overwhelming, even for \nbusiness owners, but one thing that inhibits their implementation is \ncost. Under current law, installations in residential rental property \nand non-residential real property must be deducted over a 27.5- or 39-\nyear period, respectively. The financial cost of upgrading existing \nstructures with fire safety measures is prohibitive for most property \nowners, and under our present straight-line method of depreciation, \nthere is disincentive for building safety improvements due to an \nextremely low rate of return on investment. This legislation, by \namending the internal revenue code to classify automatic fire sprinkler \nsystems as depreciable over a 5-year period, would mitigate the expense \nof retrofitting older buildings with costly automated sprinkler \nsystems. It helps businesses make the choice to take advantage of fire \nsafety systems that have been proven to have life-saving results.\n  I again express my support for the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act as a \nway to promote the use of fire sprinkler systems that are now an \ninvaluable asset in our efforts to protect citizens and firefighters \nfrom fire-related death and injury. This proposal has been endorsed by \nfirefighters, the insurance industry, and general contractors, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 583. A bill to create a competitive grant program for States to \nenable the States to award salary bonuses to highly qualified \nelementary school or secondary school teachers who teach, or commit to \nteach, for at least 3 academic years in a school served by a rural \nlocal educational agency; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, the second piece of legislation I am \nintroducing has to do with education. We know rural school districts \nhave a very hard time in terms of retaining teachers. The national \nteacher turnover rate across the country is about 15 percent, but in \nrural districts it is as high as 30 to 40 percent. Thirty to forty \npercent of teachers in rural school districts are turning over.\n  So what I hope to do with the Colorado Teacher Retention Act is to \nhelp with a competitive State program that would allow rural school \ndistricts to provide bonuses for highly qualified teachers who commit \nto teaching in rural schools for at least 3 years. It would simply \nprovide an opportunity for rural schools to have the kind of excellence \nin teaching they so deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 586. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to promote positive health behaviors in women and children; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today, \nentitled the ``Community Health Workers Act of 2007,'' would improve \naccess to health education and outreach services to women and children \nin medically underserved areas, including the U.S. border region along \nNew Mexico.\n  Lack of access to adequate health care and health education is a \nsignificant problem on the southern New Mexico border. While the access \nproblem is in part due to a lack of insurance, it is also attributable \nto non-financial barriers to access. These barriers include a shortage \nof physicians and other health professionals, and hospitals; inadequate \ntransportation; a shortage of bilingual health information and health \nproviders; and culturally insensitive systems of care.\n  This legislation would help to address the issue of access by \nproviding $15 million per year for a three year period in grants to \nState, local, and tribal organizations, including community health \ncenters and public health departments, for the purpose of hiring \ncommunity health workers to provide health education, outreach, and \nreferrals to women and families who otherwise would have little or no \ncontact with health care services.\n  Recognizing factors such as poverty and language and cultural \ndifferences that often serve as barriers to health care access in \nmedically underserved populations, community health workers are in a \nunique position to improve health outcomes and quality of care for \ngroups that have traditionally lacked access to adequate services. They \noften serve as ``community specialists'' and are members of the \ncommunities in which they work. As such they can effectively serve \nhard-to-reach populations.\n  A shining example of how community health workers serve their \ncommunities, a group of so-called ``Promotoras'' in Dona Ana County \nwere quickly mobilized during a recent flood emergency in rural New \nMexico. These community health workers assisted in the disaster \nrecovery efforts by partnering with FEMA to find, inform and register \nflood victims for Federal disaster assistance. Their personal networks \nand knowledge of the local culture, language, needs, assets, and \nbarriers greatly enhanced FEMA's community outreach efforts. The \nPromotoras of Dona Ana County demonstrate the important role community \nhealth workers could play in communities across the nation, including \nincreasing the effectiveness of new initiatives in homeland security \nand emergency preparedness, and in implementing risk communication \nstrategies.\n  The positive benefits of the community health worker model also have \nbeen documented in research studies. Research has shown that community \nhealth workers have been effective in increasing the utilization of \nhealth preventive services such as cancer screenings and medical follow \nup for elevated blood pressure and improving enrollment in publicly \nfunded health insurance programs. In the case of uninsured children, a \nstudy by Dr. Glenn Flores, ``Community-Based Case Management in \nInsuring Uninsured Latino Children,'' published in the December 2005 \nissue of Pediatrics found that uninsured children who received \ncommunity-based case management were eight times more likely to obtain \nhealth insurance coverage than other children involved in the study \nbecause case workers were employed to address typical barriers to \naccess, including insufficient knowledge about application processes \nand eligibility criteria, language barriers and family mobility\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nissues, among others. This study confirms that community health workers \ncould be highly effective in reducing the numbers of uninsured \nchildren, especially those who are at greatest risk for being \nuninsured. Preliminary investigation of a community health workers \nproject in New Mexico similarly suggests that community health workers \ncould be useful in improving enrollment in Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or ``SCHIP.''\n  According to a 2003 Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, \n``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in \nHealthcare,'' community health workers offer promise as a community-\nbased resource to increase racial and ethnic minorities' access to \nhealth care and to serve as a liaison between healthcare providers and \nthe communities they serve.\n  Although the community health worker model is valued in the New \nMexico border region as well as other parts of the country that \nencounter challenges of meeting the health care needs of medically \nunderserved populations, these programs often have difficulty securing \nadequate financial resources to maintain and expand upon their \nservices. As a result, many of these programs are significantly limited \nin their ability to meet the ongoing and emerging health demands of \ntheir communities.\n  The 10M report also noted that ``programs to support the use of \ncommunity health workers . . . especially among medically underserved \nand racial and ethnic minority populations, should be expanded, \nevaluated, and replicated.''\n  I am introducing this legislation to increase resources for a model \nthat has shown significant promise for increasing access to quality \nhealth care and health education for families in medically underserved \ncommunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Over 60 percent of American Indian women \n     are classified as obese.\n       (6) American Indian women have the highest mortality rates \n     related to alcohol and drug use of all women in the United \n     States.\n       (7) High poverty rates coupled with barriers to health \n     preventive services and medical care contribute to racial and \n     ethnic disparities in health factors, including premature \n     death, life expectancy, risk factors associated with major \n     diseases, and the extent and severity of illnesses.\n       (8) There is increasing evidence that early life \n     experiences are associated with adult chronic disease and \n     that prevention and intervention services provided within the \n     community and the home may lessen the impact of chronic \n     outcomes, while strengthening families and communities.\n       (9) Community health workers, who are primarily women, can \n     be a critical component in conducting health promotion and \n     disease prevention efforts in medically underserved \n     populations.\n       (10) Recognizing the difficult barriers confronting \n     medically underserved communities (poverty, geographic \n     isolation, language and cultural differences, lack of \n     transportation, low literacy, and lack of access to \n     services), community health workers are in a unique position \n     to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality, improve the \n     quality of life, and increase the utilization of available \n     preventive health services for community members.\n       (11) Research has shown that community health workers have \n     been effective in significantly increasing health insurance \n     coverage, screening and medical follow-up visits among \n     residents with limited access or underutilization of health \n     care services.\n       (12) States on the United States-Mexico border have high \n     percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations: \n     border States accommodate 60 percent of the total Hispanic \n     population and 23 percent of the total population below 200 \n     percent poverty in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the Medicare caps on graduate medical education positions for \nStates with a shortage of residents; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as we introduce the \nResident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2007. The bill would \nenhance America's health care infrastructure by expanding the number of \nMedicare-supported physician residency training positions in States \nwith a shortage of residents.\n  Over the past several years, a number of studies have concluded that \nthis country is facing, or soon will face, physician shortages. The \nCouncil on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) and the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges (AAMC) recently issued reports, which \nconcluded that our Nation will likely lack an adequate number of \nphysicians to meet patient demand by the year 2020.\n  By expanding the number of Medicare-supported physician residency \ntraining positions in our Nation's teaching hospitals, we can help \nstabilize America's health care infrastructure and alleviate physician \nshortages. Unfortunately, in 1997, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) \n``capped'' the number of residents that each teaching hospital could \nclaim for Medicare payment purposes. In general, Medicare does not \nreimburse hospitals for residents they train that are above the capped \nnumber of residency slots.\n  There are no exceptions that allow hospitals to permanently adjust \ntheir caps. For example, the cap on physician training positions does \nnot adjust for population growth. In many States, including Florida, \npopulations continue to grow both in size and age and physician \nshortages are occurring or soon will occur. Ten years ago, Florida's \nratio of physicians to population was above the national average. \nToday, Florida is among the States seeing the slowest growth in \nphysician supply. A major reason for the slow growth in Florida is the \nlack of physician residents.\n  A recent study by the AAMC ranks Florida 44th among States with \nfederally funded medical residency positions, with 16 residents per \n100,000 people. This problem will worsen over time because Florida's \npopulation continues to grow and Federal funding for graduate medical \neducation slots has been capped and cannot grow to reflect the need.\n  Because physicians tend to remain in the region where they complete \ntheir medical training, increasing the number of residency cap \npositions in States with a shortage will help to ensure an adequate \nphysician workforce. According to a study by the AAMC, 47 percent of \nphysicians are practicing in the State in which they did their \ntraining. Florida's record of retention is even better than the \nnational average. The same study shows that approximately 60 percent of \nphysicians who trained in Florida stay in Florida to practice medicine \nafter their residency.\n  Today we are introducing the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction \nAct of 2007 to enhance America's health care infrastructure by \nexpanding the number of resident physician training positions in States \nwith a shortage of resident physicians. Specifically, the bill \nauthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase \nthe cap on the number of Medicare-supported residency training \npositions at teaching hospitals in States where there are shortages of \nresident physicians. A State is considered to have a shortage of \nresident physicians if its ratio of resident physicians per 100,000 \npopulation is below the national median level. Under our bill, teaching \nhospitals in approximately 24 States would be eligible for increases in \ntheir resident caps.\n  We believe this legislation is a critical first step towards ensuring \nan adequate supply of physicians in our health care system. We urge all \nof our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, to join us in this \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Resident Physician Shortage \n     Reduction Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASING THE MEDICARE CAPS ON GRADUATE MEDICAL \n                   EDUCATION POSITIONS FOR STATES WITH A SHORTAGE \n                   OF RESIDENTS.\n\n       (a) Direct Graduate Medical Education.--Section \n     1886(h)(4)(F) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(h)(4)(F)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by inserting ``clause (iii) and'' after \n     ``subject to''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:\n       ``(iii) Increase in caps on graduate medical education \n     positions for states with a shortage of residents.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--For cost reporting periods beginning on \n     or after the date that is 16 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of \n     2007, the Secretary shall increase the otherwise applicable \n     limit on the total number of full-time equivalent residents \n     in the field of allopathic or osteopathic medicine determined \n     under clause (i) with respect to a qualifying hospital in an \n     eligible State by an amount determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary. Such increase shall be phased-in over\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n     a period of 5 cost reporting periods beginning with the first \n     cost reporting period in which the increase is applied under \n     the previous sentence to the hospital. For each eligible \n     State the aggregate number of such increases shall be--\n\n       ``(aa) not less than 15; and\n       ``(bb) not greater than the State resident cap increase.\n\n       ``(II) Qualifying hospital.--In this clause, the term \n     `qualifying hospital' means a hospital located in an eligible \n     State that the Secretary determines should receive an \n     increase under this clause in the otherwise applicable limit \n     on the total number of full-time equivalent residents in the \n     field of allopathic or osteopathic medicine.\n       ``(III) Eligible state.--In this clause, the term `eligible \n     State' means a State for which the National median medical \n     resident ratio exceeds the State medical resident ratio.\n       ``(IV) State resident cap increase.--In this clause, the \n     term `State resident cap increase' means, with respect to a \n     State, \\1/4\\ of the product of--\n\n       ``(aa) the difference between the National median medical \n     resident ratio and the State medical resident ratio; and\n       ``(bb) the State population (as determined for purposes of \n     subclause (VI)).\n\n       ``(V) National median medical resident ratio.--In this \n     clause, the term `National median medical resident ratio' \n     means the median of all State medical resident ratios.\n       ``(VI) State medical resident ratio.--In this clause, the \n     term `State medical resident ratio' means, with respect to \n     any State, the ratio of full-time equivalent residents in the \n     State in approved medical residency training programs as of \n     the date of enactment of the Resident Physician Shortage \n     Reduction Act of 2007 to the population of the State as of \n     such date, as determined by the Secretary.\n       ``(VII) State.--In this clause, the term `State' means a \n     State and the District of Columbia.\n       ``(VIII) Considerations in determining resident cap \n     increases.--In determining whether a hospital is a qualifying \n     hospital, and how much of an increase in the resident cap a \n     qualifying hospital shall receive under subclause (I), the \n     Secretary shall take into consideration the demonstrated \n     likelihood of the hospital filling resident positions that \n     would be made available as a result of such increase within \n     the first 3 cost reporting periods beginning on or after the \n     date that is 16 months after the date of enactment of the \n     Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2007.

Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today dealing with \nresident physician shortages. This bill will expand the number of \nMedicare-supported physician residency training positions in States all \nover the country which face a shortage of doctors.\n  This legislation is important because we know that the cities where \ndoctors are trained are often the cities where they stay. For example, \nNevada currently has 199 physicians in training and will be eligible \nfor an additional 93 positions under this bill.\n  As Nevada continues to grow, so do our health needs. The two bills I \nam introducing today will help ensure communities across Nevada that \nthey have the doctors they need and the quality of care they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 589. A bill to provide for the transfer of certain Federal \nproperty to the United States Paralympics, Incorporated, a subsidiary \nof the United States Olympic Committee; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation in support of America's Paralympic programs.\n  The Paralympics are an important facet of our modern Olympic \ntradition and serve as an integral part of the rehabilitation of the \nmind, body, and soul. Training programs provided by Paralympic \norganizations enable disabled athletes to overcome obstacles on and off \nthe field. Through training, performance, and competition, these \nathletes regain independence and renew their spirit.\n  The roots of the Paralympic movement originally stem from disabled \nveteran's returning from war. After World War II, British soldiers \nbegan participating in Paralympic games. These games provided a way for \ndisabled soldiers to compete competitively in athletics. This practice \nquickly spread to the United States, and this country is now leading \nthe way in advancing the movement. Today thousands of athletes with \nphysical disabilities compete internationally, proudly representing \ntheir countries.\n  Tremendous advancements in modern medicine and the adaptation of \nathletic equipment have allowed Para-lympic athletes to physically \ncompete in a variety of sports and live the Olympic dream. By \ncontinuing to support the development of the Para-lympic movement at \nall levels, as this bill does, we are able to take advantage of these \nnumerous scientific and medical advancements to truly improve quality \nof life for our wounded veterans.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to facilitate the transfer of \nunused Federal property in Colorado Springs, CO, to the United States \nOlympic Committee and specifically Paralympics Incorporated. The \ntransfer of this property allows the current United States Olympic \nCommittee complex in Colorado Springs to expand and provides the U.S. \nParalympic Team with further room to grow their programs.\n  To a large degree, this expansion will afford greater opportunities \nto Para-lympics athletes, especially our Nation's military veterans.\n  Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak region are unique. Home to a \nrobust veteran's population, this region also serves as the national \nheadquarters of the Unites States Olympic Committee. This makes the \narea a natural fit for championing and advancing the Paralympic \nmovement.\n  Proponents for the disabled estimate that approximately 10 percent of \nthe more than 500-person U.S. team to the Paralympics in 2012 will be \ncomprised of veteran's of the global war on terrorism. This is a \ntremendous increase considering there were no war veterans \nparticipating in either the 2004 or 2006 games.\n  Providing for the transfer of this property will give the United \nStates Olympic Commitee the necessary facilities to work with local and \nnational veteran's service organizations, the Department of Defense, as \nwell as the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to allow for \ngreater opportunities for disabled veterans to participate in the \nParalympics, particularly those returning home from war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I am not alone. National and local organizations recognize the \nimportance of these programs and vocally support my efforts, including: \nthe Colorado American Legion, the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Sports Center for the Disabled, and the Pikes Peak Chapter \nof Military Officers Association of America.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in cheering on the Olympic spirit that \nlives in all of us by supporting our Nation's disabled veterans and \nPara-lympic athletes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The Chamber,\n\n                          Colorado Springs, CO, February 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: We are writing to express our strong \n     support of your efforts to transfer the Federal Building at \n     1520 East Willamette in Colorado Springs to the United State \n     Paralympic Committee.\n       As you know, The Greater Colorado Springs Chamber of \n     Commerce has an active and steadfast relationship with the \n     United States Olympic Committee. In addition, our membership \n     provides a strong support system to our military in the \n     region. We are most impressed with the USOC's Paralympics \n     Organization that provides such a valuable initiative to our \n     injured soldiers coming back from serving and protecting our \n     country.\n       The stature and pride associated with The United States \n     Olympic Committee's presence in the Colorado Springs area has \n     always been an important part of our cultural and economic \n     significance. Combining that with the mission of helping our \n     soldiers recover and succeed in the Paralympics venue would \n     be another critical investment in our people and our region.\n       We wholly and enthusiastically support your efforts to add \n     to our nation's viability in the Paralympics movement and to \n     increase our region's prominence in that movement. Thank you \n     for your vigorous dedication in moving this effort forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Will Temby,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                            National Sports Center\n\n\n                                             For the Disabled,\n\n                                                 January 24, 2007.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: On behalf of the National Sports \n     Center for the Disabled of Winter Park, Colorado, I would \n     like to thank you for introducing legislation to transfer \n     Federal property to the United States Paralympics, Inc. and \n     the United States Olympic Committee. This property will \n     significantly add to the U.S. Paralympics' ongoing efforts to \n     provide sport programs for individuals with disabilities.\n       In recent years, the number of young men and women with \n     newly acquired disabilities from military service has \n     increased considerably. Learning to live with a disability is \n     an experience that many find difficult. Recognizing that \n     physical activity can play a tremendous role in encouraging \n     healthy and independent lives, the U.S. Paralympics has made \n     remarkable efforts to provide sport programs for such \n     individuals. As chief executive officer for the National \n     Sport Center for the Disabled, I have witnessed firsthand the \n     benefits of physical activity on the lives of the disabled. \n     It is clear that sport programs have tremendous therapeutic \n     value and encourage healthy, independent lives.\n       As military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan continue, \n     the need for such programs is greater than ever. This \n     property in Colorado Springs, Colorado will greatly enhance \n     the U.S. Paralympics' ability to continue sport training \n     programs for our soldiers with newly acquired disabilities as \n     they return home and begin the rehabilitation process.\n       I ardently support your legislation to transfer Federal \n     property to the U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. Paralympics \n     for sport programs for the disabled, and I thank you for \n     recognizing this need as so many active duty and retired \n     military personnel begin to adjust to life with a disability.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Pollitt, President/Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Pikes Peak Chapter,\n\n\n                          Military Officers Assoc. of America,\n\n                           Colorado Springs, CO, January 24, 2007.\n     U.S. Olympic Committee,\n     Olympic Plaza,\n     Colorado Springs, CO.\n       Dear U.S. Olympic Committee: The members of the Pikes Peak \n     Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America would \n     like to express our strongest support for your efforts to \n     transfer the Federal Property near the U.S. Olympic Training \n     Center to your Olympic Committee. Understanding that U.S. \n     Olympic Committee will use this property in the training of \n     United States Paralympics, we see this as a wonderful \n     opportunity to help athletes with physical disabilities. As \n     many veterans take part in this training and competition and \n     it adds so much to their lives, we strongly urge the Olympic \n     Committee to pursue the acquisition of this property for the \n     Paralympics.\n       Feel free to contact me at 719-590-9522 for further \n     details.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Thomas M.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe investment tax credit with respect to solar energy property and \nqualified fuel cell property, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nspur investment in and deployment of fuel cells and solar energy \nsystems. I am joined today by my colleague, Senator Salazar, and eleven \nother Senators in introducing this important bill to encourage the \ndevelopment if these clean energy facilities.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created new commercial and residential \ninvestment tax credits that have helped stimulate market growth for \nthese innovative technologies. Those tax credits, which were extended \nin 2006, are set to expire at the end of 2008. However, in order to \ndrive down future production costs and encourage the development of \nthese facilities, this bill provides for an eight-year extension of the \ninvestment tax credits for solar and fuel cell facilities. It also \nprovides for the accelerated depreciation of commercial solar and fuel \ncell projects.\n  The long-term extension is needed within these industries because \nthese emerging energy technologies have longer planning horizons than \ntraditional power plants. A long-term extension will also help \ndevelopers secure the financing for these facilities.\n  There are numerous benefits of extending these investment tax \ncredits. It is estimated that an eight-year extension of the tax \ncredits will displace over 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and \nsave consumers over $32 billion. An estimated 70,000 new jobs will be \ncreated in the solar and fuel cell industries and over $50 billion in \neconomic investment will be made in these industries. In addition, \ndistributed generation facilities can serve remote sites and help \naddress transmission congestion issues.\n  Home-grown energy technologies and sources help reduce our dependence \non foreign sources of energy. Moreover, both solar equipment and fuel \ncells provide zero emissions energy. I would urge my colleagues to join \nus in providing America's entrepreneurs and households with these \nimportant tax incentives. Together, we can reduce our dependence on \nfossil fuels and restore our nation's leading role in these important \nindustries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 591. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to adjust for \ninflation the allowable amounts of financial resources of eligible \nhouseholds and to exclude from countable financial resources certain \nretirement and education accounts; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Food \nStamp Savings and Investment Act of 2007, a bill that would improve the \nfood stamp program which is administered by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. For fiscal year 2005, the food stamp program touched an \naverage of over 25 million people in this country every month.\n  Our nutrition assistance programs, anchored by the food stamp \nprogram, play a key role in ensuring that needy Americans have access \nto the food they need to lead healthy, productive lives. I know from \nthe school teachers in my family the importance of good nutrition, \nespecially for our children's development. Moreover, the food for \nnutrition programs comes from U.S. farmers which helps agriculture. \nFinally, food assistance programs are an important part of this \ncountry's safety net. Not long ago, the Nation witnessed the food stamp \nprogram's effective emergency response to evacuees from hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. The U.S. food assistance programs are good for \nfamilies, good for farmers and good for America.\n  The food stamp program not only helps by providing food and emergency \naid, it helps America's needy families on their path to independence \nand self-sufficiency. The goals of the 1996 welfare reform were spelled \nout in the title, to increase ``personal responsibility and work \nopportunity.'' In essence, Congress asked our nation's families on \nwelfare to take personal responsibility for themselves and join the \nworkforce, and many of those families did. In the ten years since \nwelfare reform was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton, \nfewer families receive cash welfare, and more welfare families are \nworking. According to the Congressional Research Service, from 1996 to \n2005, the number of food stamp households with children who received \ncash welfare payments decreased by 57 percent, and the number who \nreported earned income increased 41 percent. Many families have \ntransitioned from welfare to work, and the Food Stamp program should do \nmore to encourage this continuing transition.\n  States have done a great job addressing food stamp error rates. From \nfiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005, while average monthly \nparticipation increased to a near historical high of almost 26 million \npeople, the combined error rates of over payments and under payments \nfell 34 percent to a historical low of 5.84 percent.\n  In the 2002 farm bill, Congress gave States many options to \nadminister the food stamp program easier. Most States have taken \nadvantage of these options and the program serves both taxpayers and \nrecipients better today than in the past. However, there is room to \nimprove. For many working families with low income, there are some \naspects of the food stamp program that may reduce their ability to \nescape the cycle of poverty. For example, food stamp asset rules \nconflict\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nwith families' ability to save for their future. The asset limit of \n$2,000 for liquid assets for most food stamp recipients has not changed \nfor more than 20 years. When indexed for inflation, the asset limit \nwould be almost $4,000 today. This bill would index the asset limit to \ninflation. A higher asset limit should help families build up savings \nin order to achieve financial independence and prepare for a rainy day \nor get an education and eventually end their need to receive food \nstamps.\n  In addition, food stamp rules discourage working families from \nutilizing all the financial investment tools encouraged by the tax code \nfor working Americans. This bill would exempt savings plans for \nretirement and education from being counted toward the asset when \ndetermining eligibility, provisions included in the Bush \nAdministration's farm bill proposal.\n  The core ideas underlying this bill enjoy broad support across the \npolitical spectrum. Examples of organizations that have voiced support \nfor reforming asset limits in order to encourage savings include: The \nHeritage Foundation; the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; the \nNew America Foundation; the Corporation for Enterprise Development; \nand, the Center for Law and Social Policy.\n  Reforming food stamp asset limits has the potential to help needy \nfamilies break the cycle of poverty and achieve long-term financial \nindependence. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, as a cosponsor of \nlegislation to provide some needed improvements to the Food Stamp \nProgram's eligibility rules.\n  Senator Chambliss' legislation, the Food Stamp Personal Savings and \nInvestment Act of 2007, would exempt retirement accounts and \neducational savings accounts from the current asset limits test in the \nFood Stamp Program. Additionally, this bill would index the current \nasset limit to inflation.\n  For most households, the current asset limit in the Food Stamp \nProgram is $2000; $3000 for households with an elderly individual or an \nindividual with a disability. This limit has not been raised in over 20 \nyears, making it inconsistent with the economic challenges faced by \ntoday's low-income working families in America.\n  In addition, current Food Stamp Program resources rules are \ninconsistent. Many types of retirement accounts and all educational \nsavings accounts are counted against the asset limit, meaning that a \nworking mother who has recently become unemployed but managed to save \n$2500 for her daughter's college education is actually ineligible for \nfood stamps. This forces otherwise eligible households to have to \nchoose between liquidating such savings, which in many cases are also \nsubject to a financial penalty, or going without needed food \nassistance.\n  It is clear that current Food Stamp Program rules actually discourage \npeople from planning responsibly for their futures and deny them a \nhelping hand at a time when they need it most. It makes no sense for \nthe government to force families that are suffering through periods of \nunemployment to spend down the savings which represent their only \nsource of security in times of hardship. In essence we require people \nto trade-off their minimal savings for meager food stamp benefits that \nequal an average of one dollar per meal per person.\n  If our true goal is to provide low-income families with a hand up--to \nhelp make a better life for themselves and their children--then we must \nenact policies that actually encourage them to build the resources that \nare necessary to get out of poverty and remove the barriers to saving \nthat exist in current law. Exempting retirement and educational savings \naccounts from the Food Stamp Program's asset limits test will help do \nthat.\n  Similarly, adjusting the current asset limit so that it rises with \ninflation will provide a more reasonable, less-restrictive threshold \nthat, though modest, will at least prevent further erosion in the \ncurrent asset limits. I'm hopeful that we can do more than just \nindexing the current limit, which is too restrictive. I hope that we \ncan first increase the asset limits and then index them annually to \ninflation. But Senator Chambliss' bill is a good start, and I commend \nhim for seeking to address this problem.\n  Taken together, these are common sense changes that are needed \nthroughout our federal anti-poverty programs to allow low-income \nAmericans who are currently discouraged from saving to invest in their \nfutures. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry obviously \nhas no jurisdiction over other anti-poverty programs, but we can start \nby removing the unrealistic and damaging limits that currently exist \nwithin the Food Stamp Program.\n  I should also make clear that this is not the only change needed to \nimprove upon the Food Stamp Program. We clearly must do more to help \nthose who suffer from food insecurity in this country, and there are a \nnumber of other improvements that we should make to our federal food \nassistance programs to help low-income families put food on their \ntables.\n  This legislation is a good start to the larger objective of \nsimplifying and strengthening our food assistance programs to make them \nmore responsive and relevant to helping meet the needs of today's low-\nincome American families. I commend Senator Chambliss for introducing \nthis bill, am happy to cosponsor it and look forward to continuing to \nwork with him to promote economic and food security and stability for \nlow-income Americans and families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 592. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a manufacturer's jobs credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe ``Growing Our Manufacturing Employment Act, or ``GoME,'' which is \naimed at reinvigorating the manufacturing sector, boosting the level of \ndomestic manufacturing, and preventing the further loss of \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Few issues are as important to the American people than the \navailability of good jobs in their communities. Manufacturing jobs have \nlong provided quality employment for generations of Americans. But in \nrecent years, employment in the manufacturing sector has dropped, and \nover 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since the year 2000.\n  Few States have been hit harder by the loss of manufacturing jobs \nthan my home State of Maine. According to the National Association of \nManufacturers, Maine has lost 22,000 manufacturing jobs--nearly 28 \npercent of our total--since the beginning of this decade. These jobs \nonce provided lifelong employment to Mainers in towns like Millinocket, \nWilton, Waterville, Fort Kent, Dexter, Westbrook, and Sanford. Here is \nbut one example of the tragic results of this ongoing trend, from my \nhome State of Maine: For 60 years, Moosehead Manufacturing produced \nfurniture of the highest quality--beautiful designs and quality \nmaterials combined with expert craftsmanship. Last week, Moosehead \nclosed its doors. More than 120 skilled workers have lost their jobs. A \ntraditional Maine business, built from the ground up by a Maine family, \nis gone.\n  Why are American manufacturing jobs disappearing? Three years ago, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers released a study showing that \nAmerican manufacturers face ``structural costs'' that makes it 22 \npercent more expensive to manufacture goods here than overseas. Last \nfall, NAM updated this study, and found that these costs are \nescalating, with American manufacturers now facing a cost differential \n31 percent higher than our nine leading trading partners.\n  While it would surprise no one that U.S. manufacturers face a higher \ncost-of-doing business than manufacturers in countries like China and \nMexico, it would be a mistake to assume that wage rates alone explain \nthis difference. They do not. In fact, the productivity of American \nworkers is unrivaled, allowing American workers to receive more value, \nin wages, for the goods they produce. As the original NAM study states, \nif wages were the only factor, then ``U.S. manufacturers would be much \nmore dominant . . . in the global markets than the current trade \nsituation suggests.''\n  It is other ``structural costs'' that make it more expensive to \nmanufacture goods in the U.S. relative to the\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\ncost elsewhere. Indeed, the NAM study shows that most of the \n``structural costs'' facing American manufacturers are higher than \nthose facing manufacturers in industrialized nations like Japan, \nGermany, and France. This fact illustrates the critical impact these \nhigh ``structural costs'' have on our ability to compete.\n  In essence, these costs have the same effect as imposing a 31 percent \nadditional tax on making goods here rather than overseas. To stay in \nbusiness, American manufacturers must somehow do more with less, move \noperations overseas, or get out of manufacturing altogether. The end \nresult is fewer jobs, a weaker economy, and a manufacturing sector in \ncrisis.\n  I believe a healthy manufacturing base is essential to our Nation's \nfuture. Not only is manufacturing a key source of skilled, high-paying \njobs, but also it is crucial to our economic and national security that \nwe have the ability to manufacture the goods we need right here in this \ncountry. For all these reasons, I am proposing the ``Growing Our \nManufacturing Employment Act.''\n  This bill would help to lessen the 31 percent cost differential that \nAmerican manufacturers face by providing a variety of tax incentives. \nFor example, a jobs tax credit would be provided to manufacturers that \nemploy displaced workers who are receiving benefits under the Trade \nAdjustment Act, as well as those who are receiving benefits under the \nAlternative TAA program. That would help get those workers back to \nwork. In Maine alone over 4,700 workers have been deemed eligible for \nbenefits under TAA since November of 2002, and nationally, the number \nis nearly 600,000.\n  The jobs credit I am proposing in this bill would only be available \nto manufacturers that increase their employment level. The availability \nof this credit would provide a powerful incentive to hire workers who \nare receiving benefits because they are displaced.\n  This bill is designed to ensure that only companies that are helping \nto build America's manufacturing base obtain its benefits. It has both \na carrot and a stick approach. Companies that move jobs offshore will \nsee their benefits under this proposal reduced, and companies that \nchose to ``invert'' their corporate structure to avoid U.S. taxes will \nnot be eligible for this credit at all.\n  As important as it is to assist workers who are eligible for benefits \nunder TAA and ATAA, however, this alone is not enough to address the \ncrisis facing American manufacturers. That is why my bill also includes \na 5-year extension of the research and development tax credit we passed \nlast year. R is critical to our manufacturers, because it is the \nbasis of the breakthroughs we need to keep our economy on the cutting \nedge. The credit also creates jobs--it can only be claimed on R \nperformed in the United States, and 75 percent of each dollar claimed \ngoes to cover salaries of employees engaged in R But despite its \nimportance, the R tax credit is scheduled to sunset at the end of \nthis year. Extending this credit would be a powerful tool that will \nhelp manufacturers keep their operations in America, and help offset \nthe cost disparity American manufacturers face.\n  I am hopeful that, working together on this and other proposals, we \ncan take the important steps needed to strengthen American \nmanufacturers, preserve our manufacturing capacity, and most of all, \nhelp ensure that hard-working Americans have the jobs they need and \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Dole, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 593. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \ngrant program to provide supportive services in permanent supportive \nhousing for chronically homeless individuals, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nBurr, to introduce the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act \n(SELHA).\n  It is estimated that two to three million Americans experience a \nperiod of homelessness in a given year. While the majority of these \nindividuals find themselves homeless for a brief period of time, a \ngrowing segment are experiencing prolonged periods of homelessness. \nRoughly 200,000 to 250,000 Americans fall under the category of \nchronically homeless.\n  In March 2003, former Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary Tommy Thompson issued a report that defined the issues and \nchallenges facing the chronically homeless and developed a \ncomprehensive approach to bringing the appropriate services and \ntreatments to this population of individuals who typically fall outside \nof mainstream support programs.\n  Similarly, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \nrecommended the development of a comprehensive plan to facilitate \naccess to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who \nare chronically homeless. However, affordable housing, alone, is not \nenough for many chronically homeless to achieve stability. This \npopulation also needs flexible, mobile, and individualized support \nservices to sustain them in housing.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is critical to the \ndevelopment and implementation of more effective strategies to combat \nchronic homelessness through improved service delivery and coordination \nacross Federal agencies serving this population. It directs the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to coordinate \ntheir efforts not only with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, but with other Federal departments as well as with various \nagencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that \nprovide supportive services.\n  Mr. President, SELHA is an important bipartisan measure designed to \nhelp improve coordination and ensure access to the range of supportive \nservices that the growing number of chronically homeless Americans need \nto get back on their feet. Our bill brings together permanent \nsupportive housing and services, the essential tools to enable these \nindividuals to begin to take the steps necessary to become productive \nand active members of our communities again.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward expeditious \npassage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sanders, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 594. A bill to limit the use, sale, and transfer of cluster \nmunitions; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Leahy, Senator \nSanders, and Senator Mikulski to introduce legislation to address the \ncontinuing threat posed by cluster bombs to innocent civilians around \nthe world.\n  Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of \ncluster bombs. It prevents any funds from being spent to use, sell or \ntransfer cluster munitions: that have a failure rate of more than one \npercent; unless the rules of engagement or the agreement applicable to \nthe sale or transfer of such cluster munitions specify that: the \ncluster munitions will only be used against clearly defined military \ntargets and; will not be used where civilians are known to be present \nor in areas normally inhabited by civilians.\n  The bill also requires the President to submit a report to the \nappropriate Congressional committees on the plan, including estimated \ncosts, by either the United States Government or the government to \nwhich U.S. cluster bombs are sold or transferred to clean up unexploded \ncluster bombs.\n  Finally, the bill includes a national security waiver that allows the \nPresident to waive the prohibition on the use, sale, or transfer of \ncluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent, if he \ndetermines it is vital to protect the security of the United States.\n  The human death toll and injury from these weapons are felt everyday. \nInnocent children think they are picking up a play toy in the field and \nsuddenly their arm is blown off.\n  Last November, the International Committee for the Red Cross called \nfor a ban on the use of cluster bombs in highly populated areas. They \njoined other leading organizations who have also decried the \nindiscriminate use of these weapons: Amnesty International, Human \nRights Watch, the Friends Committee on National Legislation,\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nHandicap International, and Landmine Action.\n  Several countries, including Belgium, Germany, and Norway have either \ninstituted a ban or a moratorium on the use and procurement of cluster \nbombs. More than 30 countries are actively calling for increased \ninternational controls on the weapon.\n  And next week, Norway will host an international conference to \nexplore the possibility of a international treaty to ban certain types \nof cluster munitions and provide support for the victims of the \nweapons.\n  We need to adjust our policies for their use and can do so easily.\n  Every year, hundreds of civilians are killed and many more are \ninjured due to unexploded cluster bombs.\n  From the fields of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, through the streets \nof Kosovo and Iraq, to the arid hills of Afghanistan and the \nplaygrounds of Lebanon, these lethal relics of war continue to cripple \nlife, hope, and peace.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual \n``bomblets.''\n  They are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor \ncovering over a half mile radius.\n  Yet, in practice, they pose a real threat to the safety of civilians \nwhen used in populated areas because they leave hundreds of unexploded \nbombs over a very large area and they are often inaccurate.\n  The non-profit group Handicap International studied the effects of \ncluster bombs in 24 countries and regions, including Afghanistan, \nChechnya, Laos, and Lebanon.\n  Its report found that civilians make up 98 percent of those killed or \ninjured by cluster bombs. 27 percent of the casualties are children.\n  As the report shows, cluster bombs end up in streets and cities where \nmen and women go to work and do their shopping.\n  They end up in groves of trees and fields where children play.\n  They end up in homes where families live.\n  In some cases, up to 40 percent of cluster bombs fail to explode, \nposing a particular danger to civilians long after the conflict has \nended.\n  This is particularly and sadly true of children because bomblets are \nno bigger than a D battery and in some cases resemble a tennis ball.\n  Children, outside with their friends and relatives, come across these \ncluster bombs, pick them up because they look a ball, and start playing \nwith them.\n  A terrible result often follows as these stories demonstrate.\n  On March 25, 2003 Abdallah Yaqoob was sleeping in his bed in his \nfamily's home in Basra, Iraq when he was hit by shrapnel from a cluster \nmunition strike that hit his neighborhood.\n  He lost his arm, and his abdomen was severely injured.

He lost his left index finger and soft tissue in his lower limbs. \nSource: Bonnie Docherty/Human Rights Watch.\n  Hassan Hammade, a 13 year old Lebanese boy, lost four fingers and \nsustained injuries to his stomach and shoulder after he picked up an \nunexploded cluster bomb in front of an orange tree.\n  He said, ``I started playing with it and it blew up. I didn't know it \nwas a cluster bomb--it just looked like a burned out piece of metal.'' \nSource: Christian Science Monitor.\n  All the children are too scared to go out now, we just play on the \nmain roads or in our homes.\n  These unexploded cluster bombs become, in essence, de facto \nlandmines.\n  Instead of targeting troop formations and enemy armor, unexploded \nbomblets target innocent civilians, seriously maiming or killing their \nvictims.\n  This runs counter to our values and counter to the laws of war.\n  Make no mistake, the impact of unexploded cluster bombs on civilian \npopulations has been devastating.\n  In Laos alone there are between 9 and 27 million unexploded cluster \nbombs, leftovers from U.S. bombing campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s. \nApproximately 11,000 people, 30 percent of them children, have been \nkilled or injured since the war ended. Source: International Committee \nfor the Red Cross.\n  In the first Gulf War, 61,000 cluster bombs were used containing 20 \nmillion bomblets. Since 1991, unexploded bomblets have killed 1,600 \ninnocent men, women, and children and injured more than 2,500.\n  In Afghanistan in 2001, 1,228 cluster bombs with 248,056 bomblets \nwere used. Between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians were \nkilled by them, 70 percent of them under the age of 18.\n  In Iraq in 2003, 13,000 cluster bombs with nearly 2 million bomblets \nwere used. Combining the first and second Gulf Wars, the total number \nof unexploded bomblets in the region is approximately 1.2 million.\n  An estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed \nsince 1991. Source: Human Rights Watch.\n  What gives rise, in part, to my bill are recent developments in \nLebanon over alleged use of cluster bombs by Israel.\n  It is estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets in southern \nLebanon and 1 million of these bomblets failed to explode.\n  As Lebanese children and families have returned to their homes and \nbegin to rebuild, they have been exposed to the danger of these \nunexploded bomblets lying in the rubble.\n  22 people, including six children have been killed and 133, including \n47 children, injured.\n  One United Nations official estimates that 40 percent of the cluster \nbombs launched by Israel in Southern Lebanon failed to explode.\n  So far, more than 58,000 unexploded bomblets in Lebanon have been \ndestroyed but it will take 12 to 15 months to complete the effort. \nSource: United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon.\n  Looking at these figures it is clear that several countries are awash \nwith unexploded bomblets.\n  The number is indeed staggering and the consequences are real.\n  Each death that results from an unexploded American bomblet weakens \nAmerican diplomacy and American values.\n  How are we supposed to win the hearts and minds of civilians in these \ncountries when we leave behind such deadly weapons that \nindiscriminately kill boys and girls?\n  How are we supposed to speed up reconstruction efforts--building \nhomes, schools, hospitals, clinics, and ensuring electricity and water \nsupplies--when populated areas are littered with these bombs?\n  Simply put, unexploded cluster bombs fuel anger and resentment and \nmake security, stabilization, and reconstruction efforts that much \nharder.\n  And it is not just a humanitarian problem, it is a military problem.\n  By showering targets with cluster bombs, we ensure that our troops \nwill face thousands of unexploded bomblets as they move forward.\n  This will force them to change course and slow the mission.\n  During the Iraq war, U.S. troops would fire six rockets containing \n4,000 bomblets to eliminate one artillery piece in a civilian \nneighborhood. With a 16 percent dud rate, approximately 640 duds were \nleft behind. Source: Human Rights Watch.\n  As an August 2003 Wall Street Journal article noted: ``Unexploded \nbomblets render significant swaths of battlefield off-limits to \nadvancing U.S. troops.''\n  In fact, during the first Gulf War, unexploded cluster munitions \nkilled 22 U.S. troops--6 percent of total U.S. fatalities--and injured \n58.\n  Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen recognized the threat \ncluster bombs posed to civilians and U.S. troops alike and issued a \nmemorandum which became known as the Cohen Policy.\n  It stated that beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster bomb \nwould have a failure rate of less than one percent.\n  This was an important step forward but we must remember that we still \nhave 5.5 million cluster bombs in our arsenals containing 728.5 million \nbomblets. That is, we are still prepared to use an enormous amount of \ncluster bombs that have significant failure rates. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Let me be clear. While this legislation prohibits the sale, use, or \ntransfer of cluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent, \nit does include a national security waiver to allow the President to \nwaive the restriction.\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\n  Instead of exercising the waiver, I would hope that administration \nwould work with Congress to extend the Cohen Policy to the entire U.S. \ncluster bomb arsenal.\n  During the 1990s, a comprehensive pact was forged to protect \ncivilians from land mines worldwide. The United States and the \ninternational community have since spent millions to remove mines in \npost-conflict regions.\n  There is no question there should be a similar program for cluster \nbombs.\n  Simply put, this legislation will save lives--civilians and soldiers \nalike--and will help save the reputation of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to cosponsor this \nlegislation on cluster munitions with my friend from California, \nSenator Feinstein. I commend her for the determination she has shown to \nprevent future harm to innocent people from these weapons.\n  The problem of cluster munitions, which overwhelmingly maim and kill \ncivilians, has been known for many years. Perhaps the most egregious \nexample is Laos, where millions of these tiny explosives were dropped \nby United States military aircraft during the Vietnam war. Over three \ndecades later they continue to cause horrific casualties among local \nvillagers and unsuspecting children.\n  I have urged the Pentagon to address this problem for nearly a \ndecade.\n  While they have acknowledged the problem, they have not yet taken \nsufficient steps to solve it. We used large numbers of cluster \nmunitions in the invasion of Iraq, including in densely inhabited, \nurban areas, and many civilians paid and continue to pay a terrible \nprice.\n  Israel used these weapons extensively in Lebanon, including cluster \nmunitions supplied by the United States, and again it has been \ncivilians who have suffered disproportionately.\n  Cluster munitions, like any weapon, have military utility. They can \nbe effective against armor or other military infrastructure. But they \nare, in effect, indiscriminate, because they are scattered by the \nthousands over wide areas.\n  Many of them--between 1 and 40 percent depending on the type and the \ncondition of the terrain--fail to explode on contact and remain on the \nsurface of the ground as hazardous duds indefinitely, no different from \nlandmines.\n  The duds are exploded by whoever comes into contact with them. Often \nit is a child who thinks it is a toy. The consequences are disastrous--\nlifelong disfigurement and disability, or death.\n  No one suggests that it is possible to completely avoid civilian \ncasualties in war. Innocent casualties are an inevitable, tragic \nconsequence of all wars. But this legislation should not be necessary. \nWeapons that are so disproportionately hazardous to civilians should of \ncourse be subject to strict controls on their use.\n  The Feinstein-Leahy bill does not prohibit the use or export of \ncluster munitions. Rather, it would set a standard for reliability that \nis the same as what the Pentagon now requires for new procurements of \nthese weapons.\n  The President may waive this requirement if he certifies that doing \nso is vital to protect the security of the United States, and he \nsubmits a report describing the steps that will be taken to protect \ncivilians and the failure rate of the cluster munitions to be used or \nsold.\n  Our bill, which is not aimed at any particular country because this \nis a global problem, would also require that cluster munitions be used \nonly against military targets and not where civilians are known to be \npresent or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.\n  This is a moral issue and it is an issue of our own self-interest. \nUsing or selling weapons that are so indiscriminate in their effect \nwithout strict controls on their use is immoral. It is immoral.\n  Anyone who has seen the horrific consequences of children with an arm \nor a leg blown off, or a part of their face, or their lifeless body cut \nto pieces by shrapnel, knows that.\n  It is also contrary to our own interest to be using or selling \nweapons which cause such appalling casualties of people who are not the \nenemy. It fuels anger and resentment we can ill afford among the very \npeople whose support we need.\n  Again, I am pleased to join with the Senator from California. This is \na thoughtful, much needed response to a serious humanitarian problem.\n  It is also timely because other governments, following the leadership \nof Norway, Austria and others, are meeting in Oslo later this month to \nbegin discussions on an international treaty to curtail the use and \nexport of cluster munitions that pose unacceptable risks to civilians.\n  The United States should play a visible, constructive role in those \nnegotiations and it is our hope that this legislation will contribute \nto that process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 595. A bill to amend the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nto-Know Act of 1986 to strike a provision relating to modifications in \nreporting frequency; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would preserve the public's right to know about toxic chemical \nreleases and waste management where they live.\n  The legislation would overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's \nrecent action to undermine the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program--\nwhich I helped create in 1986--by allowing facilities that release up \nto 2,000 pounds of a toxic chemical to simply provide notice of a \nchemical's presence at the facility, rather than disclose the actual \namounts released to the land, air, and water. The 2,000 pounds standard \nrepresents a four-fold increase of the current reporting threshold. EPA \nfinalized another change to the TRI program that will reduce the \ninformation available to the public regarding the waste management of \nsome of the most toxic chemicals that accumulate\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nin the environment, including lead and mercury.\n  These changes would eliminate detailed reporting for one or more \nchemicals at thousands of facilities in communities around the country, \nincluding hundreds of facilities in New Jersey, and could eliminate \nentirely the disclosure of the releases of more than a dozen \npotentially dangerous chemicals. According to the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO), citizens living in 75 U.S. counties could \nhave no numerical TRI information about local toxic pollution under the \nchanges made by EPA. Furthermore, GAO estimates that 3,565 facilities--\nincluding 101 in New Jersey--would no longer have to report any \nquantitative information about their chemical releases and waste \nmanagement practices to the TRI.\n  The EPA had also proposed to require reports on chemical emissions \nonly every other year, instead of the current annual requirement. Under \nthat plan, communities would have no knowledge of what chemicals have \nbeen released into their neighborhoods, or how those wastes were \notherwise managed every other year. Additionally, companies would have \nan incentive to concentrate their most egregious releases of toxic \nchemicals into the environment in years which are not reported. EPA \nwithdrew this particular part of their proposal, but there is no \nguarantee that they will not pursue this avenue in the future.\n  I strongly oppose all of these rule changes; and the legislation I am \nintroducing will overturn the changes EPA has made, and prevent them \nfrom making the third change that they considered.\n  I firmly believe that it is unacceptable for the EPA to reduce the \namount of information available to the public about chemicals--\nincluding mercury, lead benzene, chromium, and other carcinogens--\nstored nearby or released into their community. When Congress passed \nthe original Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in \n1986, as a response to the 1984 Union Carbide chemical disaster in \nBhopal, India, some accountability was finally established in the \nchemical industry. And now, the EPA has weakened the rules and reduced \nthe amount of information available to the public on these critical \nissues. For instance, in my home State of New Jersey, a chemical \nfacility that released 2,000 pounds of arsenic via air emissions in \n2003 would no longer be required to disclose this pollution to the \ngeneral public. Fourteen facilities that released a combined 8,600 \npounds of carcinogenic styrene would no longer have to report these \nemissions in detail.\n  While the EPA touts the benefits of its proposal as ``burden \nreduction'' for industry, I strongly believe that the benefit of \nannual, detailed reporting vastly outweighs any reduction in burden \nthat will be provided to industry. In fact, according to GAO's \nestimates, the average cost savings for facilities no longer required \nto report their release of toxic chemicals or waste management \npractices would be approximately $2.46 per day.\n  There are constructive ways to improve the TRI program, and lessen \nthe burdens on industry, without reducing the amount of information \navailable to the public. These include improving the system for \nelectronic reporting, and offering technical assistance to help \nbusinesses comply with the requirements.\n  The bill I introduce today, with Senator Boxer and Senator Menendez \nas original co-sponsors, would codify the previous requirement that \nfacilities with chemical releases of more than 500 pounds of any \nstandard TRI chemical must disclose the details of their releases. \nReleases in amounts less than 500 pounds could continue to use the less \ndetailed reporting form. Second, it would codify the current \nprohibition on using the less detailed form for the most persistent \nchemicals, including lead and mercury--those the EPA has classified as \n``chemicals of special concern.'' Finally, it would prevent EPA from \nmaking the frequency of reporting less than every year.\n  I would also like to thank my Congressional colleagues in the House \nof Representatives, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Hilda Solis of \nCalifornia, with whom I have been pleased to work on this issue. \nRepresentatives Pallone and Solis are introducing the companion of this \nbill in the House; I now look forward to continuing to work with them \nand my colleagues in the Senate to ensure its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the special postage stamp for breast cancer \nresearch for 2 years; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Hutchison to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize the extraordinarily successful \nBreast Cancer Research Stamp for two additional years.\n  Without Congressional action, this important stamp will expire on \nDecember 31 of this year.\n  This stamp deserves to be extended as it has proven to be highly \neffective.\n  Since 1998, over 747 million breast cancer research stamps have been \nsold--raising $53.76 million for breast cancer research.\n  California continues to be one of the leading contributors, \npurchasing over 47 million stamps with $3.6 million going to research--\nalmost 15 percent of the nationwide contribution.\n  Furthermore, in September 2005, the General Accounting Office (GAO) \nreleased a report showing that the Breast Cancer Research Stamp has \nbeen a success and an effective fund-raiser in the effort to increase \nfunds to fight the disease.\n  The report also indicated that ``grants funded by NIH and DOD using \nBreast Cancer Research Stamp proceeds have produced significant \nfindings in breast cancer research.''\n  The National Institutes for Health and the Department of Defense have \nreceived approximately $36.7 million and $15.7 million, respectively, \nputting these research dollars to good use by funding innovative \nadvances in breast cancer research.\n  For example, a 2002 Department of Defense Concept Award enabled \nresearchers to develop Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) technology. \nThis method of imaging helps surgeons determine if they have removed \nall cancerous tissue during breast cancer surgery.\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are \nbecoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. Every dollar we \ncontinue to raise will help save lives.\n  One cannot calculate in dollars and cents how the stamp has focused \npublic awareness on this terrible disease and the need for additional \nresearch funding.\n  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far \nreaching effects on our nation: breast cancer is the second most \ncommonly diagnosed cancer among women after skin cancer. More than \nthree million women are living with breast cancer in the U.S. today, \none million of who have yet to be diagnosed. Though much less common, \nover 1,700 men were diagnosed with breast cancer last year.\n  This legislations would: extend the authorization of the Breast \nCancer Research stamp for two additional years--until December 31, \n2009; allow the stamp to continue to have a surcharge of up to 25 \npercent above the value of a first-class stamp with the surplus \nrevenues going to breast cancer research; not affect any other semi-\npostal proposals under consideration by the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Hutchison in passing this \nimportant legislation to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for \nanother two years.\n  Until a cure is found, the money from the sale of this unique postal \nstamp will continue to focus public awareness on this devastating \ndisease and provide hope to breast cancer survivors.\n  We ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \ndirectly follow this statement in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF POSTAGE STAMP FOR BREAST \n                   CANCER RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 414(h) of title 39, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``2007'' and inserting ``2009''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Vitter, \n        and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 598. A bill to require reporting regarding the disaster loan \nprogram of the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small \nBusiness Disaster Loan Reporting Act of 2007,'' which will require the \nSmall Business Administration to update its disaster response plan and \nto submit detailed disaster loan reports to the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee. This bill is a bipartisan effort, and I \nthank Ranking Member Snowe as well as Senators Landrieu, Vitter, and \nLieberman for their efforts in bringing this bill together.\n  In the months since Hurricane Katrina, Rita and Wilma, I have worked \nwith other members of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship to improve the SBA's disaster loan program. We have \nintroduced numerous drafts of this legislation, and each time our \nreform proposals have been blocked by the administration. While we \ncontinue to work toward passing this comprehensive reforms bill, we \nneed to address some of the provisions that will assist Congress in \nassessing how the SBA's disaster loan program is operating in the \npresent.\n  SBA Administrator Steve Preston appeared before the House Committee \non Small Business this morning and admitted that although the SBA has \nimplemented widespread reforms in its operational approach to \nprocessing and disbursing disaster loans, there is no plan on paper to \nspeak of that can be provided to Congress. To provide disaster victims \nwith a quick and effective response in the aftermath of future \ndisasters, we must continue to evaluate the SBA's programs, building \nupon successes and making improvements when we identify agency flaws. \nIt is imperative that the SBA review its disaster response plan in \npreparation for the 2007 hurricane season, and this bill requires the \nSBA to do so and to submit its changes to our Committee and the House \nSmall Business Committee for review.\n  Last February, while thousands of Gulf Coast hurricane victims sat \nwaiting for promised disaster relief to arrive, the SBA nearly ran out \nof money twice for its Disaster Assistance program. It required two \nemergency acts of Congress to keep the program running. Despite knowing \nabout these funding issues well in advance, the SBA chose not to \ndisclose the problem to its authorizing Committee until just before the \nissue came to a head. With greater coordination and transparency, \nCongress can work with the SBA to ensure that this essential disaster \nresponse program does not run the risk of shutting down. This bill \nrequires the SBA to provide the Committee with detailed monthly and \ndaily reports to update us on the program's lending volumes as well as \nfunding levels. It also requires the SBA to notify its oversight \ncommittees when it will be seeking supplemental funding. Making the \ndisaster loan program transparent for our review is crucial in creating \na system that provides timely and valuable assistance to victims of \ndisasters, and this legislation will help to do that.\n  The SBA's failure to act quickly and effectively in response to the \ndevastation of the 2005 hurricanes was unacceptable, but as we have \nlearned from the continuing devastation in those areas, long-term \ndisaster assistance for our small businesses also requires attention to \nfederal procurement requirements. Small businesses need to play a \nleading role in rebuilding these areas. This legislation requires the \nSBA to report to Congress the number of contracts awarded to small \nbusinesses following disaster declarations, because continued \nassistance and government contracts for small businesses in these areas \nhelp to empower entrepreneurs to make their homes and cities vibrant \nonce again.\n  This bill will improve the SBA disaster loan program in allowing \nbetter congressional oversight to ensure the agency is giving \nentrepreneurs the tools they need to make a difference in their \ncommunities after a disaster.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 599. A bill to improve the disaster loan program of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Vitter the ``Private Disaster Loans Act of 2007.'' \nThis legislation streamlines the current disaster loan program and \nallows private banks to make loans to disaster victims.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am committed to providing the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, with the tools necessary to help small businesses \nand homeowners recover in the wake of a disaster. With the SBA at the \nforefront of disaster relief efforts, Congress must support the agency \nto ensure that this country's 25 million small businesses have a \nresource they can depend on when disaster strikes. It is essential that \nwe create a program to utilize existing infrastructure and provide \nimmediate, much-needed aid to disaster victims.\n  I have made reforming and improving the disaster loan program a top \npriority. The legislation I am introducing today, the Private Disaster \nLoans Act of 2007, is designed to remedy some of the problems that \nprevented or delayed disaster victims from receiving immediate and \nnecessary funding following the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes. Homeowners \nand businesses are the bedrock of communities across this Nation, and \nkeeping them healthy, happy, and economically viable will enhance and \nimprove the disaster recovery process. My bill is an important step in \nthe right direction.\n  The creation of private disaster loan program will give the SBA the \nopportunity to work with private banks to improve the lending process \nin the wake of another devastating disaster, as in the case of \nSeptember 11 or the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes. Because these private \ndisaster loans will be made by qualified private lenders, borrowers \nwill have an efficient alternative for accessing disaster assistance \ninstead of depending solely on the SBA.\n  Under my proposal, the maximum PDL loan size will be $2 million, with \na\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nmaximum SBA guaranty of 85 percent, no matter the size of the loan. The \nmaximum term will be 25 years if collateral is involved; otherwise, the \nmaximum term for uncollateralized loans will be 15 years. These loans \ncan be used for any purposes that are authorized under the standard SBA \ndisaster loan program.\n  There will be no SBA guaranty fee for PDLs. In addition, there will \nbe a loan origination fee paid to lenders by the SBA using authorized \nfunds appropriated for the standard disaster loan program.\n  The size standard used to determine a borrower's eligibility for the \nPDL program will be the standard currently used in the 7(a) or 504 loan \nprogram. This will provide greater flexibility to the lenders and \nfoster more incentive for use of the program.\n  For documenting each loan, lenders would be allowed to use their own \ndocuments, subject to SBA approval, and would also be permitted to \ncreate an internet, or electronic, application process.\n  As we learned all too well after the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes, it \nis critical for our Government agencies to be as prepared as possible \nwhen disaster strikes. As we move forward during the 110th Congress, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to get this \nvital legislation passed, and to support the SBA in its continuing \nmission to assist the country's small business community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nthe School-Based Health Clinic program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, I am honored to introduce the School \nBased Health Clinic Act of 2007. I developed this legislation in \npartnership with parents and healthcare advocates, all of whom are \naffiliated with Oregon's vibrant school based health center network. \nThis important legislation will create a federal authorization to \nsupport the work of school based health centers (SBHCs) across the \nNation. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Dodd, \nSnowe, Collins, Kennedy, Vitter and Bingaman.\n  Currently, there are approximately 1700 SBHCs operating across the \ncountry, and Oregon is home to 44 of them. These special health \nclinics--with the input of parents, school personnel, healthcare \nproviders and other youth advocate--provide vital primary and mental \nhealthcare services to all children, regardless of their income or \ninsurance status. Communities around the country are beginning to \nrealize the enormous benefits of SBHCs, not only to the health of \nchildren, but to the broader healthcare system. Study after study show \nthat SBHCs can help curtail inappropriate emergency room use, reduce \nMedicaid expenditures and prevent costly hospitalizations. Findings \nsuch as these have convinced me that Congress should be supporting \nprograms like SBHCs that provide convenient points of access to basic \nhealthcare services.\n  Along with Community Health Centers, SBHCs serve as an invaluable\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\ncomponent of the Nation's healthcare safety net. Sadly, more than nine \nmillion children in the U.S. still lack any form of health insurance \ncoverage. As a consequence, they face enormous challenges in accessing \nprimary, preventive and mental health services. Even those children who \nare fortunate to have consistent health coverage face access barriers, \nwhich may result in increased absences or undiagnosed health \nconditions. SBHCs help tear down those barriers so that all children--\nregardless of insurance or socioeconomic status--have access to a \ncomprehensive range of health services.\n  What truly sets SBHCs apart is their unique model of delivering care. \nWorking with parents, school personnel and other community based \nprograms, they provide direct care in a manner that helps foster the \ndevelopment of positive behaviors and long-term healthy lifestyles. \nThey also play an important role in helping students achieve their full \nacademic potential. An Oregon survey found that 75 percent of SBHC \nusers would have missed one or more classes if they had to seek \ntreatment in a traditional care setting. Clearly, SBHCs play a vital \nrole not only in keeping children healthy, but in supporting their \nlong-term educational success. We cannot expect children to excel in \nthe classroom if they are forced to miss school to seek treatment from \na traditional healthcare provider.\n\n  Despite the enormous value they add to our nation's educational and \nhealthcare systems, SBHCs receive little to no federal support. Most of \ntheir funding comes from state and local resources, patient revenue and \nprivate contributions. However, as budgets tighten and deficits grow \nlarger, SBHCs find themselves competing alongside other programs for \nlimited public health dollars. Many have been forced to scale back \nservices or close altogether.\n  Some SBHCs have been fortunate to receive limited support through the \nFederal Community Health Center (CHC) program, if they are affiliated \nwith or operated by a center. While this relationship has proven \nbeneficial, over time it has placed an increasing demand on CHC's \nsource of revenue and has limited the ability of SBHCs to cultivate the \nresources needed to expand into other vulnerable and underserved areas.\n  To realize their full potential, the Federal Government needs to \nestablish a separate authorization for SBHCs. Even a small amount of \nFederal support can serve as much needed seed money to attract funding \nfrom other sources. In Oregon, centers have been able to generate as \nmuch as $3 to $4 dollars in funding from other public and private \nsources with every $1 of State general revenue. This clearly \nunderscores the value of the SBHC-model of service delivery to the \ngovernment. My legislation is asking for only a $50 million annual \nappropriation to support the work of SBHCs--an investment that could \nlead to a return many times over.\n  As Congress prepares to consider the reauthorization of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program this year, my colleagues and I have \nturned our attention to finding innovative and effective ways we can \nsupport the health and well-being of our Nation's children. I am \nhopeful that along with that important piece of legislation, we also \ncan generate the support to pass the School Based Health Clinics \nEstablishment Act. I believe we must support a variety of means of \nhealthcare access so that all children are able to receive the care \nthey need to stay healthy and well-prepared to excel in their \neducational pursuits.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, Senator Smith and I are introducing \nthe School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007. This \nlegislation will assist in the operation of school-based health clinics \n(SBHCs) which provide comprehensive and accessible primary health care \nservices to medically underserved youth.\n  Why is this legislation needed? Let's look at the facts. We have more \nthan eight million children in this country who have no health \ninsurance. According to recent data released by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, between 2003-2005, the percentage of high \nschool students who reported smoking cigarettes was around 23 percent. \nIn 2005, 30 percent of students in grades 11-12 reported binge \ndrinking, which is five or more alcoholic drinks in a row. Twenty-two \npercent of students in grades 11 and 12 reported using marijuana in the \npast month.\n  In addition, the same Department of Health and Human Services report \nfound that the United States spends more on health per capita than any \nother country. The report, ``Health, United States 2006,'' specifically \nstated that ``much of this spending is for care that controls or \nreduces the impact of chronic diseases and conditions affecting an \naging population.'' Fewer dollars are spent on preventative care for \nour children.\n  Another fact I would like to bring to your attention is one found in \na document released today by the United Nations Children's Fund. The \nU.N. Children's Fund report found that the United States ranks last in \nchild health and safety, with the highest rates of relative child \npoverty and teenage obesity.''\n  The points I have just made should not only shock us, but should be a \nwake-up call to each member of this body and to the American people \nthat we need to take action and we need to take it now.\n  With the introduction of the School-Based Health Clinic Establishment \nAct of 2007, Senator Smith and I are seeking to change the data I have \noutlined. School-based health clinics, where available, have a \ndemonstrated record of improving the health care of our nation's youth. \nA study by Johns Hopkins University found that SBHCs reduced \ninappropriate emergency room use and increased primary care \nutilization, which resulted in fewer hospitalizations for those who \nused SBHCs. SBHCs also save money. For example, the Emory University \nSchool of Public Health attributed a reduction in Medicaid expenditures \nrelated to inpatient care and emergency department registration to the \nuse of SBHCs.\n  In Connecticut, we have 73 school-based health clinics. The SBHCs \nhave provided health care to many elementary, middle, and high school \nstudents who would not have access to care if SBHCs did not exist. The \nConnecticut clinics provide an array of services such as comprehensive \nphysical and mental health assessments, dental care, asthma treatment, \nand conflict resolution.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help enable school-based \nhealth clinics to continue providing these much needed services. \nAlthough these clinics function totally in accordance with state laws \nand regulations, the federal government needs to provide funding so \nthese clinics can continue to be a key component of our health care \ndelivery system.\n  This year, we will be working on the reauthorization of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The program was created to \nprovide health care to millions of children who were previously \nuninsured. SCHIP is an outstanding program. I believe the ``School-\nBased Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007'' would be a good \ncomplement to SCHIP.\n  The School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007 is an \nimportant step in making sure that the next time the United Nations \nChildren's Fund issues their rankings on children's quality of life, \nthat the United States is no longer listed in last place. I look \nforward to working with Sen. Smith and my colleagues to see that this \nlegislation is not only passed by this body soon, but that it is signed \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Obama, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Carper, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mr. Brown, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 601. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nbroker reporting of customer's basis in securities transactions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today Senator Tom Coburn, Representatives \nRahm Emanuel and Walter Jones and I, in the House of Representatives, \nare re-introducing bipartisan legislation to close the capital gains \ntax gap. The legislation, entitled the Simplification Through \nAdditional Reporting Tax\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n(START) Act of 2007, will require brokerage houses and mutual fund \ncompanies to track and report cost basis information to their customers \nand the IRS. In the Senate, the legislation has 15 original co-\nsponsors: Senators Coburn, Biden, Brown, Carper, Clinton, Durbin, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Obama, Klobuchar, \nSchumer, and Stabenow. The House version has seven co-sponsors. The \nlegislation is based upon a recommendation made by the National \nTaxpayer Advocate, the organization created as part of the 1998 IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act whose explicit purpose is to make \nrecommendations to Congress to simplify the tax code.\n  As you can see from the members that are supporting this proposal, \naddressing the issue of the tax gap is not a partisan issue. Taxpayers \nwho pay the right amount each year should not be subsidizing those who \ndon't. According to the National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, honest \ntaxpayers are paying an additional $2700 in taxes to subsidize \ndishonest taxpayers.\n  It is also an issue of fairness. Middle-class Americans cannot \nunderpay their taxes because their employers submit wage information \nreports, called W-2s, to the IRS. If a factory worker in Kokomo, \nIndiana underreports his income, the IRS is going to know about it \nbecause his employer sent his wage report to the IRS. By contrast, \ntaxpayers who rely on stocks and bonds for their income are on the \nhonor system to report their income accurately because the IRS receives \nvirtually no information on what taxpayers paid for their investment. A \n$17 billion capital gains tax gap is ample proof that there are some \ntaxpayers that are doing some Enron accounting when it comes to paying \ntheir capital gains taxes.\n  This is also an economic issue--we are failing to collect, at a \nminimum, $345 billion in taxes that are legally owed each year. In \nlight of our economic challenges--a national debt approaching $9 \ntrillion, the eve of the Baby Boomer retirement only a year away--\nDemocrats and Republicans need to come together and address this issue \nas a first step toward solving our longer-term fiscal challenges. This \nbill is only a small part of the solution but hopefully this will pave \nthe way for other practical solutions that not only close the tax gap \nbut also simplify the tax code.\n  The START Act of 2007 requires brokerage houses and mutual fund \ncompanies to track and report the purchase price of a security, plus \nany adjustments, to their customers and the IRS. This simple change \nwill allow taxpayers to have accurate information regarding their \ninvestments, saving them considerable time and effort when they file \ntheir taxes and have to figure out how much they owe each year in \ncapital gains taxes. For the average taxpayer with capital gains, \nsimply filling out the capital gains tax form adds 12 hours to the tax \nreturn filing process--more than a full work day. According to a recent \nGAO report, over one-third of taxpayers with capital gains or losses \nare not paying the right amount in taxes.\n  The problem involves people who are cheating the system and \nunderpaying the amount of capital gains taxes that they owe, but also \ninvolves honest taxpayers who are simply overwhelmed by the complexity \nof the tax code and make mistakes. A principal reason for the \ncomplexity involved in paying capital gains taxes is the need to obtain \nwhat is called ``adjusted cost basis'' information, a technical term \nfor the purchase price of an investment, plus any necessary changes. \nThis bill closes the loophole that dishonest taxpayers are using, but \nalso offers a hand to taxpayers who spend hours simply trying to fill \nout the capital gains portion of their tax return.\n  The bill will also help the IRS enforce the law and close the capital \ngains loophole. For the first time, the IRS will have the ability to \nsee both sides of the picture, the purchase price and the sell price of \na security. For decades, the IRS has only had half the picture. The IRS \nreceives information about the price of a security when it is sold, but \ndoesn't receive any information about the purchase price of the \nsecurity.\n  This loophole has resulted in the Federal Government being short-\nchanged by $17 billion per year in capital gains taxes owed but not \npaid. With the passage of this bill, the capital gains reporting \nloophole will be eliminated.\n  I first introduced this proposal in the 109th Congress and, \nunfortunately, no action was taken on the bill. However, over the \ncourse of the past year, this proposal gained significant momentum, in \npart due to work done by the non-partisan General Accountability Office \n(GAO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both of these organizations \nevaluated this proposal and made a recommendation to Congress that it \nbe adopted.\n  There has also been significant activity in the Congress. Last year \nalone, Congress held 7 hearings on the tax gap and Sen. Coburn's \nHomeland Security subcommittee held one of those hearings that \nspecifically focused on this proposal. During that hearing, IRS \nCommissioner Mark Everson recommended this approach. The proposal also \nhas support from non-profit taxpayer groups, such as the Citizens for \nTax Justice.\n  In addition to the bipartisan support our bill enjoys in the House \nand Senate, last week President Bush included this proposal in his \nbudget submission. With the introduction of the President's proposal, \nthe Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the \npreeminent association representing the securities and bond industry, \npublicly stated that the proposal was ``very constructive.''\n  In conclusion, this should be an issue that honorable members from \nboth sides of the aisle can agree needs to be addressed. Democrats and \nRepublicans will fight endlessly about what tax rates should be, but I \nbelieve all members should agree on the principle that all taxpayers \nshould pay what you owe. We should also all agree that we need to \nreduce our deficit, simplify the tax-filing process, and promote a fair \nand equitable tax system. The START Act of 2007 is intended to make \nprogress on all of these goals. I hope it can start a civil \nconversation about ways to improve our tax system. I look forward to \nworking with all interested parties to craft a workable proposal that \nprovides some needed relief to our overburdened taxpayers.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a bill I am \nproud to introduce today with Senators Bayh and Coburn to help close \nthe tax gap by improving the reporting of capital gains income. This \nbill requires brokerage firms and mutual fund companies to track and \nreport the adjusted cost basis of their clients' stock, bond, and \nmutual fund investments.\n  This bill is a simple, commonsense solution to a serious problem. \nMany taxpayers have a hard enough time filing their taxes. One of the \nmost complex parts of an individual's tax return is the schedule for \ncapital gains income. And what makes capital gains particularly \ndifficult is the challenge of figuring out the adjusted basis of a \nsecurity that has been sold.\n  Many taxpayers lack the proper records or knowledge to calculate \nadjusted basis for a stock that has split or been exchanged as part of \na company's merger or acquisition. And right now, the IRS does not have \nthe ability to monitor the accuracy of taxpayer calculations. As a \nresult, there is a clear risk of error or fraud. In some cases, \ntaxpayers may end up paying too much in taxes. More often, they report \ntoo little income and thus pay too little in taxes.\n  In 2001, the IRS estimated that underreporting cost the Treasury $11 \nbillion annually. Today the loss is even greater.\n  Because the IRS fails to collect these funds, the rest of us have to \npay higher taxes than we should. Most people pay their taxes honestly \nand follow the law to the best of their ability. But a small number of \ntax frauds--who often owe great amounts of taxes--cheat the system. And \nit's hard now for the IRS to stop them.\n  This bill makes it easier to stop these cases of fraud and it helps \nreduce the amount of Federal tax dollars owed that the IRS fails to \ncollect each year. Brokerage firms and mutual fund companies will be \nrequired to keep track of a taxpayer's cost basis and to report that \ninformation to the IRS. This will make it easier for honest taxpayers \nto calculate their taxable capital gain, and harder for dishonest \ntaxpayers to lie about it. Based on information from\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\nthe Taxpayer Advocate, reporting to the IRS can improve compliance of \ncapital gains reporting from an estimated 50 percent today to 90 \npercent.\n  Fortunately, this new reporting requirement will not pose an undue \nburden to the financial firms affected. First, the firms will have \nplenty of time to put the necessary systems in place since the \nreporting requirement will not take effect until 2009, and then will \nonly apply to securities acquired starting in 2009. Second, technology \nhas made tracking by financial firms simple and efficient. More than 80 \npercent of all retail accounts already subscribe to a national \nreporting service for transferring basis information at a nominal cost \nper account. Finally, in cases where it is impossible to track basis, \nthe Treasury Secretary and the IRS may develop regulations to require \nalternative information.\n  It is estimated that $345 billion of Federal taxes goes uncollected \neach year. This bill doesn't solve that full problem, but it is a step \nin the right direction. It reduces the Federal deficit without raising \ntaxes or cutting spending. It simplifies the tax filing process and \nreduces the chance of error or fraud. It applies what we know about the \nclear benefits of automatic reporting to the IRS--which is required now \nfor wage income--to capital gains income as well.\n  This bill makes sense.
