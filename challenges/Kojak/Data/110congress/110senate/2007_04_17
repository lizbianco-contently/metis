Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 60 minutes, with Senators permitted to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes each. The first half of morning business is \ncontrolled by the Republican leader or his designee or designees and \nthe last portion controlled by the majority. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 372, the \nIntelligence authorization bill.\n  Yesterday, it was unfortunate that the Senate did not invoke cloture \non the intelligence legislation. However, I did enter a motion to \nreconsider the failed cloture vote. We will have that vote again at \nsome time.\n  Also today, at 12:30 p.m., the Senate will recess for the party \nconferences. We have no votes scheduled today because of the inability \nto move forward on the very important intelligence authorization as a \nresult of the Republicans in unison voting against our ability to go \nforward. If there is no change in that, we made a couple of proposals \nyesterday which were all objected to, as to being able to move forward \non germane amendments, relevant amendments.\n  We will have a cloture vote on another issue that it appears at this \ntime the Republicans are going to block; that is, the ability for \nMedicare to negotiate for lower priced prescription drugs.\n  We are going to continue to move forward on our desire to allow the \nintelligence community, the 16 agencies that work for the Federal \nGovernment, working in espionage and other such important issues, to \nallow them to have legislation that brings us up to date. For the last \n2 years, there has been no legislation in that regard because the \nRepublicans did not move forward. We are going to continue to try to \nmove forward even though the Vice President does not want this \nlegislation.\n  We also are going to continue to speak for the American people in \nallowing Medicare--one of the most important programs ever developed by \nthis country has been Medicare. I can remember my first elected job on \nthe board of trustees of then Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital, the \nlargest hospital district in the State of Nevada at the time. When I \ntook that job, 45 percent of those people who were senior citizens who \ncame to that hospital had no insurance, and children, spouses, friends, \nand neighbors had to agree to pay their hospital bill or they would not \nbe taken care of.\n  The situation now is that virtually every senior citizen, as a result \nof Medicare having passed--that passed during my term of office on the \nboard of trustees--virtually every senior citizen now has the ability \nto be taken care of, except Medicare cannot now negotiate for lower \npriced prescription drugs. The insurance industry can, the Veterans' \nAdministration can, HMOs can, but not Medicare.\n  We are going to continue to try to move forward on that issue even \nthough the Republicans obviously are being led down the wrong path by \nthe pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry and HMOs. We are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nto continue to try to do the business of the American people even \nthough sometimes it is difficult.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4552-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I begin my statement with respect \nto tax day, I wish to pause and express on behalf of the people of Utah \nour great sympathy for and anguish over the tragedy that has occurred \nin the State of Virginia.\n  I was once a resident of the State of Virginia, and I now am a \nphysical resident of the State of Virginia while remaining a legal \nresident of Utah, and I feel close to the people of Virginia.\n  Virginia is known for its system of colleges spread throughout the \nState, in magnificent rural settings. Blacksburg, VA, is one of those \nsettings, and Virginia Tech is one of those colleges. It comes as an \nenormous shock, and a sense of horror, to discover that a single \nstudent can be sufficiently disturbed in this quiet kind of setting to \nvent all of his demons in such a manner.\n  I want the people of Virginia and the students and parents of \nVirginia Tech to know they are not alone in their horror and their \ngrief and to share that on behalf of the people of Utah whom I \nrepresent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4552-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4552-S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX DAY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today is tax day, the day when most of us \nfile for an extension so we can have another 3 months or so to work \nthrough the problems connected with our taxes. I wish to review the \nhistory of our tax system and the groundwork for an attempt to try to \nsolve some of its serious problems.\n  One of the reasons we file for an extension is because the Tax Code \nitself is impenetrable. There are few--or I would say if any--who \nunderstand it. I remember when I was a very junior Senator here on the \nfloor talking about health care, when President Clinton's \nadministration was pursuing that, and making the point on the floor \nthat the law was absolutely beyond comprehension. I quoted James \nMadison, who said that the laws should be understandable, and that was \npart of his justification for the writing of the Constitution.\n  Senator Moynihan, the Senator from New York, corrected me; that is, \nhe disagreed with me. He stood up and said: Senator, we have long since \npassed the point where the laws are understandable. Look at the Tax \nCode; there is not a soul on the Earth who understands that, so do not \nmake the fact that the health care bill is incomprehensible a \njustification for defeating it.\n  I do not know how serious he was. Senator Moynihan was known for his \nsense of humor, but he was also known for his ability to go to the \nheart of the issue.\n  Let me review the history of where we got our tax systems--and yes, \nthe last word is plural because we have basically two Federal tax \nsystems in this country. We have the payroll tax, and we have the \nincome tax. Both were adopted during the period of the Great \nDepression.\n  Stop and think about the conditions which existed at that time. We \nwere in the worst economic contraction of our history. The American \nunemployment rate was running not only in double digits but as high as \n25 percent. Of the 75 percent who still had jobs, many of them had jobs \nthat were not adequate to their needs. It was a devastating \npsychological time. The historians who talk of it say that many of \nthose who were unemployed would get up in the morning, put on their \nsuit and tie, put on their hat, and leave the house as if they were \ngoing to work because they did not want the neighbors to know they were \nunemployed. The stigma of unemployment was psychologically almost as \ndevastating as the financial stigma of being unable to meet one's bills \nand pay one's mortgage.\n  The second circumstance that was present at the time of the Great \nDepression was that we were in the center of the industrial age. All of \nus, as we went to school, remember being taught about the industrial \nrevolution when we shifted from basically an agricultural economy to \npredominately an industrial economy, an economy of factories, an \neconomy of mass--mass building, mass production, mass communications. \nEverything was industrialized.\n  The third situation that applied in those days was that our economy \nwas basically protected by two oceans. We were insulated from the rest \nof the world in a very real, physical, geographical sense.\n  Stop and think about these three interacting with each other--serious \neconomic contraction in the midst of the industrial age at a time when \nwe were self-contained between two oceans. Ask yourself whether those \nthree conditions exist today.\n  We are in the midst of the longest running expansion in our history, \nnot contraction. We are in the midst of this information age, not the \nindustrial age. The focus of America, just as it shifted from \nagriculture to industry, has now shifted to the information age, and \nthe richest man in America is not the one who owns the most land, as \nwas true in the agricultural age, or the one who owns the biggest \nfactory, as was true in the industrial age, but the one who has \nmastered the capacity of the digital code, which is true in the \ninformation age.\n  Finally, we are clearly not confined to a land between two oceans. \nMoney moves around the world, ideas move around the world, and concepts \nmove around the world with the click of a mouse.\n  We do not have anything like the economic circumstances that \nprevailed when we adopted our present tax system. Yet we continue to \nperpetuate those tax systems as if they still apply to our situation.\n  The payroll tax penalizes the working poor. It is an effective tax \nrate of 15 percent on the waitress who works at minimum wage because \n7\\1/2\\ percent she has to pay and 7\\1/2\\ percent her employer pays that \notherwise she would get in her paycheck. That is a very high, \nregressive tax. When it started out in the midst of the Great \nDepression, it was 1 percent or 2 percent, and now it has grown to a \n15-percent effective rate.\n  While the payroll tax penalizes the working poor, the income tax \ndiscourages the productive rich. The more you produce, the more the \nGovernment comes in and says: We will take that away from you.\n  I have said before in this Chamber, I was fortunate enough to be \ninvolved in building a business during what many newspapers called the \ndecade of greed. Ronald Reagan was President, and the top tax rate was \n28 percent. We had basically a flat tax system. It had two tiers, 15 \npercent and 28 percent, but it was moving us toward a simple system, a \nflat rate system. If I were running that same business today, the \neffective rate would be 43 percent, and the difference between 28 \npercent and 43 percent on the earnings of that company would probably \nmake the difference between the company surviving or not. It started \nout not in a garage but in a basement. It grew to 4,000 employees. \nThink of the tax revenue coming from those employees, think of the tax \nrevenue coming from that successful business. Then ask yourself: Would \nit have been a good thing to have prevented that business from coming \non board in the name of high tax rates?\n  We need the tax revenue. We perhaps need more tax revenue than we are \ncurrently getting. I will grant that to my friends on the Democratic \nside. But I suggest to them a bargain. If we want to drive to a higher \nlevel of tax revenue, let's recognize we live in a very different world \nthan we lived in in the 1930s, when we created our present tax system. \nLet's talk about eliminating\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nthe payroll tax. Senator Moynihan was willing to do that. Let's talk \nabout eliminating the present system of income tax and replacing it \nwith a flat tax. Instead of saying we want to use the tax system to \nmake economic decisions, using the tax system as the tiller to steer \nthe economy, let's adopt the radical notion that the purpose of taxes \nis to raise money to run the Government, and then ask ourselves, how \ncan we raise it in as simple a manner as possible, as efficient a \nmanner as possible, as competitive a manner as possible, so that we \nrecognize the reality in which we live--a tax system that is geared to \nan expanding economy rather than shrinking one, a tax system that is \ngeared to the information age rather than the industrial age, and a tax \nsystem that is geared to a worldwide economy rather than one centered \nwithin our borders.\n  I am already having conversations with some of my Democratic friends \non this issue. I think tax day is the day to talk about it. We disagree \nas to whether the President's tax cuts should be extended. I voted for \nthem. I think they probably should be. But I am willing to scrap the \nwhole thing, if my friends across the aisle will make a deal with us \nwhereby we say: Let's start with a clean sheet of paper and produce a \ntax system that is geared to the realities of the economic \ncircumstances we face. I hope in this Congress we can move in that \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4553-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4553-S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a couple of topics. \nCertainly we have a lot of issues facing us. We have a lot of things to \ndo. Quite frankly, we have been moving rather slowly over the last \nseveral months. We have had one bill signed by the President. We need \nto decide how we are going to move forward. The leader was talking \nabout the Republicans holding up bills, and so on. We need to \nunderstand that we are close enough in this Senate on numbers and \nvoting that we are going to have to have some agreements on things \nbefore we lay them out. Neither side is going to be able to say, Here \nis the way we are going, because it is close. We do have different \nviews. When there is legislation pending, the minority side has \namendments they wish to offer.\n  On the other hand, I admit that sometimes the minority side wants to \nhold things up, and we can't do that either. So I hope we will look for \na little more. I don't expect us to come together with everything, but \nwe need to come together with a system which allows us to talk about \nour differences and to reach some agreements.\n  I wish to comment on a couple of issues. The first one, of course, is \nthe one that almost everyone has on their mind today, as the Senator \nfrom Utah indicated. This is tax day. Americans have reached deep into \ntheir pockets today to pay their Federal income tax. At the same time, \nwe are straining to understand the Tax Code that governs how much we \nowe. It is very complicated. All of us understand that, particularly \ntoday, or as we ask for an extension, because it is so complicated and \nso difficult to actually arrive at a conclusion with respect to taxes.\n  I am not sure it has to be that way. The Senator from Utah has \ndescribed some changes that ought to be made. We talk about that always \nat tax time, and then we seem to get away from it when tax time is \nover. We ought to stay in there and ask: How can we do this job? There \nhave to be taxes paid. Obviously, there has to be some fairness among \nthe taxpayers. But does it need to be this complicated? Does it need to \nbe this technical? We find ourselves with a tax program that is \ndesigned by literally hundreds of programs that are more put in place \nto affect behavior and to affect how things are going to happen than \nthey are for taxes. We will give tax relief for this, if you will do \nthis. If you do this, we will give you tax relief over here. The next \nthing you know, we have such a complicated plan.\n  The average American has a great deal of trouble understanding and \ncomplying with the Tax Code. The vast majority of the taxpayers use tax \npreparers, even in the simplest of tax situations. We in Congress get \nfrustrated with the lack of compliance with the Code; i.e., the tax gap \nthat we hear so much about. It is apparently substantial in terms of \nthe amount of money involved. But the average American is as frustrated \nby sincerely trying to comply with the system in most cases. I \nunderstand the tax gap. Maybe there are some people who are actually \ntrying to avoid taxes. But often the tax gap is simply because of the \ncomplexity.\n  The good news, of course, is the economy is strong. That is good \nnews. The economic policies of the last 6 years are working and have \ncontinued to contribute to the growth of the economy, to encourage \ninvestment, and to encourage job creation. Our economy has added jobs \nfor 43 straight months; 7.8 million since August 2003. This is good, \nparticularly when we look at the changes in the world economy. Again, \nthe Senator from Utah was talking about that. As we continue to grow \njobs, that is a very good thing.\n\n  The economy has added jobs to the extent of 7.8 million over this \nperiod of time. The national employment rate has fallen to 4.4 percent \nlast month. Average earnings grew 4 percent last year. The elements of \nthe economy are good. Interestingly enough, largely because of the Iraq \nsituation, we don't hear much about the good economy or about the good \nthings going on in the country. That is too bad. The strong economy has \nresulted in stronger tax revenues in 2006.\n  It is important, as we talk about taxes, that we maintain progrowth \ntaxes in economic policy, the idea of extending those tax benefits \nwhich have helped to bring about this growth is important. We are at a \npoint where some of them will expire within the next couple of years. \nThey are the kinds of benefits that one needs to know about before tax \ntime so investments can and will be made because of the benefits. The \npolicies in place are working. I don't think we ought to mess with \nsuccess. At the same time, we have already passed as part of the budget \nan almost $1 trillion tax increase. Additionally, the budget that was \npassed by the other side of the aisle increased spending and the size \nof Government. I am concerned about that. These policies will undo all \nthe good that has been done over the last several years. It is kind of \na game: What taxes are you going to have to beat to offset spending now \nand saying it doesn't need to be. But the fact is, it does. From 2008 \nto 2011, the budget will increase the deficit by $440 billion and \nincrease the gross debt by $2.2 trillion, if we go on as is now \nsuggested. The budget ignores the impending Medicare and Social \nSecurity crises. In fact, it would make it even worse by spending more \nthan a trillion of the Social Security surplus.\n  When we talk about taxes, we also have to talk about the size, scope, \nand role of the Federal Government. It is time we look at some of the \nthings we are doing and wonder why they need to be done by the Federal \nGovernment and whether, in fact, they should be done by State and local \ngovernments or, in fact, the private sector. We should not be using tax \npolicy as a substitute for direct appropriations and encouraging \nbehavior. That is what we have gotten into. We have talked a lot in \nrecent years about tax reform. It is high time we put it into action, \nwhether it is a flat tax, which is difficult to understand but is used \nin some places around the world--it seems to be workable--or whether it \nis a tax that is put on the items that people purchase which would be a \nlittle difficult to sell. An acquisition tax is one that is being \ntalked about. But we ought to get away from the behavior tax and get \nback down to a simplified tax.\n  We need taxes. The Government has to be funded and should be funded \nin a fair way. But it needs to be done in a different way.\n  Let me move to Medicare and the noninterference issue that may be \ncoming up very soon. That is the competition on the Part D program by \nhaving the Government do the sort of work that needs to be done in the \nprivate sector and having a change in the way this thing is operating. \nI think Part D, which is rather new and still being incorporated but is \npretty deeply involved in participation at this point--90 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries have drug coverage--is very good. Folks are \nsaving a considerable\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\namount of money under the program. On average seniors are saving $1,200 \nyearly on drug costs. A survey reported 80 percent of seniors are happy \nwith the Part D benefits that went into effect recently. Folks in \nWyoming are certainly telling me they like the plans that are available \nthere. There are fewer plans available in a smaller population State \nthan there are in some others. Nevertheless, there are plans available. \nThey are available at the local drugstore, and they have an option of \nseveral plans from which to choose which is very important for us to \nmaintain in the Part D program.\n  The costs are 30 percent lower than the original estimates, and it \nhas caused competition. It has caused the private sector to come about \nwith reduced estimates. That is very good. Even the expert the \nDemocratic majority put in place to head up the Congressional Budget \nOffice says this legislation that is proposed to have the Government do \nthe negotiations with drug companies would not save money, according to \nthe CBO. In an April 10 letter to Chairman Baucus, the CBO writes:\n\n       We anticipate that under the bill the Secretary would lack \n     the leverage to negotiate prices under the broad range of \n     covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those \n     obtained by Prescription Drug Plans under current law. \n     Without the authority to establish a formulary or other tools \n     to reduce drug prices, we believe that the Secretary would \n     not obtain significant discounts from drug manufacturers \n     across a broad range of drugs.\n\n  CBO also testified that negotiating Medicare drug prices could make \ncosts go up for everyone else. We have to understand we need a drug \nprogram, a Medicare program for everyone. There are certain ways it \nwould have to be done for the elderly, for the underfinanced, and so \non. But the plan needs to be there for everyone.\n  The Government Accountability Office has said price fixing may result \nin limited access. You can imagine if there is negotiation on prices, \nsome of the pharmaceutical companies are going to say: OK, we are not \ngoing to offer this drug; we won't offer that drug. Under this plan, \nyou have alternatives and alternative programs from which you can \nchoose to take on different ideas.\n  Why do we want to take away a plan that has been moving toward \nsuccess and still has an opportunity for more success and change it \nbefore that opportunity has been worked through? Last week the Finance \nCommittee, of which I am a member, held a markup to consider the \npending legislation. We asked the proponents of that to come up with \ntheir plans. Frankly, they didn't have any specifics as to how this \nwould be handled.\n  With just the idea we would have the Government negotiate, it sounds \nlike, wow, we would come up with some real good stuff. The fact is--the \nbottom line is--I think most of us want to see the market work. When \nthere is competition, when there are these kinds of things, it does \ncause the market to work.\n  So I think before we pass any bill, we should know and consider, find \nout, as clearly as we can, what impact it has on the folks. We do not \nwant to talk too much, it seems, on the Senate floor about how that \nwill work. I think we should talk about how it works.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, but they believe expanding the Government is the way to solve \nhealth problems. I do not agree. I do not believe Government price \nfixing is the answer to the question.\n  Current law has increased choices, has lowered prices through market \ncompetition, and that is the system we have in this country. Market \ncompetition is where we need to go. So we should let the market \ncontinue to work and say, as the saying goes, ``if it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it.'' So I think that is how we are challenged.\n  I am hopeful we can move forward. I think we have a lot of things to \ndo. We need to get on with immigration. I do not think there is \nanything more important to the country than to have an immigration law \nthat works, that we have a closed border, that we have people coming to \nwork legitimately and legally who return after their period of work or \ngo through the process for becoming citizens. The system we have now is \nnot working, and we need to change that.\n  I think energy continues to be a factor in the future, very clearly. \nThere is no doubt there is going to be more demand. There is no doubt \nthere is going to be a more difficult time in acquiring energy sources \nfrom around the world. We have to depend more on our own, including \nalternatives. I think alternatives are a very good solution over time \nas we find out ways to use them and use them in the volumes that are \nnecessary to fill our needs.\n  In the meantime, I think we need to be very careful to assist in \ndeveloping those things we know how to do now that will make us have \nsupplies in the interim as we wait for these alternatives to develop--\ncoal, for example. Coal is our largest fossil resource. We know ways to \nhave plants develop electricity from coal, where we can extract carbon, \nreinject the carbon, help with the climate change, and at the same time \nhave a supply of energy we need.\n  So these are some of the things I guess I am a little frustrated we \ncannot move toward. We spend too much time hassling over some of these \nproblems that should not take that long. We should get on with dealing \nwith health care, get on with dealing with energy, get on with dealing \nwith immigration, get on with dealing with spending, get on with \ndealing with the size of the budget. These are the real issues out \nthere that I think the American people--and I am sure Wyoming people--\nare concerned about.\n  So I urge we move as quickly as we can, working together, so we can \nfind ways to move forward and solve some of the problems that are \nbefore us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

First, Mr. President, let me say that every parent \nremembers when their kids left the nest. There is that moment when they \nfinally reach that age where they are off to college. I can recall when \nLoretta and I took our three kids off to their colleges of choice. It \nwas kind of an emotional moment, with mixed feelings: proud they had \nreached this point in their lives when they were off on their own, sad \nthat now they are leaving their little family setting that had been so \nfamiliar and so happy for so many years. But you knew if you were lucky \nenough as a parent to have attended college that they were facing an \nextraordinary personal opportunity to go to college and meet so many \nother students and expand their horizons and learn what it means to \nlive on your own resources.\n\n  So that is why the tragedy of Virginia Tech is so sad, that the happy \nsetting of college, where parents have entrusted their students to the \nuniversity campus, can turn into a scene of horror as we found \nyesterday in Blacksburg, VA. We are all stunned and heartsick over the \nstaggering and incomprehensible loss of life yesterday. We offer our \ndeepest condolences to the families who lost precious sons and \ndaughters in that shooting rampage, and to the victims who survived it.\n  As police search for clues, I hope those of us in Congress will come \ntogether to also search honestly for answers about what can be done to \nprevent another tragedy. This has been billed as the worst massacre in \nAmerican history on a school or college campus. I can still recall 8 \nyears ago in the room behind me, the cloakroom, when we heard of the \nColumbine shooting when 15 students lost their lives. In Blacksburg, \nthe estimate is somewhere between 32 or 33 who have lost their lives. \nIt is unspeakable to think about the placid setting of that college \ncampus turning into a bloody scene yesterday morning. Now we will go \nabout the grim task of identifying those who were injured and burying \nthe remains of the ones who were killed as the Nation grieves with \nVirginia Tech University.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4555-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n                   REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN JIM JONTZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about a friend \nof mine who passed away on Saturday. His name was Jim Jontz. For 6 \nyears, from 1987 to 1993, Jim represented Indiana's fifth congressional \ndistrict in the House of Representatives. That is where I first met him \nand worked with him.\n  In 1991, the Almanac of American Politics described him as:\n\n       One of the most incredibly hardworking and gifted natural \n     politicians who has routinely done the impossible.\n\n  Two years ago Jim was diagnosed with colon cancer that had already \nspread to his liver. We hoped at the time he would find a way to ``do \nthe impossible'' again and defeat this illness. He fought that cancer \nfor 2 valiant years, but he died on Saturday afternoon in his home in \nPortland, OR.\n  Jim Jontz defied ordinary stereotypes. He was a progressive Democrat \nelected three times by one of the most conservative areas in the \ncountry to represent them in Congress. People used to wonder all the \ntime how that was possible. I have some ideas. For one thing, Jim had a \nflair for trademarks. He was famous for riding his sister's rusty blue \nSchwinn with mismatched tires in parades.\n  Jim also practiced a very personal style of politics--something he \nlearned from his days as a grassroots organizer. He ran what he called \n``shoe leather'' campaigns. His goal in every campaign was to knock on \nas many doors and speak to as many people as possible. He owned four \npairs of shoes that he rotated in and out of at a local repair shop \nevery week. That is how much shoe leather he put into his job. His \ncampaign signs were always shaped like shoes.\n  Most importantly, Jim Jontz was a bridge builder. There is a school \nof politics that says the way you win campaigns is to divide people up \ninto groups and pit them against one another. Jim was a master of a \ndifferent and better kind of politics. He wanted to build bridges and \nunderstanding between groups that too often saw themselves as enemies: \norganized labor and environmentalists, and family farmers and \nenvironmentalists. He was always trying to find some common ground. He \ncared deeply about preserving the land and family farms and he believed \nthe best way to preserve family farms was to help farmers be better \nstewards of the land. That seemed like a strange idea to some people 25 \nyears ago. Today, it surely makes sense.\n  Because of his bridge-building abilities, Jim was tapped to mediate \ndisputes between farmers and environmentalists during negotiations for \nthe 1990 farm bill. One result was a wetlands protection program that \nwon strong support from farmers, environmentalists, and sportsmen. That \nprogram has saved many family farms, preserved the natural beauty of \nour land, and protected our clean water. It is part of the great legacy \nJim Jontz leaves.\n  In addition to his important work on the House Agriculture Committee, \nJim served on the Education and Labor Committee, the House Select \nCommittee on Aging, and on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. On \nVeterans' Affairs, he worked with another brave man--my closest friend \nwhen I came to Congress and for so many years--Lane Evans. They worked \nto help veterans living with one of the most common but least \nunderstood injuries of war: post-traumatic stress disorder. Those \nefforts are part of Jim's legacy that we are relying on today while so \nmany of our soldiers come back from Iraq and Afghanistan trying to \nconquer the demons in their minds from that experience.\n  As everyone who knew Jim also knew, he was deeply committed to \npreserving the ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest. That \ncommitment earned him the support of celebrities and common folk as \nwell who shared his love for America's natural treasures. It also won \nhim the enmity of powerful logging interests and their supporters in \nCongress.\n  During the debate of the 1990 farm bill, Jim offered an amendment \nthat would have prevented logging of ancient forests and national \nparks. A powerful House member of the other party retaliated by \ndrafting legislation that would have allowed the Federal Government to \ncreate a 1-million acre national forest smack dab in the middle of \nJim's congressional district.\n  In the end, Jim's efforts to save old-growth forests probably ended \nhis career in Congress. The timber industry targeted him for defeat \nwhen he ran for his fourth House term in 1992 and he lost, but he \ndidn't stop. In 1994, he ran for the Senate, losing in his last \ncampaign. In 1995, he moved to Portland, OR, where he continued to work \nto save ancient forests and preserve the Endangered Species Act.\n  In 1998, Jim was elected president of Americans for Democratic \nAction, a position he held for 4 years before becoming ADA president \nemeritus. His most recent project for the ADA was leading its ``Working \nFamilies Win'' campaign which focused on raising the minimum wage, \nproviding working families with affordable health care, and other \nissues of basic economic justice.\n  Jim Jontz grew up in Indianapolis and graduated phi beta kappa from \nIndiana University in 1973 after less than 3 years with a degree in \ngeology. He fell into politics by accident almost in 1974. He opposed a \ndam building project that he thought threatened his little community. \nHe challenged the chief sponsor of the project, who happened to be the \nmajority leader of the Indiana House, and Jim won. At age 22 he became \na political giant killer. He also served in the Indiana Senate before \nbeing elected to Congress in 1996 at age 35.\n\n  Jim won that first race against the House majority leader by two \nvotes. He believed he picked up those last two votes when he insisted \non campaigning at 10 p.m. the night before the election at a laundromat \nthat was still open. That was Jim Jontz--using every last minute to try \nto make a difference. It was the way he ran his campaigns, it is the \nway he lived his life, and he did make a difference.\n  I join so many others--not just from Indiana and from Congress, but \nfrom across the country--in offering condolences to Jim's family: his \nmother, stepfather, and his sister who lives in Chicago. He was a good \nman who left a great legacy. I am proud to have called him my friend. \nHe will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4555-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4555-S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                IRAQ WAR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as I come to the floor this morning to \nshare my concerns about this country's disastrous policies in Iraq, our \nNation is mourning the unimaginable loss of 32 people in the tragic and \nsenseless shootings at Virginia Tech. The thoughts and prayers of every \nAmerican are with the victims of this horrific episode, the deadliest \nshooting this country has ever seen. We are only beginning to learn \nexactly what happened yesterday. We may never know why it happened, but \nwhat we know for certain is that in our shared grief we will find \nshared resolve to care for the wounded, to comfort the families and \nfriends of those who died, to support this university and its \ncommunity, and to search for answers and hope this tragedy may never be \nrepeated.\n  I have been a member of the Senate now for just over 100 days. I am \nhere, and many of my freshman colleagues are here, because the people \nof Rhode Island, like millions of other people across this country, \nlooked at the war in Iraq and saw something that needed to change. They \nsaw hundreds of billions of dollars spent, much of it wasted on \nreconstruction contracts that were sloppily managed or ill-advised. \nThey saw one after another in a succession of retired generals \nprotesting the failed strategy in Iraq and arguing for a different \ncourse. They saw reports that the Bush administration had misused and \npoliticized our national intelligence services to press a case for war \nthat did not exist. They read books, chronicling a heartbreaking series \nof mistakes and misjudgments. They saw tens of thousands of American \nsoldiers return home grievously injured, and mourned more than 3,000 \nmen and women who will never return home.\n  The country saw one of the greatest foreign policy disasters of \nAmerican history and demanded a new direction. The American people \nvoted for change. They were sincere, sober, and correct in their \njudgment, and this new Congress listened, but President Bush did\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nnot. Instead of committing to redeploy our troops from Iraq, the \nPresident chose to escalate this conflict. Now, instead of working with \nthis new Congress to forge a new strategy, a strategy worthy of the \nsacrifices of our men and women in uniform, the President and Vice \nPresident are on the attack--on the political attack--not against the \nIraqi leaders who are slow-walking us through this conflict in their \ncountry, but against the American people who have rightly questioned \ntheir failing policy. The question is this: How much longer will this \nPresident refuse to listen?\n  Since joining the Senate just over 100 days ago, I have worked to put \npressure on the Bush administration to redeploy our troops from Iraq. \nIn mid-March, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \ntraveled to Iraq to get a firsthand look at the situation on the \nground, to see the hard work of our dedicated troops, and to talk with \nour military commanders and with Iraqi political officials. In Baghdad, \nour delegation met with several of the officers leading America's \nmilitary engagement in Iraq, including GEN David Petraeus, LTG Raymond \nOdierno, and LTG Martin Dempsey, as well as members of our U.S. Embassy \ncountry team. We also met with Mahmud al-Mashhadani, Speaker of the \nIraqi Parliament, and National Security Minister Shirwan al-Waili. In \nmy capacity as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I also met with \nmembers of our Nation's intelligence staff and their Iraqi \ncounterparts.\n  In Fallujah, we spoke with GEN Walter E. Gaskin, Marine commander in \nAnbar Province, and other commanders of the Marine Expeditionary Force. \nI met three brave Rhode Islanders there: Kristie St. Jean from \nWoonsocket, Christopher Tilson from Providence, and Anthony Paulo from \nWesterly, all serving our Nation with dedication, courage, and honor.\n  On our return, we traveled through Germany to visit Landstuhl \nRegional Medical Center near Ramstein Air Base where our soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and airmen, badly injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nare med-evac'd to receive critical medical care before their return \nhome. MAJ Andrew Risio, who hails from Ashaway, RI, is helping provide \ncare to our wounded soldiers in that facility.\n  The young men and women I met with in Iraq and their families have \nmade tremendous sacrifices, and their expert performance and can-do \nattitude reinforced my pride in the American spirit. The security \nposture we maintain around our military bases is strong, and our troops \nare working hard to secure the cities and countryside of Iraq. The work \nof our intelligence and Special Operations personnel, which often runs \nnonstop through the night, is remarkable and exhibits a level of \nprofessionalism in which every American can be very confident.\n  The achievements of our forces in Iraq are serious--and here is what \nimpressed me the most from our trip: So is their commitment that the \nIraqis must assume responsibility for the security and governance of \ntheir own country. In nearly every briefing, at every level of command, \nthe message came loud and clear that our military is highly focused on \naccomplishing a handover of security responsibilities so as to bring \nour troops home. As a young soldier in mess hall told me, the Iraqis \n``won't stand up until we start to stand back.''\n  I do believe the Iraqis need more motivation to stand up. For \ninstance, there is key legislation the Iraqi Parliament must pass that \nour military commanders believe is necessary if this surge is to \nsucceed. They told me we cannot succeed in this military surge unless \nit is accompanied by a political surge, an economic surge, and a \ndiplomatic surge. Critical measures to facilitate provincial elections, \nregulation and revenue-sharing for the Iraqi oil industry, reversing \nde-Beatification in favor of reunification, and restricting sectarian \nmilitias are all legislative initiatives that have stalled.\n  Iraq must take action and move this legislation forward and step up \nits own security presence. That will require real commitment and \nurgency, Mr. President. And it would be putting it mildly to say I was \nnot reassured by the signals I received from our meetings with Iraqi \nofficials. There is a serious disconnect between the urgency of our \ngenerals about this legislation, and the absence of urgency or energy \non the part of Iraqi officials. One soldier I met put it in simple, \nhomespun terms. He said: ``If your parents are willing to pay for the \nmovies and you don't have to spend your own money, or if you can get \nyour big sister to do your homework for you, who wants that to stop?''\n  It does have to stop and this Congress is taking action to make that \nclear. I was proud to vote with a majority of the Senate to pass \nbinding bipartisan legislation to require the safe redeployment of our \nbrave troops beginning in 120 days, with the goal of having the vast \nmajority of our troops redeployed from Iraq by the end of March. I am \nalso a cosponsor of the recently introduced Feingold-Reid legislation \nto continue to put pressure on the Bush administration to safely \nredeploy our troops.\n  Only the kind of pressure a decision to redeploy creates will provide \nthe motivation needed for Iraq to take the necessary steps to assume \nresponsibility for its own governance and security. An announcement \nthat our troops will be leaving will encourage the Iraqis to step up \nand take their security seriously, will discourage the insurgents, and \nwill send a message to the world community that stability in Iraq will \nno longer be the responsibility of America alone.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to take that message directly to the \nOval Office. In a meeting with President Bush and several of our \ncolleagues who had recently traveled to Iraq, I urged him to announce a \nredeployment and a change of course was the strongest force he had in \nhis hands. I also gave the President letters sent to me from Rhode \nIsland folks with family members serving in Iraq. Those messages said \nloudly and clearly that it is time to bring our troops home.\n  But rather than acting to change course, the President keeps playing \npolitics. He has threatened to veto legislation this Congress passed to \nprovide critically needed funding for our troops in the field. In our \nmeeting last week, he said he was prepared for what he called a \n``classic political showdown.''\n  The question of what to do in Iraq is not a political fight between \nPresident Bush and the Democrats in Congress. It is a struggle between \nthe President and the will and the good sense of the American people. \nIt is long past time that their voices were heard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

RES. 123\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in January this body took a significant \nstep toward reforming the way we spend American taxpayer dollars. While \ndebating the ethics reform bill, Senators voted 98 to 0 in favor of my \namendment requiring transparency for 100 percent of Member-requested \nearmarks. This was an early sign that Congress was going to change the \nway we do business here in Washington.\n  But since then, I am afraid my optimism has been tempered by a \nhealthy dose of political reality. The ethics bill containing new \nSenate rules has been stalled, and its future enactment is anything but \ncertain. In the meantime, the Senate has continued business as usual, \nas earmarking continues unfettered from transparency rules. The \nappropriators are soliciting earmarks. The WRDA bill is full of \nundisclosed earmarks, and none of the committees are complying with the \nanticorruption transparency requirements.\n  Upon notice that I was going to offer this bill again on the floor, \nthe Democratic leadership of the Appropriations Committee just issued a \npress release\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nsaying they were going to comply with these rules. That is really good \nnews. So if the appropriators want to comply, there is no reason at all \nthat we shouldn't enact this rule as a Senate rule.\n  Yesterday's Roll Call reported that the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee is advancing two pieces of legislation packed with \nbillions of dollars worth of earmarks, but the committee is not asking \nSenators to certify that they have no financial interests in the \nprojects, at least for now. In other words, the Senate is continuing to \nconduct its business in the old way, which was rejected by the American \nvoters.\n  We cannot continue to wait. The Senate rules must be changed now if \nwe are going to implement what the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished chairman, called an accountable, \naboveboard, transparent process for funding decisions, and put an end \nto the abuses that have harmed the credibility of Congress.\n  I agree 100 percent. My proposal, S. Res. 123, creates a new Senate \nrule that requires public disclosure of the earmarks contained in bills \npassed by committee. This disclosure includes the name of the Member \nrequesting the earmark, the name and address of the intended recipient \nof the earmark, the purpose of the earmark, and a certification that \nthe requesting Member and his or her spouse have no financial interest \nin the requested earmark. These are simple transparency ideas that the \nAmerican people need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors to S. Res. 123: Senator Ensign, Senator McCain, \nSenator Enzi, Senator Martinez, and Senator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this resolution will immediately require \nall Members who request earmarks to certify in writing that they have \nno financial interests in the requested earmark.\n  Following the imprisonment of Congressman Duke Cunningham for selling \nearmarks for bribes, Americans need to know their elected officials are \nnot using public office for private gain. This is simply information \nevery Senator should be willing to provide, and I believe most are.\n  But it is beginning to look as if the new majority is not really \ninterested in shining light on the earmarking process. Before we left \nfor the Easter recess, I asked unanimous consent for the Senate to \nadopt S. Res. 123 so that we could enact this important rule \nimmediately. The majority objected and said this proposal needed to go \nthrough the ``appropriate process.'' That is a sad excuse. This rule \nhas already gone through the normal process. It was offered as an \namendment on the floor, it was modified by the leadership of the \nDemocratic Party, and it passed 98 to 0. This is a Senate rule, and the \nonly thing left for us to do is actually enact it.\n  Let me just read a few quotes from the Democratic leadership when we \nworked out the language on this bill before. This includes a lot of \nDemocratic language.\n  Majority leader Harry Reid said: In effect, we have combined the best \nideas from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, to \nestablish the strongest possible disclosure rules in this regard.\n  Majority whip Dick Durbin said: I am pleased with this bipartisan \nsolution. I believe it reflects the intent of all on both sides of the \naisle to make sure there is more disclosure. We have full agreement. \nThe language has been vetted.\n  The bill I offer today as a Senate rule is exactly the language we \npassed 98 to 0.\n  The majority leader offered up his own excuse when he said his office \nwas not notified in advance. In order to make sure that excuse is not \nused again, I sent a letter last week to the Democratic and Republican \nleaders notifying them of my intent to seek unanimous consent today to \nenact a Senate earmark disclosure rule--again, the one we have already \npassed 98 to 0.\n\n  But I understand the other side has come up with a third excuse. This \ntime, they are going to say that enacting earmark disclosure \nrequirements will dilute the effect of the lobbying and ethics reform \nbill. This is probably the weakest of all of their excuses. How does \nenacting an ethics reform provision dilute its effect? The only thing \ndiluting ethics reform is our unwillingness to abide by this new rule. \nThis excuse rings hollow because the majority did not bother to include \nthis rule in their original bill. When we brought it to the floor, they \ntried to kill it.\n  I have tried to work in a bipartisan manner on this issue. I have \nbeen patient. But it has been over 80 days. The earmark process is \ncontinuing as usual, and all the American people are getting is \nexcuses. It is time to enact this rule.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration and the Senate now proceed to S. \nRes. 123; further, that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois reserves the \nright to object.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in explaining my reservation, I first wish \nto commend the Senator from South Carolina on the courtesy he has \nextended to both sides of the aisle in notifying us of his intent to \nmake this unanimous-consent request. I wish to make clear to him and to \nall Members that the Senate Democratic leadership remains fully \ncommitted to earmark disclosure, but we believe his suggestion, taking \nit piece by piece, is not the right way to accomplish our goal.\n  Earlier this year, we considered comprehensive ethics reform. It is a \nproduct of the first 100 days of the new leadership of Congress that we \nare most proud of. Included in that reform was a provision related to \ntransparency in earmarking. I supported this reform. In fact, I joined \nSenator DeMint in crafting a new definition of ``earmark'' and \nrequiring that earmarks in legislation be posted on the Internet prior \nto their final consideration on the floor of the Senate. We both agreed \non this language. It passed with an overwhelming majority of 98 to 0, \nand the underlying bill passed 96 to 2.\n  No one is suggesting these earmark rules will not be implemented. In \nfact, today the Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, who is now presiding, Senator \nByrd, has announced a new policy of transparency in accountability, \ntotally consistent with the language which we agreed on and adopted \noverwhelmingly on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee's \nannouncement on these sweeping reforms be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Press Release, Apr. 17, 2007]\n\n   Senate Appropriations Committee Announces Earmark Reform Standards\n\n       Washington, DC.--The U.S. Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations will adopt an unprecedented policy of \n     transparency and accountability beginning with the Fiscal \n     2008 appropriations cycle, Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, \n     D-W.Va., announced Tuesday.\n       ``The changes that we are making in the appropriations \n     process will help to restore confidence in the Congress,'' \n     Chairman Byrd explained. ``We are ending `business as usual' \n     in Washington, D.C. We will restore integrity to the process. \n     We will increase accountability and openness, while we also \n     will work to substantially reduce the number of earmarks in \n     legislation.''\n       Until S. 1, the Ethics and Earmark Reform legislation, is \n     signed into law, the Senate Appropriations Committee will \n     follow these standards:\n       All earmarks will be clearly identified in the committee \n     bill and report. The identification will include the \n     requesting Senator, the amount of the earmark, the recipient \n     of the earmark, and the purpose of the earmark. If there is \n     no specifically intended recipient for an earmark, the \n     intended location of the activity will be listed.\n       An earmark shall be defined as it is in the Senate-passed \n     Ethics and Earmark Reform legislation. An earmark is a \n     legislative provision or report language included primarily \n     at the request of a Senator, Member of the House, Delegate, \n     or Resident Commissioner, that provides, authorizes, or \n     recommends a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority, credit authority, or other spending\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\n     authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan \n     authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or \n     targeted to a specific State, locality, or Congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula driven or competitive award process.\n       The committee bill and report will be published on the \n     Internet, both through the committee site (http://\nappropriations.\nsenate.gov) as well as on the Library of Congress' website \n     (http://thomas.loc.gov).\n       Senators will be required to certify that neither they nor \n     their spouses have a financial interest in any earmark. \n     Senators will need to submit a letter to the Appropriations \n     Committee certifying that they have no financial interest in \n     a project. Those letters will be available for public \n     inspection. What constitutes a Senator's ``financial \n     interest'' shall be determined by the guidelines of the \n     Senate Ethics Committee and Senate Rule XXXVII.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, under these new guidelines, all earmarks \nwill be clearly identified in the committee bill and report, including \nthe requesting Senator, the amount of the earmark, the recipient of the \nearmark, and the purpose of the earmark. An earmark shall be defined as \nin the Senate-passed ethics reform bill, which Mr. DeMint and I \ncosponsored. The committee bill and report will be published on the \nInternet--as my amendment required--so that the world can see these \nearmarks in advance of final passage. Senators will be required to \ncertify that neither they nor their spouses have any financial \ninterests in any earmark. These guidelines will be in place until the \nethics reform bill is signed into law.\n  I commend the Presiding Officer as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for reaching out to the other side of the aisle, to the \nranking member, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, so that he has been \ninformed of our intention to reform this earmark process.\n  Earmark disclosure, though, is only one part of the much broader \npackage. We need to strengthen gift and travel rules for Members of the \nSenate, close the revolving door, strengthen lobbying disclosure, \noutlaw the K Street Project, this notorious project in which Mr. \nAbramoff and others were involved, and take other steps to clean up the \nway business is done in Washington.\n  Now, if the Senator from South Carolina has his way, we will take one \npiece today. Some will suggest taking another piece tomorrow. I think \nit will dilute our effort. We need, within the next few weeks, to work \nwith the House to pass this measure. For those who ask: Well, why \nhasn't it taken place so far, the House ethics reform was done by House \nrule, did not involve a joint action by the House and the Senate.\n  So we are going to find a vehicle that will accomplish our Senate \nethics reform, statutory and rules reform, and do it in the appropriate \nmanner and do it in a comprehensive way. We have been assured by House \nleaders that they will move on this bill in the next few weeks. As soon \nas the House acts, the Senate will move for conference as quickly as \npossible. We should not take up bits and pieces of the larger bill.\n  The Senate has expressed a strong support for earmark disclosure, and \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, which I am proud to be a member \nof, has taken the lead on this side of the aisle in strong reforms. The \ngoal of the Senator from South Carolina is already being implemented, \nand I hope he can take ``yes'' for an answer.\n  I would like to correct one thing he said for the record. When he \nstarted his remarks about earmarks, he said at one point that when it \ncomes to earmarks, this Senate is ``business as usual.'' As the \nPresiding Officer and those who follow the Senate know, that is hardly \nthe case. When we considered the continuing resolution which had all of \nthe pending appropriations bills from the previously Republican-\ncontrolled Congress yet enacted, we took a bold move on our part--that \nis, the Democratic side--and eliminated 9,300 earmarks that were in \nbills authored when the Senator from South Carolina was in the \nmajority. We eliminated every single one of them--all 9,300 earmarks. \nIt contained no new earmarks. This continuing resolution eliminated \nfunding for over $2.1 billion of earmarks for over 1,900 separate \nprojects.\n  This is hardly business as usual. Business as usual would have been \nto take the bills from a Republican Congress, with thousands of \nearmarks, and enact them into law. We did not do that. So to suggest we \nare continuing along the path that was the case when there were \nprevious leaders in Congress is just not supported by the facts.\n  Beyond that, I can give my assurance to the Senator from South \nCarolina, my colleague, that the earmark language which we adopted in \nthe Senate is going to be the standard by which we live. The \nAppropriations Committee has made that very clear. I believe that is \nwhat we should do.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, acknowledging the commitment of the \nSenator from South Carolina to this issue and acknowledging that he \nshould be standing here and saying he has accomplished quite a bit to \nthis point, I would have to say that his additional suggestion today of \nplucking out one piece of ethics reform and moving on it would be \ninconsistent with our ultimate goal of having comprehensive ethics \nreform. In the meantime, we have followed this measure through the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and, as a consequence, I must object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthis issue. It is very interesting. The American people should hear \nwhat has just gone on here.\n  What we have heard is rhetoric without responsibility. There is no \nquestion that by moving, as Senator DeMint has, we finally got the \nAppropriations Committee to endorse what was passed in the ethics \nlegislation. However, after the ethics legislation was passed, I spoke \non the floor. I was the last person to speak on the floor late that \nevening. I made the statement--and it is now proving to be true--that \nit was ethics reform in name only, no substance.\n  We now hear an argument that says: We should not pass the most \nsignificant portion of the ethics bill in a stand-alone process so that \nwe can, in fact, do what the American people want, which is \ntransparency in this Government.\n  It is interesting, if you know how this place operates, that if in \nfact you have an earmark reform on appropriations only, and no earmark \nreform on an authorization, you have no earmark reform because once \nsomething is authorized in an authorizing bill through an earmark, it \nno longer will apply to the appropriations bill. So we will have the \nsame thing going on. The reason we are seeing an objection to earmark \nreform is because we truly, in the majority of cases, don't want \nearmark reform. What we are doing is, we are doing it--talk about \npiecemeal--only in one area. What we will do is, there won't be an \nearmark on an appropriations bill. What we will do is authorize them \nnow. Since we won't apply the earmark rule to authorization bills, the \nAmerican public will once again be hoodwinked. They won't know whose \nfinancial interest it is nor who it will benefit.\n  The problem with ethics in Washington isn't the lobbyists, isn't the \ncampaign contributions, it is the Members of Congress. Until that \nchanges, until the American people demand accountability--what we just \nheard was a flimsy excuse for not accepting this into the rules of the \nSenate. We voted on it. The American people deserve it. It is a sham.\n  I again ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration, and the Senate now proceed to S. 123; \nfurther that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the several \nrequests?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It strikes me as odd that the Senator from Oklahoma will \nnot acknowledge the obvious. The earmark reform language which he \nsupported, and the Senator from South Carolina supports, passed the \nSenate 98 to 0. It was part of the first comprehensive ethics reform \npackage this Senate has seen in many years; many years of Republican \nrule, I might add. We are\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nnow saying that the Appropriations Committee has voluntarily said, even \nbefore the conference committee that we are going to live by these \nstandards.\n  I will not quibble with the Senator from Oklahoma because he and I \nsee this quite differently. But authorizing a project does not mean it \nhas money. That is why we have authorizing committees and appropriating \ncommittees. I can authorize the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and the Milky \nWay, but I will not deliver any of those to anybody until I get to an \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When I am finished, I will. All of the authorization in \nthe world notwithstanding, unless you appropriate the money from the \nTreasury for the project, it is just a good idea that might happen.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I said I will. Allow me to finish my sentence. What I am \nsuggesting is, other committees may take this up as well on an interim \nbasis. But the bills that are going to move on the floor of the Senate \nare the appropriations bills. Now that the budget resolution is passed, \nour major obligation is to achieve something we haven't done for years. \nWe want to try to pass the appropriations bills on time. That means \nthat the time of the Senators from Oklahoma and South Carolina and all \nof us will be consumed with appropriations bills, and the rules we will \nplay by on earmarks for those bills which will be front and center, our \nmajor business, will be the same rule that you voted for, the vote that \nthe Senator from Oklahoma cast on this floor for earmark reform. So I \nsay to the Senator from Oklahoma, he can be prepared as these bills \ncome to the floor to see the very approach he has suggested be followed \nvoluntarily. In the meantime we have the assurance of the House that \nthis matter is going to conference committee.\n  Suggesting that we have abandoned our commitment to reform or calling \nit a flimsy excuse overstates the Senator's position.\n  I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators will please address other \nSenators through the Chair and refer to other Senators in the third \nperson, not in the first person.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois objects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4559-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 372, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 372) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n     2007 for the intelligence and intelligence-related activities \n     of the United States Government, the Intelligence Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Rockefeller/Bond amendment No. 843, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Collins amendment No. 847 (to amendment No. 843), to \n     reaffirm the constitutional and statutory protections \n     accorded sealed domestic mail.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Republican manager, Senator Bond, \nand I and our staffs have been working together to clear some \namendments, and we have in fact cleared already 10 amendments. I now \nask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senate to consider en \nbloc the following amendments, that they be agreed to en bloc, and that \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc. These were \nagreed to by both sides and have been cleared by all parties. The \nnumbers of the amendments are 845, 846, 856, 858, 859, 860, 861, 862, \n863, and 872.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the several requests?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is very important that we move forward \nwith this bill. We have given time for our colleagues to debate and \nraise other questions. We would ask that we be able to proceed in a \nreasonable timeframe to take up amendments which have been introduced \nby the chairman and the vice chairman together and reflect bipartisan \nagreement. As vice chairman, I am firmly committed to passage of \nintelligence reauthorization. I would say further it remains my \nintention to reduce the partisanship and politicization of intelligence \nmatters.\n  Events on the Senate floor yesterday, including direct personal \nattacks on me, indicate this remains a tall order. This bill makes \ngetting a bill harder, and it is already hard enough. Given the kitchen \nsink provided in the administration's Statement of Administration \nPolicy indicating a possible veto, the chairman and I are trying in \ngood faith, as the chairman indicated, to work through 9, 10, or a \ndozen amendments to correct the major objections that the \nadministration has.\n  The administration must know that as we try to weigh their key \npriorities, they must respect our priorities and our fundamental \noversight responsibility which I and the Members of this body should \ntake seriously, as any Senator will.\n  As for yesterday's events, Senator McConnell manages the floor for \nthe minority. He did not want to end the debate prematurely and the \nopportunity to offer amendments by the minority, especially with 18 \nMembers absent from the Senate due to bad weather. I supported him \nbecause it is the responsibility of our two leaders to manage the floor \ndebate and to protect the rights of minorities and absent Senators. \nWhile the attacks on me were inappropriate and offensive, I will \ncontinue to work for passage of this intelligence reform measure, which \nis one of the most important bills we can pass in this session. The \nmeasure is too important to be derailed by personal and political \nattacks.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle want more oversight of \nintelligence. I agree. We got into problems prior to 9/11 because we \ndidn't have good oversight. We have found that there are holes that \nneed to be plugged in oversight. We need to move forward. But forcing \nan end to the debate with 18 Members absent was not the way to do so. I \nam hoping that we can show progress by adopting amendments and moving \nthis bill forward to exercise our oversight to provide the intelligence \ncommunity the direction they need. Our desire is to move forward in the \nregular order, work our way through amendments, work out a time \nagreement, dispose of amendments, and hopefully conclude with a bill \nthat most, if not the overwhelming majority, of Members can support so \nwe can get to conference and continue the process.\n  I will continue to work with the chairman under the difficult \ncircumstances that he and I both face. I am not for delay or any \neffort, real or imagined, to kill this bill, but I have honest \nconcerns, as others, that there should be an opportunity to address \nthrough the regular order in a reasonable timeframe. If there are \nunreasonable delays, then we will pursue other options which are \nnecessary sometimes to move a bill.\n  Because of the difficult division present in recent years over these \nissues, we have been unable to get an authorization bill passed. I find \nthat unacceptable, and I am committed to finding a bill, but it can't \nbe just any bill. It must be the product of give and take and mutual \nrespect and compromise between both parties and both bodies and one the \nadministration can sign.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the vice chairman yield?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma has \nindicated to me that he will not object to the managers' amendment \ngoing forward, if he would be allowed to finish what he was talking \nabout, which I assume would happen within the next 5 or 8 minutes. If \nthat is the case, then we will have made progress.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I didn't mean to cut the Senator off. For \nthe movement of this bill, we had hoped to\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\nbe able to clear some amendments so we could show progress, but the \nSenator from Oklahoma is seeking recognition. I am sure he has some \nimportant things to say. I hope we will finish in time to allow us to \npass the cleared amendments prior to 12:30. I apologize to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Earmarks\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is very important we not leave the \ndebate on earmarks. What we saw was an issue about the integrity of \nCongress which Senator DeMint and myself have been championing. There \nare only 4 Members of the Senate who don't offer earmarks, 4 out of 100 \nwho don't play the game of earmarks. It is important that the American \npeople know that if we are going to have earmarks, it ought to be \nclearly identified. We ought to know who is benefiting, who is getting \nthe money, who is sponsoring the money, and what the outcome will be. \nIt is great that the Appropriations Committee has just stated that they \nare going to voluntarily accede to the rules we passed 98 to 0, except \nthere is one small problem with that; the fact is, there is no \nenforcement of the rules available to Senators when they violate that \nvery point, which means they may follow that, but if, in fact, they do \nnot, we have no course of action with which to raise a point of order \nwhen they do not.\n\n  I wish to go back to something the esteemed Senator from Illinois \nsaid, which is, we have gotten what we want. No, we have not. We have \nnot gotten it until the American people get the transparency they need \nabout how the Congress operates. If you eliminate earmarks in \nappropriations but do not eliminate earmarks in authorizations, what is \nauthorized as an earmark will come to the appropriation as not an \nearmark because it is then authorized, so we will play the same game \nbut one step further back.\n  I am disappointed at the leadership, that they would block what the \nAmerican people so fully want. And the idea we have to conference what \nshould be a Senate rule, when the House has already passed a rule--they \noperate under the very same thing Senator DeMint has asked for--all we \nhave to do is agree we will, in fact, abide by those rules by accepting \nthat as a rule of the Senate. Anything less than that is political \nWashington doublespeak which the American people are tired of.\n  There should not be one earmark, one special favor, one indication of \nanything done at any level--authorization or appropriations--the \nAmerican people are not fully aware of as to who has the vetted \ninterest and who will be the benefactor and what the motivations might \nbe in association with that.\n  So the fact the majority objects to incorporating what we obviously, \nsupposedly, all agreed to--or was it the fact that people voted for it \nbecause the people wanted us to and now we will not carry it out? What \nit does, by not adopting this rule, Senator DeMint's rule, is we \nundermine again the integrity of this body.\n  The American people deserve transparency. The American people should \nhave transparency. The only way we can truly be held accountable by the \nAmerican people is if they can see everything that is going on.\n  To deny this rule, to deny the fact we are going to operate in the \nopen, to deny the fact we are going to be held accountable is exactly \nwhat the American people are sick of.\n  I remind my colleagues we do not have a higher favorability rating \nthan the President at this time, whom we are so quick to impugn, and \nthe reason we do not is the very reason we saw in the objection placed \non this rule, this resolution. To me, it is a sad day in the Senate \nbecause we are playing games again with the American people. I said, \nafter we passed the ethics bill, it will be a long time until we see \nanything. It will be a long time. It has already been a long time. Why \nhasn't it been conferenced? There have been 80 days to conference an \nethics bill. There has not been the first step. There has not been the \nnaming of conferees. There has not been the first step to move forward \ntoward that.\n  The American people should surmise--and correctly--the Congress still \nwants to work in the shadows, they still do not want to have \ntransparency; therefore, they still do not want to be held accountable \nby the American people.\n  I thank you for the time and yield back, and I will offer no \nobjection to the request of the Senator from West Virginia to accept \namendments on the Intelligence authorization bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I may call up amendments Nos. 848, 849, 850, 851, \n852, and 853, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as I indicated before, the \ndistinguished Republican manager, Senator Bond, and I and our staffs \nhave been working together to clear some amendments. We have cleared \n10. I now ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senate to \nconsider en bloc the following amendments, that they be agreed to en \nbloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc. \nThe amendment numbers are 845, 846, 856, 858, 859, 860, 861, 862, 863, \nand 872.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from West Virginia \nhas the floor. I don't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia would be interested \nas to why it is the distinguished Senator from Texas objects.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee is now recognized.\n\n\n                   USCIS Naturalization Test Redesign\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me 5 \nminutes.\n  As my late friend Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' said, ``Find \nthe good and praise it.'' We talk an awful lot about illegal \nimmigration here in the Senate. The majority and minority leaders have \nboth said that before Memorial Day, we will bring up immigration reform \nin a comprehensive manner. I hope very much that we do that. That is \nour responsibility. It is too big a problem for one party to solve, and \nwe should work on it in a bipartisan way.\n  Today, I want to talk about legal immigration as opposed to illegal \nimmigration. About 650,000 individuals become U.S. citizens every year. \nEach of us has attended ceremonies where this happens. This is at the \nvery heart of our Nation. This is why we call the United States of \nAmerica the Nation of immigrants. What is so important about them is \nthat no one becomes an American based upon his or her race or where \ntheir grandparents came from. In fact, that is constitutionally \nimpermissible. One becomes an American by a remarkable oath of \nallegiance to this country as opposed to some other country, and then \ndemonstrating good character, being here for 5 years, and showing that \nyou know our common language, English, and an understanding of the U.S. \nhistory.\n  The importance of that was brought home to me last week when I was \nvisiting in Nashville. About 30 percent of all of the students in \nTennessee who have limited English proficiency happen to be in the \nNashville School District, and Pedro Garcia, the superintendent of \nschools, was telling me that many of those students who are not now \nAmerican citizens want to make sure they learn enough U.S. history in \nmiddle school and high school so they can pass the citizenship test and \nbecome Americans when they graduate.\n  Today, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is \nformally releasing the Citizen's Almanac. I call it to the attention of \nour colleagues. It is a collection of American symbols of freedom and \nliberty to be given to every newly sworn citizen, and that would be \n650,000 this year. It is built upon action that was taken earlier this \nyear by the USCIS to create a new and better citizenship test.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent that a fact \nsheet about the naturalization test redesign be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the purpose of that test is to simply \ngive new meaning to what it means to be an American. That oath of \nallegiance which these 650,000 new citizens will take is basically the \nsame oath that George Washington and his officers took at Valley Forge \nin 1778. It has a great deal of meaning. Other countries in the world \nhave not had the experience we have had helping people from around the \nworld become Americans. The English, the French, the Japanese, and the \nGermans are struggling with that right now, as people move in who are \nnot Japanese, German, English, or French. It is hard for them to become \npart of that national identity. We have not had that problem. We \nwelcome everyone based upon their understanding of the symbols and \ndocuments represented in the Citizen's Almanac. So if we don't teach \nabout these things in our schools or immigrants don't learn it in the \nnaturalization process, then we are not a united country.\n  As I have said many times on this floor, diversity is a great \nstrength of the United States of America, but it is not our greatest \nstrength. Our greatest strength is that we have been able to take all \nof this diversity and mold it into one country, not because of race or \nethnicity but because of a belief in a few principles and our common \nlanguage. We are able to say we are proud of where we came from, but we \nare prouder to be Americans.\n  I salute the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for this \ndocument, and the National Endowment for the Humanities for its hard \nwork on it. The Citizen's Almanac includes the patriotic anthems and \nsymbols of the United States, Presidential and historical speeches from \nPresidents Lincoln, Washington, Roosevelt, Kennedy and Reagan, and \nMartin Luther King, Jr., and landmark decisions of the Supreme Court. \nIt ought to be in every Senate office. It will be in every home of \nevery new citizen. It will be a good document to be in every school in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n [From the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and \n                  Immigration Services, Jan. 22, 2007]\n\n                   USCIS Naturalization Test Redesign\n\n       U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is \n     revising the naturalization test to create a test and testing \n     process that is standardized, fair and meaningful. A \n     standardized and fair naturalization test will include \n     uniform testing protocols and procedures nationwide to ensure \n     that there is no variation between offices. A meaningful test \n     will encourage civic learning and patriotism among \n     prospective citizens. A revised test, with an emphasis on the \n     fundamental concepts of American democracy and the rights and \n     responsibilities of citizenship, will help to encourage \n     citizenship applicants to learn and identify with the basic \n     values that we all share as Americans.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       During the past 10 years, the standardization and \n     meaningfulness of the naturalization test have come under \n     scrutiny. Various studies found that the exam lacked \n     standardized content, instruments, protocols or scoring \n     system. Inconsistencies were reported in the way the exams \n     were administered nationwide, and there was no assessment of \n     whether applicants had a meaningful understanding of U.S. \n     history and government.\n       To address these concerns, Immigration and Naturalization \n     Services (INS) launched a test redesign project in 2000 that \n     has included technical assistance from several test \n     development contractors, the National Academy of Sciences, a \n     panel of history and U.S. government scholars, and a panel of \n     English as a Second Language (ESL) experts. In addition, \n     USCIS has sought input from a variety of stakeholders, \n     including immigrant advocacy groups, citizenship instructors, \n     ESL teachers, and USCIS District Adjudications Officers.\n\n                   Changes to the naturalization test\n\n       The reading and writing portions of the pilot \n     naturalization exam is similar to the current test except \n     that the new exam contains more civics-based vocabulary. \n     Applicants will still have up to three chances to read and \n     write a sentence correctly in English. In the writing section \n     of the test, the testing officer will dictate a sentence and \n     ask the applicant to write everything the officer reads. \n     During the reading portion\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\n     of the test, the test officer will ask the applicant to read \n     each word out loud in that sentence.\n       The proposed format for the new civics exam will still \n     require applicants to correctly answer six out of 10 \n     questions chosen from a master list of 100 civics questions \n     and answers. The difference is that the new sentences will \n     now focus on civics and history topics, rather than the \n     general range of topics on the current test. USCIS has placed \n     these questions and answers, along with a study guide on the \n     Internet and elsewhere in the public domain to help \n     applicants prepare.\n       Q. What are the new civics questions and English vocabulary \n     list items?\n       A. USCIS posted has made the English vocabulary lists \n     available at: www.uscis.gov/natzpilot.\n       Q. How were the questions developed?\n       A. English Items. A panel of English as a Second Language \n     (ESL) and other test development experts chosen by the \n     association of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other \n     Languages (TESOL) developed the English items. The TESOL \n     panel established an English language level for the test \n     consistent with Department of Education reporting levels for \n     adult basic education.\n       Civics Items. The TESOL panel also assisted in drafting and \n     reviewing civics questions using a content framework \n     identified by the Office of Citizenship from a review of \n     government authorized civics and citizenship texts, the U.S. \n     Department of Education's National Standards for Civics and \n     Government, the current naturalization test, and the study \n     guide developed by a panel of experts assembled by USCIS in \n     2004.\n       Q. How are the new questions an improvement over the old \n     questions?\n       A. By weighing the questions on the new civics and U.S. \n     history test we will ensure that all test forms are at the \n     same cognitive and language level. By creating test forms at \n     the same level of difficulty, we are ensuring that an \n     applicant who goes for an interview in one city of the \n     country has the same chance of passing the test as in any \n     other city. The English vocabulary on the new test is also \n     fairer because it is targeted at a language level consistent \n     with the Department of Education reporting standards for the \n     level required by Section 312 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act. District Adjudication Officers are being \n     trained to administer and score the naturalization tests in \n     the same way nationwide to ensure uniform administration of \n     the test.\n       Applicants will receive a study guide on the new civics and \n     U.S. history questions so they can deepen their knowledge and \n     understanding of our Nation as they prepare for the exam. The \n     new items will focus less on redundant and trivial questions \n     based on rote memorization and will focus on concepts, such \n     as the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Some items \n     on the current test fit those needs and required little \n     content change, so several items from the current test will \n     appear on the revised test. The range of acceptable answers \n     to each question will also increase so that applicants can \n     learn more about a topic and select from a wider range of \n     acceptable answers. And finally, the reading and writing test \n     will provide a tool for civic learning because the vocabulary \n     list is civics-based.\n       Q. How will the interview process change for applicants?\n       A. The interview process will not change.\n\n\n                             PILOT PROGRAM\n\n       As part of the test redesign, USCIS will conduct a pilot \n     program in ten cities beginning in February 2007 to ensure \n     the agency has all the information necessary before the new \n     test is fully implemented nationwide in 2008. During this \n     pilot, USCIS will carefully analyze the new test questions to \n     make certain that the questions are fair and work as they \n     were intended. USCIS will also collect information about \n     testing procedures, to include feedback from DAOs, to help \n     refine the testing procedures and facilitate the smooth \n     transition to the new naturalization exam.\n       Q. What will USCIS pilot?\n       A. USCIS plans to pilot 142 U.S. history and government \n     questions and approximately 36 reading and 36 writing items. \n     The topic areas include principals of American democracy, \n     system of government, rule of law, rights and \n     responsibilities, American History, and geography. About half \n     of the questions include rephrased versions of questions on \n     the current test. All citizenship applicants in the 10 pilot \n     areas who are scheduled for their naturalization test during \n     the pilot will receive advance copies of the civics questions \n     and the two lists of vocabulary for self-study. USCIS has \n     also posted these study materials on the web at: http://\nwww.uscis.gov/natzpilot. The actual test will become \n     available to the public.\n       Q. How were the questions selected?\n       A. The TESOL panel assisted USCIS in drafting and reviewing \n     civics questions using best practices and conventional sample \n     techniques, such as regression analysis, currently used in \n     private industry.\n       Q. Where are the test sites?\n       A. The pilot program will run in 10 cities that were \n     randomly selected based on citizenship application volume. \n     The ten pilot sites are: Albany, NY, Boston, MA; Charleston, \n     S.C.; Denver; EL Paso, Texas; Kansas City, Mo.; Miami; San \n     Antonio, Texas; Tucson, Ariz.; and Yakima, Wash.\n       Q. How were the 10 pilot cities selected?\n       A. To capture the diversity of USCIS offices and \n     applicants, USCIS randomly selected a representative sample \n     of 10 districts by geographic region and the volume of \n     applications that were processed in each office to conduct \n     the pilot. This method will help insure that the final \n     results can be made with equal accuracy and statistical \n     weight.\n       Q. What is the purpose of the pilot?\n       A. A pilot is a crucial component of any test design \n     process. A pilot ensures that the draft test items, scoring \n     rubrics, and administration processes are appropriate, not \n     too difficult, and elicit the responses we expect.\n       Q. How will USCIS conduct the pilot?\n       A. USCIS must administer about 6,000 tests to achieve a \n     representative and significant study.\n       Pilots will begin in February 2007 and will last between \n     two to four months.\n       USCIS trained the test administrators on the new exam \n     process.\n       USCIS will mail a notification to all applicants scheduled \n     for an interview at the pilot sites during the pilot period \n     informing them that they have the opportunity to participate \n     in the national pilot program.\n       Applicants will also receive a letter explaining the pilot \n     and study questions.\n       Applicants who take the pilot but do not pass one or more \n     parts will have the opportunity to take the current test or \n     part of the current test immediately during the interview, \n     thus giving them an additional opportunity to pass the \n     naturalization test.\n       Many of the questions on the pilot test and the current \n     test cover the same subjects, so additional preparation is \n     expected to be minimal.\n       Once pilot results have been analyzed, piloted items will \n     be revised accordingly.\n       Q. Must applicants participate in the pilot?\n       A. No. Applicants will have the choice to decline \n     participation in the pilot test. For those who decline, they \n     will be given the current test.\n       USCIS will continue to meet with local immigrant service \n     providers, advocates, and ESL teachers in pilot sites to gain \n     their support so that they can encourage immigrants to \n     participate in their government and make this a successful \n     pilot.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeingold and I be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as chairman of \nthe Rules Committee to speak about a bill that the Committee heard and \npassed out unanimously a short time ago. That bill is entitled the \n``Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.'' It is sponsored by Senators \nFeingold, Cochran, and 32 other Senators. It would require that Senate \ncampaign finance reports be filed electronically rather than in paper \nformat. That is all the bill does.\n  Currently, House candidates, Presidential candidates, political \naction committees, and party committees are all required to file \nelectronically, and they do. But Senators, Senate candidates, \nauthorized campaign committees, and the Democratic and Republican \nSenate campaign committees are exempt. As a result, we have a very \ncumbersome system in which paper copies of disclosure reports are filed \nwith the Senate Office of Public Records, which then scans them, makes \nan electronic copy of them, and sends that copy to the FEC on a \ndedicated communications line. The FEC then prints the report and sends \nit to a vendor in Fredericksburg, VA, where the information is keyed in \nby hand and transferred back to the FEC database. All of this costs \nabout $250,000, and it is a waste of money, a waste of staff, and a \nwaste of time.\n  At our hearing on February 14 on this bill--and this bill is just on \nthis point--it was clear that there was no public opposition to this \nproposal, only public support. The bill has been hotlined. It has \ncleared on the Democratic side. It has not cleared on the Republican \nside.\n  Now, again, this bill says we will just allow us to electronically \nfile our quarterly reports. I just electronically filed my quarterly \nreports. I then gave a paper copy to the Secretary of the Senate. This \nis exactly the type of good-government law the Senate can adopt as a \nstand-alone measure.\n  I hope we move this legislation today, without burdening it with \nother items. It is really long past time to bring the Senate into the \nmodern era. So I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in ensuring timely access and disclosure of Senate finance \ncampaign activities and bring that information before the public.\n  I will now yield to the author of the legislation, the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nam very pleased to be here with her today. I sincerely thank the \nSenator from California for moving the Senate Campaign Disclosure \nParity Act through the Rules Committee so that we are now in a position \nto finally pass this legislation. As the Senator from California \nindicated, at last count, we now have 35 cosponsors for S. 223, 20 \nDemocrats and 15 Republicans, and no known opposition.\n  The bill fixes the anomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly \nimpossible for the public to get timely access to Senate campaign \nfinance reports, even though most other reports are available on the \nInternet within 24 hours of their filing with the Federal Election \nCommission, FEC. This bill will finally bring Senate campaigns into the \n21st century by amending the section of the election laws dealing with \nelectronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the \nSenate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 \nhours.\n  This step is long overdue. There is no excuse for keeping our own \ncampaign finance information inaccessible to the public when the \ninformation filed by House and Presidential candidates, PACs, parties, \nand even 527 organizations is readily available almost immediately. The \nWashington Post has called the outmoded Senate campaign reporting \nsystem ``obviously unjustified,'' and Roll Call has called it \n``indefensible.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  The current system means that the FEC's detailed coding, which allows \nthe press and the public to do more sophisticated searches and \nanalysis, is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for \nHouse reports. It means that the final disclosure reports covering the \nfirst 2 weeks of October are often not available for detailed scrutiny \nuntil after the election. That is scandalous and there is no good \nreason for it.\n  Let me just say that I know that the election laws have a big impact \non campaigns and all Senators have a strong personal stake in vetting \nchanges to those laws. I am very familiar with controversial and \ncontested campaign finance legislation. This isn't that kind of bill. \nThis bill is as close to a no-brainer as you can get in this area.\n  In addition to bipartisan support here in the Senate, major media \noutlets have endorsed it, as have bloggers on the left and the right. \nNo one that I know of opposes it. And yet, it has now been nearly 3 and \na half years since I first introduced it. That is nearly half as long \nas it took us to pass McCain-Feingold. I know McCain-Feingold. You \nmight say McCain-Feingold is a friend of mine. This bill is no McCain-\nFeingold.\n  As I understand it, this bill has cleared the Democratic side. Given \nthe strong support for it from across the political spectrum, and \ncosponsorship from many Republican Senators, and I especially thank \nSenator Cochran for being the main author along with me. I sincerely \nhope there won't be an objection on the Republican side. It would be \nwrong to hold this bill up as some kind of bargaining chip. It is time \nfor the Senate to pass this bill, and I hope that can be done today.\n  Once again, I thank the Senator from California, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I will ask a question of the \nSenator from Wisconsin. First, I thank him for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  If I can ask the Senator, is there any item in this bill other than \nelectronic filing?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No, there is not.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Doesn't this bill simply enable Members of the \nSenate, just as every other political office does, to file directly \nelectronically their finance reports?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is all it does.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, this is such a simple, direct bill with respect to \ntransparency. It is an idea whose time has long come. It happens \neverywhere else except for the Senate, Senate committees, and the \nSenate campaign committees. The time is long overdue to pass this bill. \nIt is such a simple, good-government issue. It is very hard for me to \nunderstand who could oppose this and what their reason for opposing it \ncould be. I hope that if there is opposition in this Senate, the Member \nwould be willing to come down to the floor and express why they would \noppose this bill.\n  We have the solid support of the entire Rules Committee. This bill \nwas easy to pass out of committee. It was easy to hotline on the \nDemocratic side, and it should be easy to pass by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 96, S. 223, a bill to require \nSenate candidates to file designations, statements, and reports in \nelectronic forms; that the committee-reported amendment be considered \nand agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed; \nand that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of a Republican Senator, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Action on Amendments Nos. 856 and 859 Vitiated\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious action on amendments Nos. 856 and 859 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 \np.m. today, the motion to proceed to the motion to reconsider be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be agreed to, and without further \ninterning action, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 372, the Intelligence authorization bill; further, that \nMembers have until 4:45 p.m. to file any second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I should say this has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business \nfor half an hour, although I probably will not speak that long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this year I gave a series of \nstatements on this floor on the Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nBack then, I said I was informing my colleagues because in the near \nfuture Congress would consider some fundamental changes in how the \nbenefit works.\n  Well, for the entire Senate, the future is now. Last week the Senate \nFinance Committee marked up legislation on the so-called prohibition on \nGovernment negotiations under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nWhen I gave these four statements during February, I said it was \nimportant for the public and also for Medicare\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nbeneficiaries to understand the proposed changes, and that it was \nequally important to explore the effects these changes would have.\n  Those reasons still hold true this very day. They are even more \nimportant now as the Senate gears up for action on that ill-advised \nlegislation. I will inform my colleagues on this topic today, tomorrow, \nand the rest of the week, if I need to, because I want to make sure \neveryone understands the consequences of this legislation that is going \nto change the Medicare Program and hurt the Medicare Program, a program \nthat is working; that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I am willing to \ntalk about this issue until I am blue in the face.\n  First, everyone should recognize that political opponents of the drug \nbenefit that we call Part D of Medicare have tried for 4 years to tear \nthis benefit apart since day one. Day one dates back to December 2003, \nwhen the President signed the bill. These naysayers feel Government can \nalways manage better. They want a Government-run benefit program of \ndrugs in Medicare, and they want the Federal Government dictating drug \nprices, as if the Federal Government can dictate drug prices.\n  Thankfully, the naysayers lost when that legislation was being \nconsidered. But that has not stopped them from constantly whining and \ncarping about the drug benefit that is now law. The naysayers said \nthere would be no prescription drug plans. Then when there were plenty \nof prescription drug plans coming into the system, approved by the \nSecretary of HHS to administer to the seniors of America, they said \nthere were too many plans.\n  The naysayers said it was too confusing, that the seniors would not \nbe able to choose plans, even arguing that there would be a small \nnumber of seniors signing up.\n  But the seniors have enrolled. In fact, 92 percent of the seniors in \nAmerica are covered by a prescription drug plan. And what about their \nsatisfaction? Interviews show a great deal of satisfaction on the part \nof seniors with the plans.\n  Then the naysayers suggested plans could change their prices and the \ndrugs they cover at the drop of a hat, which has not happened. So the \nnaysayers were wrong again. They did all they could to taint \nbeneficiaries' views of the benefits before it even got off the ground. \nBut the naysayers' biggest criticism of the drug benefit is that, \naccording to them, the Government does not negotiate with drugmakers \nfor lower prices.\n  Now I will show you how silly that is and how wrong that is and, more \nimportantly, how misleading that is. I say according to ``them,'' \nmeaning according to the naysayers, because they have gone to great \nlengths to make it sound as though nobody is negotiating with drug \ncompanies. If you believe the naysayers out there, you would think that \ndrug companies name their price and Medicare is forced to pay it. That \nis so wrong that it truly boggles the mind. It seems to me, as I see \nthese arguments, there is no embarrassment on the part of the \nnaysayers' part.\n\n  Now, it is correct, of course, that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices himself does not negotiate with drug companies, but it is \nabsolutely not correct to say there are no negotiations. That is \ncomplete and utter nonsense. It is embarrassingly wrong. Under the \nMedicare drug benefit, multiple drug plans compete against each other \nfor the membership of seniors and disabled people covered by Medicare. \nThese plans compete to get the lowest prices from manufacturers, for \nyou as a member, because they want to keep you as a member.\n  In fact, these plans want to be the best negotiators and to offer \nbeneficiaries the best possible drug plan with low premiums, low cost \nsharing, and even with additional benefits. They compete to be the plan \nthat beneficiaries want to join.\n  Now, is this something new? No, it is nothing new. This is the same \napproach used for health care benefits for every Member of Congress, \nand 3 million Federal employees, under what we call the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefit Program. If beneficiaries do not like the job \ntheir plan is doing, you can fire your plan. You can leave it, join \nanother plan. You can choose a better plan. Yet, you see, it is \nactually very simple how this works; very simple. Harnessing the power \nof competition among plans gives the Medicare Program beneficiaries and \nthe taxpayers access to better negotiation than anything the Government \ncould do on its own.\n  In fact, there are five negotiators out there that are negotiating in \na bigger way than even the Federal Government can. Can you imagine \nthat, there are five negotiators that are bigger than the Federal \nGovernment that were negotiating this? Competition, then, is the \nmainstay of our free market economy. Businesses compete every day in \nalmost every sector of our economy to produce the products consumers \nmost want at a price that consumers pay, which is probably what \nconsumers can afford.\n  But the naysayers of the drug benefit somehow do not like that. They \nare uncomfortable with the free market. They want the Government to run \neverything. They want the Government itself doing the negotiation. They \nfind it hard to believe anyone could do a better job negotiating than \nbig Government.\n  Of course, along the lines, they are ignoring the simple fact that \ncompetition is working. They are ignoring that competition has led to \nlower premiums, $22 this year instead of $23 last year, instead of $37 \nwhen we wrote the legislation.\n  They are ignoring that competition is bringing choices to \nbeneficiaries, those who said we would never have choice, that you \ncould not use plans because plans would not work. You know what. Those \nvery Members of Congress are wrong, because in my State there are 43 \nplans. Will there always be 43 plans? No, I imagine there are some that \nare small, will weed themselves out, will be bought. These people are \nignoring that the Government is not actually very good at figuring out \nwhat it should pay for drugs. They are ignoring the fact to carry on \nwith the political scam that they committed against beneficiaries and \nagainst the public.\n  I have a chart I used a month ago that I want to show again. On it is \na quote from the Washington Post, recognizing as well, when it wrote \nthe following in an editorial, that this is a political scam and that \ngovernments don't do a very good job of negotiating:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. Government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  We knew this because of the Government's experience paying for drugs \ncovered by Medicare Part B. There are not very many drugs covered by \nMedicare Part B, but there have been a few and over a long period of \ntime. What did we learn from that experience of Part B Medicare? These \nhappen to be the drugs that are given during a physician's office visit \nor other drugs such as oral cancer drugs. Medicare payments for these \ndrugs were based on what is called the average wholesale price, AWP. It \nis similar to a sticker price for a car. No one actually pays that \nprice on the sticker of a car. The joke was that average wholesale \nprice or AWP actually stood for ``ain't what's paid.'' Over the past \ndecade, reports issued by the inspector general, by the Department of \nJustice, and by the Government Accountability Office found that by \nrelying on average wholesale price, Medicare was vastly overpaying for \nthese drugs. Recommendations were made to change payments so they \nreflected actual market cost. The Clinton administration tried to make \nsome of these changes but after pushback from providers, it backed off.\n  Congress took another run at this issue in 2003 in the Medicare \nModernization Act and was successful. Congress reformed how Medicare \npays these drugs under Part B, not Part D. Medicare now bases its \npayment for many of these drugs on a market-based price, a real price, \nnot the average wholesale price, not the ``ain't what's paid'' price \nbecause it wasn't paid. This change, believe it or not, is saving the \ntaxpayers and beneficiaries, but it took years to get that fixed. In \nall that time, Medicare and taxpayers paid too many dollars for drugs, \nwasted money, billions and billions of dollars wasted. So using the \nPart B tradition, we don't want to make the same mistake. We don't want \nto repeat that experience under the new Part D of drugs for Medicare.\n  We also knew Medicare overpays for a lot of other services and \nequipment.\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nThe bookshelves are full of other reports from the General Accounting \nOffice, from the inspector general, from the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, from the Congressional Budget Office, and others, about how \nMedicare is paying too much in too many areas. For example, Medicare \noverpaid for durable medical equipment for years until the Republican-\nled Congress made changes in the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. In \naddition, each year the Office of Inspector General issues what is \ncalled the Red Book, which presents cost savings recommendations. The \nbooks are usually 50 or more pages long, and the recommendations span \nall aspects of Medicare--hospitals, physicians, home health care plans, \nand others. This is more evidence of the many areas where Medicare \ndoesn't get the best deal.\n  Congress has even created the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \ncalled MedPAC, to provide advice to Congress on payments for services. \nEvery year, Congress hears recommendations from MedPAC to address \nMedicare overpayments, but many times it takes years for the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services or for the entire Congress to act to save \nthe taxpayers money. In making recommendations, MedPAC looks at profit \nmargins, for example. One type of provider had been found to have \nmargins of 17 percent off of Medicare payments. The Congress has been \nable to act on many MedPAC recommendations, but it can be very hard to \naccomplish these changes. I remember when I was chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee over the last 4 years. I received letters from \nMembers saying something like: Please don't cut payments for this \nprovider group or that provider group.\n  In fact, on the Senate floor just before recess, I fought to prevent \nthis very Senate from freezing a Center for Medicare Services' rule \nthat would have prevented wasteful spending in the program we call \nMedicaid. Is the rule a good thing or a bad thing? We didn't bother to \nhold the first hearing on the subject. The only thing that mattered was \nthat a group of providers complained. Like the Clinton administration \nfound, letters and complaints such as that can make it difficult, in \nthe very short order, to do anything about a problem, despite the \ncompelling evidence of overpayments, despite the high profit margins, \ndespite the fact that a proposed change could save taxpayers billions \nof dollars.\n  Those of us who wrote the Part D Medicare drug plan passed 4 years \nago--and that was mostly Senator Baucus for the Democrats and me for \nthe Republicans--were concerned that this same kind of dynamic might \nhappen with this Part D program. Political pressures on Medicare drug \nbenefits would tie the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. If that happens, the programs would be unmanageable and costs \nwould skyrocket. Instead, Congress put competing private plans in \ncharge of negotiating. These plans and their negotiators have years of \nexperience in this arena. This is what they do for a living. Health and \nHuman Services has had very little experience and a very dismal track \nrecord.\n  On this chart, these plans and their negotiators and managers have \npowerful bargaining clout in the market. They manage the drug coverage \nfor tens of millions of people. There are plans that cover upwards of \n50 million people--75 million, in one case--far more than the 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. Clearly, Medicare beneficiaries account \nfor a large number of all prescriptions filled each year, so some might \nargue that 41 million beneficiaries have more clout than 75 million \nnonbeneficiaries, but numbers alone do not necessarily translate into \nlower costs.\n  As evidence of that, we had all sorts of experts come before the \nFinance Committee in January on this very topic. In response to \nquestions I asked, particularly of Professor Scott Morton of Yale \nUniversity, he said it doesn't matter whether you negotiate on behalf \nof 1 million or 43 million people; what matters is what leverage you \nhave and how you use that leverage.\n  I think I ought to emphasize that. It is how you use the leverage. So \nit is what is done to leverage those numbers, then, that leads to lower \ncosts. That leverage comes from the plan being able to say to a drug \ncompany something such as: I can get a better deal on drug A from a \ndifferent manufacturer that has the same clinical effect as your drug \nB. If you can't match it or do better, then I am going to leave the \ntable.\n\n  Some plans will get a better deal on drug A and put it in their \nformulary. Some plans will get a better deal on drug B. But many \nexperts agree--and experience suggests--that it would be difficult for \nthe Government itself, our Government, to walk away from the table. \nThere would be enormous pressure to cover everything. If it did, the \nnegotiating power lies not with the Government but with the \nmanufacturers.\n  Here is what Professor Scott Morton said would happen if someone \nnegotiating drug prices couldn't have a formulary:\n\n       Each manufacturer would know that, fundamentally, Medicare \n     must purchase all products. The Medicare ``negotiator'' would \n     have no bargaining leverage, and therefore, simply allowing \n     bargaining on its own would not lead to substantially lower \n     prices.\n\n  At the same hearing, we had another witness. That witness was Mr. \nEdward Haislmaier, of the Heritage Institute. I would like to quote him \nfrom his written testimony:\n\n       [that] volume purchasing encourages manufacturer \n     discounting, it is not, in and of itself, sufficient to \n     extract large discounts. Manufacturers will only offer \n     substantial discounts if the buyer combines the ``carrot'' of \n     volume with the ``stick'' of being able to substitute one \n     supplier's goods with those of another.\n\n  In drug negotiations, that stick is called a formulary. Plans \nparticipating in drug benefits can use that stick. Expert after expert \nagrees it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Government, \nhowever, to use that stick under Medicare. In fact, in a November 2 \nWall Street Journal opinion piece, Dr. Allen Enthoven, an economist at \nStanford University, wrote:\n\n       When the government negotiates, its hands are tied because \n     there are few drugs it can exclude without facing political \n     backlash from doctors and the Medicare population, a very \n     influential group of voters.\n\n  Let's be honest with each other. What do you think would happen in \nthe Senate if the Center for Medicare Services, CMS, tried to cut a \nlarge drug company headquartered in New Jersey or North Carolina, for \nexample, completely out of Part D because they wouldn't meet the \nGovernment's price demands? Would Senators from those States say \nsomething such as: Oh, well, that is just too bad? Would any of you say \nthat if it was in your State that a manufacturer was being cut out? \nAgain, let's be honest with each other.\n  What are we left with then? At the January Senate Finance Committee \nhearing, Professor Scott Morton said that without a formulary--the \n``stick,'' as I refer to it--the Secretary would have about as much \nnegotiating power as you would get by calling a drug maker and saying \nsomething such as: I would like you to offer a lower price. Their \nanswer might be: Why should I? You have to buy my drug, so why would I \noffer you a lower price? About all you have left after that is: Please, \nwon't you give me a lower price? That is not going to get you very far.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle think this bill is going \nto achieve real savings for consumers or the Federal Government, they \nmust have some ideas in mind. I can't believe my friends would come to \nthe Senate floor with a bill that is truly as ``do nothing'' as CBO \ndescribes it.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office said about S. 3. It \nwould have ``a negligible effect on federal spending.'' Another quote:\n\n       Without the authority to establish a formulary, we believe \n     that the Secretary would not be able to encourage the use of \n     particular drugs by Part D beneficiaries, and as a result \n     would lack the leverage to obtain significant discounts in \n     his negotiations with drug manufacturers.\n\n  So let me repeat that other quote: It would have ``a negligible \neffect on federal spending.''\n  The bill we are considering and voting on tomorrow cannot possibly be \nas innocuous or inconsequential as what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid. Certainly, there must be creative ideas out there to find savings \nwe have not considered.\n  Since the Finance Committee's markup of S. 3 the other night, I have \nbeen considering how a Secretary\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nmight use his imagination to find savings. One of the first places we \nlooked at was H.R. 4, the bill that passed the Senate.\n  H.R. 4 struck the language in the statute that prevents the Secretary \nfrom instituting a price structure for reimbursement of covered drugs. \nDid the House strike the ban because they want an imaginative Secretary \nto use price controls as part of negotiations? Because all we have \nheard is they do not want price controls.\n  Last Thursday night, we offered an amendment to S. 3 to prevent the \nSecretary from using a preferred drug list, or PDLs as they are called. \nA preferred drug list is just a formulary under a different name. It is \nessentially a Government-controlled list of drugs that you can or \ncannot have.\n  While I do not think there is a difference between formularies and \npreferred drug lists, we have seen the courts rule that a State can use \none in Medicaid even though Medicaid bans the use of formularies.\n  So Thursday night, we had an amendment to prevent the Secretary from \nusing preferred drug lists. After all, we do not want the Secretary \ncoming up with a list of drugs you can or cannot take, do we?\n  To my surprise, the Democrats on the committee rejected my amendment. \nSo what is going on? Perhaps they think that having the Government \nestablish a preferred drug list is one of the imaginative ideas a \nSecretary will be able to use to save money.\n  I think this bill is a Trojan Horse. It is dressed up as a do-nothing \nmessage bill. But before the week is out, we are going to look inside \nthat horse and see all the bad that could be waiting to hurt \nbeneficiaries. We will see what is bad in this bill that will hurt \naccess and choices beneficiaries currently have in this Medicare drug \nbenefit program.\n  Maintaining access and choice--access and choice--is critical because \nbeneficiaries have different drug needs. The way the benefit is \nstructured now is that plans can have different formularies. Some might \nget a good price on one drug; another might get a better price on \nanother drug. They can have different formularies, and beneficiaries \ncan have choices that meet their needs.\n  When Congress finished work on the new drug benefit in 2003, we knew \nit was an experiment. Nothing like this had ever been tried. Here is \nwhat we learned: Private competition works. It has been successful at \nkeeping costs down. The 25 most used drugs by seniors cost 35 percent \nless. Plan bids have come in lower than expected. This year, they were \ndown 10 percent from last year's bids.\n  Premiums are lower than they were estimated to be. Before 2006, \nMedicare's chief actuary estimated the average monthly premium would be \n$37, but it was actually $23 in 2006. That is 38 percent lower than \nexpected. Because of the strong competition between plans, the average \npremiums for beneficiaries is expected to be about $22 in 2007, not the \n$39 that had been estimated.\n  Why? Private competition works.\n  The net cost to the Federal Government is also lower than expected. \nIn January, the official Medicare actuary announced that the net 10-\nyear cost of Part D has dropped by $189 billion over the original \nbudget window used when the Medicare Modernization Act was enacted. \nThat is 2004 to 2013. That is a 30-percent drop in the actual cost \ncompared to the projection.\n  Why? Because private competition works.\n  The savings are unheard of for a Government program of any kind. \nWhere else have you ever heard of a cost underrun in a Federal program?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, could I please have 4 more minutes? I \nask unanimous consent for that additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to emphasize: We have a cost underrun in a \nFederal program. When have you ever heard of that?\n  You could not get those lower prices and lower costs unless the \nprescription drug plans are being strong negotiators with the drug \nmakers. States are also saving money in lower contributions, better \nknown as ``clawback'' payments. State clawback payments are now \nprojected to be $37 billion less over a 10-year period. That is 27 \npercent lower. Just in 2006, States saved $700 million.\n  Why? Because private competition is working.\n  The plans are negotiating lower prices for drugs. I have said so many \ntimes, for the top 25 drugs used by seniors, the Medicare prescription \ndrug plans have been able to negotiate prices that on average are 35 \npercent lower than the average cash price at retail pharmacies--35 \npercent lower.\n  Why? Because private competition is working.\n  Here are some examples: Lipitor is 15 percent lower, Atenolol is 63 \npercent lower, while Fosamax is 30 percent lower. I could go on down \nthe list.\n  Now, when the drug benefit was signed into law, we believed it would \nwork and hold down costs. That is certainly happening today even more \nthan we expected because private competition works.\n  We also said that if it did not work--if the negotiating model used \nfor the drug benefit did not hold down costs--then Congress would need \nto reexamine things. If costs grew too fast, then the whole idea would \nhave to be revisited.\n  Maybe we would have to restrict access to drugs. Maybe we would have \nto rely more on mail order pharmacies instead of liberal access to \nlocal retail pharmacies. Maybe more drastic cost-cutting measures would \nbe needed.\n  But that is not the position we are in today. Why? Because private \ncompetition works.\n  I hate to sound like a broken record, but I think the naysayers out \nthere need a little repetition therapy. Everyone has heard the old \nsaying that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It certainly applies \nhere, and the evidence shows it.\n  I would like to be the first one to say that the Medicare drug \nbenefit is not perfect. There are improvements that can be made. \nCongress should look at ways to make it easier for low-income \nbeneficiaries to get the additional assistance they need by reexamining \nthe low-income subsidy asset test.\n  We need to look at payments to pharmacies and make some reforms in \nthat area. We need to look at ways we can simplify the enrollment \nprocess. And there are other areas where we can make improvements.\n  But one area that is working very well is the negotiating power of \nMedicare drug plans. They have shown their ability to hold down costs. \nIt is working.\n  The pleas from the naysayers to put the Government in charge of \nnegotiating are about politics, not policy. These voices have not given \nup in their misguided quest to score political points with the drug \nbenefit. It saddens me the Democratically controlled Congress has \ndevoted so much time to this issue rather than looking at some of the \nimprovements we can make in Part D that I mentioned.\n  Why they have put politics ahead of constructive changes is beyond \nme.\n  In January, I had hoped we could put politics aside and focus on some \nof the real improvements we could be making with the drug benefit. But, \nsadly, that is not the case, and that is why I am here today.\n  Under the drug benefit today, with the plans negotiating with drug \nmakers and competing with each other, we have lower drug prices for \nbeneficiaries, lower program costs for the Government--saving the \ntaxpayers money--and prescription drug choices for beneficiaries.\n  Private competition works.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 3. It is a big \ngovernment takeover of the private market that is working for the \nMedicare benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just comment. I did not come to the floor to \nspeak about the bill specifically. I wish to speak about the \nalternative minimum tax in a moment. But I cannot help, since I am a \nmember of the committee--listening to the ranking member talk about \nMedicare and what the\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nimpact of allowing Medicare the possibility of being able to negotiate \nmight or might not be--but speak to that for a moment, if I can.\n  I think most Americans understand, as a matter of common sense, that \nwhen an entity that represents their tax dollars has the ability to go \nout into the marketplace and negotiate for a price, the probability \nthey are going to have saved tax dollars is pretty real, if there is a \ngood and decent negotiation.\n  The resistance of the Senator from Iowa and others is interesting \nbecause it is a resistance that represents the power of big companies \nin the country--the drug companies--to sort of say: Hey, we kind of \nlike the system the way it is--which we understand because the profits \nare enormous. But our job is to represent the taxpayers' dollars. Our \njob is also to use the marketplace thoughtfully.\n  I do not know what it is that suggests, on the one hand, it is \nlegitimate for the Veterans' Administration to go out as a Government \nentity and negotiate a lower price for the drugs it purchases to \ndistribute to veterans--which we do--but it is not OK for Medicare--\nwhich is another Government program that costs the taxpayers a lot of \nmoney--to be able to go out and negotiate a lower price for seniors. It \nis illogical.\n  What they do is come in and try to scare people and say: Well, we \nhave given this special privilege to the Veterans' Administration, but \nif all of a sudden we allow somebody else to negotiate it, then the \nveterans are not going to get as good a deal.\n  Well, nobody knows that until you go out into the marketplace. The \nVeterans' Administration and Medicare together still do not represent \nthe entire market. You are going to have an incredible number of \nprivate citizens still purchasing through private health care plans or \ntheir HMOs or other plans--private as they are--also.\n  The marketplace is still going to have its capacity to work. This is \nnot such a large block that it represents a complete and total \neradication of a marketplace, No. 1. No. 2, there are other countries \nwhere you have this kind of negotiated fee for the service being \nprovided which has worked very effectively.\n  I think the bottom line is that people have to remember that this \nlegislation we are talking about does not order the Secretary to do \nthis. It is pretty obvious under this administration it is not going to \nhappen because they do not believe in it. All we are doing is lifting \nthe prohibition against the Secretary doing it. So if all the negative \nthings the Senator talks about are true, a smart Secretary is not going \nto do them because they are negative.\n  But why would you put in place a prohibition? Why do you specifically \nsay: No, the Secretary can't go out and negotiate the price. You are \nstuck with the status quo. You are stuck with the current system. The \nreason is very simple: because it is a lot of money out of the pockets \nof taxpayers into the pockets of the big companies. That is it, and \nthey are here protecting that.\n  This is a question of whether we are simply going to lift the \nprohibition, let the Secretary make the judgment. Can you go out into \nthe market? Can you do this without hurting veterans? Can you do it \nwithout upsetting the marketplace? Can you do it and still have the \nkind of resources you want put into the research of new drugs and other \nthings? I am confident a Secretary is going to make a smart decision.\n\n  It is interesting to see the people who usually spend the most time \narguing in this country ``don't let the government interfere'' are the \nones who are standing up to let the Government--excuse me, not let the \nGovernment, force the Government, in effect, to interfere with the \nmarketplace. Actually, what they really are doing is putting in place a \nprohibition against the Secretary actually letting the marketplace work \nor testing whether the marketplace could work more effectively. In \neffect, we leave it in a state where the companies are dictating \neffectively what the price is going to be and the citizen, as a result, \nwinds up paying an unfair burden.\n  We are not doing the best job possible as Government trustees of \ntaxpayer money in taking care of that money and in representing the \ninterests of our taxpayers. That is what is at stake here. Are you \nprepared to trust the discretion of the Secretary to analyze this, to \nlook at what is best for the country, best for the delivery system, and \nmake that judgment? All we are doing is lifting an unfair special \ninterest prohibition to allow a full analysis of what the better \nalternative might be.\n\n\n                        Alternative Minimum Tax\n\n  Mr. President, as Americans prepared their taxes this year, millions \nof families in Massachusetts and across the country found a very \nunpleasant surprise. Beyond their regular income taxes, families found \nanother hidden income tax, which is the alternative minimum tax. It \ncosts those families many thousands of dollars. Most taxpayers are \naccustomed to computing their income tax liability in the usual way: \nadding up their income, making whatever deductions they are entitled \nto, subtracting exemptions for their dependents, and then checking \ntheir tax bracket to find out how much they owe. But this year, many of \nthose same taxpayers discovered another tax that ate up any exemptions \nand deductions they might have claimed. It is a hidden income tax, and \nit affects the wrong people. It affects people we never intended to \naffect, and each year that we don't address it, it grows worse.\n  This alternative minimum tax is a tax that made sense once upon a \ntime. When it was first enacted in 1969, it had a rationale, but since \nthen, it has become bloated and illogical. The tax was first put in \nplace when Treasury Secretary Joseph Barr, during his 1 month as the \nshortest tenured Treasury Secretary in history, told Congress about 155 \nwealthy Americans who had paid no income tax in 1966. Congress was \noverwhelmed with mail expressing outrage that these 155 rich Americans \nweren't pulling their weight. In response, Congress passed the first \nversion of the AMT. So the AMT was put in place to address Americans' \nconcerns with 155 of the richest Americans at a time when 155 \nrepresented a large block of those who were among the wealthiest \nAmericans. Urging tax reform, Secretary Barr coined the phrase \n``taxpayers' revolt'' and that is exactly what we are likely to see \nunless we get this right now.\n  In 1970, 20,000 taxpayers were affected by the alternative minimum \ntax. This year, about 4 million Americans will pay it, and next year \nthat number could rise to 23 million Americans. What was originally a \nsmall fix at the edge of our Tax Code has now ballooned into a massive \ninconvenience and unfairness at the center of our Tax Code. Instead of \nserving its original purpose, the tax cuts we saw passed into law a few \nyears ago, illogical and deceptive as they were, are winding up \ntargeting the very people we are supposed to be helping. The very \npeople we hear most of the rhetoric about--those who need help in \nAmerica and the middle class being unfairly taxed--are the very people \nwho are being unfairly taxed by this hidden tax people don't want to \ntalk about. The fact is the middle class has seen an enormous shift in \nthe burden away from the wealthiest Americans onto the middle class, \nthe very people the AMT was designed to protect.\n  The AMT is now poised to make a dramatic shift from the wealthy to \nthe middle class. In 2006, taxpayers earning more than half a million \ndollars will pay 47 percent of the tax. By 2010, that number will drop \nto 16 percent. We are going to go from 47 percent of the people who \nearn more than half a million dollars who are supposed to be the \ntargets of the alternative minimum tax--that will drop to 16 percent--\nand the people who are going to pick up the difference are going to be \nAmericans in the middle class who are struggling with increasing \ntuition costs, increasing energy costs, increasing health care costs, \nand wages that are either frozen or going down. Meanwhile, investment \nincome will not be impacted by the alternative minimum tax, and the top \nalternative minimum tax rate is lower than the top marginal tax rate, \nwhich is what people pay on their income.\n  So a tax designed to cover or apply to the wealthiest Americans has \nbecome a solidly middle-class tax.\n  This tax also punishes certain States in our country more than other \nStates, and particularly a State such as mine--Massachusetts--but other \nStates in the Northeast and large industrial States.\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\nIn 2007, 24 percent of Massachusetts taxpayers, up from about 5 percent \nlast year, will be hit by the alternative minimum tax, so that \nMassachusetts will be No. 4 in the rankings of all the States in the \ncountry. I don't think we ought to be putting an undue burden on the \nmiddle class, and we certainly shouldn't be putting one unfairly on \ncertain States while other States are exempt.\n  Worse still, the tax penalizes families with children because it \neliminates any dependent exemptions. So here we are talking about \nfamily values, but the family values are stripped away for those \nmiddle-class families because they lose their exemptions for their \ndependents.\n  In 2007, the alternative minimum tax will impact a family with four \nchildren and an income of $57,000. Married couples will be more than 12 \ntimes as likely as singles to face the alternative minimum tax in 2010. \nSo those of us who argued strongly about the marriage penalty need to \nnote that the marriage penalty is, in fact, growing larger as a \nconsequence of the alternative minimum tax. We wrote the exemptions \nthat we had specifically to help families to get away from that \nproblem, and my question is, do we now want to burden them with this \nadditional tax.\n  President Bush has acknowledged, at least rhetorically, this is a \nfailed policy. There is room for bipartisanship here. Congress and the \nPresident need to work together to address what has become a major \nstructural problem in our Tax Code. I commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Congressman Neal, who is working in the House on this \nissue and showing important leadership in order to try to address it, \nand I look forward to seeing his proposal.\n\n  In fixing this tax, there are two major pitfalls we have to avoid. \nThe first is: Don't simply repeal the tax without paying for it. We \ncan't afford to do that, and it is clearly not fiscally responsible. \nFinally, it doesn't solve the problem. Second, we need to find a \npermanent solution. The alternative minimum tax itself was originally a \nsmall fix for a different tax issue. It is the accumulation over time \nof stopgap measures that has brought us to the current problem. So I \ndon't believe it serves us well at all to push this issue down the \nroad, as has been the practice of the Congress in these last years.\n  We also need to make the tax policy of our country simpler and more \nstraightforward and fill it with a little more common sense and a \nlittle less special interests. Our tax problem as a nation was, in \nfact, made significantly worse by the Bush tax cuts, and the \nalternative minimum tax has been used quietly, more and more, to ask \nmiddle-class families to pay the burden of the wealthiest Americans' \ntax cut.\n  We can all agree the main reason this tax has grown out of proportion \nis that it wasn't indexed to inflation. The same money we talk about \ntoday went an awful lot farther in 1970. The movies back then cost \n$1.65. The fact is we haven't adjusted the tax brackets to rise with \ninflation.\n  Another major problem has been the alternative minimum tax \ninteraction with the Bush tax cuts. This administration and the \nRepublican Congress purposefully allowed the tax system to become \nunbalanced. This was done in order to hide the true cost of the tax \ncuts. Normally, sound tax policy involves changing the alternative \nminimum tax to reflect changes in regular tax cuts. For example, in \n1993, we raised rates for both taxes simultaneously. But under this \nPresident, in 2001 and in 2003 and in 2004, we cut the regular income \ntax rate without making corresponding significant changes in the AMT. \nInstead of paying upfront through the regular income tax, this \nadministration used the AMT to finance tax cuts for the very people the \nAMT was designed to tax. The AMT quietly takes back a portion of the \nBush tax cuts by 2010, about 29 percent, transferring the tax burden \nfrom the top tax brackets to largely middle-class tax families.\n  If we had a vote on the floor of the Senate which specifically said: \nAre you going to tax middle-class families in order to pay for a \nwealthy tax cut and shift the burden by about 29 percent, almost \neverybody here would vote no. So it is the hidden tax cut that has the \nimpact. Before the Bush tax cuts, 17 million taxpayers would have been \naffected by the alternative minimum tax in 2010, but with the Bush tax \ncuts, that number almost doubles to 31 million. If we let the Bush tax \ncuts expire in 2011, at least the number of AMT taxpayers would drop \ndramatically. I am confident that will be an important debate down the \nroad here. In 2007, a family with 2 children and an income of $80,000 \nwill see 59 percent of their tax cut taken back by the alternative \nminimum tax. Tom Waits, the 1970s singer and songwriter, once said the \nlarge print giveth and the small print taketh away. Well, the small \nprint, my friends, is the alternative minimum tax, and it is taking \naway America's families' tax savings.\n  We need to be honest about the cost of our tax cuts. Back in 2001, I \ntried to offer an amendment that exempted all taxpayers with incomes \nunder $100,000 from the AMT. At that time I warned that the AMT is \nencroaching on middle-class taxpayers and that the tax cuts would only \nmake things worse. The fix for the AMT problem at that time was \nestimated to cost $110 billion over 10 years, money that instead is now \nbeing paid by middle-class families. The amendment at that time was \nrevenue neutral. It offset the cost by delaying some of the Bush tax \ncuts. It cut the 39.6 rate down to 37 percent, instead of 35, but \nunfortunately, the amendment failed.\n  I don't believe we can continue to put this problem off. Unless we \nreform our tax system for the sake of middle-class families--and we \nsimply can't afford not to reform it--we are going to pay one way or \nthe other, with the debt that is passed on to our children or with \ntaxes passed on from the wealthiest to an ever-growing part of the \nmiddle class. We need a bipartisan, fiscally responsible, permanent \napproach, not one that masks the costs of irresponsible cuts or becomes \na burden for the middle class, and not one that gives more and more \nfamilies an unpleasant surprise on tax day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to propound a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will inquire.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 372.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation--I may \nnot have the floor. May I ask the Chair, please tell me what the \nparliamentary situation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has been \nrecognized by the Chair and now has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if that were not the case, what would be the \ncase?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no current time agreement. The Senate \nis considering S. 372 under no time agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Mr. President, I am not going to speak just now. \nI want to respect the wishes of another Senator who is on the floor at \nthe moment. In a few minutes, I will want to speak a bit. As of now, I \nam going to take my seat. I will ask the Senator, does he wish to speak \nat this time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia for his courtesy. If it would not be too great an imposition, \nI will speak for a few minutes on the Intelligence bill. That would be \nvery much appreciated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I am \ngoing to sit down and listen. May I ask the Senator this question: How \nlong will he likely speak?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy. I will speak less than 10 minutes. I so appreciate the \nthoughtfulness of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. After he \nyields the floor, I will seek recognition. I understand the rules of \nthe Senate. I am just stating at this point what I intend to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves, Senator Byrd has always been so kind to \nthis Senator. I appreciate it.\n  I wish to take a few moments to talk about the critically important \nIntelligence authorization bill that is before the Senate now. I am \ndisappointed that this legislation has not yet passed because it seems \nto me that Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond have done an \nawful lot of very good work in terms of negotiating on this legislation \nand doing it in a bipartisan fashion. A number of us have felt that it \nwas critically important that intelligence, in the days ahead, at a \ntime of great threat to our country, be an area that is pursued in a \nbipartisan way. My view is that Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman \nBond have really kept that kind of bipartisan lodestar in mind as we \nhave conducted our work throughout this session. That is one of the \nreasons I have so wanted this legislation to move forward.\n  I wish to take a minute to highlight just one of the provisions that \nseems to be objectionable to the executive branch and try to show how, \nin my view, that should not be the case and how the Senate ought to \ncome together around it and move forward on this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation.\n  There is a provision in the bill the Senate is now considering--a \nprovision that I offered--which would make public the total size of our \nnational intelligence budget. This provision would not make public how \nmuch the country spends on any particular collection method; it would \nsimply state the U.S. Government spends X amount of money on national \nintelligence programs.\n  This has long received bipartisan support. The bipartisan 9/11 \nCommission was for it. The former Director of the CIA, Stansfield \nTurner, is for it. I would like to note that our current Secretary of \nDefense, Secretary Gates, when he was before the U.S. Senate \nIntelligence Committee--and I will quote here--said:\n\n       From my personal perspective, I don't have any problem with \n     releasing the top line of the intelligence community budget.\n\n  I am of the view that Secretary Gates was right when he said that a \nnumber of years ago, and he is right at this time as well. In my view, \nto suggest that disclosing the total size of our national intelligence \nbudget would cause any harm whatsoever to national security is \nridiculous. It is absolutely absurd to think that Osama bin Laden is \noff in a cave somewhere contemplating what the overall national \nintelligence budget is. It is absurd to suggest that Kim Jong Il is \nsomehow sitting in his office wondering and worrying, for example, \nwhether the Wyden amendment to the intelligence authorization is going \nto pass. It is absurd to believe that any terrorist or dictator or any \nother enemy of the United States will gain any sort of advantage \nwhatever from the public disclosure of the top line of the national \nintelligence budget.\n  But there are people who will gain an advantage; that is, the \nAmerican people. Making the total size of our intelligence public is \ngoing to increase public accountability and will allow for a more \ninformed debate about national security. If the national intelligence \nbudget's overall number is made public, there will be a more informed \ndiscussion about whether money should be spent on aircraft carriers or \nsubmarines or on intelligence gathering. This debate will only ensure \nthat taxpayer dollars are used more wisely and that America will be \nsafer.\n\n  Senator Byrd has been very gracious to give me this time this \nafternoon. There are other provisions that I feel strongly about in \nthis legislation. The increased penalties, for example, for outing a \ncovert agent is something I feel strongly about. After the Dubai Ports \ndebate, it is clear that there should be additional resources devoted \nto looking at the intelligence ramifications of those particular \nissues.\n  But my bottom line is, at a time when Americans are questioning our \nintelligence agencies' ability to keep them safe, the Congress has a \nresponsibility to provide support. At a time when the intelligence \ncommunity is undergoing major reorganization, the Congress has a \nresponsibility to provide guidance. At a time when our allies and our \ncitizens are raising serious questions about detention issues, Congress \nhas a responsibility to conduct oversight. At a time when Americans \ncontinue to open their morning papers and read about aggressive new \nforms of Government surveillance and, in particular, the now-disclosed \nabuse of the national security letters, Congress has a responsibility \nto demand accountability.\n  Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond have done a lot of good \nwork on this legislation. The distinguished occupant of the chair has \nbeen involved in those debates, and we are pleased that he is part of \nthe committee. I hope the Senate will move expeditiously to move \nforward on this legislation. It is an important bill, at a critical \ntime for the security of the American people.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for giving me the opportunity to speak this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for his courtesy, and I also want to say that \nhe is one of the immortal 23 Senators who said, in kind words and \nrespectful words and in senatorial terms, we won't go--meaning, we were \ngoing to be Senators. We know what the Constitution says about Members \nof the Senate and the House, we were going to be Senators, we were \ngoing to be respectful, but we were going to vote our way. We were \nrespectful of the President, but we knew we were Senators and that \nthere were three branches of Government, and we know and knew then that \nthis is the legislative branch--the first branch of Government that is \nmentioned under the Constitution, and it is sometimes called ``the \npeople's branch.'' That is for good reason.\n  Now, what is the floor situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 372 is the pending question, and the \nSenator from West Virginia has the floor with no present time \nrestriction.\n  Mr. BYRD. Further parliamentary question: Is time controlled at this \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may speak as in morning business--in other words, out of order--\nfor not to exceed 20 minutes. I don't expect to take that much time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                              Veto Threats\n\n  Mr. President, the 110th Congress will consider legislation this \nsession that raises passions and excites partisan fervor. It is likely \nthat much of what the Congress considers this year and next will be \nsubject to Presidential veto threats because the President's political \nparty no longer controls the Congress.\n  I was quite surprised recently to hear some Senators take the \nposition that this body is wasting its time in drafting and passing \nlegislation which the President threatens to veto.\n  Let me respectfully remind all who listen that the Congress \nlegislates for the people and has a constitutional obligation--in other \nwords, duty--to act independently from--I say this again, I say it \nrespectfully--from the White House. There are three branches, as \neverybody knows, of Government. This is a separate but equal branch. I \nwant Senators to listen. This is a separate branch, but it is equal.\n  I will repeat myself. As Senators already know, there are three \nseparate but equal branches of Government. The Constitution's Framers \nnever considered a President to be the final arbiter of the public \ngood. Whether the question relates to military, foreign, or domestic \naffairs, a Presidential veto threat is not the last word in what should \nbecome the law of our land. Those decisions are left to the \nrepresentatives of the people, along with the power over the purse--\nalong with the power over the purse--and other constitutionally \nenumerated congressional powers.\n  We hear almost daily a Presidential scolding of the Congress \nconcerning the supplemental appropriations bill, which is shortly \nheaded for a House-Senate conference. Continued Presidential veto \nthreats on the funding for the Iraq war represent a stubborn \nunwillingness to concede that the American people have over time and \nwith considerable debate come to see that the Iraq war was a mistake.\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\n  In the case of Iraq, it is likely that the people of the United \nStates would have come to these opinions much earlier had they not had \ninformation withheld from them or, in some instances, presented to them \nfalsely. Of course, I knew this.\n  Of course, also, it remains the constitutional prerogative of the \nPresident to exercise the veto. I respect that. But it also remains the \nprerogative of the Congress--the other body across the way and this \nbody--it also remains the prerogative of the Congress to challenge that \nveto and to assert and defend the will of the people.\n  A President's power to veto is not and should not be absolute. Let me \nrepeat that. A President's power to veto is not and should not be \nabsolute. If the President vetoes a measure under our Constitution, the \nCongress can override that veto with a two-thirds vote of both Houses. \nAll Senators know that. I am not telling Senators anything they don't \nknow.\n  A Presidential veto does not necessarily end the legislative process. \nWhen the President vetoes legislation under article I, section 7 of the \nConstitution, the President's objections are submitted to the House of \nCongress--Congress being of two bodies--submitted to the House of \nCongress in which the measure originated so that the measure and the \nPresident's objections can be reconsidered. All Senators know that. Any \nschoolboy who has studied the Constitution knows that. But I am stating \nfor the record, again, for all who run to read.\n  A new vote can be scheduled on the same piece of legislation and a \nveto can be overturned if the people's representatives--if the people's \nelected representatives--in Congress demand it.\n  There is nothing earthshaking about overturning a Presidential veto. \nSince 1969, the Congress has overridden almost 20 percent of the \nPresidential vetoes. President Franklin Roosevelt had nine vetoes \noverridden by Democratic Congresses. I repeat: President Franklin \nRoosevelt had nine vetoes overridden by Democratic Congresses. \nPresident Ronald Reagan had six vetoes overridden by a Democratic House \nand a Republican Senate.\n  The veto override provision in the Constitution is a protection for \nthe people whom the Congress represents. Members of Congress are \nelected by the people to make laws based on sound public policy, not to \ncapitulate or surrender to any--Republican or Democrat--to any \nPresidential threats. The Senate must never--hear me now, the Senate \nmust never--become a rubberstamp for any President, Republican or \nDemocrat or Independent or otherwise.\n  Certainly, the Congress should carefully consider the announced \nreasons for a Presidential veto, but the Congress has a duty, if the \nPresident's reasons are not credible or do not reflect the will of the \npeople, to overturn Presidential vetoes, if the Congress wishes to do \nso.\n  The veto on the override is a healthy public opportunity for Members \nof Congress--both Houses--to consider the reasons offered by the \nPresident for his veto. Just as the President is held accountable for \nhis veto, we Senators are held accountable for our votes on bills that \nare sent to the President and, if applicable, a subsequent veto \noverride vote.\n  Members of the Senate and the people understand that when the \nPresident submits a bill to Congress and then asks that it be passed \nwithout any amendments or conditions--the President has a right to do \nthat, but we all know that the President is treating the Congress like \na subordinate branch capable of only saying yes or no and never \nexpected to alter a Presidential proposal in any way.\n  The President knows what the Constitution says, and he knows that the \nCongress has a right to listen, to study, and then to act as it seeks \nto act. So this is an argument that contradicts the most basic \nconstitutional principles on which our Republic is founded.\n  The Congress was envisioned as a check on an overzealous or unwise \nPresident, and that is no reflection on either party--that the \nPresident can be a Democrat, a Republican, or otherwise--and we do our \nduty to the Constitution when we vigorously utilize our enumerated \npowers.\n\n  So let us hear no more about measures that the President has \nthreatened to veto being not worthy of the Senate's consideration. Let \nthe President issue his veto threats as he wishes, but also let the \nCongress dutifully represent the will of the people.\n  On the matter of Iraq--and I say this most respectfully--I have been \nchagrined of late to hear the falsehoods and scare tactics emanating \nfrom the Oval Office. President Bush has repeatedly intimated that \nthere is a connection between the attacks of 9/11 and the Iraq war when \nno such link exists. President Bush has suggested--he is my President \nand yours, Senators--that the supplemental appropriations bill as now \nwritten would cause death and destruction in America, which is patently \nfalse. I speak now as the chairman--of course, everybody knows it--I \nspeak as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. President, I make a parliamentary inquiry: Are we under limited \ntime, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 30 seconds remaining \nof the 20 minutes he requested.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not going to belabor Senators. I have \nseven more pages to read. I know what is in here, and so I ask \nunanimous consent that I may use whatever time I consume, and I assure \nSenators I will not consume more than 10 minutes, if that much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. President Bush has said the bill does not fund the troops, \nwhich is false. The Senate bill provides $2 billion more than the \nPresident requested for the troops and provides $1.8 billion more for \nveterans health care. I regret this continual barrage of misinformation \ncoming from the White House just as I regret the intransigence--the \nintransigence--of a President who will not cool off--and I say this \nrespectfully--of a President who will not cool off and stop \nfearmongering long enough to negotiate a resolution to the differences \nin the bill's language. He--the President--has been invited to do so in \ngood faith and yet still the almost daily castigation from the White \nHouse continues.\n  I wonder about the effect on the morale of our brave fighting men and \nwomen when the President--any President--repeats inaccuracies like the \nCongress has failed to fully fund the troops. It seems to me that it is \nnot a prudent thing to say. Congress and the American people support \nour troops, and the supplemental bill that we shall shortly take to \nconference robustly funds their needs in the field and cares for their \nneeds after they return home.\n  For the President to assert otherwise is a disservice--and I say this \nwith the utmost respect. I will say it again. For the President to \nassert otherwise is a disservice. Honorable men and women may disagree, \nbut Members of Congress and officials of the executive branch have a \nduty to try to find common ground, especially when the issue is a \nviolent and controversial war, with our troops in harm's way every day. \nI shall hope for a more reasonable and more realistic tone from our \nPresident--and I say it with the utmost respect, but this is an equal \nbranch with the executive branch and the judicial branch--in the coming \ndays. May I say further that more light and less heat on this matter \nwould truly be in the best interests of our troops and of our sorely \ndivided country.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have been here a long time. I know how to \nspeak, when to speak, and when not to speak, but I am a U.S. Senator, \nand I am asserting this Senate's constitutional duty. My Republican \nfriends and my Democratic friends know this, and I know they have a \nright to do the same, but that is my speech for today, God willing.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I thank all Senators, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia for his insight, as always, and wisdom on \nso many issues. He epitomizes what it means to be a Senator, and we are \nhonored and appreciative of his leadership.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. President, I do want to speak today as it relates to prescription \ndrugs and the very important vote we will be having tomorrow, but I \nalso first want to speak to what is happening as it relates to \nBlacksburg, VA,\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nand Virginia Tech University, just to indicate that we know there was a \nmemorial service today; that all of us, even as we carry on the normal \nbusiness of the Senate, are very mindful and aware of what has occurred \nin the massacre at Virginia Tech University. My thoughts and prayers go \nout to everyone who has been affected throughout the university, most \nparticularly the families.\n  Certainly, I think I can speak for the people of my great State of \nMichigan when I say that we are deeply, deeply sorrowful, and our \nprayers go out to each and every one of the people who have been \naffected.\n  Mr. President, we have a very important vote tomorrow, which is \nwhether to proceed to legislation that would begin the process of \nallowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be able to \nnegotiate the very best price for our seniors under Medicare. I want to \ntake this opportunity to commend our majority leader for getting us to \nthis point, Senator Reid, and the Finance Committee for getting us to \nthis point, for bringing the issue of Medicare drug pricing to the \nSenate floor. I hope tomorrow we are going to see a strong bipartisan \nvote to proceed with the bill.\n\n  Frankly, it is very unfortunate we are having to vote on whether to \nproceed to this bill, but since that vote is occurring, I hope we will \nhave a resounding yes tomorrow for something that is so clear to the \nAmerican people. The direction we will hopefully take tomorrow is the \ndirection that the voters asked us to take. Their message last November \nwas crystal clear: that they want to make sure we are making health \ncare decisions in the best interests of people--the best interests of \nseniors, of children, of families--and not the special interests that \nmake money off the system. Tomorrow is going to be a vote on that.\n  Tomorrow will be the first step in the process. We are removing the \nprovision that prohibits Medicare from using its negotiating clout. \nWhat we are going to be voting on tomorrow is whether we will proceed. \nAnd why are we doing that? Well, first of all, this Medicare bill that \nwas put in place a few years ago actually prohibited the Secretary from \nnegotiating to get the best price for seniors, amazingly. People to \nthis day ask: How in the world did that happen? Well, it happened \nbecause, unfortunately, there were too many provisions in that bill \nthat were put in on behalf of the special interests rather than our \nseniors.\n  The step we take tomorrow is good for our seniors, it is good for \nfamilies, and it is good for taxpayers. It is good for taxpayers to get \nthe best deal so that our dollars can go as far as possible under \nMedicare. So tomorrow is an important day.\n  I have been fighting for this provision ever since the Medicare \nprescription drug program was passed in late 2003. I wish I could have \nsupported that bill. I did not, in part because of the prohibition that \nwas put into place. That bill was written and designed with a huge gap \nin coverage--it has often been called the doughnut hole--that, frankly, \nwouldn't be there if we were able to get the very best pricing and \nstretch those Medicare dollars as far as they should go.\n  In fact, I joined a group of Senators to introduce legislation on \nDecember 12, 2003, to repeal the prohibition on negotiation, which is \nwhat we are talking about now, because we knew then what we know today. \nIf the Secretary of Health and Human Services negotiates Medicare \nprescription drug prices, seniors will pay the lowest possible price. \nThat should be what we are all focused on as it relates to Medicare \nprescription drugs. More than 3 years later, we are taking the first \nstep toward getting this done. It is about time. I think that is what \nthe American people are saying to us.\n  The best way to get the lowest possible prices on prescription drugs \nis to use the negotiating clout of 43 million seniors and people with \ndisability who are under Medicare. That negotiating clout needs to be \nused. We are considering this bill right now because the American \npeople want it. According to a poll conducted by the AARP, 87 percent \nof all Americans said they want Medicare to negotiate prescription drug \nprices--87 percent. That is a pretty big number. Eighty-seven percent \nof the seniors, according to AARP, when asked, have said: Yes, of \ncourse, we want the Federal Government to negotiate to get the very \nbest price.\n  Why do consumers want Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices? \nBecause they know what everybody knows: large purchasers are getting \ndeep discounts for prescription drugs, and they want the same from \nMedicare.\n  This bill does not do the same thing as the VA, but the VA is a good \nexample of what can be done when there is negotiation, when the Federal \nGovernment brings its clout as it does for our veterans. It gives us \nsome idea of the kinds of discounts that can be achieved.\n  For example, we know that on average, the VA health system gets \nprescription drugs for approximately 58 percent less than their retail \nprices--58 percent--and on some medicines, it is up to a 1,000-percent \ndifference. Now, I would say, if the VA can do this and get 58 percent, \nwe can get a better deal if we negotiate, knowing again that this bill \ndoes not reflect what the VA does, but it gives you a sense of what can \nbe done when we have that kind of clout.\n  Let's be clear about what we are doing right now with this bill. We \nare opening the door to lower drug prices so Medicare beneficiaries can \nafford the medicines they need and we can save taxpayers money. We all \nknow how many times we have heard the stories--I hear them all the \ntime--of folks trying to juggle between keeping the lights on, buying \nfood, and getting their medicine. Our top goal should be, as a Medicare \nProgram, to make sure people can get the medicine they need at the very \nbest price. This bill moves us in that direction.\n  Let's be clear also about what we are not doing. This legislation \ndoes not create a national drug formulary, nor does it establish price \ncontrols. Seniors will have access to all of the drugs they do today, \nand possibly more. The prescription drug industry will continue to \nthrive, and R will not be affected. The change we will see is a \nchange we have been asking for for the last 3 years, that seniors and \nfamilies have been asking for for the last 3 years.\n  It is also important to note because we will hear from our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle that somehow, if Medicare is going to have \nthe opportunity to negotiate or if the Secretary can negotiate at \nappropriate times for lower prices, we are going to see the prices of \nthe VA go up. Well, I asked the Congressional Budget Office to submit \nto me in writing if that were, in fact, true under this bill. They, in \nfact, said: No, under this bill, that is not the case. We are not going \nto see veterans or any other group see their prescription drug prices \ngo up under this legislation. So that is one good thing we need to make \nclear and debunk as we begin this debate.\n  Now, what we do know is we have a very interesting thing going on. We \nhave two kinds of debate going on right now in opposition from those \nwho are major beneficiaries of the current system, the special interest \ngroups that have the benefit right now of seeing huge profit increases \nas a result of this prescription drug bill. On the one hand, we are \nseeing ads that say: This legislation will do nothing. Do not pass it; \nit will not do anything. Then, on the other hand, the very same people \nare saying: But it will cause seniors to not be able to get the choice \nof medicines they want, it will cause veterans to see their medicine \ncosts go up, it will cost R and we won't be able to do research and \ndevelopment into new prescription drugs anymore. I find it so \ninteresting that the same people are arguing both sides: It will not do \nanything, and it will have all of these devastating effects.\n  At the same time, we are seeing huge amounts of money, millions and \nmillions of dollars--for months, I have seen ads on TV and radio, \nnewspaper ads telling us these people do not want negotiation or that \nit will not do anything, all paid for by the same people who benefit by \nthe current system. I might just say that just today, a full-page, \nsingle-color ad running in the Washington Post on page A5 today, costs \nabout $135,000--this is today, this is yesterday. We have ad after ad \nafter ad being run and paid for by people who tell us this bill will \nnot do anything. It will not do anything, but yet they have spent \nmillions of dollars on TV, millions of dollars on the radio, in ads we\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\nhave seen, ads for our benefit, ads telling us people do not want \nnegotiation.\n  I might add that in this ad which is running right now, where they \nsay people really do not want Medicare to negotiate, what they say in \nthe fine print is that, in fact, 89 percent oppose Government \nnegotiation if it could limit access to new prescription medicine--if \nit could limit access to new prescription medicine. This bill does not \nlimit access to new prescription medicine--or old prescription \nmedicine, for that matter. That is not what we are talking about.\n  In fact, what I find interesting, and the subtle part of this is, if \nwe negotiate for a better deal, they won't be able to do research \nanymore. We know that right now the drug industry spends 2\\1/2\\ times \nmore on marketing and advertising than they do on research.\n  I would suggest we can negotiate to get a little better price. And I \nwonder how much $135,000 would buy in medicine for somebody today \ninstead of one ad? Let's cut down a little bit on the marketing and \nadvertising, and we won't have to worry about whether Medicare can \nnegotiate for the very best price.\n  So I hope that tomorrow we are going to have a vote to proceed to \nthis very important public policy issue, this very important bill. I \nhope we are going to, in fact, do what 87 percent of voters are saying \nthey want us to do--negotiate the very best price for prescription \ndrugs.\n  I would ask my colleagues to vote to allow us to proceed to the bill. \nWe can continue to work together on exactly what the language should \nlook like, but the idea that you would stop it before we can even have \nthe debate would be extremely disturbing. People in this country do not \nunderstand why it is that decisions are made too often for those who \nhappen to have the lobbyists here or the ads on TV or in the newspaper \nand not enough for the folks who are working hard every day or are \nretired on a fixed income trying to make ends meet.\n  Tomorrow is a chance for us to show that those folks are not making \nthe decisions, that we are going to move forward on a bill which is \npositive for seniors, which is going to give us an opportunity to open \nthe door to negotiating good prices and make a real difference for \npeople, a real difference for people whom the system is supposed to \nhelp, the Medicare prescription drug benefit for our seniors, for \npeople on Medicare. They deserve the best price. Tomorrow, we will have \na chance to vote to go to that debate and work together to get a bill \nthat will do that. I hope we are going to vote to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                                Tax Day\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Once again, today, tax time is upon us. It is April 17. \nWe know April 15 is the magic day, but it has been extended because of \nwhen it fell. Today is the day everybody in America knows that the \nFederal Government income taxes are due. If you are like me, you spent \nway too much time completing your taxes this year.\n\n  Our Tax Code and its accompanying regulations total tens of thousands \nof pages which are complicated, confusing, and costly to comply with. \nIn fact, since we last had major reform in 1986 there have been more \nthan 14,000 changes to the Tax Code. Average taxpayers should not have \nto pour over tax regulations for hours on end or pay a tax professional \nto complete their tax documents.\n  In the IRS' own estimation, the average time burden for all taxpayers \nfiling a 1040 is 30 hours. Unfortunately, what this means is that for \nmost people is that in addition to paying the Government every year, \nthey need to pay someone or buy software to tell them exactly how much \nto pay their Government.\n  Americans need a simple, common-sense solution. This is why I have \nintroduced S. 1040, the Tax Simplification Act.\n  The Tax Simplification Act establishes a flat income tax of 17 \npercent on all income and places real spending limits on the Federal \nGovernment. First, my proposal would replace our current \nincomprehensible Tax Code with a flat rate of 17 percent on all \nindividuals' income beyond an exemption for the individual and any \ndependents. To prevent the double-taxation of income, earnings from \nsavings would not be included as taxable income, resulting in a tax cut \nfor virtually all taxpayers and providing a strong incentive for people \nto save. Increasing the savings rate in this country should be a \npriority of this Congress and this bill will do that.\n  As complicated as the individual tax system has proven, it pales in \ncomparison to the hoops U.S. businesses are required to jump through. \nIn preparation for 2005 taxes, businesses and nonprofits spent an \nestimated 6.4 billion hours complying with the Federal Income Tax Code, \nwith an estimated compliance cost of over $265 billion. Without action, \nthat number is expected to grow to over $482 billion by 2015.\n  What this means is that for every $5 the Government collects right \nnow, businesses are forced to spend another $1 to comply with the \ncountless rules and regulations that we, the Government, have created. \nThese additional costs are then passed on to the consumers, investors, \nand employees. We need to overcome this notion that our corporate \nincome tax simply applies to some faceless boardroom. Corporations do \nnot pay taxes. People pay taxes. Corporations do not comply with our \ntax laws. People do.\n  Under my legislation, companies would pay the flat tax of 17 percent \nrate on their income, simplifying the complicated calculations \nbusinesses currently go through to determine their taxable income. S. \n1040 simply defines income as the positive difference between revenue \nand expenses. As the legislation is implemented, the rate of taxation \nwould be 19 percent in the first 2 years and then lowered to the \ndesired rate of 17 percent in the third year.\n  Finally, this legislation would require a three-fifths majority in \nCongress for any tax increase. This ensures that only in times of the \nmost need would the Government be able to take any more money out of \nthe hands of hard-working Americans. By enacting this legislation we \nwould institute a strong backstop against those that would seek to \ncontinue the out-of-control growth of the Federal Government. And we \nwould open a new chapter of responsibility and accountability in our \nrevenue collection.\n  Yes, the flat tax would revolutionize the way our Government \noperates. Today, if a flat tax were in place, taxpayers would file a \nreturn the size of a postcard. Rather than spending hours deciphering \nconvoluted IRS forms or resorting to professional tax assistance, the \nflat tax would allow taxpayers to complete their taxes quickly and \neasily.\n  The time for significant reform of our Tax Code is now. The flat tax \nwould revolutionize the way our Government operates. The complexities \nand inequities of the current tax system would end. They would be \nreplaced by a system that treats every taxpayer equally and represents \na massive reduction in the tax burden carried by hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Only by treating every taxpayer equally can our Tax Code ever achieve \ntrue fairness. Only when the shackles of our burdensome Tax Codes are \nremoved will we truly see what our great economy is capable of doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Mr. Isakson has a very brief statement, \nperhaps 2 minutes. I wonder if he can be recognized for 2 minutes and \nthen Senator Nelson for 2 minutes and then I be recognized for 5 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                          Honoring Ryan Clark\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to address the Senate as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sympathy and I \nknow the sympathy of all of the Members of the Senate and the people of \nthe United States of America on the tragic losses yesterday at Virginia \nTech.\n  I learned this morning that one of those first tragic losses was a \nyoung gentleman by the name of Ryan Clark,\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nand I, from the floor of the Senate, send to Martinez, GA, my sympathy, \nthat of Senator Chambliss, and that of all Members of the Senate on the \ntragic loss of Ryan.\n  None of us can understand what happened yesterday, but all of us must \nunderstand the profound tragedy and the loss of youth in its prime.\n  Ryan Clark, 22 years old, a double major in English and biology, was \nabout to walk across the stage and graduate and then pursue a masters \nand a Ph.D. in psychology. Ryan is survived not only by his mother \nLetitie but by his brother Bryan. Bryan told us that his brother was \nknown best by his nickname on the campus, ``Stack.'' Stack, if you go \nto the Web site of the Virginia Tech band, can be seen volunteering his \ntime in a food drive for the needy. In fact, just last December, in the \nGeorgia Dome at the Peach Bowl of 2006, one of the last times that Ryan \nwent back to Georgia, he performed with the Virginia Tech band at \nhalftime of that bowl game.\n  This young man was a residential adviser, a member of the band, an \noutstanding student, a proud son, and a proud brother. I am very proud \nas a Georgian to have known of his accomplishments, and I send his \nmother Letitie my prayers and my hopes that she will accept our \nsympathy and endure the tragedy of the loss of her son Ryan.\n  To the families of all of those professors, employees, and students \nwho were hurt yesterday in Blacksburg, VA, I extend my sympathy and my \ndeepest prayers that we will find reconciliations out of tragedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, our hearts go out to the \ncitizens of Virginia, to the university community, and to the families \nand the loved ones of those in this tragedy. It goes without saying \nthat we will get to the bottom of this and then find out what is going \nwrong in this country that our sense of morality has gone askew so that \na senseless set of murders such as this would occur.\n  I am here to speak on behalf of this intelligence legislation on \nwhich we are about to have a vote, cutting off debate so we can proceed \nto finalize the bill. It is necessary that we do that. I had the \nprivilege of serving on the Intelligence Committee along with my \ncolleague, the Senator from Michigan, on his committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, as well as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nThere is so much going on that is at stake for this country that we \ncannot in any way delay this Intelligence bill; it needs to be \nconsidered; it needs to be amended, if that is the will of this body; \nit needs to be passed, and we need to then get reconciled with the \nHouse and get it to the President for his signature. There are too many \nthings that are super important to this country for us to do anything \nother than protect the interests of this country through our \nintelligence activities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the release of the 9/11 Commission Report \nin July of 2004 fueled a debate about how our intelligence community \nshould be restructured to better respond to the post-9/11 threat.\n  In response to problems identified by the 9/11 Commission, Congress \npassed and the President signed into law the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Most notably, that bill created the \nDirector of National Intelligence, empowering the DNI with budget power \nand control over personnel in the intelligence community.\n  The bill also created the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC, \nwith the authority to conduct strategic counterterrorism planning and \nto assign roles and responsibilities for counterterrorism activities. \nPassage of intelligence reform was a watershed moment in the drive to \nbetter organize our Government to deal with the threat of terrorism.\n  On December 8, 2004, the same day the Senate passed the Intelligence \nreform bill, it passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 2005. It is troubling that that day, December 8, 2004, was the \nlast day this body passed an Intelligence authorization bill, and it \nunderscores the importance of the Senate passing the bill before us. \nSince passage of the Intelligence reform bill in 2004, we learned a \ngood deal about what additional changes to law might be needed to \nimprove our intelligence community functions. In addition, as we have \nlearned about such activities as the NSA's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram, we have come to better appreciate the need for strong \ncongressional oversight of the intelligence community.\n  As a matter of fact, the 9/11 Commission said the following in its \nvery lengthy and thoughtful report, ``Strengthen Congressional \nOversight of Intelligence and Homeland Security.'' That is the heading \nof the section, and this is the one pungent sentence from that report \nwhich I hope will cause a lot of people to rethink their opposition to \ncloture on this bill:\n\n       Of all of our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and important.\n\n  Those words should have an impact on the vote that is coming up in \nabout 40 minutes.\n  More than 30 years ago, the Senate passed S. Res. 400, establishing \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence, and charging that committee with \nproviding ``vigilant legislative oversight over the intelligence \nactivities of the United States to assure that such activities are in \nconformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.''\n  The legislation before us today takes significant steps toward \nreinvigorating our oversight responsibility. For example, effective \noversight depends on Members of Congress having timely access to \nintelligence information. Unfortunately, too often that is not the \ncase, as requests from Congress for intelligence information are \nstonewalled and slow walked. Section 108 of the bill before us requires \nthe intelligence community to provide, upon request from the chairman \nor vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee or chairman or \nranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, timely access to \nexisting intelligence assessments, reports, estimates, legal opinions, \nor other intelligence information.\n  The bill before us also advances Congress's oversight of particular \nmatters. For example, section 313 requires the Director of National \nIntelligence to submit a classified report on any clandestine detention \nfacilities operated by the U.S. Government. This public law requirement \nreflects the Intelligence Committee's determination to undertake \nserious oversight of any intelligence community detention and \ninterrogation practices. The bill before us also establishes within the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence an inspector general of \nthe intelligence community. That is a major reform. It is highly \nimportant, and it is long overdue. The creation of an inspector general \nof the intelligence community will strengthen accountability by \npermitting independent examinations of problems, abuses, or \ndeficiencies.\n  We should not let another year go by without an Intelligence \nauthorization bill. We cannot defeat the threats this Nation faces \nwithout the strongest and most effective intelligence community which, \nin turn, requires strong oversight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, later this week there will be a group of \nus in the Senate holding a meeting on trade issues and talking about \nwhat our response will be to the request by President Bush to extend \nwhat they call trade promotion authority. Trade promotion authority is \na slogan that was used to replace fast track because fast track \napparently became some sort of a pejorative term, at least in the minds \nof some. So they came up with the term ``trade promotion authority.'' \nIt is like labeling things healthy forests or clear skies, trade \npromotion authority. What it means is fast track. The Congress, by \nConstitution, has the\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nright to be engaged in foreign commerce. That is where it is described, \nin the Constitution. It is not described as part of executive branch \nresponsibilities. It is described as part of the responsibilities of \nCongress to be involved in the issue of trade and foreign commerce.\n  What has happened over some years is the Congress has given the \nPresident authority to negotiate trade agreements in secret behind \nclosed doors, bring the trade agreements to this Congress, and we agree \nwe will put on a straitjacket and not be allowed to offer any \namendments, and it will be considered as a trade agreement that we have \nnegotiated with some other country under expedited procedures. The \nCongress itself has decided to put itself in a straitjacket with \nsomething called fast track or trade promotion authority. I did not \nsupport that. I didn't support it for President Clinton. I don't \nsupport it for President Bush. President Bush has had fast track trade \npromotion authority now for some while. It is about to expire on June \n30. He is asking that it be extended. As for me, I will not support \nextending it. I hope to be involved with a group of Senators who \nsimilarly will describe the danger to this country's economic future \nthat would be entailed by supporting the extension of fast track or \ntrade promotion authority.\n  Let me describe what the danger is. Some wish to ignore all the \nevidence that exists with respect to trade. The fact is, in the past \nyear our trade deficit in 1 year was $830 billion. What does that \nnumber mean? It probably doesn't mean much to most people. It means \nevery single day we purchase from foreign countries $2 billion more \nthan we are able to sell to foreign countries. Every single day we put \n$2 billion worth of IOUs in the hands of another country. A substantial \nportion of those IOUs is now possessed by China, Japan, and others. \nAbout $1 billion is owed from the citizens of this country to China and \nJapan.\n  In addition to the imbalance of $2 billion a day importing more than \nwe export or consume--saying it another way, about 6 percent more than \nwe produce--we are seeing American jobs being shipped overseas. We have \nactually some cheerleaders for that proposition. We have some people in \nthis country who say isn't that great. Isn't that a wonderful situation \nwhere we can actually move American jobs abroad. None of those people \nwill ever lose their jobs. They will write books and make laws, but \nthey will never lose their jobs. It is the folks who shower after work \nwho lose their jobs; the people who go to the plant, the people on the \nassembly line; the people who find their job is going elsewhere because \nthere is someone else in the world, a billion to a billion and a half \npeople willing to work for 20 or 30 cents an hour. They will work with \nno health care benefits and no retirement benefits and in some cases \nfor 20 cents an hour. If they decide they are being cheated out of \nwages and try to organize workers, they will be sent to prison.\n  That is the new economy? That is the new circumstance of the global \neconomy? That is free trade? That is good for our country? I don't \nthink so.\n  I have spoken at length about this issue. I am for trade and plenty \nof it. Sign me up. I support trade. I like trade. I insist that it be \nfair to this country. I am flat out tired, through fast track, of \nhaving trade agreements being negotiated in secret overseas someplace \nbehind closed doors by U.S. negotiators who forget who they are working \nfor. They bring them to this Chamber under expedited authority called \nfast track and there is the prohibition of any amendment being offered \nto change what is obviously wrong with the agreement. Then it runs \nthrough here like a hot knife through butter. We have had NAFTA and \nCAFTA and U.S.-Canada. We have had all these trade agreements, at the \nend of which we have the largest trade deficit in the history of \nhumankind. It is not even close. Every time we pass a new trade \nagreement, we have a larger deficit.\n  The people who come up with these concoctions called free trade say: \nIsn't this wonderful? No, it is not. Would they say it was wonderful if \nthey were losing their jobs? They wouldn't. But they are not the ones \nlosing their jobs.\n  Alan Blinder, a mainstream economist, former vice chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, said this about the outsourcing of American jobs: \nThere are 40 million American jobs subject to outsourcing. Not all of \nthem will leave this country, but even those that remain will have \ndownward pressure on their income because there is someone else \nsomewhere else in the world willing to work for pennies.\n  So is that the new global economy? Is that the flat world? Mr. \nFriedman wrote the book ``The World is Flat.'' I know better than that; \nso does he. The world is not flat. In the chapter where he looks at \nBangalore, India and says, isn't this wonderful, all these jobs in \nIndia, no, it is not wonderful.\n  Is this the kind of new economy we signed up for? Have we forgotten \nthe lessons, have we forgotten what it took to get to this kind of \nstandard of living?\n  James Fyler was shot 54 times. It was said once he died of lead \npoisoning. I guess when you are shot 54 times--he was actually killed \nin Ludlow, CO, nearly 90 years ago. He was killed because he thought \npeople who went into the coal mines to mine for coal had a right to a \nfair wage and a right to work in a safe workplace.\n  Move forward a century from James Fyler, from people who gave their \nlives to lift the standards in this country, to expand the middle \nclass, to provide for good jobs, demand a fair wage, demand decent \nbenefits, and then ask yourself if, after a century, when we expanded \nthe middle class in this country--with good jobs that pay well--have we \nnow decided there is a new strategy, a bankrupt strategy, which is so-\ncalled free trade, which is unfair to the American worker, because it \nis a race to the bottom, saying to companies: If you can find somebody \nwho will work for 20 cents an hour, have them make the Huffy bicycles, \nhave them make the Radio Flyer little red wagons, have them make the \nFig Newtons, have them make the Hanes underwear, and have them make the \nLevi's. They are all gone because they went in search of cheap labor. \nAll those American jobs are gone. Now, I ask you, is that a road to a \nbetter future for American workers?\n  We, actually, in this Chamber, mind you--not me but a majority--have \nsupported one of the most pernicious provisions I have ever seen, a \nprovision that says: Do you know what, if you want to close your \nmanufacturing plant and fire your workers and move the jobs to China, \nwe intend to give you a big fat tax break for doing it. That is \nunbelievable. I have tried four times to change that in the Senate and \nhave come up short in the vote four straight times. But I guarantee you \nthis: One day, there will be enough clear thinking in this Congress to \ndecide we ought to stop subsidizing the export of American jobs.\n  So I started by saying we have an $830 billion trade deficit. That \nrelates to the export of jobs and the purchase every day of $2 billion \nmore than we are able to ship abroad. We are going to have to repay \nthat someday. You can make a case on the budget deficit that is money \nwhich we owe to ourselves. You cannot make that case with the trade \ndeficit. That will be repaid someday with a lower standard of living in \nthis country.\n  That is why we ought to, as a country, begin worrying about and \nthinking about this new strategy. I am for a fair trade strategy. I am \nfor trade, and plenty of it, but it must be fair to this country. I am \nsick and tired of seeing trade agreements that pull the rug out from \nunder our workers and pull the rug out from under our standards. I want \nto lift people up, not press people down. I do not believe in a future \nin which 40 million to 50 million additional workers are subject to \noutsourcing. But if they are not outsourced, they, nonetheless, can \ncome home and say: Honey, I didn't lose my job today, but they are \ngoing to pay me less.\n  One final point. I spoke here about a week ago about Circuit City. I \ndo not know much about that company. I do know this: They announced \nthey were going to fire 3,400 people. Because they were bad workers? \nNot a bit. No. They said: We are going to fire them because we want to \nrehire other workers to whom we can pay less money. They were making, I \nthink, slightly above $11 an hour. They wanted to fire 3,400 workers so \nthey could hire cheaper workers, less expensive workers.\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\n  I do not know. If you go into a store and ask somebody where the \ncamera counter is, are you going to find a worker who knows? Maybe you \nhave a worker you could pay less money to, but do these companies \nforget that their company is their workers, the company is represented \nby their workforce, that is their brand?\n  We are headed in the wrong direction. There is no social program in \nthis country as important as a good job that pays well. Yet the whole \nnotion here of the companies that want to produce in China and ship \nhere and run their income through the Cayman Islands to avoid paying \ntaxes to this country--the whole notion is, this is a new day, it is a \nnew economy. Don't you understand it? Free trade. That is not fair \ntrade, where I come from.\n  My colleague, Senator Brown, has worked on this issue for a long \nwhile in the U.S. House, and now in the U.S. Senate. I really \nappreciate seeing new voices come to the Senate demanding we move \ntoward fair trade relationships. We can compete, but the competition \nhas to be fair. That has not been the case with any of these trade \nagreements.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor so my colleague, Senator \nBrown, can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for only 5 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to echo much of what Senator Dorgan \nhas said and thank him for his leadership on trade issues. I came to \nthe House of Representatives in 1993, elected in 1992. Our trade \ndeficit was fairly large in those days, we thought: $38 billion. Today, \nas the Senator said, depending on whether you count services in \naddition to manufactured products, it exceeds $800 billion.\n  Interestingly, if you add the aggregate trade deficit from 1992 \nthrough 2006--that means the amount of imports we have brought into our \ncountry versus the amount of exports we have going out of our country--\nwe have had a $4 trillion trade deficit in the aggregate. That is $4 \ntrillion of wealth having gone out of our country.\n  To understand what $4 trillion is, because nobody can really \nunderstand that, if you spent $1,000 every second of every minute of \nevery hour of every day--if you spent $1,000 of every second of every \nminute of every hour of every day--to spend $4 trillion, it would take \nyou 135 years. That is the kind of wealth we have seen go out of our \ncountry. But to understand that in more human terms, let me just share \na story, if I could, for a moment.\n  About 7 or 8 years ago, after the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, unfortunately, passed the House and Senate--Senator Dorgan \nvoted against it in the Senate; I voted against it in the House, a \ndozen or so years ago--I flew to McAllen, TX, at my own expense and \nrented a car and went across the border with a couple of friends and \nvisited Reynosa, Mexico, to see what NAFTA had brought to the border \nareas and to the country of Mexico--at least that part of Mexico.\n\n  I went to the home of two General Electric workers--General Electric, \nMexico. Both made about 90 cents an hour. Both worked pretty much 60 \nhours a week, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. They lived in a home maybe \n20 feet by 15 feet, with no running water, no electricity. They had \ndirt floors. When it rained hard, the floors turned to mud.\n  When you went outside their home--these are people who worked 60 \nhours a week each for an American company, a Mexican subsidiary of an \nAmerican company, 3 miles from the United States of America in Reynosa, \nMexico--if you went outside their home, there was a ditch behind their \nhouse, maybe 4 feet wide, with 2 by 4s across the ditch. Children would \nbe playing in this ditch with human waste, industrial waste--who knows \nwhat was going through it. The American Medical Association said the \nMexican-U.S. border is the most toxic place in the Western Hemisphere. \nAnd these children were playing in whatever this human and industrial \neffluent waste was in this neighborhood.\n  As you walked through this neighborhood, you could tell where the \nworkers worked by the construction materials from which their homes \nwere built--packing materials and cardboard boxes from the companies \nfor which they worked or from the suppliers to the companies for which \nthey worked. They used that as roofs and walls to build their shacks.\n  Again, these are people who hold full-time jobs for General Electric, \nMexico, 3 miles from the United States of America.\n  Then, nearby, within a mile, I visited an auto plant--an auto plant \nthat looked just like an auto plant in Lordstown, OH, Avon Lake, OH, \nwith modern technology, even more modern than what we have often in \nauto plants in Ohio, unfortunately. They had clean floors and hard-\nworking workers who were very productive.\n  There was one difference between the Mexican auto plant and the auto \nplant you would see in Cleveland. The difference was there was no \nparking lot in the Mexican auto plant because, simply put, the workers \nhave not shared in the wealth they produce for their company.\n  You could go halfway around the world. You could go to a Motorola \nplant in Malaysia, and the workers are not paid enough to buy the \nphones they make. You could come back halfway around the world to Costa \nRica to a Disney plant, and the workers do not make enough money to buy \nthe toys they make for their children. You could go back halfway around \nthe world to China, and the workers at the Nike plant are not paid \nenough to buy the shoes they make. The difference in their economy and \nours, and these trading partners where we have huge trade deficits, is \nthe workers are not sharing in the wealth they create.\n  But that is starting to happen in the United States. In the last 30 \nyears, the wealthiest 20 percent in our country, the wealthiest 5 \npercent, the wealthiest 1 percent are seeing their wealth go up while \nwages are stagnant for the rest of the country. That is why the middle \nclass is shrinking, because people who are working hard and playing by \nthe rules simply are not sharing in the wealth they create.\n  They are more productive than they have ever been. We are setting \nproductivity records in this country. Yet wages are stagnant or worse. \nCompanies are outsourcing, companies are going overseas. Senator Dorgan \nsaid those same companies are getting tax breaks and all kinds of \nadvantages, as this body and, across the Capitol, the House of \nRepresentatives continue to pass these job-killing trade agreements \nthat outsource our jobs, that betray our middle class, that mean \nlayoffs of police and fire and teachers and people who make our \ncommunities healthier, as families are hurt by these layoffs or as \nfamilies are hurt by stagnant wages.\n  That is why we need a very different trade policy--whether it is with \nJapan, whether it is with Mexico--a trade policy that lifts up the \nmiddle class and helps to strengthen the middle class, a trade policy \nthat will help workers in the developing world instead of this trade \npolicy that outsources our jobs, betrays our communities, and hurts our \nfamilies.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio has described \nautomobiles as one part of his discussion. I wonder if the Senator from \nOhio knows, for example, with respect to South Korea, we imported about \n700,000 automobiles from South Korea in the last year. We were able to \nexport about 4,000 American cars to South Korea.\n  Now, why the imbalance? Mr. President, 99 percent of the cars driven \non the streets of South Korea are made in South Korea. That is the way \nthey want it. Once in a great while, we have a little burst. The Dodge \nDakota pickup--all of a sudden, it looked like they were going to sell \nsome Dodge Dakota pickups in South Korea. Just like that, the \nGovernment shut that down. Oh, they do it very subtlely, but they know \nwhat they are doing--just like that.\n\n  China is a good example. We did a trade agreement with China. China \nis now creating an automobile export market. They want to be a big \nautomobile exporter and intend to export to this country. Here is what \nwe said to China, a country with which we have a giant trade deficit: \nWhen you ship your Chinese cars to the United States, we\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\nwill impose a 2.5-percent tariff on your cars. And we agree that for \nany U.S. automobiles we would sell in China, you may impose a 25-\npercent tariff. So to a country with which we have a giant trade \ndeficit--we now have a $230 billion trade deficit with China--we have \nsaid: It is OK for you to impose a tariff that is 10 times higher than \nwe would impose on your cars.\n  That is unbelievably ignorant, in my judgment, ignorant of our own \neconomic interests.\n  If I may make one additional point. In Ohio, they used to make Huffy \nbicycles. I have spoken about that at some length on this floor. They \npaid people $11 an hour to make Huffy bicycles. Huffy bicycles are 20 \npercent of the American bicycle market. You can buy them at Wal-Mart, \nKmart, Sears. The people at the plant in Ohio loved their jobs. They \nmade the Huffy bicycles for over a century. They all got fired. They \nall lost their jobs. You can still buy a Huffy bicycle. They are all \nmade in China.\n  But on the last day of work, after they were fired, these Huffy \nbicycle workers, as they drove out of the parking lot of the plant, all \nleft a pair of empty shoes where their car used to sit in the parking \nlot. It was their way of saying to this company: You can ship our jobs \noverseas, but, by God, you are not going to fill our shoes. It was a \npoignant way for workers to say: This job mattered to me. We worked \nhere for a century making bicycles as American workers. And now it is \ngone.\n  It is unbelievable, when you hear these stories and see what the \nconsequences are of American companies that have decided: Do you know \nwhat, the new economy says, let's produce where we can pay people 30 \ncents an hour. Incidentally, that is how much workers get who are now \nproducing Huffy bicycles. They are paid 30 cents an hour. They work 7 \ndays a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. That is what the Ohio workers were \ntold. You cannot compete against that, so you lose.\n  In my judgment, our country, this Senate--Senator Brown and I and \nothers--has to begin standing up for the economic interests of our \ncountry and our workers. If we do not, we will surely see a shrinking \nof the middle class and a dramatic impact on the economy and future \ngrowth of this country. That is why this is such an important issue.\n  Again, let me just say how impressed I am with not only Senator Brown \nbut especially Senator Brown and some others who have joined us in the \nSenate, who will be very strong voices on behalf of a sane, thoughtful, \nsensible protrade policy that is pro-fair trade and stands up for this \ncountry's economic interests.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding to me.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I reemphasize what Senator Dorgan says so \noften; that is, we want trade--plenty of it--we just want it with \ndifferent rules. We want fair trade. Plenty of countries around the \nworld practice trade, as South Korea does, for their own national \ninterests. We practice trade according to some economics textbooks some \ndays, and other days we practice trade according to what is in the \ninterests of these large corporations that outsource. But these \ncompanies--again I use the word ``betray''--they betray our families, \nthey betray our communities when they do what Huffy Bicycles did \nbecause those jobs were good-paying union jobs in Shelby County OH, in \nwestern Ohio. As Senator Dorgan said, they have been there for hundreds \nof years.\n\n  In the far corner of northwest Ohio there is a company called the \nOhio Art Company. The Ohio Art Company makes something that almost \neveryone who grew up in this country knows about: they make the Etch A \nSketch. Some years ago, Wal-Mart went to the Ohio Art Company and said: \nWe want to sell Etch A Sketch in our stores for under $10, and the Ohio \nArt Company couldn't make them for that price, so they pretty much \nmoved most or all of their production to China.\n  It is that kind of betrayal by these corporations, with the \nconcurrence of our Government, because our Government writes the rules \nfor these trade agreements--our Government has consistently practiced \ntrade and allowed our largest companies to practice trade not \naccording--unlike other countries that don't practice it according to \nour national interests, and it is time that we do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator to yield \nfor one more point. The Governor of Pennsylvania, Governor Rendell, \ntried very hard to keep a company in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania House \nFurniture. They make fine furniture with Pennsylvania wood, a very \nspecial kind of Pennsylvania wood. They make top-of-the-line furniture \nand did for a long time--I think for over a century as well. They were \npurchased by La-Z-Boy, and La-Z-Boy decided that Pennsylvania House \nFurniture would be outsourced to China. At that point, Governor Rendell \nand folks in Pennsylvania got involved to try to save Pennsylvania \nHouse Furniture, but they couldn't do it. The jobs all went to China. \nIncidentally, they now ship the wood from Pennsylvania to China, put \nthe furniture together, and then ship it back to be sold as \nPennsylvania House Furniture.\n  There is somebody in this country who has a piece of furniture that \nthey don't understand the value of. The last day at work at this plant \nwhere they had made furniture, these craftsmen, who made top-end, top-\nof-the-line furniture, these craftsmen, the last day of work, on the \nlast piece of furniture that came off the assembly line in \nPennsylvania, turned it over and they all signed it. Someone has a \npiece of furniture with the signatures of all the craftsmen at that \nplant who, on their last day at work, decided they wanted to sign as a \nnote of pride in the work they had just completed.\n  Then the jobs were gone, all gone to China, because the Pennsylvania \nworkers could not compete with those who would work for 25 cents, 30 \ncents, 35 cents an hour. But they shouldn't have to. That is the point \nof our discussion about fair trade.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the next decade our Nation needs to--our \nGovernment needs to come up with a manufacturing policy. If our trade \nlaws and our tax laws continue to encourage outsourcing, continue to \ncontribute to this erosion of the middle class, we will be a country \nwith less and less manufacturing, fewer and fewer manufacturing jobs, \nless and less of an ability to protect our national interests. It is a \nquestion of national security, to be able to have a strong \nmanufacturing component to our economy, and it is a question of \neconomic security for families in places such as Dayton, in places such \nas Steubenville and Painesville and Cleveland, OH, places where people \nhave built middle-class lifestyles, bought their homes, sent their \nchildren to college, worked for a decent retirement because they have \nworked hard and played by the rules and manufactured goods that people \nin our country use.\n  I think it is important as we move forward with Senator Dorgan and \npeople like Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, who is also very \ninterested in this, that we move forward on developing this \nmanufacturing policy on trade, on tax law, and on helping particularly \nour small manufacturers compete in this global economy.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we have seen a considerable number of \nthe members of the Intelligence Committee come up to this floor this \nafternoon, and that is because we have before us S. 372, legislation \nauthorizing funding for our intelligence and national security \nservices. But rather than work with Congress to ensure agencies such as \nthe CIA, FBI, NSA, and many others receive the funding they need to \nmeet their missions and keep Americans safe, the Bush administration \nand some in the Republican minority are stonewalling this legislation.\n  As the newest member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \ndeeply troubled to see this legislation stalled at the expense of the \nsecurity of our Nation. My father was a Foreign Service officer, and \nthrough his eyes I have seen the power of American diplomatic and \nintelligence efforts to do both great good in the world and great harm.\n  In their misuse and in the politicization of America's intelligence \napparatus, President Bush and his administration have done great harm \nto America's standing in the world and our security at home. Now we \nface the\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\nbleak prospect that for the third year in a row the Senate may not pass \nan intelligence authorization bill. This should give every concerned \nAmerican pause.\n  This measure will fund our intelligence community agencies, fight \nterrorism, strengthen our capabilities to collect, analyze, and act on \nintelligence, and, most importantly, expand transparency and oversight \nof our intelligence community. It is a reflection of diligent, \nthorough, and tenacious work by our committee chairman, Jay \nRockefeller, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia whom I see \nwith me on the floor this afternoon, along with his Republican \ncounterpart, Vice Chairman Bond. I was hopeful that at least we could \nend the partisan logjam that has crippled the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee for the last several years. I have been pleased with the \nthoughtful and serious tone of the committee's work on both sides of \nthe aisle. Yet now something has suddenly changed, and the Republican \nminority has maneuvered to block this legislation from becoming law. \nNow it appears the White House has intervened, has called in chits, and \ntwisted arms to stop a bill on which Chairman Rockefeller and Vice \nChairman Bond have worked so long and hard.\n\n  We understand this administration does not want congressional \noversight. They don't want oversight on their inept response to \nHurricane Katrina. They don't want oversight on the unprecedented purge \nof U.S. attorneys. They don't want oversight on the debacle going on in \nIraq. They don't want oversight on intelligence either. But no \nadministration in recent memory has more badly needed congressional \noversight, and in no area has that need been more plainly demonstrated \nthan in the intelligence function of our Government.\n  This is the administration that failed to ensure adequate oversight \nof national security letters under the PATRIOT Act. This is the \nadministration that conducted its own secret wiretap program to monitor \nconversations, including the conversations of U.S. citizens. This is \nthe administration that established its own secret prison network \noffshore to hold terrorism suspects off the record of this country's \nlegitimate judicial institutions. This is the administration that \ncherry-picked its intelligence to justify the claim of Iraqi weapons of \nmass destruction. That abuse of intelligence alone cost our country \nthousands of lives, billions of dollars, and damage to our relations \nwith allies around the world that will linger for many years.\n  One can see why this administration would resist congressional \noversight, but Congress is obligated to oversee our country's national \nsecurity and intelligence-gathering services. That is our duty under \nthe Constitution. This duty is particularly important with the covert \nintelligence agencies because their work is not subject to public \ninquiry. These are not organizations that work in the bright light of \nday but in the deep dark of the secrecy they require to be effective. \nSo meaningful and appropriate congressional oversight is our only \nsafeguard.\n  This administration welcomes oversight less than almost any I can \nthink of, but no administration in recent memory has needed it more. \nPerhaps the Nixon administration, but like the Nixon administration, \nthis administration's resistance to congressional oversight is a \nmeasure of how badly that oversight is needed. Unfortunately, for too \nmany years this Congress has conducted oversight by the principle, \n``out of sight, out of mind'' or maybe ``see no evil, hear no evil, \nspeak no evil.'' You don't have to look far to see how badly this \nstrategy has failed.\n  But there is a new team in town and a new leadership of this Congress \nthat takes these responsibilities seriously. It is an abdication of our \nresponsibility under the Constitution, and it is irresponsible with \nrespect to the security of our Nation to let this legislation languish.\n  I urge my colleagues in the minority to reconsider their actions, to \nreturn to this floor in good faith, to continue the good work that \nChairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond have so nobly accomplished, \nand to give our intelligence agencies the funding they need to keep us \nsafe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to truly \ncongratulate the Senator from Rhode Island for his statement which was \ndelivered forcefully, intelligently, accurately, and with great \nconviction which comes from his extremely broad experience in life.\n  For this Senator's part, my view is this: Unless the Senate invokes \ncloture and moves to finish action on the fiscal year 2007 \nauthorization bill, we have failed for the third time, or as Senator \nLevin put it, since 2004 when we last passed it, to pass important \nnational security legislation. Everything that the American people are \nworried about, everything that comes out of events like yesterday in \nBlacksburg, VA--and by the way, I spent a good deal of time on the \nphone talking to students I know down there--everything points to a \nmassive, tectonic change in the way we are carrying on.\n  I speak very proudly of a PBS series which is looking at this whole \nsubject. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, 12 \nconsecutive hours of looking at what Islam is, what it isn't; what \njihad is, what it isn't; and how we came to this point. It is done from \nall points of view, usually without any journalists, just soldiers \ntalking. It is brilliant, and I recommend it to my colleagues.\n  We tried last week to move the Intelligence authorization bill, and \nwe were prevented from doing so due to objection from some of our \nRepublican colleagues. When cloture on the motion to proceed was passed \nlast Thursday, the vote was 94 to 3. That is not just to drop off a \nnumber, that is a significant expression of public will in the Senate. \nThe Senate was again prevented from moving to the bill for the purpose \nof debate and amendment by a continued Republican objection, forced 30 \nhours to run on the motion to proceed. As a result, we have wasted 2 \ndays.\n\n  As my distinguished and good friend Senator Bond said, we wasted 2 \ndays when we could have considered and disposed of many amendments, \nwhich we were prepared to do.\n  Vice Chairman Bond and I have been working together, the two of us, \nto clear and pass amendments even this day, and have done so, a goodly \nnumber of very important ones, because we are determined that this \nshould work. However, many of those 42 amendments filed are extraneous, \nand they are nonrelevant. We have to pay attention to those things that \nare outside the jurisdiction of the Senate Intelligence Committee and \nthe purpose of the authorization bill so they don't fall, but we won't \nbe able to get to those.\n  So I would just conclude this way. Oversight of the activities of the \nU.S. intelligence community is a necessary and essential duty of this \nbody. It is a duty which Vice Chairman Bond and I take extremely \nseriously. He is very aggressive about it and cares a great deal about \nit. I do, too. I think it defines the integrity of the process with \nwhich we protect our Nation and the people who protect our Nation, \ncovertly, overtly, as the Senator from Rhode Island talked about.\n  So it is our constitutional duty. I don't like to be in dereliction \nof my constitutional duty at any particular time. I can't think of any \ntime that is more important to me not to do so than right now.\n  In addition, I fear that it sends a disturbing message to the \nclandestine collectors and the intelligence analysts of the \nintelligence community who actually watch us and pay a lot more \nattention to us, particularly here in Washington, and read our tea \nleaves and take their signals about where they stand on our priority \nlist. I want them to stand at the very top. I think the vice chairman \nwants them to stand at the very top. If we do not consider them a \nlegislative priority, then I am saddened by that.\n  I call upon my colleagues to set aside politics and vote for cloture \nand final passage of this intelligence authorization bill that has \nlanguished in legislative limbo for more years than I am happily \nwilling to admit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I regret we have come to an impasse. The \nchairman and I and the members of the committee have worked very hard \nto get a bill that is getting much better. I am very sorry that we were \nnot allowed to\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\nvote on amendments this afternoon and to continue with our efforts to \nmove this bill forward. The leaders are responsible on both sides for \nrunning this body, and we are in a position now where it appears to the \nminority that amendments will not--could be precluded under that \ncircumstance. I am afraid there will not be the support for cloture. I \nregret that we have worked so long and hard and apparently will not be \nable to continue with this bill. I hope to do so at a later time.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider is agreed to.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed and concerned \nabout the continuing Republican filibuster of the fiscal year 2007 \nIntelligence authorization bill. This bill is critical for our national \nsecurity. It supports the intelligence community while ensuring that \nCongress can conduct necessary oversight of our intelligence \nactivities. Failure to pass this legislation would undermine the men \nand women of our intelligence community who look to Congress not only \nfor funding but for policy guidance and legal clarity. It also sends a \nterrible signal to the American people, that despite repeated abuses by \nthis administration from warrantless wiretapping to National Security \nLetters, Senate Republicans have chosen to shield the administration \nfrom congressional scrutiny and oversight. Unchecked executive \nauthority is contrary to our constitutional system. And the American \npeople understand well what the 9/11 Commission stressed--that strong \ncongressional oversight is an essential part of defending and \nprotecting America.\n  There are a number of provisions of the bill that I view as \nparticularly important. Besides authorizing the intelligence programs \nthat help keep us safe, the bill improves congressional oversight of \nthe intelligence community and advances the critical work of \nintelligence reform. The National Security Act requires that the \ncongressional intelligence committees be kept fully and currently \ninformed of all intelligence activities. The administration failed to \ncomply with this law with regard to its illegal warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. I am pleased, therefore, that this bill limits the ability of \nthe executive branch to deny information to the full membership of the \nIntelligence Committee. I am also pleased that the classified annex to \nthe bill includes my amendment calling on the administration to work \nwith the committee to ensure adequate oversight of the program, which \nhas not yet occurred.\n  With regard to intelligence reform, the bill establishes, within the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, an inspector general \nof the intelligence community, which will strengthen accountability \nacross the community. The bill also requires the declassification of \nthe aggregate budget for all intelligence activities. This longstanding \nintelligence reform goal, which was recommended by the 9/11 Commission, \nwill allow for basic budget transparency and a level of accountability \nwithout damaging our national security.\n  The bill includes an amendment I offered to the classified annex with \nSenator Rockefeller calling for more intelligence resources to be \ndirected toward Africa. The continent presents a wide range of threats, \nsuch as terrorist havens and the transnational movements of terrorist \norganizations, while corruption, authoritarianism and poverty allow \nthese conditions to fester. In order to bolster our national security, \nwe need greater information and understanding of these threats. Of \nparticular concern is Somalia, where the committee encouraged the \nintelligence community to work with other agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment on a comprehensive strategic plan for stability. \nUnfortunately, since the amendment was originally accepted by the \ncommittee in May 2006, the situation in the Horn of Africa has only \ndeteriorated and the overall U.S. Government strategy for addressing \nthe crisis remains sorely inadequate.\n  Finally, I am pleased that, in response to the concerns of Senator \nWyden and myself, a provision creating a new exemption to the Privacy \nAct has been removed. Widespread abuses involving National Security \nLetters recently uncovered by the Department of Justice inspector \ngeneral only underscore why Congress must conduct vigorous oversight of \nhow current authorities are being used before providing new ones.\n  I again express my disappointment that the bill is being filibustered \nand hope that the bill will soon be passed into law.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to talk to my colleagues about my \namendment No. 866 to protect the classified information handled by \nCongress.\n  Having served on the Intelligence Committee for 8 years, no one needs \nto tell me how important it is for Congress to have the information it \nneeds to perform oversight of the intelligence community.\n  However, we must be mindful that much of this information could do \ngreat damage to our national security.\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\nThis bill includes what I believe are misguided provisions related to \nclandestine prisons, the Detainee Treatment Act, and the enormous \nexpansion of access to highly sensitive national security information.\n  The bill would declassify information about the intelligence budget, \ndramatically expand the number of members and staff with access to the \nmost sensitive national security information our government holds, and \nprovide details of the interrogation techniques used by our military \nand intelligence community.\n  Can anyone imagine what would happen if al-Qaida became privy to the \ninterrogation techniques our military and intelligence community use? \nDoes anyone think al-Qaida wouldn't adapt and train its terrorists \naccordingly?\n  I believe disseminating this information is a mistake. But, if we are \ngoing to disseminate it, we must put in place a mechanism to ensure \nthis sensitive information does not get into the hands of our enemies. \nAnd we must give pause to those who would use this information to \nconduct their own personal foreign policies, as has been seen in the \nsystematic use of leaks of classified information in recent years.\n  My amendment will ensure this information is treated as it should be \nby imposing a 10-year criminal penalty on those Members and staff who \nleak our national security secrets.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Medicare \nprescription drug program that Congress passed a little over 3 years \nago with a bipartisan majority. We have all heard the very impressive \nstatistics associated with the Medicare Part D program. More than 90 \npercent of seniors eligible for the benefit have drug coverage, and \nthey will save on average $1,200 per year.\n  More importantly, more than 80 percent of enrolled seniors have \nexpressed their satisfaction with the program. Competition in the \nprescription drug benefit has forced down costs far below what was \nanticipated. In 2007, the average premium for the benefit was $22 a \nmonth, 40 percent less than projected at the outset.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's new budget estimate for the next 10 \nyears shows that net Medicare costs for the prescription drug benefit \nwill be more than 30 percent, or $256 billion, lower than originally \nforecast. Not only are the costs for this prescription drug benefit \nlower than expected, but for 2007 more drugs are also being covered by \nparticipating plans than last year. The average plan now covers 4,300 \ndrugs in its formulary versus 3,800 last year, a 13-percent increase.\n  The basic point is this: We passed a prescription drug benefit that \nuses market competition to provide critical medications to seniors at a \ncost much lower than originally projected. The results so far \ndemonstrate a familiar principle: competition and choice bring lower \nprices and, I might add, better service.\n  There are some who want to change that successful model, so we have \nto ask ourselves: How does their plan improve on this very successful \nGovernment program?\n  Since I believe being a zealous guardian of the taxpayers' dollars is \none of the reasons my constituents sent me here, one of the first \nquestions I ask is: Will the alternative plan of interfering with this \nmarket-based competition actually save taxpayers money while continuing \nto provide choice and access to prescription drugs for seniors?\n  The simple answer to this question is, no, and you don't have to take \nmy word for it. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined \nthat the proposal that is before us would have a ``negligible effect'' \non reducing Government spending.\n  The advocates of this particular proposal that is pending before us \ncannot point to any Government source that will support their claim \nthat the Federal Government can negotiate more effectively than the \nprivate market. Specifically, CBO writes that ``CBO estimates that H.R. \n4 would have a negligible effect on Federal spending because we \nanticipate that the Secretary would be unable to negotiate prices \nacross the broad range of covered part D drugs that are more favorable \nthan those obtained by PDPs under current law.'' Secretary Leavitt \ndescribes in practice how having the Government negotiate drug prices \nwill not lead to lower costs for beneficiaries or taxpayers. He has \nwritten:\n\n       We are seeing large-scale negotiations with drug \n     manufacturers, but they are being conducted by private plans, \n     not the government. A robust market with a lot of competitors \n     has driven down prices. It's the magic of the market. To \n     assume that the government, in our genius, could improve on \n     this belies the reality of a complex task.\n\n  In fact, public opinion polls back up Secretary Leavitt's comments. A \nstudy by the Tarrance Group found that only 28 percent of seniors \nbelieve that the Government would do a better job in setting drug \nprices than a competitive marketplace.\n  The Washington Post agrees. It has written, on January 14:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. Government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  As policymakers, it is also our job to ask: What are the potential \nconsequences of this new legislation that is pending before us? Quite \nsimply, the consequences are dire. Since Government will decide which \ndrugs seniors have access to, seniors will be left with fewer choices.\n  In terms of analyzing the consequences of this alternative plan, it \nis helpful to look at examples in other countries that have tried what \nDemocrats are now advocating in this model. We don't have to guess \nabout what the consequences would be because other countries have tried \nit. I recently read a piece published in the Washington Post and \nwritten by Alberto Mingardi, president of a think tank in Italy, and I \nwant to quote from this article because I believe it demonstrates my \npoint. He writes about the Democrats' plan to require the Government to \nset prices, or at least giving the Secretary the authority to do that. \nHe said:\n\n       It would create a Medicare drug program that looks a lot \n     like the system we have in my country, Italy, where drug \n     prices are among the lowest in Europe. At first glance, this \n     might seem like an enviable model for America to follow. But \n     before Pelosi rushes down the road to Italian-style health \n     care, let me offer a word of caution. Italy is hardly a \n     health care paradise. In fact, it's more like a quagmire of \n     red tape.\n       For the most part, Italy's lower drug prices are the \n     product of government price controls. In Italy, these price \n     controls have created a number of problems. The government's \n     attempt to force down drug prices has not produced overall \n     health-care spending. Rather, it has resulted in a spike in \n     demand--which is one reason why Italy's health-care spending \n     has skyrocketed, growing nearly 68 percent between 1995 and \n     2003.\n       As for the quality of Italy's care, that, too, has \n     suffered. With demand for drugs rising, the Italian \n     government has attempted to save money by adopting \n     reimbursement policies that favor certain drugs over others. \n     Unfortunately, the most innovative products often aren't \n     considered reimbursable by the government precisely because \n     they are the most expensive.\n       It's a great system if you just need an antibiotic. But if \n     you're hoping to avoid open heart surgery through access to a \n     miracle drug, it can be a nightmare.\n\n  He concludes.\n\n       The economy is also harmed. Because it's simply not \n     profitable for companies to invent cures in Italy, price \n     controls have decimated Italy's pharmaceutical industry. So \n     by attempting to hold down drug prices, the Italian \n     government has deprived its citizens of the best care without \n     reducing health-care spending. And it has deprived the \n     country of what could be a vibrant sector of the economy. In \n     their rush to revamp Medicare, U.S. policy leaders should be \n     careful not to make the same mistake.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nits entirety in the Record at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I also want to stress the last sentence \nthat I read one more time, where he says: It is a great system, if you \nneed an antibiotic. But if you are hoping to avoid open heart surgery \nthrough access to a miracle drug, it can be a nightmare.\n  We don't need to go down this path. We don't have to change course. \nRight now, under Medicare Part D, market forces and competition have \ncreated a wildly popular benefit that uses market competition to \nprovide critical medications to seniors at costs much lower than \nprojected a few short years ago.\n  I have spent a few moments describing my concern with the Democrats'\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\nplan to ``so-called'' negotiate prices. I would say to ration drugs is \na more accurate description. But by far my biggest concern about this \nbill is, of course, another example of their preference for Government \ncontrol in health care rather than market-driven, patient-centered \napproaches favored by those of us on this side of the aisle.\n\n  I would urge my colleagues to call this debate what it is: It is not \nso much about noninterference clauses in Medicare prescription drug \nlaws. There is a much more importantly and potentially consequential \ndebate about whom Americans want to be making decisions in our health \ncare system. Do they want it to be the Government or do they want it to \nbe patients themselves and their doctors?\n  I recently read a quote from a physician in Switzerland that I found \nparticularly poignant. He reminds us that:\n\n       We all have a single-payer health care system. Citizens \n     always wind up paying for health care, either through taxes, \n     insurance premiums, or out-of-pocket costs. The real question \n     is whether they will have a single-decider system. In many \n     European countries, there are single-decider systems in which \n     governments and their agents control what medical services \n     its citizens will or will not receive.\n\n  Of course, we know all too well how close we are in this country to \nhaving a single-payer health care system. Roughly, 50 cents of every \nhealth care dollar we spend in the United States is spent directly by \nthe U.S. Government. The health care economy is approximately $2 \ntrillion annually, or one-sixth of the entire U.S. economy. I believe \nwe have to reform our health care system, emphasizing individual choice \nand trusting patients and their families and their doctors to make the \nright choices--not lawyers or, yes, even bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC,--to make the important health care and treatment decisions.\n  So make no mistake about it, this bill is about a much larger issue \nthan the title of the legislation itself would suggest. We are not \ndebating some sterile provision called a noninterference clause. We are \ndebating something far more significant.\n  The Washington Post believes this debate is about something much \nlarger than the noninterference clause as well, and they have written:\n\n       The Democrats' stance is troubling because it suggests an \n     excessively governmental-led view of health care reform. The \n     better approach is to let each insurer offer its own version \n     of the right balance, see whether it attracts customers, and \n     then adapt flexibly.\n\n  In my State, the Dallas Morning News has written:\n\n       When congressional Democrats press for this change next \n     year, remember they're pushing for much more than lower \n     prices. They're seeking to move the line where government \n     should stop and the marketplace should start.\n\n  I do agree with the Democrats that this debate is about negotiation, \nbut the real question is not should we have negotiation but who should \nnegotiate. The proponents of this legislation believe it should be the \nGovernment, and I couldn't disagree more. The proponents of this \nlegislation believe the Government is more skilled in making pricing \ndecisions than the free market, and I have to say, I think that is \nwrong.\n  We have been presented in this legislation with a remarkably clear \nchoice: If you believe the way to improve our broken health care system \nis to embrace a market-driven approach that lowers costs and does not \nreduce choices for seniors, then you will vote to continue the \nprescription drug program that we passed a few short years ago. If you \nbelieve, as the advocates of this legislation do, that Government \nbureaucrats are better suited than the free market to make pricing \ndecisions for thousands of prescription drugs, then you will want to \nvote for this legislation.\n  I will vote for the current market-driven approach that provides \nchoices for seniors and puts patients and doctors in control rather \nthan the Government, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 12, 2006]\n\n                        Drug Price Path To Avoid\n\n                         (By Alberto Mingardi)\n\n       The next speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-\n     Calif.), has let it be known that within her first 100 hours \n     on the job, she will move to allow the government to \n     negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to obtain \n     lower drug prices for Medicare patients.\n       Her plan would create a Medicare drug program that looks a \n     lot like the system we have in my country, Italy, where drug \n     prices are among the lowest in Europe. And that's pretty low, \n     considering that drugs in Europe average about 60 percent \n     less than in the United States. Even as U.S. prices rose, \n     Italian drug prices decreased by 5 percent last year.\n       At first glance, this might seem an enviable model for \n     America to follow. But before Pelosi rushes down the road to \n     Italian-style health care, allow me to offer a word of \n     caution. Italy is hardly a health-care paradise. In fact, \n     it's more like a quagmire of red tape.\n       For the most part. Italy's lower drug prices are the \n     product of government price controls. The state purchases \n     nearly 60 percent of the nation's prescription drugs. And it \n     supposedly negotiates prices directly with pharmaceutical \n     companies. But since the Italian government controls such a \n     disproportionate share of the market, it in effect dictates \n     drug prices. In Italy, these price controls have created a \n     number of problems.\n       First, they distort the laws of supply and demand. Because \n     of the country's artificially low drug prices, demand for \n     pharmaceuticals is artificially high--higher than it would be \n     under free-market conditions. The point is that the \n     Government's attempt to force down drug prices has not \n     reduced overall health-care spending. Rather, it has resulted \n     in a spike in demand--which is one reason why Italy's health-\n     care spending has skyrocketed, growing nearly 68 percent \n     between 1995 and 2003.\n       As for the quality of Italy's care, that, too, is \n     suffering. With demand for drugs rising, the Italian \n     government has attempted to save money by adopting \n     reimbursement policies that favor certain drugs over others. \n     Unfortunately, the most innovative products often aren't \n     considered reimbursable by the government precisely because \n     they are the most expensive.\n       It's a great system if you just need an antibiotic. But if \n     you're hoping to avoid open-heart surgery through access to a \n     miracle drug, it can be a nightmare. And Italians are lacking \n     more than just choice in cutting-edge drugs. They also lack \n     information. According to a recent survey, more than 50 \n     percent of Italy's patients believe that the national health \n     service cannot even supply adequate information about \n     treatments and drugs.\n       The economy is also harmed. Because it's simply not \n     profitable for companies to invent cures in Italy, price \n     controls have decimated Italy's pharmaceutical industry. \n     Today not one of the world's 50 largest drug manufacturers \n     has its headquarters in Italy, even though the country is the \n     world's seventh-largest economy. Because most drug and \n     biotechnology companies are outside Italy's borders, there \n     are only 84,000 pharmaceutical workers in Italy's entire drug \n     industry. The industry has become a perfect target for \n     Italy's politicians, because they can rail against it with \n     little political downside. The more we follow this path, the \n     less likely it is for Italian companies to develop valuable \n     innovations--at great risk for both our economy and our \n     health.\n       So by attempting to hold down drug prices, the Italian \n     government has deprived its citizens of the best care without \n     reducing health-care spending. And it has deprived the \n     country of what could be a vibrant sector of the economy. In \n     their rush to revamp medicare, U.S. Policy leaders should be \n     careful not to make the same mistake.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concerns about S. \n3, the Medicare Fair Prescription Drug Price Act of 2007.\n  Back in 2003, I helped draft the Medicare Modernization Act. I was \none of the Senate's chief negotiators for the House-Senate conference \non this legislation. We wrote legislation that was approved by both \nChambers of Congress and signed into law by the President in December \n2005. And by enacting this legislation, Medicare beneficiaries are now \noffered a quality prescription drug benefit at an affordable price. It \nis a successful program by any measure.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about the Medicare Modernization \nAct of 2003 and what a difference it has made in the lives of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Today, there are 38 million Medicare beneficiaries and over 90 \npercent participate in the Medicare Part D program. Eighty percent of \nMedicare Part D beneficiaries are happy with their Medicare \nprescription drug plan. And they are happy with their plans, because \nthey have a choice in coverage--beneficiaries are able to get a plan \nthat meets their needs. We don't have a one-size-fits-all program \nattempting to stretch over 38 million people. The cost savings have \nbeen profound for both beneficiaries and for taxpayers.\n  When the Medicare Part D plan first began in January 2006, we thought \nthat the average premium would be around\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\n$37 per month. Because of plan competition, the average premium is $22 \na month. That has reflected for taxpayers over $113 billion of savings \nover what Congress had originally estimated. And the other good news is \nthat if a beneficiary hits the doughnut hole--the point where the \nbeneficiary has to pay out of pocket for his or her prescriptions--\nthere are now plans in every State that will provide coverage through \nthe doughnut hole period.\n  As we all know, back in January, the House of Representatives passed \nlegislation that would require the prices of prescription drugs \nreceived under the Medicare Part D program to be negotiated by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. Late last week, the Senate \nFinance Committee also approved S. 3, the Medicare Fair Prescription \nDrug Price Act of 2007. While this legislation does not mandate that \nthe Secretary negotiate drug prices for the Medicare Part D benefit, it \ngives the Secretary the discretion to do so.\n  Any way you look at it, Congress requiring the Secretary to negotiate \nprescription drug prices would lead to a one-size-fits-all drug plan \nwhich would result in fewer choices. Beneficiaries would have less \nsatisfaction with a one-size-fits-all plan. And, in my opinion, drug \nprices will not be lower.\n  In addition, beneficiaries would have fewer choices. When you \nnegotiate drug prices, there is really only one way to do it. You limit \nthe choices available. You say I am going to take your medication off \nyour drug plan or I am only going to pay X amount for a drug, a price \nso low that perhaps the manufacturer cannot participate. If the \nGovernment starts doing that, suddenly you have the Government making \nchoices about who can get what drug as opposed to beneficiaries and \ntheir doctors making those decisions.\n  Currently there are over 4,400 drugs available on Medicare Part D \nplans. Beneficiaries may choose a plan that meets their needs. That is \nexactly why 80 percent of Medicare Part D beneficiaries are happy. And \nfor those who aren't, the good news is we can help find a plan that \nserves them better. If we had one plan, one formulary, then we would \nhave a lot more unhappy people.\n  And how does the Secretary of Health and Human Services feel about \nthis new responsibility? I would like to take a minute to read an \neditorial that appeared in the Washington Post on January 11, 2007. \nThis editorial was written by Secretary Mike Leavitt, not only a good \nfriend of mine but a very thoughtful, knowledgeable, and openminded \nSecretary of HHS as far as health care policy is concerned. ``Medicare \nAnd the Market Government Shouldn't Be Negotiating Prescription \nPrices,'' by Mike Leavitt, Thursday, January 11, 2007; Page A25:\n\n       We all want people with Medicare to get the prescription \n     drugs they need at the lowest possible prices. The issue \n     before Congress this week is how best to do that. Should \n     consumer choice and private-sector competition determine \n     prices--or should government?\n       The success of the Medicare prescription drug benefit \n     provides strong evidence that competition among private drug \n     plans has contributed significantly to lowering costs. The \n     average monthly premium has dropped by 42 percent, from an \n     estimated $38 to $22--and there is a plan available for less \n     than $20 a month in every state. The net Medicare cost of the \n     drug program has fallen by close to $200 billion since its \n     passage in 2003.\n       Seniors and people with disabilities like the benefit. \n     Studies consistently show that three-quarters of Medicare \n     beneficiaries are satisfied with their coverage. Individuals \n     like being able to choose the plan that best fits their \n     needs. A single, one-size-fits-all drug plan would have made \n     the choice easier, and Congress did create a standard plan. \n     But fewer than 15 percent of enrollees have selected that \n     standard plan--opting instead for plans with lower premiums, \n     no deductibles and enhanced coverage.\n       Despite the success of the benefit, some people believe \n     government can do a better job of lowering prices than a \n     competitive marketplace. Legislation under consideration \n     would require the secretary of health and human services to \n     negotiate and set the prices of drugs. In effect, one \n     government official would set more than 4,400 prices for \n     different drugs, making decisions that would be better made \n     by millions of individual consumers.\n       There is also the danger that government price setting \n     would limit drug choices. Medicare provides access to the \n     broadest array of prescription drugs, including the newest \n     drugs. But price negotiation inevitably results in the \n     withholding of access to some drugs to get manufacturers to \n     lower prices.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs, often cited as an \n     example of how government can negotiate prices, operates an \n     excellent program for veterans, but the VA formulary excludes \n     a number of new drugs covered by the Medicare prescription \n     benefit. Even Lipitor, the world's best-selling drug, isn't \n     on the VA formulary. That may be one reason more than a \n     million veterans are also getting drug coverage through \n     Medicare.\n       Some observers point to the massive buying power of the \n     federal government as the means to exert clout over drug \n     companies, but the federal government has nowhere near the \n     market power of the private sector. Private-sector insurance \n     plans and pharmacy benefit managers, who negotiate prices \n     between drug companies and pharmacies, cover about 241 \n     million people, or 80 percent of the population. Medicare \n     could cover at most 43 million.\n\n  The independent Congressional Budget Office has said that government \nprice negotiation would have a ``negligible effect on federal \nspending.'' And previous experience with Congress and Medicare \nregulating drug prices has not been reassuring. Medicare Part B, which \ncovers physician services, outpatient hospital care and other services, \nsets the prices for some medicines--notably a number of cancer drugs. \nIt has a history of reimbursing at rates substantially greater than \nprevailing prices. In 2005, Part B drug spending increased by almost 20 \npercent.\n  If the Federal Government begins picking drugs and setting prices for \nall Medicare beneficiaries, administrative costs would add a new burden \nto taxpayers. The Department of Health and Human Services would have to \nhire hundreds of new employees. Legions of lobbyists would follow, each \nseeking higher Medicare payments for the drug companies they represent. \nAs a Post editorial noted in November, ``having the government set drug \nprices is a sure way of flooding the political system with yet more \npharmaceutical lobbyists and campaign spending.''\n  There is a proper role for government in setting standards and \nmonitoring those who provide the benefit. We should ensure that \nbeneficiaries have access to medically necessary treatments. But \ngovernment should not be in the business of setting drug prices or \ncontrolling access to drugs. That is a first step toward the type of \ngovernment-run health care that the American people have always \nrejected.\n  There are many ways the administration and Congress can work together \nto make health care more affordable and accessible. But undermining the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, which has improved the lives and \nhealth of millions of seniors and people with disabilities, is not one \nof them.\n  Secretary Leavitt is correct--providing flexible prescription drug \nplans to beneficiaries should be one of our top goals. Getting Medicare \nbeneficiaries the best price possible for their prescription drugs \nshould be one of our top goals. And offering Medicare beneficiaries \nhigh quality prescription drug plans should be one of our top goals. In \nmy reading of this legislation, passage will result in none of these \ngoals being achieved and, in fact could result in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit becoming a national formulary which could \nresult in higher prices for drugs and limited choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  When we were drafting this bill, we took great care to provide \nprotections to Medicare beneficiaries who decided to participate in the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Plan. We wanted to provide beneficiaries \nwith a drug benefit that would not cost them an arm and a leg, and that \nwould allow access to a wide range of prescription drug choices.\n  In order to preserve those choices, the Medicare Modernization Act \nprohibits the Secretary from establishing a formulary. If the Secretary \ncannot lower prices without a formulary and if it is prohibited by law \nfor the Secretary to establish a formulary then I ask you--what is the \npurpose of this bill?\n  I believe that, should this bill become law, it will be no time \nbefore its supporters decide that now they want the Secretary to \nestablish a formulary. I think this bill is a Trojan horse with a \nMedicare formulary hidden inside.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think carefully about this \nissue. I urge them to talk to their Medicare beneficiaries in their \nstates and ask them whether or not they are happy with their \nprescription drug plans. I believe that they will find that almost \neveryone is happy with their current\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\nbenefit and changing this benefit is a terrible mistake on our part.\n\n\n                   federal income tax filing deadline\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the tax man cometh.\n  Americans have April 17 circled on their calendars, and not with a \nsmiley face.\n  This year, roughly 135 million Americans sat down to complete their \ntax returns. Many have made the unfortunate discovery that they owe \nadditional money to the IRS.\n  Others are shocked to learn that they owe something called the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  I would like to emphasize one point today, a point that many of my \nconstituents have learned the hard way: their tax burden is already too \nhigh.\n  For middle-class Americans, tax day has become an aggravation at \nbest, and an outrage at worst.\n  Many Utahns, as well as distraught taxpayers throughout the Nation, \nknow the look of tax overload. They see it when they look in the \nmirror, and they see it when they look at their spouse.\n  There is the kitchen table. A late night. Some scattered papers and \nreceipts. An elbow on the table. And a hand on the forehead in \ndisbelief. This is the look of overtaxed Americans. It is the look of \nmisery and confusion. It does not need to be this way.\n  There are economic burdens as well, and that burden is only going to \ngrow if the Democrats get their way.\n  Many of us pay too much in taxes already. But the policies of the \ncongressional majority are a blueprint for even higher taxes. Neither \nour citizens nor our economy can bear much more.\n  Middle-class Americans are overtaxed.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, this year Americans will work 120 \ndays to pay their total tax burden.\n  Let's put this in perspective. They will work 62 days to pay for \ntheir house and home. They will work 52 days for health and medical \ncare. They will work 30 days for food. But they will work 120 days to \npay their taxes.\n  If you told my parents' generation that their tax burden would be \nthat high, they would have thought we lost a war to France.\n  But the Democrats are not satisfied. They want the so-called rich to \npay more of their so-called fair share.\n  Let me translate. By ``rich'' they mean anyone with a job.\n  And by ``fair share,'' they mean empty your wallet.\n  According to recent data from the IRS, persons making more than \n$30,122, or the top 50 percent of all income earners, paid 97 percent \nof all income taxes in 2004, the latest year there were data available.\n  Those who made more than $60,041 in 2004, the top 25 percent, paid 85 \npercent of all income taxes.\n  These people are not rich.\n  As one of my Democratic colleagues noted earlier this year, a mother \nand a father making $90,000 a year in a place like Virginia or New York \nor California or New Jersey are not rich. They are doing the best they \ncan to provide for their families. And once you factor in taxes, \nhousing, clothing, medical care, and college savings, those paychecks \ndo not go that far.\n  The middle class is already paying out much more in taxes than is \nspent by the Government on its behalf.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, an individual making over $65,000 a \nyear pays $7,217 more in taxes every year than is spent for him or her.\n  But for some Members of this body, our system is still not \nprogressive enough.\n  I know that there are some policy wonks and political strategists who \nthink the days of tax revolt are over.\n  Apparently we are at some postpartisan, end of history, where \nAmericans just accept big government and big bites out of their \npaychecks.\n  I for one am not buying it.\n  It seems some things never change in this country.\n  One of those things is the commitment of Americans to their rights of \nlife, liberty, and property.\n  Americans remain very jealous of their liberties, and rightly so. \nChief among our liberties is the freedom to use the money you earn \nthrough your hard work and initiative, to build your business, buy a \nhome, and take care of your family.\n  Working hard to fund some new Government bureaucracy is not at the \ntop of the list. If taxes go up significantly, the party responsible is \ngoing to be in for a rude awakening. They are going to be reminded, \nwith grave electoral consequences, that the Government can take only so \nmuch.\n  Along with many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I think \nour tax burden is still too high. Many Americans still pay too much. \nThe estate tax still destroys family businesses. Too many startup \nbusinesses are killed off by taxes before they have begun. We need to \nbe providing tax incentives so people can responsibly save for their \nretirement and health care. We need to be coming up with innovative tax \npolicies and entitlement reforms.\n  Instead, the Democrats are keeping mum as Medicare and Social \nSecurity take on water, keeping to themselves their foolproof plan to \nbail us out: Raise taxes.\n  The combined unfunded liability for Social Security and Medicare is \n$84 trillion. That is ``trillion'' dollars. Where is that money coming \nfrom? They are having a hard time coming up with money today for a $50 \nbillion 1-year fix for the AMT, the alternative minimum tax. Where are \nthey going to get $84 trillion?\n  Do not worry, they tell us; they are going to fix Social Security and \nMedicare. But fixing it their way will break the backs of middle-class \ntaxpayers. Mark my words, they will raise taxes on the middle class, \ntaking away or limiting savings vehicles for health and retirement. \nThey will raise taxes on individuals, hiking rates and hurting \nfamilies. And they will raise taxes on businesses, killing industry and \nchoking initiative.\n  Conservatives are fond of saying that ideas have consequences. They \ncertainly do. There are important differences between the parties. In \ntheir guts, Democrats distrust markets, believe that more Government \nintervention and Government programs are the answer, and are willing to \nhike taxes to achieve their goals.\n  Those of us on this side of the aisle believe in personal \nresponsibility, low taxes, and encouraging the freedom, \nentrepreneurialism, and dynamism of the American people.\n  Ideas have consequences. One leads to economic prosperity; the other \nleads to national stagnation. I want my constituents to know that on \nthese debates to come, I stand with the taxpayers. We need to be \nencouraging industry. We need to be growing our economy. We need to be \nlowering and simplifying our tax burden.\n  Today's Democratic majority promised real change. Instead, we are \ngetting the same tired song. They are not taking our Nation's fiscal \nwoes seriously. They are hoping Americans will not object when their \ntaxes are hiked to pay for our coming entitlement train wreck.\n  They should think twice before going down this road. Middle-class \nAmericans, such as my constituents in Utah, are trying to get their \ntaxes done by midnight tonight. They want their tax burden lowered, and \nso do I. There are lots of promises made by our friends on the other \nside to get rid of the AMT. They have had at least three chances to \nvote to get rid of the AMT for the vast majority in the middle class \nand they have refused do so.\n  If left unchecked, the AMT is going to, within the next 10 years, be \nassessed on over 35 million Americans. Remember, it started out because \nthere were about 159 people who did not pay their taxes, people who \nwere immensely rich. Now we are talking up to 25 million Americans as \nwe stand here today, and up to 35 million Americans within the next ten \nyears. I am calling on my colleagues on the other side to live up to \ntheir campaign promises and let us get rid of AMT. It is very unfair to \nthe middle class, and frankly, for most Americans.\n  I promise to do all I can to see we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 372, the \nfiscal year 2007 Intelligence authorization bill, in its current form. \nI believe, without amendment, this legislation will\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\ndeteriorate the existing working relationship and trust the \nintelligence community has with Congress.\n  I voted against this legislation in both the Intelligence Committee \nand the Armed Services Committee because I believed significant \nalterations needed to be made before I could offer my support. As a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, I am fully cognizant of the \nimportance of passing an authorization bill to guide our intelligence \ncommunity as well as to advise the Senate appropriations process. \nPassing an authorization bill reasserts much needed Congressional \noversight of the intelligence community, and it ensures that the Senate \nis relevant on national security issues that are critically important.\n  At this time, I question whether the Senate is serious about the need \nto examine all possible improvements to the bill or is willing to \ndevote the time necessary to discuss and debate all amendments. Given \nthe natural and conflicting interests involved, it is prudent that \nCongress act carefully and work with the executive branch to ensure \nthat its needs are met, rather than hastily making demands through \nlegislation that many provisions of this bill attempt to do. This will \nonly create further friction between the two branches. I believe there \nare other ways to ensure effective oversight.\n\n  Some sections of this bill, particularly sections 304 and 107, are \nproblematic to me, and I believe they will not further meaningful \nCongressional oversight. Therefore, I have offered amendments to strike \nthese sections and urge my colleagues to support my amendments.\n  Let me detail my concerns with these two sections. First, section 304 \nrequires the intelligence community to notify all of the members of the \nSenate and House Intelligence Committees whenever the House and Senate \nleadership and committee leaders are briefed on highly sensitive \nintelligence or covert actions. It requires that the notification \ninclude a statement of the reasons why only the leadership was \ninformed, as well as a description of the main features of the matter.\n  There is a history of compromise and cooperation between the \nexecutive and legislative branches regarding the sharing of sensitive \nintelligence with Congress. The President has the duty to protect \nintelligence sources and methods. One such way is to limit the number \nof people who are privy to the information. Congress recognized this \nduty in the National Security Act, which states that information be \nshared:\n\n       with due regard for the protection from unauthorized \n     disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive \n     intelligence sources or methods or other exceptionally \n     sensitive matters.\n\n  The reporting requirement in section 304 may disclose the very \nsensitive information the President has determined only the leadership \nhas a need to know. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I \nrecognize there are some highly sensitive matters I do not have a need \nto know, and I support having limited notification when absolutely \nnecessary to protect the information.\n  Frequently the Congressional leadership will be informed of tightly \ncontrolled classified operations in which limiting knowledge of them is \nappropriate. Many of us do not have a need to know about various \nsensitive operations which, if leaked, could result in lives being lost \nas well as the termination of Congressional access to information.\n  Additionally, I have confidence in the chairman and vice chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee. I count on the leaders of the committee to \nbe responsible for determining when additional access to information is \nwarranted and for requesting that additional members be briefed as \nnecessary. Section 304 seeks to abandon these practices which have been \nrefined over three decades of aggressive Congressional oversight.\n  Next, section 107 requires the public disclosure of the National \nIntelligence Program budget requests and Congressional authorizations \nand appropriations for the intelligence community. Disclosing these \nfigures to the public also discloses them to our enemies who will be \nwatching for fluctuations in these figures, which may damage \nintelligence sources and methods over time.\n  Additionally, declassifying the overall budget for the intelligence \ncommunity may lead others to demand that each agency declassify their \nbudget. No doubt this would have grave effects on the capabilities of \nour intelligence agencies. For those reasons I oppose S. 372 in its \ncurrent form and the managers' amendment to it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendments to strengthen this bill.\n\n\n                              Fair Tax Act\n\n  Mr. President, today is the deadline for all taxes to be filed. As \nmany millions of Americans rush to file their taxes, I rise to bring \nattention to our horribly broken, overly complex, and unfair American \ntax system. I have and will continue to support significant reform of \nthe Tax Code in this country, as I have consistently done during my \nservice in Congress.\n  Accordingly, I have recently introduced the Fair Tax Act of 2007 on \nbehalf of myself, my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, Senator \nCoburn, and Senator Cornyn, because we are in desperate need of tax \nreform.\n  Imagine the economic freedom and purchasing power provided by a tax \nsystem that would allow us to retain 100 percent of our earnings while \nmaintaining the benefits of Government-sponsored programs, and allowing \nthem to flourish. Such would be the case under the system proposed in \nthe Fair Tax Act.\n  The Fair Tax Act would create a national sales tax as the primary \nsource of Federal revenue, would eliminate our current archaic and \ninefficient Tax Code, and would replace it with a simpler, fairer means \nof collecting revenue. Specifically, the Fair Tax Act would repeal the \nindividual income tax, the corporate income tax, capital gains tax, all \npayroll taxes, self-employment tax, and the estate and gift taxes in \nlieu of a 23-percent tax on the final sale of all goods and services.\n  Elimination of these inefficient taxing mechanisms would bring about \nequality and simplicity to our overly complex tax system. Moreover, the \nFair Tax Act would abrogate any double taxation that occurs under our \ncurrent tax system because it would provide tax relief for business-to-\nbusiness transactions. These transactions, including used-product \ntransactions that have already been taxed, are not subject to the sales \ntax.\n  More importantly, under the Fair Tax Act, the Federal Government's \nrevenue would go unchanged. Social Security and Medicare benefits would \nremain untouched under the Fair Tax bill, and there would be no \nfinancial reductions to either one of these vital programs. Instead, \nthe source of the trust fund revenue for these two programs would be \nreplaced simply by consumption tax revenue instead of payroll tax \nrevenue.\n  Finally, under the Fair Tax Act, every American would receive a \nmonthly rebate check equal to spending, up to the Federal poverty level \naccording to the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. \nThis rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of \nnecessities. This is a critical component.\n\n\n                         Invest in America Act\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today as an original cosponsor of the \nInvest in America Act. While I firmly believe significant overhaul of \nthe Tax Code is the best way to achieve absolute fairness and \ntransparency in our tax system, until we actually get to that point, we \nsimply cannot allow the current rate reductions and other provisions of \nthe 2001-2003 tax relief packages to expire, which is what the \nDemocrats have proposed in their budget for the 2008 fiscal year. This \nwould be a drastic blow to the economy and a misguided step in the \nwrong direction. The Invest in America Act would make the individual \ntax rates permanent. The lower rates have been essential to our \ncontinued economic growth over the past several years, and have \nencouraged Americans to work harder, be more productive, and retain \nmore of their hard-earned money.\n  Additionally, this bill corrects current wrongs in our tax codes, \nsuch as the death tax and the AMT. It would make the repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent, and would save more than 130,000 families each \nyear from confronting a loss of the family farms, ranches, or family-\nowned businesses. It would permanently repeal the AMT which, while \ndesigned to ensure every American pays some minimum tax, is\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nin fact now hitting more and more middle-income families, and this it \nwas not designed to do.\n  Most significant to the growth of our economy, this bill would also \nmake the current reduced capital gains and dividend rates permanent. \nSince the reduction of these investment rates in 2003, it has become \neasier for new businesses, and existing ones, to attract the capital \nthey need to start, succeed, and expand.\n  Moreover, with greater than half of all Americans owning stock, \nmiddle-class families, seniors, and other Americans are greatly \nbenefitting from these lower rates, including the 5-percent rate, which \ndrops to zero percent in 2008.\n  The proposals in this bill would also help American families by \nmaking permanent the increased child tax credit, the marriage penalty \nrelief, the adoption tax credit, the tuition deduction, and the teacher \ndeduction. These provisions, along with other proposals in the Invest \nin America Act, make permanent the R tax credit and the increased \nsmall business expensing rates, enabling both the taxpayer and the \nAmerican economy to grow.\n  Most importantly, the Invest in America Act sets forth a tax system \nthat would gave back to those who invest in the strengthening of the \nAmerican economy. We need to overhaul our tax system, impose fairness, \nand implement policies that encourage economic growth rather than \nstifle it. That is what Georgians want and deserve, and that is what \nAmericans want and deserve.\n\n\n                         Virginia Tech Tragedy\n\n  I rise today with a very heavy heart to extend my condolences to the \nfamilies who lost loved ones as a result of yesterday's tragic \nshootings on the Virginia Tech campus. One of those victims includes a \nyoung man, 22-year-old Ryan Clark of Martinez, GA, who served as a \nresident adviser at West Ambler Johnston dormitory where the first \nshooting occurred. Ryan was set to graduate this spring with a degree \nin biology and English, and he hoped to pursue a Ph.D., a pretty \namazing young man from an academic standpoint. In his spare time, he \nalso helped out the disadvantaged children in the area, as well as \ndisabled children. On this particular day, he came to the rescue of the \nfirst victim and, as a result, became a victim himself.\n  I wish to convey my extreme sorrow to his family as they try to grasp \nthe reality and gain a better understanding of what has happened. While \nhe was still in his very young years, it is clear that he had already \nimpacted so many lives and in so many different ways. While I know that \nwords may be of little comfort at this time, the Clark family and all \nof the families involved and the Virginia Tech community will remain in \nmy prayers as we try to find peace in the coming days.\n  It is difficult to fathom how something like this could happen. Words \ncan't fully describe the grief we all feel as the weight of this \ntragedy settles over our Nation. My prayer is that through faith and \nresolve, our country will emerge from this disaster in unity and \nstrength as together we find healing. While I know that we are still \nlearning the facts surrounding these despicable acts, it is my hope \nthat we can all work together and renew our commitment to ensure that \nour communities and schools are safe from similar future events.\n  I join my colleagues in the Senate who have spoken so eloquently on \nthis matter and our entire Nation in mourning the 32 lives lost \nyesterday, and I pray for the strength of our country during this time \nof grief and sorrow.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, news of yesterday's tragic killings at \nVirginia Tech reached me piecemeal as I was traveling back to \nWashington.\n  We are still far from final answers and explanations. Even today, \nfacts are still being confirmed, evidence is still being collected, and \nthe impact of the tragedy is still reverberating.\n  Last night, the Senate formally reacted to these terrible events \nthrough a resolution of sympathy.\n  I rise today to personally express my sorrow and condolences to the \nfamily and friends of the victims, to the survivors, and to the \nVirginia Tech community at large. The magnitude of this tragedy is \nunimaginable. You are in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope you know \nthat the hearts of millions of Americans go out to you in your time of \ngrief.\n  As we come to understand more about the events that unfolded so \ntragically yesterday, there will be plenty of time for us to argue \nabout policy and politics and how to distribute blame. Today we should \nbe mourning the loss of these lives, and doing what we can to help the \nwounded and comfort the bereaved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't need to remind my colleagues that \nour country is at war. We face tremendous challenges in keeping America \nsafe. On the other side of the aisle, in the last couple of days we \nhave heard some talk about the Intelligence authorization bill which \nthe Republican majority failed to pass in 2 separate years, the first \ntime in 27 years this bill has not been passed, but it wasn't passed \nthe last 2 years.\n  This year I thought it would be good if we passed an Intelligence \nauthorization bill. We have 16 agencies that deal with the espionage, \nthe security, the intelligence of our Nation. A bipartisan bill came \nout of the Intelligence Committee, the committee agreeing that \nsomething should be done. But it gets over here and word comes from the \nWhite House: Don't let that bill go. Like lemmings off a cliff, the \nRepublicans do not allow this bill to go forward. The excuses, a fourth \ngrade student could see through, maybe a second grade student.\n  They say: Democrats wouldn't allow us to offer amendments. That is \nabsolutely false, untrue. From the very beginning, when they refused to \nlet us proceed to the bill initially and we had to file cloture, \ncloture was invoked because it gave them 30 hours to stall doing \nnothing. I said that during that 30-hour period amendments could be \noffered. Not a single amendment was proffered.\n  So then we come to cloture on the bill itself. Even the vice chairman \nof the committee did not vote to go forward with this legislation. \nAgain, I said: OK, cloture wasn't invoked. Let's go ahead and offer \nsome amendments. They did. Guess what the first amendment was to show \nhow serious they are about the intelligence operations of this country. \nAn amendment was offered by a Republican 34 pages long dealing with \nimmigration which shows how they want to solve the immigration problems \nof this country and the intelligence problems. This is no place for \nimmigration. We are going to debate immigration the last 2 weeks of \nthis work period.\n  It is beyond my ability to comprehend how Senators on this side of \nthe aisle, looking over there, could vote this way, people whom I have \nalways believed to be patriots. Why would they not vote on this? I will \ntell you why they didn't. Vice President Cheney wants to be the czar of \nintelligence of this country, as he has been for 6 years. He can rest \nwell tonight because he is going to be able to continue, without this \nbill setting certain standards for interrogation with our intelligence \nagencies and other things that on a bipartisan basis were said to be \nimportant to improve the intelligence apparatus of our country.\n  The amendments offered this afternoon were not in good faith. A 34-\npage immigration amendment on an Intelligence authorization bill? They \nwere nothing more than an effort to make the White House happy. It is \nno secret. Senators have told Senators on this side that is why they \nvoted against cloture: they were told to do so by the White House.\n  Maybe my friends on the other side of the aisle think it is not \nimportant, that they can pull this one off and get away with it. We \nhave a war on terror going on, and we have intelligence agencies--16 in \nnumber--that are working every day trying to keep ahead of the bad \nguys. The bipartisan bill that has been before the Senate for the last \nseveral days was drafted based upon what the intelligence agencies \nthought they needed to improve their ability to collect information. I \ndon't think it is going to work. The credibility of the Vice President \nis not very high in this country. For reasons like this, it is apparent \nwhy that is.\n  The White House talks about the war on terror; let's work together to \ndo\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nsomething about it. Step back a minute. Is it political posturing to \nthink that the intelligence agencies of this country that should have \nlegislation that should be passed every year not be passed for 3 years?\n  I am very disappointed. I say this not in a mean or argumentative \nway. I am terribly disappointed. If the Presiding Officer, other \nSenators on this floor, if I ever as the leader came to one of you and \nsaid: We are not going to let the intelligence bill go forward this \nyear, I think my caucus would tell me what to do with my suggestion. \nBut apparently the White House has more sway than the American people \nto this group across the aisle. That is really too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Americans as much as any people on Earth \nhave a sense of fair play. That is why I believe 3 or 4 years ago, when \nthe Medicare law was passed literally in the middle of the night in the \nHouse of Representatives, where the Presiding Officer and I served at \nthat time, by one vote--the rollcall vote was kept open for 3 hours, \narms were twisted, calls from the President and pleas and all kinds of \nbegging on the House floor, and who knows what else--that is why people \nwere angry with the way the Medicare law passed. They were also angry \nespecially because of the sense of betrayal they felt with the Medicare \nlaw that clearly was written by the drug companies and for the drug \ncompanies and by the insurance companies and for the insurance \ncompanies.\n  In fact, that Medicare law meant as much as $200 billion in extra \nprofits for the drug industry and meant as much as $70 or $80 billion \nin directed subsidies for insurance companies to entice--the word our \nfriends used--entice those insurance companies to write standalone \nMedicare prescription drug coverage.\n  Americans know the score. Americans understand much about this whole \nMedicare law. We all understand the major employee groups typically in \nour system negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs. Americans \nalso understand that the VA negotiates bulk discounts on prescription \ndrugs. The VA, which ensures millions of our Nation's veterans, will go \nto the drug industry, company by company, and negotiate on a drug \nformulary, negotiate a price that gives the Government paying for these \nprescription drugs for our Nation's veterans a discount of about 50 \npercent on average, the same kind of thing that large insurance \ncompanies will do. But under this Medicare law--again, written by the \ndrug companies, written by the insurance companies, pushed through \nbecause of the lobbying force and the advertisements and all that the \ndrug industry did and the insurance industry did--Medicare is \nprohibited under law from negotiating bulk discounts on prescription \ndrugs. That is a prohibition only the drug industry and their friends \nin Congress--and they number many--could love.\n  When Medicare has to pay higher prices for medicines, dollars are \ntaken from taxpayers' pockets and placed directly into the pockets of \nthe multinational drug industry. For many years, I have taken bus trips \nwith senior citizens to Canada, when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, from my northern Ohio congressional district. We drove \nup through Detroit to Windsor to allow senior citizens to buy \nprescription drugs at a discount of 50, 60, 70 percent because the \nCanadians have a system where they negotiate drug prices directly with \nthe manufacturer. It is the same drugs, the same manufacturer, the same \npackaging. The only difference between the medicine sold here and the \nmedicine sold in Canada is the price.\n  That is the same in country after country after country. We pay two \nand three and four times more for prescription drugs than people in any \nother country given the same drug, the same dosage, the same \nmanufacturer. It is a great deal for the drug industry and a bum deal \nfor consumers, especially for senior citizens and for taxpayers in our \ncountry.\n  Medicare is the single largest prescription drug consumer in the \ncountry, and jacked-up prices jeopardize Medicare's future.\n  The legislation we will consider tomorrow ends the prohibition on \nprice negotiations. It takes the handcuffs off Medicare and enables \nMedicare to negotiate price discounts--the kind of discounts Medicare \nshould receive, given the huge volume of medicines it purchases.\n  Medicare is a system with more than 40 million Americans in that \nsystem. That kind of bulk discount buying will save billions--tens of \nbillions--of dollars for American taxpayers and for senior citizens.\n  The drug industry, however, has taken to the airwaves, as it always \ndoes, and gone to Nation's newspapers to fight this legislation. In the \nWashington Post today is an example of an outrageous kind of ad the \ndrug industry has written: ``89% of Voters Oppose Government \nNegotiation of Medicare Drug Prices.'' That is what it says: ``89 \npercent of Voters Oppose Government Negotiation of Medicare Drug \nPrices.'' That does not even pass the straight-face test. I hardly know \nanyone in Ohio--a Democrat, a Republican, an independent--I hardly know \nanyone who does not think the Government should use the bulk discount \nprocess of negotiating directly with the drug industry on behalf of 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. Yet, they claim, in bold print, in a \nfull-page ad that costs tens of thousands of dollars--not much for the \ndrug industry, to be sure--that ``89% of Voters Oppose Government \nNegotiation of Medicare Drug Prices.''\n  If you read the small print, it says:\n\n       Majorities of Democratic, Republican and Independent voters \n     do not want the government negotiating prescription drug \n     prices under Medicare. In fact, 89 percent oppose government \n     negotiation if it could limit access to new prescription \n     medications.\n\n  Well, no kidding, if it limits access, then they say they do not like \nit. But, of course, they do not. And, of course, because of high drug \ncompany prices, we are seeing limited access to prescription drugs.\n  How many times, I say to the Presiding Officer, in New Jersey or in \nOhio or in Nevada or in Iowa do we hear stories from our constituents \nwho have decided, because they cannot quite afford the drugs, they are \ngoing to cut a pill in half so their prescription will last twice as \nlong, or they are only going to take a tablet every other day, even \nthough they are prescribed to take it every day, so their prescription \nlasts longer? How often do we have to hear that?\n  That is the issue of access, that too many seniors, too many middle-\nclass Americans, too many low-income Americans simply cannot afford to \npay for their prescription drugs because the price is so high because \nof the drug companies, with their billions of dollars in advertising, \nwith their hundreds of millions of dollars they spend on 600 lobbyists \nin this institution. There are, at last count, over 600 people paid by \nthe drug industry to lobby this Congress. There are only 535 of us here \nin Congress; 100 in the Senate, 435 in the House. They have more than \n600 lobbyists to talk to us. These most recent ads are particularly \noffensive.\n  Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower priced medicines will not reduce \naccess to medicines, it will increase access. If we get lower priced \ndrugs, more people who have these prescriptions will be able to fully \nfill their prescriptions so, in fact, they will get access to drugs. \nThat is why lower prices for Medicare mean lower copayments for \nseniors, and that means increased access to medicines.\n  That is why AARP supports allowing price negotiations. That is why \nthe Alliance for Retired Americans supports allowing price \nnegotiations. That is why the Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare supports allowing price negotiations.\n  The drug industry, again, stooped pretty low with this misleading \npoll, and then with this very expensive--tens of thousands of dollars \nfor this one ad in one newspaper in the country. I wonder if there is \nany line the drug industry would not cross when it comes\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nto preserving the sweetheart deal they have in this country, where they \nhave far too many politicians in the Senate and in the House, far too \nmany of our colleagues, who simply, again, over and over and over, do \nthe drug companies' bidding.\n  Every other developed country in the world, as I said earlier, gets \nbetter priced prescription drugs than we do. Every other developed \ncountry in the world gets better prices than we do. That is because \nthese countries do not put up with the grossly inflated drug prices our \nNation does. It is because their drug company lobbyists or their drug \ncompany media campaigns simply may not be as effective in France and \nCanada and Germany and Israel and Japan and Mexico, and all over the \nworld, where drug prices are a half or a third or a fourth of what they \nare here.\n  We will put up with most anything, it seems, if an industry has deep \nenough pockets and an army of lobbyists. Prohibiting the Government \nfrom negotiating volume discounts on prescription drugs simply makes no \nsense. The Government negotiates the price of everything else it buys.\n  When the Architect of the Capitol buys carpeting for the Senate \nfloor--as we look around at this very nice blue carpet here--they do \nnot take the manufacturer's word that a fair price would impair fiber \nresearch. We do not say whatever the carpet makers want, we will pay \nbecause it costs a lot to do this research to make these rugs beautiful \nand make this carpet last, when so many feet walk over it.\n  When the Park Service buys ranger uniforms, it does not take the \nfirst bid that comes in. It gets good quality at the lowest price \npossible.\n  But with drugs, the President and his allies here in Congress--and we \nknow how much money the drug industry gave to President Bush; and we \nknow the kinds of effective lobbying the drug industry employs in the \nSenate--the President and his allies here in Congress say the \nGovernment must pay any price the drug industry wants to charge.\n  That policy is more than a mistake; it is a joke on the American \npeople. It is a betrayal of our constituents. The drug companies are \nlaughing all the way to the bank.\n  We need to pass this legislation tomorrow and let Medicare bargain \nfor the prices that Medicare beneficiaries deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4588-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FELIX WILLIAM RIVERA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a great \nNevada educator and coach, Felix William Rivera. Felix, a physical and \nhealth education teacher in the Clark County School District in Las \nVegas, NV, was involved in a fatal car accident on February 8, 2007.\n  Felix proudly lived in the Las Vegas metropolitan area all of his \nlife. He graduated from Basic High School in 1991 and the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas in 1996 with degrees in secondary education and \nsports medicine and certification in athletic training. As a student \nteacher, Felix was selected as a Distinguished Student Teacher of the \nYear Award. He began his teaching career at Swainston Middle School in \n1997, and thereafter served as a Physical Education Coach and Athletic \nTrainer at Western High School and Health Teacher and Athletic Trainer \nat Desert Pines High School.\n  Felix went above and beyond his job responsibilities in order to \nprovide students with the opportunity to learn and succeed. He spent \ncountless hours treating students who had limited access to health \ncare. Oftentimes, he would arrive early to school in order to provide \ntreatments, limited therapy, or counseling to students who simply \nneeded a listening ear. Felix had outstanding listening skills and \nfrequently utilized his networking base to connect students with the \nproper resources. As one of his former students noted, ``Not only did \nMr. Rivera teach health, he also taught us about life and steps we \nneeded to take in order to become successful.'' A fellow teacher at \nDesert Pines High School described him as a ``role model for students \nwho took great pride in every lesson that he taught.'' A teacher and \nfriend further commented on his congenial personality, ``He was the \nkind of person who had an innate ability to get right to the point, an \near-to-ear smile that was contagious and a well-known sense of humor.''\n  It is clear that Felix was a dedicated educator, a role model, and a \nmentor who left a lasting impression on his students. On April 18, \n2007, family, friends, students, and colleagues will honor his legacy \nby dedicating a mural with the words ``hard as steel with a heart of \ngold'' in the training room at Desert Pines High School, where he spent \nmuch of his time counseling students. I join in honoring Felix and \nextend my deepest sympathies to his family and friends, especially his \nwife and high school sweetheart, Alice ``Cookie'' Masterson and \nchildren, Anthony and Felicia. He is deeply missed and his service and \ndedication to the students of Clark County will always be greatly \nappreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4588-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT CENTER AND SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, when I began my chairmanship of the \nVeterans' Affairs committee this January, I assured my colleagues that \nwe would renew our focus on the need for cooperation and collaboration \nbetween the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. As we look at the way these two entities work together, it is \nimportant that we highlight the good work and progress being made. One \nexample of progress and excellence in collaboration can be found at the \nArmy Medical Department Center and School, located at Fort Sam Houston, \nwhich trains Army, Air Force, and VA nurses.\n  This year, U.S. News and World Report ranked the Army Medical \nDepartment Center and School second in the Nation for their anesthesia \nnursing program. They missed first place by just a tenth of one point, \nand have improved their score from 3.8 out of 5.0 in 2003, to 4.0 out \nof 5.0 in 2007. This notable achievement brings added credibility to \ntheir already prestigious program.\n  Since 2004, VA and DOD have partnered to train VA nurse anaesthetists \nto work in the VA health care system, the largest health care system in \nthe country. The first class of VA nurse anesthetists recently \ngraduated from the Army Medical Department Center and School. Their \ngraduation represents what I hope will be a steady flow of highly \nqualified VA nurse anesthetists using their skills and knowledge to \ngive veterans the high-quality health care they have earned through \nservice.\n  I realize that, with the private sector offering six-figure salaries \nfor nurse anesthetists, those who chose to work within the military and \nVA do so not for personal gain. They stay to respond to the higher \ncalling of caring for servicemembers and veterans in their times of \nneed, and are to be commended for their dedication and their work. In \nthat spirit, I say `e ho'omaika'i ia'oukou, or congratulations, to the \ngraduates, students, faculty, staff, and others who have worked to make \nthe Army Medical Department Center and School the success that it is \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4588-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4588-S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF CANUTE DALMASSE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I honor Canute Dalmasse of Stowe, VT, \nwho is retiring after 36 years of dedicated service to the State of \nVermont, working to conserve, protect, and enhance our State's natural \nresources. His extraordinary contribution to the stewardship of \nVermont's natural environment calls for special recognition.\n  Canute retires as the deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency of \nNatural Resources, overseeing fish, wildlife, forests, parks, \nrecreation, and environmental conservation programs and recently served \nwith distinction as acting secretary. His career began in 1971 as one \nof the first district coordinators implementing Vermont's landmark Act \n250 environmental law that uses a holistic approach looking at \nenvironmental, visual, and social criteria to assess potential \ndevelopment impacts. A proven leader and innovator, he has served as \ndirector of the Office of Water Resources and commissioner of the \nDepartment of Environmental Conservation.\n  Canute is an avid boater and angler on Lake Champlain and an \nunflinching\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\nadvocate for Vermont's waters. He serves on the Lake Champlain Basin \nProgram Steering Committee and as chair of its executive committee, \nbringing the States of Vermont and New York and the Province of Quebec \ntogether to work for a clean, healthy lake. He also serves on the Lake \nMemphremagog Steering Committee, working with the Province of Quebec to \nprotect and enhance that international water.\n  Canute received his bachelors degree from Columbia University in New \nYork City and served in the 101st Airborne Division in the U.S. Army \nduring the Vietnam War. He and his wife Diane have two sons, Layton and \nCanute. He is a longtime resident of Stowe, VT, and is a past president \nof Stowe Youth Hockey and chair of the Stowe Recreation Commission.\n  Canute Dalmasse is a tribute to his State, his community, and to \nprotecting Vermont's natural environment. The great State of Vermont, \nwith its celebrated natural beauty and well-deserved reputation for \nexemplary environmental stewardship, honors Canute's dedication, \ndevotion, and hard work that helped set the course for Vermont's \nenvironmental future. It is an honor and a privilege to recognize \nCanute today in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4589-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to speak to legislation to fight a \ndiscrepancy in access to care that prevents hundreds of our Nation's \nheroes from receiving the best possible care for traumatic brain \ninjury.\n  Traumatic brain injury has been identified as the ``signature \ninjury'' afflicting armed servicemembers returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. After sacrificing so much, we have a moral obligation to \nensure that these men and women receive the best care available to \nthem. Unfortunately, administrative and medical capacity problems have \nprevented many of our heroes from receiving the care they desperately \nneed and deserve. There is an immediate solution to address this.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has made clear progress in \nresearch and development of rehabilitation treatment for individuals \nwho have incurred traumatic brain injuries. However, VA medical \nfacilities have not yet reached the level of private rehabilitation \nfacilities, which have been developing cognitive treatment for the past \n30 years.\n  While VA medical centers offer excellent services, there are barriers \nto receiving the optimal health care options. These include a confusing \narray of benefits, overworked and undertrained case managers, and, most \nimportantly, a discrepancy between benefits for those on active duty \nversus those who are medically retired. This discrepancy in benefits \nleads to confusion among families who are forced to try to determine \nwhat is in the best interest of the servicemember, often without having \nfull knowledge of the difference in benefits offered to Active Duty and \nveterans. Currently, the TRICARE plan that is available to Active Duty \nservicemembers permits them to receive coverage for cognitive therapy \nobtained in private nonmilitary facilities. However, medical retirees \ndo not have this health care coverage option. Consequently, severely \ninjured TBI patients struggle to obtain the critical care they \ndesperately need.\n  Further, while many armed servicemembers have dedicated family \nmembers and loved ones who fight to ensure that they receive the best \ncare possible, not all servicemembers have family to speak and act on \ntheir behalf. Thus, many are left without optimal treatment and without \nan advocate.\n  The need to ensure that every TBI patient receives the best care \npossible cannot be understated. This is an immediate problem with an \nimmediate solution. We have the ability to provide a crucial, temporary \nanswer to our armed services members while the VA develops the \ncapability to facilitate care for this unique population. We can not \nstand idly by, as hundreds of our bravest Americans are prevented from \nreceiving the care they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4589-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING PASTOR RHIO CLEIGH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I take a few minutes to honor a \ngreat man of faith. Pastor Rhio Cleigh dedicated the past 25 years to \nserving his community through the church. The last 15 of those years \nhave been at my home church--Prairie Lakes Church in Cedar Falls, IA.\n  The work of a pastor is not always easy but, much like my work, it is \nvery rewarding. As a minister in our church, Rhio was responsible for \ncounseling individuals through difficult times, visiting the sick in \nthe hospital, and ministering to the senior citizens of our \ncongregation.\n  This Sunday our membership will honor Pastor Cleigh as he retires \nfrom the ministry. Rhio plans to spend his retirement enjoying time \nwith his wife Patti, his 6 children, 10 grandchildren, and 1 great-\ngrandchild. He also hopes to have a little more time for some of his \nhobbies--things like woodworking, camping, fishing, and gardening.\n  Barbara joins me in sincere appreciation to Rhio for his \ncontributions to our church and community. Together we wish him a long \nand happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4589-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a sense-of-the-\nCongress amendment my good friend and colleague Senator Inhofe has just \nsubmitted regarding Presidential authority over setting American \nforeign policy. Like all of my colleagues, I have the right to visit \nforeign countries in my capacity as a Member of Congress. However, the \nConstitution is quite clear about the separation of powers between the \nlegislative and executive branches of our government, and the executive \nbranch has the exclusive authority to conduct negotiations with foreign \ncountries.\n  As we all know, the Logan Act prohibits American citizens from \nnegotiating with foreign governments without the authority of the \nUnited States. What would it mean if a Member of the House or Senate, \nand especially a member of the leadership, was to visit a foreign \ncountry and in discussions with their government, explicitly speak out \nagainst our Nation's foreign policy agenda? High ranking Members of \nCongress, I believe, are seen by foreign governments as carrying an \nofficial message of foreign policy, and if such members contradict the \nadministration, it can be very damaging to our country politically and \ndiplomatically.\n  Members of Congress have the ability to express their dissent from \nthe floor of their respective Chambers, but under no circumstances \nshould Members visit with foreign governments for the sole purpose of \ndemonstrating their opposition to the administration's foreign policy. \nSuch actions would show a sincere lack of respect for the boundaries \ndrawn out by our Constitution, and I would hope that all Members of \nCongress will use good judgment when visiting with foreign governments \nin the future.\n  It is a very dangerous precedent to set if Members of Congress decide \nto buck the American foreign policy agenda and carry mixed messages to \nforeign governments, especially foreign governments hostile to our \ncountry. While I will continue to support congressional rights to \ntravel abroad and meet with government officials, there is a \nresponsibility that comes along with those visits, and that \nresponsibility is to uphold and support the administration's foreign \npolicy agenda.\n  For this reason I have joined my colleague Senator Inhofe in \nsubmitting this amendment. I believe it sends a clear and strong \nmessage that Members of Congress have the responsibility to defer to \nand support the administration on setting our Nation's foreign policy \nagenda, and under no circumstances should Members blatantly defy our \nadministration for purely political gain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4589-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4589-S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REAL ID ACT\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today my home State of Montana becomes the \nfourth State in the Nation to declare its opposition to the REAL ID Act \nby enacting binding legislation that opts Montana out of REAL ID. With \nit, my State is opting out of the onerous regulation, blatant invasion \nof privacy, and the high cost of compliance that will come from \nimplementing REAL ID.\n  I congratulate my Governor, Brian Schweitzer, and both houses of the\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nMontana State Legislature. Both houses of the legislature approved this \nlegislation unanimously. Thirteen other States have anti-REAL ID \nlegislation that has passed one of the houses of the legislature. In \nMontana and the rest of these States, opposition to this poorly \nconstructed law is bipartisan.\n  That is why I am pleased to once again offer my support for the \nIdentification Security Enhancement Act, introduced by Senator Akaka \nand Senator Sununu--another bipartisan show of opposition to the REAL \nID Act.\n  Why is there so much opposition to REAL ID beyond the beltway? It \ncomes down to three reasons. First, the REAL ID Act puts massive new \nFederal regulations on the States. From new databases and fraud \nmonitoring, to new network and data storage capacity, the States will \nbe tasked with an enormous range of new regulations and requirements. \nOnce REAL ID becomes effective, every State's Department of Motor \nVehicles will have to play immigration official by reconciling \ndiscrepancies in social security numbers with the Social Security \nAdministration. DMVs will have to require proof of ``legal presence'' \nin the United States from immigrants.\n  I am for a strong immigration policy. I believe we ought to enforce \nour borders and enforce the laws we have on the books. But it is \ncompletely unreasonable for the Federal Government to put that job on \nthe Montana Department of Motor Vehicles, or any other State's DMV.\n  And these new regulations carry with them a hefty pricetag. DHS now \nestimates that Real ID will cost the states and their taxpayers $23.1 \nbillion.\n  Finally, REAL ID raises some very real privacy concerns. Data mining \nand data theft have become all too common phrases for too many \nAmericans who resent having their personal information collected by the \ngovernment, or worse, having it stolen from the government. We all \nrecall the massive potential problems that arose from the theft of \npersonal data from the VA last year. I have no doubt that the databases \ncalled for in REAL ID will be an even greater target for data thieves.\n  We can do better than REAL ID. Senator Akaka's legislation shows \nthat. Today, Montana adds its voice to those calling for the Federal \nGovernment to go back to the drawing board. Let's listen to what \nMontana has to say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4590-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAYOLA SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on an \nimportant settlement that has been recently announced by the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC.\n  Four major radio station groups, Clear Channel, Entercom, Citadel, \nand CBS Radio, have taken an important first step in cleaning up the \nradio industry through today's consent decree with the FCC and side \nagreement with the independent music community on airplay and rules of \nengagement. I want to especially commend Commissioner Adelstein for his \ntireless work to bring these groups together and then-Attorney General \nSpitzer for spearheading the initial investigation that has led to \nState and now Federal settlements.\n  I was encouraged to see internal business reforms, increased \nrecordkeeping for transactions between labels and radio stations and \nunfettered access to these records by the FCC as part of the consent \ndecrees. While these provisions are not as broad as those included in \nmy previous payola legislation, the increased recordkeeping and \ndisclosure in the consent decrees represent a step in the right \ndirection. Transparency and accountability through sustained oversight \nwill go a long way in eliminating the pervasive shadowy practices that \nhave plagued the radio industry on and off almost since its inception.\n  While the parties to the consent decrees do not directly admit \nwrongdoing, the payment of $12.5 million to the U.S. Treasury from the \nfour station groups is an implicit acknowledgement that the evidence \nuncovered by then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer showed that \nsignificant abuses had taken place. From all accounts, the stations \nalso deserve some credit for working in good faith with the FCC and the \nindependent music community to work toward a solution that did more \nthan just put this matter behind them. The internal reforms and side \nagreement negotiated with the American Association of Independent \nMusic, A2IM, appear to show a real desire to change and include the \nvoices of local, unsigned and independent musicians that have \nunfortunately been missing more often than not from our public airwaves \nover the past decade or more.\n  I am pleased by the voluntary side agreement by the radio station \ngroups to provide more airtime and fair rules of engagement. These \nrules of engagement require nondiscriminatory treatment for labels and \nmusicians seeking to be played at the stations and echo requirements \nfrom my previous payola legislation. I am heartened that these major \nradio station groups have apparently come to the realization that the \nold system wasn't working and that it was in their best interest to \nmake it easier for small labels and local musicians to be heard. With \nmore and more musicians being successful without or with limited radio \nairplay--just look at the commercial and critical success of the Dixie \nChicks' last album--I hope radio stations are realizing they must \nchange and play what their potential listeners want to hear in order to \nremain relevant. I hope this important commitment by four station \ngroups will be replicated throughout the rest of the radio industry.\n  I have a few lingering concerns that both the consent decrees and \nside agreement depend heavily on continued good faith instead of strong \nenforceable standards. I have no reason to believe that the potential \ngood from these agreements will not be fulfilled, but we can't allow \nbacksliding, especially after the 3-year term of the decrees expires. \nThis means that the FCC will need to maintain vigorous and continued \noversight. I urge the FCC to take the next step of building on this \nfirst wave of settlements and reaching agreements or taking enforcement \naction against the other stations implicated by the Spitzer \ninvestigation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4590-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4590-S4591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I just spotted the note.\n       Hilzoy notes the commentary in some quarters that:\n       Following the example set by their Senate brethren last \n     Friday, House Democrats will adopt a budget resolution \n     containing the largest tax increase in U.S. history amid \n     massive national inattention.\n       Bet you didn't know that, eh? The Dems are already pushing \n     through the largest tax increase in U.S. history! and nobody \n     is paying attention!\n       Anyway, Hilzoy digs a bit further into the story. It really \n     is worth reading.\n       Long story short . . . Republican Congresses chose not to \n     make their tax cuts (or, as PGL would note, their tax \n     deferments) permanent. They didn't have to put in a sunset \n     clause--they chose to, in an attempt to make long term \n     projections look better. Even with that obfuscation, the \n     situation no longer looks quite so rosy. But . . . if the new \n     Democratic Congress doesn't do what the Republican Congresses \n     that preceded it failed to do, namely make the tax cut \n     permanent, well, that's the equivalent of the Democrats \n     pushing the largest tax increase in history.\n       Maybe it's just me . . . but since this whole thing was \n     planned and executed by a Republican Congress under a \n     Republican President, shouldn't we be referring to this as \n     the Republican's tax increase? And my bet is that there are a \n     lot of Republicans in Congress now, and that will be seeking \n     re-election some time soon, that voted for this massive tax \n     increase.\n       Blue Bunting: Tuesday April 3, 2007, 9:07 pm\n       Fact Check\n       Robert Novak wrote this in today's Washington Post:\n       ``Following the example set by their Senate brethren last \n     Friday, House Democrats will adopt a budget resolution \n     containing the largest tax increase in U.S. history amid \n     massive national inattention.\n       Nobody's tax payment will increase immediately, but the \n     budget resolutions set a pattern for years ahead. The House \n     version\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\n     would increase non-defense, non-emergency spending by $22.5 \n     billion for next fiscal year, with such spending to rise 2.4 \n     percent in each of the next three years. To pay for these \n     increases, the resolution would raise taxes by close to $400 \n     billion over five years--about $100 more than what was passed \n     in the Senate.''\n       Heavens, I said to myself, what can Robert Novak possibly \n     be talking about? The Democrats budget (pdf, h/t The Gavel) \n     does not actually contain any tax increases:\n       And yet this claim that the Democrats' budget contains a \n     tax increase is being cited all over the place. So what's up?\n       Novak gives us a clue:\n       ``It had been assumed that the new Democratic majority \n     would end President Bush's relief in capital gains dividend \n     and estate taxation. The simultaneous rollback of Bush-\n     sponsored income tax cuts was a surprise.''\n       Ah, Rolling back the Bush tax cuts. But wouldn't that still \n     require some actual changes in revenues from the baseline \n     projections? A GOP Budget Caucus press release gives us \n     further details:\n       Note that word `automatic'. It's quite worrying. How did \n     the Democrats manage to create an automatic tax increase? \n     Don't tax increases normally have to be enacted? I hope so. \n     It would be awful if tax increases could just happen \n     automatically. Come to think of it, it would be even worse if \n     it turns out that this isn't confined to the tax code, and \n     all sorts of laws could be passed automatically. I mean, who \n     knows what the U.S. Code might decide to do to itself, \n     without the intervention of any human agent? We could wake up \n     one morning to find that ping pong had been automatically \n     criminalized, or that a requirement that all Americans wear \n     silly clown costumes had automatically come into force, or \n     that all our national parks had automatically sold themselves \n     to WalMart. The possibilities are horrifying.\n       Imagine my relief when I realized what was actually going \n     on. The Bush tax cuts are set to expire automatically. They \n     were written that way. What the Democrats are proposing to do \n     is simply not to change this.\n       Moreover, guess who wrote these sunset provisions into the \n     tax increases? The Republicans, that's who. They were trying \n     to make the tax increases seem less fiscally ruinous than \n     they were, so they made them last only so long before they \n     expired. (This is why I expect 2010 to produce a spike in \n     mortality among the very rich; the heirs of people who die \n     during 2010 pay no estate tax; the heirs of people who die in \n     2011 pay 50% on all the money they inherit above the level at \n     which the estate tax kicks in. As Paul Krugman said, ``That \n     creates some interesting incentives. Maybe they should have \n     called it the Throw Momma From the Train Act of 2001.'')\n       So here's what Novak's ``largest tax increase in U.S. \n     history'' actually comes to the Republicans passed a series \n     of tax cuts that they set up to expire. They intended to make \n     them permanent, but never got around to it. The Democrats are \n     proposing to leave their tax cuts alone. But this counts as a \n     tax increase, apparently on the grounds that whatever \n     Republicans sorta kinda thought they were going to do, but \n     never actually got around to doing, counts as already done, \n     and anyone who proposes to leave things alone counts as \n     undoing the things they were intending to do.\n       That's a fun way to think. Maybe we should also count the \n     Democrats as having dramatically increased the budget \n     deficit, on the grounds that the Republicans kinda sorta said \n     they were going to make it go away, so even though they \n     didn't, we should act as though they did and compare whatever \n     deficits the Democrats incur to the Republicans' imaginary \n     balanced budget.

Mr. President, today millions of taxpayers, many owners of \nsmall businesses, will file their income tax returns while some States \nin the Northeast, including my home State of Maine, have rightfully \nbeen given an additional 48 hours to file due to the devastating storms \nresulting in disastrous flooding, wind damage, and power outages.\n  As citizens file their taxes this week, I am very happy to say that a \nwide majority of Mainers and Americans alike will be fully compliant in \nreporting the appropriate amount of income, with the Internal Revenue \nService estimating 84 percent of taxpayers are compliant. The \nunfortunate flip side to that statistic is that 16 percent of taxpayers \neither fail to report income or underreport income and thus fail to pay \nall the taxes owed. This misreporting of income has resulted in a $345 \nbillion gross tax gap, which is the difference between taxes owed and \npaid.\n  Unquestionably, we must ensure that taxes owed are taxes paid. While \nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO, projects a deficit of around $200 \nbillion this fiscal year without any abatement through 2011, the fact \nremains that narrowing the tax gap would help reduce the deficit--plain \nand simple.\n  Not only does the tax gap prevent us from balancing the budget, \nequally disturbing is how noncompliance breeds disrespect for the tax \nsystem and can lead to the further shirking of obligations. The result \ncould be that, to fill the gap, law-abiding taxpayers would have to pay \nhigher taxes. Consider the following: According to preliminary IRS \ndata, for 2005, taxpayers filed 134.5 million individual income tax \nreturns. If we were to shrink the tax gap, each of those returns would \nhave to be assessed additional tax in the amount of $2,566. I would not \nwant to be in position to ask my constituents for more of their hard-\nearned money, especially to cover those who are not paying their fair \nshare.\n  Last year, the Treasury Department issued ``A Comprehensive Strategy \nfor Reducing the Tax Gap.'' This document astutely points out, the Tax \nCode's complexity is itself a significant source of noncompliance. The \ncurrent Tax Code costs the Government revenue since even those who try \ntheir best to follow the rules, often end up underpaying tax because \nthe rules are too complicated and difficult to decipher. Therefore, any \nsolution to the tax gap must also require simplifying the Tax Code.\n  A top priority I hear from small businesses across Maine and this \ncountry is the need for tax relief. Despite the fact that small \nbusinesses are the real job-creators for Maine's and our Nation's \neconomy, the current tax system is placing an entirely unreasonable \nburden on them when trying to satisfy their tax obligations. The \ncurrent Tax Code imposes a large, and expensive, burden on all \ntaxpayers in terms of satisfying their reporting and record-keeping \nobligations. The problem, though, is that small companies are \ndisadvantaged most in terms of the money and time spent in satisfying \ntheir tax obligation.\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each \nyear complying with Government reports. They also spend more than 80 \npercent of this time on completing tax forms. What's even more \ntroubling is that companies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend \nnearly $1,304 per employee in tax compliance costs, an amount that is \nnearly 67 percent more than larger firms. A recent survey by the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses found that 88 percent of \nsmall-employer taxpayers used a tax professional and the two reasons \nsmall-employer taxpayers most frequently cite for using tax \nprofessionals are to assure compliance and the complexity of the law.\n  For that reason, I have introduced a package of proposals that will \nprovide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, but also simpler rules under the Tax Code. By simplifying the \nTax Code, small business owners will be able to satisfy their tax \nobligation in a cheaper, more efficient manner, allowing them to be \nable to devote more time and resources to their business.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 269, in response to the repeated \nrequests from small businesses in Maine and from across the Nation to \nallow them to expense more of their investments, like the purchase of \nessential new equipment. My bill modifies the Internal Revenue Code by \ndoubling the amount a small business can expense\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\nfrom $100,000 to $200,000, and make the provision permanent, as \nPresident Bush proposed this change in his fiscal year 2007 tax \nproposals. With small businesses representing 99 percent of all \nemployers, creating 75 percent of net new jobs and contributing 51 \npercent of private-sector output, their size is the only ``small'' \naspect about them.\n\n  By doubling and making permanent the current expensing limit and \nindexing these amounts for inflation, this bill will achieve two \nimportant objectives. First, qualifying businesses will be able to \nwrite off more of the equipment purchases today, instead of waiting 5, \n7 or more years to recover their costs through depreciation. That \nrepresents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time small \nbusinesses would otherwise have to spend complying with complex and \nconfusing depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will contribute \nto continued productivity growth in the business community, which \neconomic experts have repeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term \nvitality of our economy.\n  Second, as a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for \nthis benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased to $800,000 \nin new assets purchases. At the same time, small business capital \ninvestment will be pumping more money into the economy. This is a win-\nwin for small business and the economy as a whole and I am pleased to \nhave Senators Lott, Isakson, Chambliss and Collins join me as \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  Another proposal that I have introduced with Senators Lincoln and \nLott, the Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2007, S. 270, will \npermit start-up small business owners to use a taxable year other than \nthe calendar year if they generally earn fewer than $5 million during \nthe tax year.\n  Specifically, the Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2007 will \npermit more taxpayers to use the taxable year most suitable to their \nbusiness cycle. Until 1986, businesses could elect the taxable year-end \nthat made the most economic sense for the business. In 1986, Congress \npassed legislation requiring partnerships and S corporations, many of \nwhich are small businesses, to adopt a December 31 year-end. The Tax \nCode does provide alternatives to the calendar year for small \nbusinesses, but the compliance costs and administrative burdens \nassociated with these alternatives prove to be too high for most small \nbusinesses to utilize.\n  Meanwhile, C corporations, as large corporations often are, receive \nmuch more flexibility in their choice of taxable year. A C corporation \ncan adopt either a calendar year or any fiscal year for tax purposes, \nas long as it keeps its books on that basis. This creates the unfair \nresult of allowing larger businesses with greater resources greater \nflexibility in choosing a taxable year than smaller firms with fewer \nresources. This simply does not make sense to me. My bill changes these \nexisting rules so that more small businesses will be able to use the \ntaxable year that best suits their business.\n  To provide relief and equity to our Nation's 1.5 million retail \nestablishments, most of which have less than five employees, I have \nintroduced a bill, S. 271, with Senators Lincoln, Hutchison, and Kerry \nthat reduces from 39 to 15 years the depreciable life of improvements \nthat are made to retail stores that are owned by the retailer. Under \ncurrent law, only retailers that lease their property are allowed this \naccelerated depreciation, which means it excludes retailers that also \nown the property in which they operate. My bill simply seeks to provide \nequal treatment to all retailers.\n  Specifically, this bill will simply conform the Tax Codes to the \nrealities that retailers on Main Street face. Studies conducted by the \nTreasury Department, Congressional Research Service and private \neconomists have all found that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuildings is too long and that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuilding improvements is even worse. Retailers generally remodel their \nstores every 5 to 7 years to reflect changes in customer base and \ncompete with newer stores. Moreover, many improvements such as interior \npartitions, ceiling tiles, restroom accessories, and paint, may only \nlast a few years before requiring replacement.\n  Finally, I joined Senator Bond in introducing S. 296 that will \nsimplify the Tax Code by permitting small business owners to use the \ncash method of accounting for reporting their income if they generally \nearn fewer than $10 million during the tax year. Currently, only those \ntaxpayers that earn less than $5 million per year are able to use the \ncash method. By increasing this threshold to $10 million, more small \nbusinesses will be relieved of the burdensome recordkeeping \nrequirements that they currently must undertake in reporting their \nincome under a different accounting method.\n  This package of proposals are a tremendous opportunity to help small \nenterprises succeed by providing an incentive for reinvestment and \nleaving them more of their earnings to do just that. Notably, providing \ntax relief by passing these simplification measures will also help us \nreduce the tax gap by increasing compliance. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting these proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4592-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4592-S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          INVENT IOWA PROGRAM\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on April 21, some 360 young Iowa \ninventors will gather at Hilton Coliseum on the campus of Iowa State \nUniversity for the Invent Iowa 2007 State Invention Convention. This \ngathering will mark the 20th year for Invent Iowa.\n  Over the last two decades, thousands of Iowa students have \nparticipated in this important statewide event. The annual Invention \nConvention has showcased the skill, imagination and creativity of some \nof our best and brightest--and most creative--youngsters.\n  From the Motorized Guinea Pig Walker invented by Nicholas Schrunk of \nSpirit Lake to the Oops! Proof No-spill Feeding Bowl invented by Alexis \nAbernathy of Cedar Rapids, students have created innovative solutions \nto everyday problems.\n  In Nicholas' case, he needed to figure out a way for his guinea pig, \nFreckles, to get some exercise without running around the house and \nannoying his mother. Alexis got the idea for her invention by watching \na 2-year-old child spill his cereal again and again. These two \ninventions were creative solutions that earned recognition for the \nyoung inventors. In the last 20 years, there have been thousands of \nother inventions.\n  Each year, approximately 30,000 Iowa students begin the journey to \nthe State Convention by participating in local and regional \ncompetitions. The staffs from Iowa's Area Education Agencies do a \ntremendous job working with educators on curriculum ideas and setting \nup the regional events. Since the inception of the program in 1987, \nmore than half a million students have participated in Invent Iowa.\n  The seed for Invent Iowa was planted at a statewide conference I \nsponsored in conjunction with Iowa State University in 1986 on the \nfuture of Iowa communities. In his keynote address, David Morris from \nthe Institute for Local Self-Reliance focused on the need to rekindle \nthe spirit of innovation in the United States, and he also spoke of his \nexperience as a judge for the Minnesota Metropolitan Young Inventor's \nFair. Following that event, my office, led by Dianne Liepa, began \nworking with Carol McDanolds Bradley at the Iowa Department of \nEducation, statewide education groups, nonprofit organizations and \nbusinesses to form a steering committee to establish a statewide \ninvention program for students. Invent Iowa was born.\n  In 1989, the Invent Iowa Board of Directors contracted with the \nBelin-Blank Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development at the \nUniversity of Iowa to serve as the home for the organization's State \ncoordinator. Eleven years later, Invent Iowa would become a program \nunder the full direction of Belin-Blank. Under the leadership of the \ndedicated staff at Belin-Blank, Invent Iowa has grown and flourished.\n  In particular, I would like to salute the excellent work of Dr. \nNicholas Colangelo, director of the Belin-Blank Center, and Dr. Clar \nBaldus, who serves a dual role as administrator of Rural Schools \nPrograms and Inventiveness Programs at Belin-Blank as well as State \ncoordinator for Invent Iowa. They have been tireless advocates for the \nprogram and are dedicated to its success far into the future.\n  Invent Iowa is a great program, and I am very proud to recognize all \nof the\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\npeople and organizations that continue to carry on Iowa's tradition for \ninnovation and invention. Congratulations on reaching this important \nmilestone to the advisory board for Invent Iowa and to the sponsors \nincluding the Belin-Blank Center, Iowa Area Education Agencies, Iowa \nIntellectual Property Law Association, Rockwell Collins Corporation, \nMcKee, Voorhees and Sease patent attorneys Larry Engman and David \nBelin, Dean P. Barry Butler and the College of Engineering at the \nUniversity of Iowa, and Dean Mark J. Kushner and the College of \nEngineering at Iowa State University.\n  The most important partners in the success of Invent Iowa have been \nclassroom teachers across Iowa. They help guide students through all \nphases of the invention process from the documentation of need, to the \ninception of the idea, creation of the prototype, research to ensure \nthe innovativeness of the invention, and the final presentation to a \npanel of evaluators. Without these dedicated teachers working with the \nyoung inventors, there would be no Invent Iowa.\n  On the 20th anniversary, I congratulate all the Iowans who have \nworked so hard to make Invent Iowa such a success. I wish them even \ngreater success in their next 20 years. Also, good luck to the students \nwho will be participating in the 2007 Invention Convention this \nweekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4593-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF THE POTTER FAMILY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to \nthe Potter family, who are being honored with the Family Tree Alumni \nAward from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, UNL. This award was \nestablished in 1995 for families having at least three generations of \nUNL graduates and at least two family members with a record of \noutstanding service to the university, the alumni association, their \ncommunity and/or their profession.\n  This legacy finds its roots in Herb ``Cub'' Potter, Sr., who began \nattending the University of Nebraska in 1910. Herb lettered as a \nquarterback on the dominating ``Stiehm Rollers'' Nebraska football \nteams of 1911, 1912, and 1914. The latter of those teams finished with \n7 wins, 0 losses and 1 tie, which was said to be deserving of the \nmythical national title. At the university, Herb met his wife, Carrie \nComan, a fellow student and an Alpha Omicron Pi member.\n  The two sons of Herb and Carrie Potter, Herb, Jr., and younger \nbrother Brooks, became the next generation of Huskers during the early \n1940s. Herb, Jr., graduated in 1943 with a degree in business \nadministration and soon married a fellow graduate, Lois Ballantyne, \nclass of 1940. Brooks attended the University of Nebraska until he \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy at the onset of World War II. Unfortunately, \nBrooks passed away while serving his country as a member of the \n``greatest generation.''\n  Herb, Jr.'s close ties to Nebraska did not end with his graduation. \nHe embarked on a career spanning 30 years at the University of Nebraska \nFoundation as secretary/treasurer and later vice president. Upon his \nretirement in 1982, Herb's tenure spanned a period during which the \nfoundation grew from a staff of 5 employees and assets of $1 million to \na staff of 22 and assets of $80 million.\n  Herb and Lois passed on the Husker tradition to their two daughters, \nBarbara and Carol. Barbara, class of 1967, met and married Robert \nReynolds, class of 1971, at Nebraska. Robert went on to serve in the \nU.S. Department of the Interior with distinction for 33 years. In \nrecognition of his outstanding contributions to the National Park \nService, Robert was given the Meritorious Service Award in 1991, the \nsecond highest award given in the Department of the Interior. Then in \n2000, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award, which is given to \nonly 4 out of 20,000 each year.\n  Carol, class of 1973, M.S. 1975, also met her husband, Paul Lou, \nclass of 1973, M.S. 1976, at the university. Paul has spent the past 25 \nyears as an instructor teaching a broad range of computer classes at \nDiablo Valley Community College in Pleasant Hill, CA, where he is \nconsidered one of the most popular teachers.\n  From the Ballantyne family, there have been several other Nebraska \ngraduates, with the latest being Kevin Zimmerman, a lawyer who is \ncurrently serving his country in the armed services. Other graduates \nhave gone on to become doctors--Doug Peter--teachers--Sandra Peter, Pat \nKahre and Frank Daily--artists--Joyce Ballantyne and Beverly \nBallantyne--and business professionals--Byron Ballantyne and Jim Peter.\n  Finally, current marching band member Kyle Peter represents the fifth \ngeneration of the Potter family tree to attend the University of \nNebraska.\n  In addition to this legacy being deep in its years, it is also wide \nin its spread. From 1910 up to the present, there has been a member of \neither the Potter or Ballantyne families affiliated with the University \nof Nebraska during every single decade. What a rich tradition at \nNebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4593-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO COACH DOUG ROSS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nmake some remarks today about a very valuable asset to the University \nof Alabama in Huntsville and the entire State of Alabama--Ice Hockey \nHead Coach Doug Ross, who is retiring after 25 years of coaching the \nUAH Chargers hockey team.\n  Coach Ross began his coaching career at Ohio University in 1976 where \nhe coached for one season, and then at Kent State University for 2 \nyears. He came to UAH in 1982. The hockey team at that time was a top \nteam and the only NCAA hockey team south of the Mason-Dixon line. Under \nhis leadership, the team has had great success, reaching NCAA Division \nI status. Quoting Coach Joe Ritch, his predecessor at UAH. ``Doug \nbrought UAH championships, unique notoriety, and national respect in \nthe collegiate hockey world. We all owe Doug Ross a debt of gratitude \nfor his commitment to UAH and hockey for this state.''\n  The team went to the NCAA Regional Tournament this year where they \nplayed the third longest game in NCAA Regional Tournament history. In a \nthrilling game with top-ranked and top-seeded Notre Dame, the Chargers \nlost 3-2 in double overtime on a power-play goal. If winning it all \ncould not happen, this game was one on which to cap a career.\n  Coach Ross is known for recruiting top notch student athletes to UAH. \nFollowing their success on the ice, many of his players are active \nalumni, living in the Huntsville area and actively involved in the \ncommunity.\n  Thank you, Coach Ross, for bringing NCAA hockey to the forefront in \nAlabama and for your loyalty and support for the University of Alabama \nin Huntsville. Your legacy is a great one and I join with UAH, the \nHuntsville community, and the State of Alabama in wishing you the very \nbest in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4593-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 988.

A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     urging Congress to consider adoption of a resolution working \n     toward the development of a federal bipartisan, long-term \n     solution that addresses sustainable management of federal \n     forest lands to stabilize payments, which help support roads \n     and schools, to forest communities throughout the western \n     states; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 4\n\n       Whereas, it has long been the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold rural communities harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Committee on \n     Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands \n     could create hardship for many counties as they provided \n     little revenue or commerce at that time; and\n       Whereas, in 1908, the federal government promised rural \n     counties twenty-five percent of all revenues generated from \n     the multiple-use management of the newly created national \n     forests to support public roads and public schools; and\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the forest resources have not \n     been managed in a manner to produce long-term sustainable \n     revenue to share with schools and counties; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, Congress passed Public Law 106-393, the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. \n     The Act restored historical payment levels previously made to \n     states and counties from the federal government for road and \n     school purposes because of declining levels of actual forest \n     receipts; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization and appropriation of the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act is \n     pending before the United States Congress, and Idaho counties \n     are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully funded \n     approval of this Act; and\n       Whereas, federal land managers continue to be faced with \n     funding shortages. In the event the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act is not reauthorized and \n     appropriated, counties will be faced with higher property \n     taxes or a reduction in services and, even if the Act is \n     reauthorized and appropriated, it will likely be the last \n     time, and the state of Idaho must seek a long-term solution; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2006, House Joint Memorial No. 21 was adopted \n     by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-\n     eighth Idaho Legislature to provide one option to address the \n     problem of declining forest receipts by urging Congress to \n     support federal legislation transferring management of \n     National Forest System lands within Idaho to the state of \n     Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural counties and \n     schools; and\n       Whereas, in February 2007, a concurrent resolution was \n     introduced in the Idaho House of Representatives and will be \n     voted on by the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth \n     Idaho Legislature authorizing Idaho's Legislative Council to \n     appoint an interim committee to undertake and complete an \n     assessment of the decline in receipts on National Forest \n     System lands, which have historically been shared with \n     counties. The goal of the interim committee's recommendations \n     will be to develop a federal, bipartisan, long-term solution \n     that addresses sustainable management of federal forest lands \n     to stabilize payments to Idaho's forest counties, which help \n     support roads and schools, and to provide projects that \n     enhance forest ecosystem health, provide employment \n     opportunities, and improve cooperative relationships among \n     those who use and care about the lands the federal government \n     manages. The resolution calls for the interim committee to \n     work in cooperation and coordination with the state of Idaho, \n     its counties, its school and highway districts, along with \n     the recognized Indian tribes of the state of Idaho. The \n     resolution also provides that the interim committee address \n     National Forest System lands, but only those lands that do \n     not have special designations. The interim committee is \n     directed to formulate a solution that will protect all valid \n     existing rights, existing public access and activities, \n     including hunting, fishing and recreation, and that will not \n     be construed to interfere with treaties or any other \n     obligations to the Indian tribes, commitments to county \n     governments, or the General Mining Law or Taylor Grazing Act: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That the legislatures of \n     all western states should consider the adoption of similar \n     resolutions, working toward the development of a federal, \n     bipartisan, long-term solution that addresses sustainable \n     management of federal forest lands to stabilize payments to \n     forest counties throughout the western United States, which \n     help support roads and schools, and to provide projects that \n     enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment \n     opportunities, and to improve cooperative relationships among \n     those who use and care about the lands the federal government \n     manages; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, the congressional delegation representing the State \n     of Idaho in the Congress of the United States and to the \n     Legislatures of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, \n     Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, \n     Washington and Wyoming.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-63. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan expressing the Senate's \n     opposition to Norfolk Southern Corporation's proposed sale of \n     its rail lines from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids \n     to Kalamazoo and continuing to the Indiana border; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, The Norfolk Southern Corporation is considering \n     the sale of its Michigan lines from Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo \n     and from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo. The Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo \n     line carries the state's busiest high-speed AMTRAK train, the \n     Wolverine, which travels from Detroit to Chicago. The \n     Wolverine travels on the Norfolk Southern Railroad's rail \n     corridor from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo until it connects with \n     AMTRAK's own line. Ridership on this line increased six \n     percent in 2006 to 142,185 passengers; and\n       Whereas, The Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo portion of the Norfolk \n     Southern line is a vital link between Detroit and Chicago. \n     Expanding the high-speed rail capacity on this line is vital \n     to the future development of this area. New industry, \n     including coal energy, biodiesel, and ethanol fuel plants are \n     proposed for Michigan and specifically along the I-94 \n     corridor located near the Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo rail line. \n     Continued operation of this line by Norfolk Southern is \n     essential to expansion of new industry in this area. Over 150 \n     railroad employees' jobs are associated with the rail traffic \n     along this line; and\n       Whereas, Norfolk Southern is a Class One railroad operator, \n     earning revenue in excess of $250 million annually. As a \n     Class One operator, Norfolk Southern has the capacity to \n     maintain and promote the use of these lines. The proposed \n     sale of the Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids to \n     Kalamazoo lines will almost certainly place the lines under \n     the management of a Class Three operator, a rail company \n     earning revenue of $20 million or less annually. A Class \n     Three operator will be far less likely to have the means to \n     maintain the lines, thus increasing the chance of accidents. \n     Class Three operators also rely on federal grants for line \n     and equipment maintenance, grants that are not always \n     guaranteed; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we express opposition to \n     Norfolk Southern's proposed sale of its rail lines from \n     Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo and \n     continuing to the Indiana border; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     United\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\n     States House of Representatives; members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation; the United States Department of \n     Transportation, Surface Transportation Board; the Norfolk \n     Southern Corporation; AMTRAK; and the Michigan Department of \n     Transportation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-64. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine memorializing the President and Congress \n     to fully fund the State Children's Health Insurance Program; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\nJoint Resolution Memorializing the President and Congress of the United \n   States to Fully Fund the State Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n       Whereas, the State of Maine and at least 13 other states \n     have used up much of the federal subsidies for child health \n     care even though the fiscal year is still not ended, due in \n     part to the great need for these funds and also to the \n     inadequate formula by which the money is apportioned; and\n       Whereas, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \n     known as SCHIP, was started by Congress in 1998 and is funded \n     by a combination of federal and state funds, as well as by \n     the premiums of participants; and\n       Whereas, the program was envisioned as a way to provide \n     health insurance to the children of the working poor and the \n     current budget is $5.5 billion, which is about $745 million \n     short of the needs of the states; and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine has used its SCHIP funds to \n     help significantly with MaineCare, which has provided \n     valuable and important health care to more than 14,850 \n     children in our State, and without additional federal aid \n     3,500 to 4,000 Maine children will go uninsured; and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine needs at least $6,500,000 to \n     help the children at risk and to keep our children healthy, \n     and other states have needs just as important: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, take this opportunity to request that \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program be fully funded \n     not only for the children of the State of Maine, but for all \n     of the children of the working poor in the United States; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That official copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     President George W. Bush, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate and to each member of the Maine Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-65. A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     urging Congress to use all efforts, energies, and diligence \n     to withdraw the U.S. from any further participation in the \n     Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral activity that seeks to \n     advance, authorize, fund or in any way promote the creation \n     of any structure to create any form of the North American \n     Union; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 5\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department \n     of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n     participated in the formation of the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership of North America (SPP) on March 23, 2005, \n     representing a trilateral agreement between Canada, Mexico \n     and the United States designed, among other things, to \n     facilitate common regulatory schemes between these countries; \n     and\n       Whereas, reports issued by the SPP indicate that it has \n     implemented regulatory changes among the three countries that \n     circumvent United States trade, transportation, homeland \n     security and border security functions and that it is the \n     intention of SPP to continue toward a North American Union in \n     the future; and\n       Whereas, the actions taken by the SPP to coordinate border \n     security by eliminating obstacles to migration between Mexico \n     and the United States actually makes the United States-Mexico \n     border less secure and more vulnerable to possible terrorist \n     activities, and Mexico is the primary source country of \n     illegal immigrants, illegal drug entry and illegal human \n     smuggling into the United States; and\n       Whereas, according to the U. S. Department of Commerce, the \n     United States trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have \n     significantly increased since the implementation of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the volume of \n     imports from Mexico has soared since NAFTA, straining \n     security checks at the U.S. border; and\n       Whereas, the economic and physical security of the United \n     States is impaired by the potential loss of control of its \n     borders attendant to the full operation of NAFTA and the SPP; \n     and\n       Whereas, the regulatory and border security changes \n     implemented and proposed by the SPP violate and threaten \n     United States sovereignty; and\n       Whereas, the NAFTA Superhighway System from the west coast \n     of Mexico through the United States and into Canada has been \n     suggested as part of a North American Union to facilitate \n     trade between the SPP countries; and\n       Whereas, the stability and economic viability of the U.S. \n     ports along the western coast will be seriously compromised \n     by huge cargos off-loaded at cheaper labor cost from foreign \n     traders into the ports of Mazatlan and Lazaro Cardenas; and\n       Whereas, the state of Texas has already approved and begun \n     planning of the Trans-Texas Corridor, a major multi-modal \n     transportation project beginning at the United States-Mexico \n     border, which would serve as an initial section of the NAFTA \n     Superhighway System; and\n       Whereas, plans of Asian trading powers to divert cargo from \n     U.S. ports such as Los Angeles to ports in Mexico will only \n     put pressure on border inspectors, interfering with their \n     already overwhelming job of intercepting the flow of drugs \n     and illegals flowing into this country; and\n       Whereas, future unrestricted foreign trucking into the \n     United States can pose a safety hazard due to inadequate \n     maintenance and inspection, and the Transportation Security \n     Administration's (TSA) lack of background checks for \n     violations in Mexico, lack of drug and alcohol testing, lack \n     of enforcement of size and weight requirements and lack of \n     national security procedures, which threaten the American \n     people and undermine the very charge given to our homeland \n     security agency to defend our borders against these threats; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Eisenhower National Highway System was \n     designed for the national security of the United States for \n     movement of the military, purposes of commerce from state to \n     state, not from foreign countries, and this highway system \n     should not be compromised by treaties or agreements with \n     other countries that would supplant the control and \n     management of our nation's highways by our U.S. Department of \n     Transportation and the various states; and\n       Whereas, we strongly object to any treaty or agreement, \n     which threatens to violate national security, private \n     property, United States commerce, constitutional rights and \n     American sovereignty and emphasize our commitment to the \n     Pacific Northwest Economic Region (PNWER) and other \n     cooperative working nations in mutual beneficial goals; and\n       Whereas, this trilateral partnership to develop a North \n     American Union has never been presented to Congress as an \n     agreement or treaty, and has had virtually no congressional \n     oversight; and\n       Whereas, recent reports on internet news, Friday, January \n     26, 2007, WorldNetDaily, stating that Congressman Poe (R-\n     Texas) asked about the U.S. Department of Transportation's \n     work with the trade group North American Super-Corridor \n     Coalition, Inc. (NASCO) and the department's plans to build \n     the Trans-Texas Corridor, Congressman Poe was told that the \n     NAFTA agreement superhighway corridor plans exist to move \n     goods from Mexico through the United States to Canada; and\n       Whereas, American citizens and state and local governments \n     throughout the United States would be negatively impacted by \n     the SPP process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That we emphatically urge \n     and petition the Congress of the United States and \n     particularly the congressional delegation representing the \n     state of Idaho to use all efforts, energies and diligence to \n     withdraw the United States from any further participation in \n     the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America or \n     any other bilateral or multilateral activity that seeks to \n     advance, authorize, fund or in any way promote the creation \n     of any structure to create any form of North American Union; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That House Concurrent Resolution 40 of the First \n     Session of the 110th Congress addresses the concern herein \n     expressed by the state of Idaho; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we are asking our congressional delegation, \n     our U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Mary E. \n     Peters and President Bush to reject appropriated federal fuel \n     tax dollars for such SPP or NAFTA when there is such a need \n     for fuel tax dollars to be dedicated to the needs of the \n     states in the U.S. in order to maintain our highway system; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-66.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan memorializing Congress \n     to invest in Head Start and quality child care; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, Head Start and high-quality child care prepare \n     children for school and life success by narrowing the \n     educational achievement gap between lower- and upper-income \n     kids, increasing high school graduation rates, and reducing \n     crime; and\n       Whereas, Studies show that at-risk children who attend Head \n     Start and high-quality child care are better prepared for \n     school. For example, Head Start narrows the literacy skills \n     gap by nearly half between children in poverty and all \n     children. The research is clear that quality early childhood \n     education programs work to prevent crime. In Ypsilanti, \n     Michigan, three-and four-year-olds from low-income families \n     who were randomly assigned to a group that did not receive \n     preschool preparation were five times more likely to have \n     become chronic lawbreakers by age 27 than those who were \n     assigned to the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation's \n     Perry Preschool program; and\n       Whereas, Currently, only about half of eligible low-income \n     children can attend Head Start due to state and federal \n     funding limitations, and even fewer infants and toddlers. \n     Less than five percent of eligible children three years old \n     and younger are able to participate in Early Head Start. \n     Moreover, only one in seven eligible children in working, \n     low-income families receives help paying for quality child \n     care through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The \n     combination of state and federal money for preschool has \n     helped Michigan reach two of three at-risk four-year-olds and \n     one of five at-risk three-year-olds; and\n       Whereas, Real dollar funding levels for Head Start and \n     child care have been cut for the last several years, falling \n     far behind the rising costs that programs face. Instead of \n     reaching more eligible kids with comprehensive health, \n     nutrition, and early education services, Head Start programs \n     have been forced to shorten program hours, cut back staff, \n     reduce parent coaching, and reduce transportation and other \n     services that help families participate: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to increase discretionary funding in the \n     federal budget for 2008 by $750 million in additional funding \n     over current levels for Head Start and $720 million in \n     additional funding over current levels for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant (CCDBG). This request does not \n     address the unmet need in Head Start and CCDBG, but simply \n     restores services to children to the Fiscal Year 2002 level. \n     This is a crucial first step toward meeting the need to \n     provide quality early childhood education and care for at-\n     risk children. Investing in Head Start and quality child care \n     now will improve education outcomes for our nation's at-risk \n     children and will save lives and money down the road; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-68. A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     affirming the state's support of the United States campaign \n     to secure our country and urging members of Idaho's \n     congressional delegation to support measures to repeal the \n     federal REAL ID Act of 2005; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the state of Idaho recognizes the Constitution of \n     the United States as our charter of liberty and the Bill of \n     Rights as affirming the fundamental and inalienable rights of \n     Americans, including freedom of privacy and freedom from \n     unreasonable searches; and\n       Whereas, Idaho has a diverse population whose contributions \n     are vital to the state's economy, culture and civic \n     character; and\n       Whereas, Idaho is proud of its tradition of protecting the \n     civil rights and liberties of all its residents, affirming \n     the fundamental rights of all people and providing more \n     expansive protections than are granted by the Constitution of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-\n     13, creates a national identification card by mandating \n     federal standards for state driver's licenses and \n     identification cards and requires states to share their motor \n     vehicle databases; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act mandates the documents that states \n     must require to issue driver's licenses and requires states \n     to place uniform information on every driver's license in a \n     standard, machine-readable format; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act prohibits federal agencies and \n     federally-regulated commercial aircraft from accepting a \n     driver's license or identification card issued by a state \n     that has not fully complied with the act; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act places a costly, unfunded mandate \n     on states, with initial estimates for Idaho of more than \n     thirty-nine million dollars with ongoing annual expenses of \n     an estimated nine million three hundred thousand dollars and \n     a national estimate of more than eleven billion dollars over \n     the next five years; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act requires the creation of a massive \n     public sector database containing information on every \n     American that is accessible to all motor vehicle employees \n     and law enforcement officers nationwide and that can be used \n     to gather and manage information on citizens. Such activities \n     are not the business or responsibility of government; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act enables the creation of additional \n     massive private sector databases, combining both \n     transactional information and driver's license information \n     gained from scanning the machine-readable information \n     contained on every driver's license; and\n       Whereas, these public and private databases are likely to \n     contain numerous errors and false information, creating \n     significant hardship for Americans attempting to verify their \n     identities in order to travel on commercial aircraft, open a \n     bank account or perform any of the numerous functions \n     required to live in the United States today; and\n       Whereas, the federal trade commission estimates that ten \n     million Americans are victims of identity theft annually, and \n     because identity thieves are increasingly targeting motor \n     vehicle departments, the REAL ID Act will enable the crime of \n     identity theft by making the personal information of all \n     Americans, including date of birth and signature, accessible \n     from tens of thousands of locations; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act requires a driver's license to \n     contain a person's actual home address and makes no exception \n     for individuals in potential danger, such as undercover law \n     enforcement personnel or victims of stalking or criminal \n     harassment; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act contains onerous record \n     verification and retention provisions that place unreasonable \n     burdens on the motor vehicle division and on third parties \n     required to verify records; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act will place enormous burdens on \n     consumers seeking new driver's licenses, such as longer \n     lines, increased document requests, higher costs and a \n     waiting period; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act will place state motor vehicle \n     staff on the front lines of immigration enforcement by \n     forcing state employees to determine federal citizenship and \n     immigration status, excessively burdening both foreign-born \n     applicants and motor vehicle staff; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act passed without sufficient \n     deliberation by Congress and did not receive a hearing by any \n     congressional committee or a vote solely on its own merits, \n     despite opposition from more than six hundred organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act eliminated a process of negotiated \n     rulemaking initiated under the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which had convened federal, \n     state and local policymakers, privacy advocates and industry \n     experts to solve the problem of the misuse of identity \n     documents; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act provides little security benefit \n     and leaves identification systems open to insider fraud, \n     counterfeit documentation and database failures: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That we support the \n     government of the United States in its campaign to secure our \n     country, while affirming the commitment of the United States \n     that this campaign not be waged at the expense of the \n     essential civil rights and liberties of the citizens of this \n     country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That it is the policy of the state of Idaho to \n     oppose any portion of the REAL ID Act that violates the \n     rights and liberties guaranteed under the constitutions of \n     the State of Idaho and the United States, including the Bill \n     of Rights. Be it further\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Idaho Legislature shall enact no \n     legislation nor authorize an appropriation to implement the \n     provisions of the REAL ID Act in Idaho, unless such \n     appropriation is used exclusively for the purpose of \n     undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the costs of \n     implementing the REAL ID Act or to mount a constitutional \n     challenge to the act by the state Attorney General. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Idaho Legislature urges the Idaho \n     congressional delegation to support measures to repeal the \n     REAL ID Act. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States George W. Bush, the United States Attorney \n     General Alberto Gonzales, the President of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, the \n     Governor of Idaho C. L. Otter and the congressional \n     delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of \n     the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-69. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Massachusetts memorializing the \n     President and Congress to recommend more funding to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs in the budget for fiscal year \n     2008; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n   Resolution Memorializing George W. Bush, President of the United \nStates, and the United States Congress to Recommend More Funding to the \n  Department of Veterans Affairs in the Fiscal Year 08 Federal Budget.\n\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush has recommended 34.2 \n     billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs in his \n     proposed fiscal year 08 budget, which is an inadequate \n     appropriation to adequately address the health of our \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, while the Bush Administration continues to tout \n     its recommendation for an increase of $2 billion over the \n     previous fiscal year as a ``landmark budget'', the reality is \n     that this 6% increase is barely enough to account for the \n     cost of inflation and cannot fund the need for improvements \n     in medical care and expansion of services; and\n       Whereas, more than 27,000 service members have returned \n     home to Massachusetts since September 11, 2001, having faced \n     a new type of warfare in the form of improvised explosive \n     devices and are, upon return home, in need of specialized \n     services and care; and\n       Whereas, the United States Government must provide to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs all the tools available to \n     make this specialized care available, particularly for head, \n     spinal cord and sight injuries and the growing need for \n     mental health services; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the Veterans Health Administration's \n     Undersecretary for Health Policy and Coordination stated that \n     some areas of the country did not have any mental health \n     services available and that other areas had such long wait \n     times that certain services were ``virtually inaccessible''; \n     and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, once again, Category 8 Veterans, \n     those veterans deemed ``high income'' veterans by the \n     Veterans Administration--some who make as little as $28,000 a \n     year--and who have been ineligible to enroll in the Veterans \n     Administration Health Care System since 2003, may continue to \n     be shut out of the Veterans Administration Health Care Systen \n     if funding is not increased, adding to the approximately 1 \n     million Category 8 Veterans who have been turned away since \n     2003; and\n       Whereas, while the Massachusetts State Senate has supported \n     the Veterans Affairs' recommendations for improvements in \n     medical equipment and facility upgrades to medical centers, \n     for two years, the Senate has fought hard to prevent the \n     possible consolidation of the four existing Veterans \n     Administration medical care facilities in the greater Boston \n     area into one ``mega-plex'', since the negative impact of \n     removing thousands of veterans from their familiar health \n     care environment and forcing them to change physicians would \n     have consequences that cannot be balanced by the creation of \n     one modernized facility: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate hereby urges the \n     President of the United States and Congress to address the \n     Veterans Affairs Budget in a timely manner, include in the \n     2008 budget the Veterans Affairs' recommendations for \n     improvements in medical equipment and facility upgrades to \n     all Massachusetts Veterans Administration Medical Centers and \n     to provide mandatory funding for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Health Care system so as to appropriately honor and \n     facilitate the healing of our veterans who selflessly risk \n     their lives and well-being to protect our freedom; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States, the Presiding Officer of each branch of \n     Congress and to the Members thereof from the Commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-70. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Vermont urging Congress to enact \n     legislation to assure federal funding for veterans' health \n     care; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 13\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) provides medical care for veterans, including men and \n     women, who have risked their lives to protect the security of \n     our nation, and\n       Whereas, Congress appropriates funding for VA health care \n     each year as part of the discretionary federal budget, and\n       Whereas, each year's federal budget for veterans' health \n     care has been very seriously under-funded, and\n       Whereas, this serious and now chronic shortfall affects the \n     access to and the quality of medical care services that the \n     VA provides for our veterans, and\n       Whereas, the priority of serving veterans must be absolute \n     and irrevocable, and must serve as the foundation for the VA \n     and of our nation's public policy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate of the State of \n     Vermont urgently requests that Congress enact legislation to \n     assure Federal funding for veterans' health care, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Governor Douglas also request that Congress \n     enact legislation to assure Federal funding for veterans' \n     health care, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be directed to \n     send a copy of this resolution to the Governor, the \n     President, the Vice President, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \n     James Nicholson; Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; House \n     Minority Leader, John Boehner; Senate Majority Leader, Harry \n     Reid; Senate Minority Leader, Trent Lott; to the members of \n     the Vermont Congressional delegation; and to Vermont veterans \n     organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4599-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4599-S4600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Grassley, \n             Mr. Lott, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n             Smith, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n             DeMint, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Chambliss, \n             Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, Mr. Allard, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n             Enzi, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Coburn):\n       S. 14.

A bill to repeal the sunset on certain tax rates and other \nincentives and to repeal the individual alternative minimum tax, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, on behalf of the Senate Republican \nleadership, I am introducing the Invest in America Act, a comprehensive \nset of legislative proposals that are designed keep American families \nand the American economy on the path of continued prosperity by \npreventing--the largest tax increase in our Nation's history--a tax \nincrease that is scheduled to happen in 2011 if Congress fails to \nextend current tax policies.\n  The American economy is the envy of the developed world. Our \nunemployment rate is just 4.4 percent, and 7.8 million new jobs have \nbeen created since mid-2003. Not only are more Americans working than \never before, but the benefits of our growing economy are broadly shared \nby all Americans. Real, inflation-adjusted wages rose 2.2 percent in \nthe last 12 months--faster than the average rate of the late 1990s. \nThis meant an extra $1,279 in the past year for the typical family with \ntwo wage earners. To keep our economy growing on this strong and \nsustainable path, we must avoid tax increases that could damage our \neconomy.\n  America's economy has been growing at a strong and sustainable pace \ndue in large measure to the fact that Americans are willing to work \nharder and be more productive in their labor, thus creating more new \ngoods and services at lower costs. Americans will continue to be \nproductive and contribute to our strong economy if we reject marginal \ntax rate increases on the income they earn. Studies have shown that \npeople really do work more if the tax imposed on their extra labor is \nrelatively low. Arizona State University's distinguished economics \nprofessor, Dr. Edward Prescott, won a Nobel Prize in economics for \nresearch that proved this theory.\n  It's interesting that the big investment bank, Goldman Sachs, studied \nwhat would happen if taxes increase across-the-board, as is scheduled \nto happen in 2011 when the various tax rates and other provisions \nenacted since 2001 expire. The short answer is an immediate recession--\na recession that would not be avoided even if the Federal Reserve acted \nto cut interest rates. This study demonstrates very clearly why \nCongress cannot allow this tax hike to happen.\n  The President proposed in his fiscal year 2008 budget to make the tax \nrates and many other tax incentives enacted since 2001 permanent. In \nmarked contrast, Democrats have produced budget resolutions in both the \nHouse and the Senate that assume all of these tax policies will expire \nand taxes will increase dramatically for virtually every American. In \nfact, the average family will see its taxes increase by about $3,675 if \nthe Democrats are successful in canceling the tax relief. Today, Senate \nRepublicans are going on the record in support of making these \nimportant tax policies permanent and in opposition to plans by \nDemocrats to allow these tax increases to occur.\n  Our legislation underscores our commitment to American families and \nto a strong American economy by preventing the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history. We believe that American families pay enough in \ntaxes--indeed, revenues are running above historical levels. The Invest \nin America Act makes all of the current-law tax rates permanent so that \nno American family faces an automatic tax hike in 2011. I want to \nunderscore that Republicans believe that no American family should face \na tax increase--not young people just entering the job market and other \nlower-income Americans who are benefiting so substantially from the 10 \npercent bracket; not middle-income families; and not more successful \nAmericans, including the almost 80 percent of taxpayers in the top \nbracket who report small business income.\n\n  Our legislation also invests in American families by making the \n$1,OOO-per-child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, and the other \ncomponents of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act--\nEGTRRA--of 2001 permanent. American moms and dads face an enormous and \nunexpected reduction in the child tax credit in 2011,\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\nwhen the child tax credit is scheduled to be cut in half. Republicans \nknow that the child tax credit helps countless parents offset some of \nthe costs associated with raising their children, and we know that \nreducing the credit by 50 percent will be a terrible blow to many \nfamilies. That's why Republicans support making the current $1,000 per-\nchild tax credit permanent.\n  Married couples will face an unwelcome surprise when the marriage \npenalty relief expires. The marriage penalty relief the Republicans \nenacted is aimed squarely at middle-income families because the relief \nis only provided for the standard deduction and the 15-percent bracket. \nRepublicans believe there is no reason a married couple should face a \nhigher tax burden than they would as two single taxpayers, and so we \npropose to invest in American families by making the marriage penalty \nrelief permanent.\n  The Invest in America Act underscores our commitment to investing in \nAmerica's future by making the important education-related tax benefits \nenacted in recent years permanent. This will help countless middle-\nincome Americans afford higher education costs. Our legislation invests \nin America's future by extending the tuition deduction, extending the \nmodifications to Coverdell education savings accounts, extending \ncertain provisions for the student loan interest deduction, and \nextending the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance. \nWe also propose to permanently extend the $250 deduction for expenses \nof elementary and secondary school teachers.\n  Republicans also believe that parents ought to be able to pass on the \nfruits of their labor to their children without the Federal death tax \nconfiscating half of their estate, above a small exemption amount. The \ndeath tax hits family businesses and family farms and ranches the \nhardest because the owners are often not wealthy families, but rather \nhave most of their assets tied up in the value of the business or the \nvalue of the land. And while the death tax hurts families, it also \nhurts our economy if it forces family businesses to close down, \neliminating good-paying jobs in the process. Under current law, the \ndeath tax is repealed in 2010, but springs back to life in 2011, when \nmore than 131,000 families will have to file estate tax returns in that \nyear alone. Americans pay taxes throughout their lives, and Republicans \nbelieve they should not have more than half of their assets taken in \ntaxes at death too, so the Invest in America Act makes repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent.\n  The Invest in America Act goes beyond the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \nlaws and also repeals--once and for all--the individual Alternative \nMinimum Tax (AMT). If you go by rhetoric alone, there is overwhelming \nbipartisan support in Congress for repealing the AMT. But, American \ntaxpayers want action. The problems we have encountered from the AMT \ndemonstrate what happens when Congress tries to target a tax \nspecifically at the ``wealthy''--we almost always end up hitting the \nbroad swath of middle-income families. The AMT was never intended to \nhit middle-income taxpayers, and Congress ought to repeal it before it \nimposes unnecessary and unexpected taxes on more and more families.\n\n  Republicans understand that, in addition to not raising taxes on \nfamilies, we cannot take our strong and dynamic economy for granted; we \nbelieve we must invest in American competitiveness. While our \nlegislation should not be viewed as a comprehensive approach to \nimproving American competitiveness, we believe a necessary first step \nis to prevent tax increases that will surely hurt America's competitive \nposition in the world economy. Specifically, the Invest in America Act \nmakes permanent the current tax rates for capital gains and dividends; \nit makes the increased expensing amounts available for small businesses \npermanent; and it makes permanent the newly-enhanced research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  America cannot expect to be the home for worldwide capital markets if \nit is hostile to American investors, so the Invest in America Act makes \nthe existing tax rates for long-term capital gains and for qualified \ndividends permanent. These lower tax rates implemented in 2003 and \nextended in 2006 have encouraged investors of all income categories to \nput their money to work in the markets, generating solid returns for \nAmerican investors and providing much needed capital for American \nbusinesses to grow and create new jobs. It has been 4 years since these \nlower rates were enacted-long enough for us to determine once and for \nall that lower rates really do encourage increased economic activity.\n  Growth since the 2003 tax relief has averaged more than 3.5 percent, \nwhile it averaged just 1.3 percent from the first quarter of 2001 \nthrough the second quarter of 2003. The Dow Jones Industrial Average \nhas risen by 40 percent since the lower investment tax rates were \nenacted. The average 401(k) balance has risen by about 65 percent since \n2003. All of this investment activity makes it easier for entrepreneurs \nand businesses to raise funds to expand and grow their businesses, \ncreate more jobs, and improve standards of living around the country.\n  It's interesting to note that, while the conventional wisdom is that \nthese lower investment tax rates only benefit ``the rich,'' half of all \nAmericans own shares of stock, either on their own or in their \nretirement savings. In fact, most of the Americans who are benefiting \nfrom these lower rates are middle-income taxpayers. Moreover, the \ncurrent 5 percent rate, which is available for the lower-income \ninvestors and drops to zero in 2008, is a sometimes-forgotten benefit, \nbut it is especially important to our senior citizens who rely on their \ninvestment income. According to statistics calculated by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the vast majority of elderly taxpayers who \nreport capital gains and dividends income have incomes under $100,000.\n  In addition to reducing tax rates to encourage more business \ninvestment, Congress also significantly increased the amount of \ninvestment that small businesses may expense in a given year. This has \nhelped countless small businesses expand their operations by making the \npurchase of new equipment more cost-effective. Unfortunately, these \nincreased levels are only in effect through 2009. Small businesses \ncreate most new jobs in the U.S. and comprise half of our private gross \ndomestic product, so the Invest in America Act proposes to make the \nenhanced small business expensing levels permanent.\n  While low tax rates on income and investments are essential to \nkeeping America competitive, Republicans know that many countries \naround the world are specifically and aggressively working to attract \nsome of the most high-quality jobs and economic activities available: \nresearch and development. America hinders its ability to attract and \nretain R here because the tax incentives we give to encourage R are \nnot permanent law, but must be extended every year or so. This makes it \nvery difficult for companies to commit to large-scale R investments \nin the U.S., when other countries are offering permanent or longer-term \ntax incentives. To ensure that America remains the most attractive \nplace for R, the Invest in America Act makes the R tax credit \npermanent.\n  The Invest in America Act also acknowledges that the U.S. tax system \nimposes a costly and frustrating burden on taxpayers, with filers \nspending an average 30 hours to complete the typical Form 1040. Six in \nten Americans opt instead to hire a professional. The billions of \ndollars spent each year simply complying with the tax system could be \nput to a much better, and more economically beneficial, use. The Invest \nin America Act expresses the Sense of the Senate that the Finance \nCommittee should report tax simplification legislation by the end of \nthe year to make the tax system fair, transparent, and efficient, \nwithout raising tax rates.\n  Finally, I want to address the effect all of the tax changes have had \non our budget deficit and to dispute the notion that Congress must \nraise taxes elsewhere if we are going to make existing tax rates and \nincentives permanent and repeal the AMT. It is important for all \nAmericans to know that all of the additional tax revenue flowing into \nthe Treasury from our growing economy, hardworking Americans, and from \nprofitable investments has caused our budget deficit to shrink below 2 \npercent of GDP--well below its historical average. If we stay on our \ncurrent progrowth path, reject tax increases,\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nand impose reasonable restraints on spending growth, we will balance \nthe budget by 2012, if not sooner.\n  As for the notion that Congress must ``pay for'' tax relief with tax \nincreases, I would note that the official estimates about how much \ncertain tax provisions will ``cost'' the Treasury are just that, \nestimates. And they often prove to be wrong. For example, since 2003, \nthe Treasury has collected $133 billion more in capital gains revenue \nthan was originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office; \nrevenues have exceeded official CBO projections by 68 percent. Second, \nthe concept of requiring corresponding tax increases falsely assumes \nthat the Government is entitled to the revenue, when it really belongs \nto the American people. Third, revenues are running above their \nhistorical average of about 18.2 percent and are projected to continue \nincreasing even if we make the current tax structure permanent, as we \npropose in the Invest in America Act. If we raise taxes in order to \nextend the tax policies, we will be taking even more resources out of \nthe private sector and spending them on government programs, which will \ncertainly damage our economy. To protect our growing economy, I believe \nwe must ensure that revenues, as a percentage of our economy, do not \nrise much above their current level.\n  I am pleased to be the lead sponsor of this important legislation \nthat underscores the commitment of the Senate Republican leadership to \ninvesting in American families, America's future, and American \ncompetitiveness. America's economy is growing at a strong and \nsustainable level, to the benefit of all American families, but this \ngrowth will not continue if we unwisely allow taxes to be increased on \nwork, savings, and investment--the very engines of economic growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1121. A bill to authorize the cancellation of Perkins Loans for \nstudents who perform public service as librarians in low-income schools \nand public libraries; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am joined by Mr. Cochran in introducing \nimportant legislation, the Librarian Incentive to Boost Recruitment and \nRetention in Areas of Need (LIBRARIAN) Act, to support our Nation's \nlibrarians. This legislation is also being introduced in the other body \nby Representative Becerra, along with Representatives Grijalva, Ehlers, \nand Shimkus.\n  Public libraries and schools across the Nation are experiencing a \nshortage of librarians. Approximately 25 percent of America's school \nlibraries do not have a State certified library media specialist on \nstaff and with more than three in five librarians becoming eligible for \nretirement in the next decade this shortage is anticipated to only \nworsen.\n  The LIBRARIAN Act amends the Higher Education Act to provide for \nPerkins loan forgiveness to individuals with master's degrees in \nlibrary science who become librarians in low-income schools and public \nlibraries. Librarians working full-time in low-income areas would \nqualify for up to 100 percent Perkins loan forgiveness depending on the \nnumber of years they serve.\n  Libraries and librarians play an essential role in our schools and \ncommunities; this legislation aims to provide the same support to \nlibrarians as other public service workers receive, including teachers \nworking in low-income schools, Head Start staff, law enforcement \nofficials, and nurses or medical technicians.\n  Today we celebrate National Library Workers Day, a day to recognize \nthe valuable contributions made by librarians and others who work in \nlibraries. With this legislation, we have an opportunity to encourage \nmore individuals to pursue the field of library science and retain \nthose skilled librarians who are already serving in our low-income \nschools and communities.\n  I was pleased that the text of this bill was included in the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization bill approved by the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee last Congress. I will again \npress for its inclusion in the reauthorization bill the Committee is \ncurrently working to develop. I urge my colleagues to join us in this \nendeavor by cosponsoring the LIBRARIAN Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify, modernize, and improve public notice of and access to tax \nlien information by providing for a national, Internet accessible, \nfiling system for Federal tax liens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today is the day that millions of Americans \nacross this country perform an important civic duty by paying their \ntaxes. It is also a day when many Members of Congress take the time to \nreflect on the state of the Federal tax system and consider how we can \nstrengthen it, simplify it, make it more fair, and, in a responsible \nway, ease the tax burden on our citizens.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, S. 681, \nto strengthen our tax system. That bipartisan bill, which I introduced \nwith my colleagues, Senators Norm Coleman and Barack Obama, targets \noutrageous, offshore tax abuses that drain $100 billion each year from \nthe U.S. Treasury at the expense of honest, hardworking American \nfamilies who pay their fair share. Offshore tax abuses eat away at the \nfoundations of our tax system, draining billions in tax revenue, \ndiverting substantial IRS enforcement resources, and demoralizing \nhonest taxpayers who play by the rules. S. 681 offers a host of \nprovisions to stop offshore abuses, and I urge my colleagues to take a \nserious look at that legislation on this tax day. If enacted, it would \nmake our tax system more effective, more fair, and more productive. It \ndeserves to be enacted into law this year.\n  Stopping offshore tax abuse, however, is far from the only tax \nproblem that needs to be addressed if we are to achieve a fair and cost \neffective tax system. So today, I am introducing with Senator Coleman \nlegislation offering a cure to a completely different tax problem. The \ntarget of this legislation is better administration of Federal tax \nliens.\n  It has been 40 years since Congress made any significant changes to \nthe laws regulating how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) files \nFederal tax liens and makes them public. Right now, outdated laws are \nforcing the IRS to waste taxpayer dollars on an old-fashioned, \ninefficient, and burdensome paper tax lien filing system that should be \nreplaced by a modernized electronic filing system capable of operating \nat a fraction of the cost. It is time to bring the Federal tax lien \nsystem into the 21st century. That's why I am introducing today, along \nwith Senator Coleman, the Tax Lien Simplification\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nAct, which will simplify the process of recording tax liens at an \nestimated ten-year cost savings of over half a billion dollars, while \nat the same time improving taxpayer service by speeding up the release \nof liens after taxes are paid.\n  Tax liens are a principal way to collect payment from persons who are \ndelinquent in paying their taxes. By law, Federal tax liens arise \nautomatically ten days after a taxpayer's failure to pay an assessed \ntax. The lien automatically attaches to the taxpayer's real and \npersonal property and remains in effect until the tax is paid. However, \nthe tax lien is not effective against other creditors owed money by the \nsame taxpayer, until a notice of the Federal tax lien is publicly \nrecorded. Generally, between competing creditors, the first to file \nnotice has priority, so the filing of tax lien notices is very \nimportant to the government and to the taxpaying public if taxes are to \nbe collected from persons who don't pay them.\n  Current law requires the IRS to file public notices of Federal tax \nliens in State, county, or city recording offices around the country. \nThere are currently more than 4,100 of these local recording offices, \nmany of which have developed specific rules regulating how such liens \nmust be formatted and filed in their jurisdictions. This patchwork \nsystem developed more by default than by plan, because those local \noffices were where documents affecting title to real property, \njudgments, and other lien and security interest documents had always \nbeen filed.\n  In 1966, to help the IRS comply with a proliferating set of local \nfiling rules for Federal tax liens, Congress passed the Tax Lien Act to \nstandardize certain practices. This act provided, for example, that \nliens against real estate had to be filed where the property was \nlocated, and required each State to designate a single place to file \nFederal tax liens applicable to personal property. Most States \nsubsequently adopted a version of the Uniform Tax Lien Filing Act, \nenabling the IRS to file a notice of tax lien in each locality where \nthe taxpayer's real estate is located, and a single notice where the \ntaxpayer resides to reach any personal property. For corporations, \nStates typically require the IRS to file a notice to attach real estate \nin each locality where the real estate is located, and a separate \nnotice, usually at the State level, to attach other types of property. \nThere are often additional rules for trusts and partnerships. The end \nresult of the law was to reduce some but not all of the multiple sets \nof rules regulating the local filing of Federal tax liens.\n  In addition, in most cases, the IRS continued to have to physically \nfile the tax lien in the appropriate local recording office. In most \ncases, that filing is accomplished by mail. Some jurisdictions also \nallow electronic filings, but those jurisdictions are few and far \nbetween. The same is true if a lien has to be corrected, or a related \ncertificate of discharge, subordination, or nonattachment needs to be \nfiled, or when a tax liability has been resolved and the IRS wants to \nrelease a lien. Each usually requires a paper filing in one or more \nlocal recording offices. If a paper filing is lost or misplaced, the \nIRS often has to send an employee in person to deal with the problem, \nadding travel costs to other administrative expenses.\n  The paper filing system imposes similar burdens on other persons \ndealing with the tax lien system. Any person who is the subject of a \ntax lien, for example, or who is a creditor trying to locate a tax \nlien, is required to make a physical trip to one or more local \nrecording offices to search the documents and see if a lien has been \nfiled. Currently, there is no central database of locally filed tax \nliens that can be accessed by any member of the public or by any \ntaxpayer that is the subject of a federal tax lien. Not even IRS \npersonnel have access to such a tax lien database. It does not exist.\n  The result is an inefficient, costly, and burdensome paper filing \nsystem that can and should be completely revamped. Businesses across \nthe country learned long ago that electronic filing systems outperform \npaper; they save personnel costs, material costs, time, and client \nfrustration. Government agencies have learned the same thing as they \nhave moved to electronic databases and recordkeeping, including systems \nmade available to the public on the Internet. Among the many examples \nof government-sponsored, Internet-based systems currently in operation \nare the contractor registry operated by the General Services \nAdministration to allow persons to register to bid on federal \ncontracts, the license registry operated by the Federal Communications \nCommission to allow the public to search radio licenses, and the \nregistry operated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to allow the \npublic to search currently registered patents and trademarks. Each of \nthese systems has saved taxpayer money, while improving service to the \npublic.\n\n  Just as government agencies gave up the horse and buggy for the \nautomobile, it is time for the IRS to move from a decentralized, paper-\nbased tax lien filing system to an electronic national tax lien \nregistry. But the IRS' hands are tied, until the Congress changes the \nlaws holding back modernization of the federal tax lien filing system.\n  The bill we are introducing today would make the changes necessary to \nenable the IRS to take immediate steps to simplify and modernize the \nFederal tax lien filing system. The operative provisions would require \nthe IRS to create a national registry for the filing of tax lien \nnotices as an electronic database that is Internet accessible and \nsearchable by the public at no cost. It would mandate the use of this \nsystem in place of the existing system of local filings. It would \nestablish the priority of Federal tax liens according to the date and \ntime that the relevant notice was filed in the national registry, in \nthe same way that priorities are currently established from the date \nand time of filing in local recording offices. The bill would also \nshorten the time allowed to release a tax lien, after the related tax \nliability has been resolved, from 30 days to 10 days.\n  To establish this new electronic filing system, the bill would give \nthe Treasury Secretary express authority to issue regulations or other \nguidance governing the establishment and maintenance of the registry. \nAmong other obligations, Treasury would be required to ensure that the \nregistry was secure and prevent data tampering. In addition, prior to \nthe implementation of the national registry, the Treasury Secretary \nwould be required to review the information currently included in \npublic tax lien filings to determine whether any of that information \nshould be excluded or protected from disclosure on the Internet. For \nexample, the Treasury Secretary would be expected to prevent the \ndisclosure of social security numbers that are currently included in \nmany public tax lien filings, but if disclosed on the Internet, could \nfacilitate identity theft. While such identifying information could \ncontinue to be included in a tax lien filing to ensure that the filing \nis directed toward the correct person, the registry could be \nconstructed to prevent such information from being disclosed publicly \nand to instead provide such information only upon request from \nappropriate persons involved in the enforcement of the tax lien or \ncollection of the tax debt. By requiring this information review prior \nto implementing the national tax lien registry, the bill is expected to \nprovide greater protection of some taxpayer information than occurs in \ncurrent tax lien filings.\n  The bill would require the Treasury Secretary to establish a \nfunctioning tax lien registry by January 1, 2009, but would also allow \nthe IRS to continue to use the existing paper-based tax lien filing \nsystem, in parallel with the new system, for an appropriate period to \nensure a smooth transition. The IRS has indicated that it would be able \nto establish an electronic tax lien filing system within the specified \ntime period.\n  Moving to a centralized, electronic tax lien filing system, an \nInternet-based National Registry of tax liens, would accomplish at \nleast three objectives. It would save taxpayer dollars, speed the \nprocess for filing and releasing tax liens, and simplify the process \nfor researching Federal tax liens for taxpayers and creditors.\n  The IRS estimates that moving from a paper-based, locally filed tax \nlien system to an Internet-based, Federal tax lien filing system would \nsave about $570 million over 10 years. That's half a billion dollars in \ncost savings. These\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nsavings would come from the elimination of State filing fees, IRS \npersonnel costs, travel costs related to local filing problems, and the \ncost of lost taxes whenever the IRS makes an error or a tax lien filing \nis misplaced or delayed. Filing fees, for example, vary widely from \nstate to state, but typically cost at least $10 per filing, and in some \nStates cost as much as $150. If a taxpayer has real estate in multiple \njurisdictions, those costs multiply. Personnel costs include the IRS \nservice center staff that is currently charged with filing tax liens \nnationwide and complying with the myriad filing rules in effect in the \n4,100 recording offices across the country. Additional anticipated \nsavings would come from reduced mailing and travel costs.\n  Electronic filing would not only save money, it would improve \ntaxpayer service. Taxpayers who are the subject of a tax lien filing, \nfor example, would benefit from a centralized registry in several ways. \nFirst, taxpayers would be able to review their liens as soon as they \nare filed online, without having to make a physical trip to one or more \nlocal recording offices. Second, taxpayers would have an easy way to \nlook up their liens on multiple occasions, identify any problems, and \ncorrect any errors. Third, once the underlying tax liability was \nresolved, the IRS would be required to release the tax lien in 10 days, \ninstead of the 30 days allowed under current law. The longer 30-day \nperiod is necessitated by the current complexities associated with \nfiling a paper lien in one or more local offices, complexities that \nwould be eliminated by the establishment of a centralized, electronic \nregistry.\n  Creditors who need to research Federal tax liens would also benefit \nfrom a centralized, electronic registry. Lenders, security holders and \nothers, for example, would be able to use a simplified search process \nthat could take place online and would not require physical trips to \nmultiple locations. Simplifying the search process would also provide \ngreater certainty that all tax liens were found. The ability to \nresearch Federal tax liens remotely and instantaneously should be of \nparticular benefit to larger lenders and to creditors of taxpayers with \nwidely distributed assets.\n  Federal tax liens are not a topic that normally excites the public's \ninterest. Sound tax administration, however, requires attention to \nadministrative as well as enforcement concerns. Federal law is \ncurrently impeding development of a more efficient, cost effective tax \nlien filing system. Amending the law as indicated in the Tax Lien \nSimplification Act to streamline the tax lien filing system, moving it \nfrom a paper-based to an electronic-based system, would not only \nadvance the more efficient, cost-effective tax system we all want, it \nwould also save half a billion dollars in taxpayer money. At the same \ntime, it would make the system work better for individual taxpayers by \nreducing the possibility for mistakes and speeding up the release of \nliens for taxpayers who have paid. Modernizing our tax lien filing \nsystem makes sense in every way. I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nColeman and myself in enacting this bill into law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record following these \nremarks a section-by-section analysis of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Tax Lien Simplification Act introduced by Senators \n     Levin and Coleman contains the following provisions.\n\n\n                               Section 1\n\n       The short title of the bill is the ``Tax Lien \n     Simplification Act.''\n\n\n                               Section 2\n\n       Section 2 contains the findings and purpose of the bill. It \n     finds that the current federal tax lien filing system is \n     inefficient, burdensome, and expensive, and that current \n     technology permits the creation of an electronic system that \n     would be more efficient, more timely, less burdensome, and \n     less expensive. It states that the purpose of the bill is to \n     simplify and modernize the tax lien filing process, to \n     improve public access to tax lien information, and to save \n     taxpayer dollars by replacing the current decentralized \n     system of local tax lien filings with a centralized, \n     nationwide, Internet accessible, and fully searchable tax \n     lien filing system.\n\n\n                               Section 3\n\n       Section 3 contains the operative provisions of the bill.\n       Subsection (a) would amend section 6323(f) of title 26 by \n     eliminating the provisions in current law directing tax liens \n     to be filed in state and local recording offices, and by \n     authorizing the filing of federal tax lien notices in a \n     national tax lien registry to be established under a new \n     subsection 6323(k). It would deem such notices, and any \n     related certificate of release, discharge, subordination, or \n     nonattachment of a lien, to be effective for purpose of \n     determining the relative priority of a federal tax lien. It \n     would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe the \n     form and content of the tax lien notices to be filed on the \n     registry. Filings of tax lien notices and related documents \n     would become effective from the date and time of recording in \n     the national tax lien registry, just as they are now from the \n     date and time of a local filing.\n       Subsection (b) would provide that if an existing tax lien \n     notice must be re-filed, then the re-filing should be made in \n     the national tax lien registry.\n       Subsection (c) would require certificates of release, \n     discharge, subordination, and nonattachment of a tax lien to \n     be filed in the national tax lien registry. It would also \n     reduce from 30 days to 10 days the time allotted for the \n     release of a tax lien after the underlying tax liability has \n     been resolved. It would make various conforming amendments in \n     the provisions related to federal tax liens.\n       Subsection (d)(1) would amend section 6323 of title 26 by \n     establishing a National Registry of federal tax liens and \n     related documents. It would require this National Registry to \n     be established and maintained by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and made accessible to and searchable by the public \n     through the Internet at no cost. It would require the \n     registry to identify the taxpayer to whom the tax lien \n     applies and reflect the date and time the notice of lien was \n     filed. It would require the registry to be searchable by, at \n     a minimum, taxpayer name and address, the type of tax, the \n     tax period, and when Treasury determines it is feasible, by \n     the affected property.\n       Subsection (d)(2) would require Treasury to issue \n     regulations or other guidance for the maintenance and use of \n     the registry, and to secure the registry and prevent data \n     tampering. Prior to the implementation of the registry, the \n     Treasury Secretary would be required to review the \n     information currently provided in public tax lien filings to \n     determine whether any of that information should be excluded \n     or protected from public viewing in the National Registry.\n       Subsection (e) would establish a transition rule for the \n     move from the existing paper-based tax lien filing system to \n     the National Registry. It would authorize the Treasury \n     Secretary to issue regulations allowing for the continued \n     filing of notices in state and local offices for ``an \n     appropriate period to permit an orderly transition'' to the \n     National Registry.\n       Subsection (f) would require Treasury to make the National \n     Registry operational as of January 1, 2009, and make the bill \n     applicable to tax lien notices filed after December 31, 2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish a Summer of Service State grant program, a Summer of \nService national direct grant program, and related national activities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Cochran, Kennedy, Stevens, Bingaman, Kerry and Rockefeller the \nSummer of Service Act of 2007. This bill offers middle school students \nthe chance to spend a summer in service to their communities as they \ntransition into high school.\n  The Summer of Service Act would create a competitive grant program \nthat would enable States and localities to offer middle school students \nan opportunity to participate in a structured community service program \nover the summer months. It would employ service-learning to teach civic \nparticipation skills, help young people see themselves as resources to \ntheir communities, expand educational opportunities and discourage \n``summer academic slide.'' Providing tangible benefits to their \ncommunities, Summer of Service projects would direct grantees to work \non unmet human, educational, environmental and public safety needs and \nencourage all youth, regardless of age, income, or disability, to \nengage in community service. The program would also grant participants \nwith an educational award of up to $500 which can later be used to pay \nfor college.\n  Volunteerism not only brings support and services to communities in \nneed, it also provides significant benefits to the students who \nparticipate. When young people participate in service activities they \nfeel better able to control their lives in a positive way, avoiding \nrisk\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nbehaviors, strengthening their community connections and become more \nengaged in their studies. When service is tied to what students are \nlearning in school, they often make gains on achievement tests, \ncomplete their homework more often, and increase their grade point \naverage. Students who engage in service learning also improve their \ncommunication skills, gain increased awareness of career possibilities, \nand develop more positive workplace attitudes, setting the foundation \nfor their place as America's future leaders. Studies also show that \nstudents who participate in community service are more likely to \ngraduate high school and demonstrate interest in going to college.\n  We often hear today of the tremendous pressures our young people face \nat home, in school and in the afterschool hours. Summer of Service \nprovides young people with the chance to be a positive change in their \ncommunities. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Summer of Service Act of 2007. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer of Service Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet \n     human, educational, environmental and public safety needs.\n       (2) Americans desire to affirm common responsibilities and \n     shared values, and join together in positive experiences, \n     that transcend race, religion, gender, age, disability, \n     region, income, and education.\n       (3) Americans of all ages can improve their communities and \n     become better citizens through service to their communities.\n       (4) When youth participate in service activities and see \n     that they are able to improve the lives of others, the youth \n     feel better able to control their own lives in a positive \n     way, avoiding risky behaviors, strengthening their community \n     connections, and becoming more engaged in their own \n     education.\n       (5) When youth service is tied to learning objectives, that \n     service is shown to decrease alienation and behavior \n     problems, and increase knowledge of community needs, \n     commitment to an ethic of service, and understanding of \n     politics and morality.\n       (6) When service is tied to what students are learning in \n     school, the students make gains on achievement tests, \n     complete their homework more often, and increase their grade \n     point averages.\n       (7) Students who engage in service-learning improve their \n     communication skills, increase their awareness of career \n     possibilities, have a deeper understanding of social and \n     economic issues that face the United States, and develop more \n     positive workplace attitudes, preparing them to take their \n     places as future leaders of the United States.\n       (8) In a national poll, more than 80 percent of parents \n     said that their child would benefit from an after school \n     program that offered community service and 95 percent of \n     teens agreed that is important to volunteer time to community \n     efforts.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) offer youth the chance to spend a summer in service to \n     their communities as a rite of passage before high school;\n       (2) teach civic participation skills to youth and help \n     youth see themselves as resources and leaders for their \n     communities;\n       (3) expand educational opportunities and discourage \n     ``summer slide'' by engaging youth in summer service-learning \n     opportunities;\n       (4) encourage youth, regardless of age, income, or \n     disability, to engage in community service;\n       (5) provide tangible benefits to the communities in which \n     Summer of Service programs are performed; and\n       (6) enhance the social-emotional development of youth of \n     all backgrounds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the people of Maine have always been \nfaithful stewards of the forest because we understand its tremendous \nvalue to our economy and to our way of life. From the vast tracts of \nundeveloped land in the north to the small woodlots in the south, \nforest land has helped to shape the character of our entire State.\n  While our commitment to stewardship has preserved the forest for \ngenerations, there is a threat to Maine's working landscape that \nrequires a fresh approach. This threat is suburban sprawl, which has \nalready consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest land in southern \nMaine. Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forest or farm land \ncannot compete with the value of developed land.\n  Sprawl threatens our environment and our quality of life. It destroys \neco-systems, increasing the risk of flooding and other environmental \nhazards. It burdens the infrastructure of the affected communities, \nincreases traffic on neighborhood streets, and wastes taxpayer money. \nSprawl causes the unnecessary fragmentation of open space that reduces \nthe economic viability of the remaining working forests.\n  In the State of Maine, suburban sprawl has already consumed tens of \nthousands of acres of forest and farm land. The problem is particularly \nacute in southern Maine where an 108 percent increase in urbanized land \nover the past two decades has resulted in the labeling of greater \nPortland as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''\n  I am particularly alarmed by the amount of working forest and farm \nland and open space in southern and coastal Maine that has given way to \nstrip malls and cul-de-sacs. Once these forests, farms, and meadows are \nlost to development, they are lost forever.\n  Maine is trying to respond to this challenge. The people of Maine \ncontinue to contribute their time and money to preserve important lands \nand to support our State's 88 land trusts. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to help support these State and community-based efforts.\n  For these reasons, I have introduced the Suburban and Community \nForestry and Open Space Program Act. This legislation, which was \ndrafted with the advice of land owners and conservation groups, \nestablishes a $50 million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service \nto support locally driven land conservation projects that preserve \nworking forests. Local government and nonprofit organizations would \ncompete for funds to purchase land or access to land to protect working \nlandscapes threatened by development.\n  Projects funded under this initiative must be targeted at lands \nlocated in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. In \naddition, this legislation requires that Federal grant funds be matched \ndollar-for-dollar by State, local, or private resources.\n  This is a market-driven program that relies upon market forces rather \nthan government regulations to achieve its objectives. Rather than \npreserving our working forests, farmland and open spaces by zoning or \nother government regulation, with this program we will provide the \nresources to allow a landowner who wishes to keep his or her land as a \nworking woodlot to do so.\n  My legislation also protects the rights of property owners with the \ninclusion of a ``willing-seller'' provision, which requires the consent \nof a landowner if a parcel of land is to participate in the program.\n  The $50 million that would be authorized by my bill would help \nachieve stewardship objectives: First, this bill would help prevent \nforest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to maintain \nthe supply of timber that fuels Maine's most significant industry. \nSecond, these resources would be a valuable tool for communities that \nare struggling to manage growth and prevent sprawl.\n  Understanding that land ownership issues differ in other parts of the \nNation, I have included a geographic limitation in this bill. This \nlimitation would exempt any State where the Federal Government owns 25 \npercent or more of that State's land from the Suburban and Community \nForestry and Open Space Program. With the 25 percent limitation, a \nfigure used in previous bills, the twelve States with the highest \npercentage of federally owned land would not be eligible to participate \nin this new program. Those\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nStates, however, who are struggling most with the loss of working \nlandscapes would be authorized to receive Federal assistance in their \nefforts to combat sprawl.\n\n  Third, the bill would help to preserve open space and family farms. \nCurrently, if the town of Gorham, ME, or another community trying to \ncope with the effects of sprawl turned to the Federal Government for \nassistance, none would be found. My bill will change that by making the \nFederal Government an active partner in preserving forest and farm land \nand managing sprawl, while leaving decision-making at the State and \nlocal level where it belongs.\n  The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Program Act has \nhad a successful history in the Senate. In 2002, this legislation was \nincluded in the forestry title of the Senate approved version of the \nFarm Bill. Unfortunately, the forestry title was stripped out of the \nFarm Bill conference report. And again, in 2003, this legislation \npassed the Senate. This time, during consideration of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act. Unfortunately, this provision was removed from \nthe Healthy Forests Restoration Act conference report. This new \nCongress and the reauthorization of the Farm Bill provide an excellent \nopportunity to enact this important legislation.\n  There is great work being done on the local level to protect working \nlandscapes for the next generation. By enacting the Suburban and \nCommunity Forestry and Open Space Act, Congress can provide an \nadditional avenue of support for these conservation initiatives, help \nprevent sprawl, and help sustain the vitality of natural resource-based \nindustries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1132. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nIndian tribes to receive charitable contributions of apparently \nwholesome food; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhelp increase the amount of food donations going to American Indians \nand Alaska Natives nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, the poverty rate among American Indians and Alaska \nNatives continues to be high. Specifically, the poverty rate for our \nNation's American Indians and Alaska Natives is over three times that \nof non-Hispanic whites, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Not only \ndo natives face greater challenges in securing basic household \nnecessities, but in securing food as well.\n  According to a 2005 U.S. Department of Agriculture report, 35.1 \nmillion Americans face challenges in getting enough food to eat. This \nincludes 12.4 million children. Of these statistics, Natives constitute \na disproportionate number due to the higher poverty rate among this \ngroup.\n  And yet, charitable organizations that provide hunger relief are \nunable to meet the basic needs of Natives due to an oversight in the \nfederal tax code. Section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows \ncorporations to take an enhanced tax deduction for donations of food; \nhowever, the food must be distributed to 501(c)(3) nonprofit \norganizations, such as food banks. Nonprofit organizations cannot then \ntransfer such donations to tribes. Although many donations to tribes \nare tax deductible under section 7871 of the Internal Revenue Code, \ntribes are not among the organizations listed under Section 501(c)(3) \nof the Internal Revenue Code. To clarify, section 170(e)(3) does not \nallow tribes to be eligible recipients of corporate food donations to \nnonprofit organizations since they are not listed under Section \n501(c)(3) as an eligible entity.\n  With this legislation, I intend to make a simple correction to the \ntax code that clearly indicates that tribes are eligible recipients of \nfood donated under section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This \ncorrection is long overdue and would remedy an egregious inequity in \nthe Federal tax code that affects natives nationwide.\n  Please allow me to provide a few examples of how this legislation \ncould foster positive change. In Alaska, approximately half of the food \ndonated to the Food Bank of Alaska from corporations could go to tribes \nthroughout Alaska. Much of this food would go to villages that are only \naccessible by air or water. In South Dakota, roughly 30 percent of the \nfood the Community Food Banks of South Dakota distributes could go to \nreservations. In North Dakota, the amount of food donated to the Great \nPlains Food Bank could double if this legislation were enacted. The \nMontana Food Bank Network projects that food donations could increase \nby 16 percent. A food bank based in Albuquerque, NM, estimates that \ntheir food donations could triple in the first year alone.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue expeditiously. \nThe health and well-being of low income American Indians and Alaska \nNatives across the Nation is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional protections for recipients of \nthe earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Taxpayer \nAbuse Prevention Act. Earned income tax credit (EITC) benefits intended \nfor working families are significantly reduced by the use of refund \nanticipation loans (RALs), which typically carry three or four digit \ninterest rates. In 2005, EITC filers accounted for more than half of \nthe refund anticipation loans issued despite being only 17 percent of \nthe taxpayer population. EITC recipients lost an estimated $649 million \nin loan fees plus application or documentation fees in 2005. The EITC \nis intended to help working families meet their food, clothing, \nhousing, transportation, and education needs. Working families cannot \nafford to lose a significant portion of their EITC funds by expensive, \nshort-term, RALs.\n  The interest rates and fees charged on RALs are not justified because \nof the short length of time that these loans are outstanding and the \nminimal risk they present. These loans carry little risk because of the \nDebt Indicator program.\n  The Debt Indicator (DI) is a service provided by the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) that informs the lender whether or not an applicant owes \nFederal or State taxes, child support, student loans, or other \ngovernment obligations, which assists tax preparers in ascertaining the \nability of applicants to obtain their full refund so that the RAL is \nrepaid. The Department of the Treasury should not be facilitating these \npredatory loans that allow tax preparers to reap outrageous profits by \nexploiting working families.\n  Unfortunately too many working families are susceptible to predatory \nlending because they are left out of the financial mainstream. Between \n25 and 56 million adults are unbanked, or not using mainstream, insured \nfinancial institutions. The unbanked rely on alternative financial \nservice providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills,\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nsend remittances, utilize payday loans, and obtain credit. Many of the \nunbanked are low-and moderate-income families that can ill afford to \nhave their earnings unnecessarily diminished by high-cost and often \npredatory financial services. In addition, the unbanked are unable to \nsave securely to prepare for the loss of a job, a family illness, a \ndown payment on a first home, or education expenses.\n  My legislation will protect consumers against predatory loans, reduce \nthe involvement of the Department of the Treasury in facilitating the \nexploitation of taxpayers, and expand access to opportunities for \nsaving and lending at mainstream financial services.\n  My bill prohibits refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC \nbenefits. Other Federal benefits, such as Social Security, have similar \nrestrictions to ensure that the beneficiaries receive the intended \nbenefit.\n  My bill also limits several of the objectionable practices of RAL \nproviders. It will prohibit lenders from using tax refunds to collect \noutstanding obligations for previous RALs. In addition, mandatory \narbitration clauses for RALs that utilize federal tax refunds would be \nprohibited to ensure that consumers have the ability to take future \nlegal action if necessary.\n  It is troubling that the Department of the Treasury facilitates \nrefund anticipation loans. In 1995, the use of the DI was suspended \nbecause of massive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. The use of the \nDI was reinstated in 1999. Use of the Debt Indicator should once again \nbe stopped. The DI is helping tax preparers make excessive profits from \nlow- and moderate-income taxpayers who utilize RALs. The IRS should not \naide unscrupulous preparers who take the earned benefit away from low-\nincome families. My bill terminates the DI program. In addition, this \nbill removes the incentive to meet congressionally mandated electronic \nfiling goals by facilitating the exploitation of taxpayers. My bill \nwould exclude any electronically filed tax returns resulting in tax \nrefunds distributed by refund anticipation loans from being counted \ntowards the goal established by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998, which is to have at least 80 percent of all returns filed \nelectronically by 2007.\n  My bill also expands access to mainstream financial services. \nElectronic Transfer Accounts (ETA) are low-cost accounts at banks and \ncredit unions intended for recipients of certain federal benefit \npayments. Currently, ETAs are provided for recipients of other federal \nbenefits such as Social Security payments. My bill expands the \neligibility for ETAs to include EITC benefits. These accounts will \nallow taxpayers to receive direct deposit refunds into an account \nwithout the need for a refund anticipation loan. Furthermore, my bill \nwould mandate that low- and moderate-income taxpayers be provided \nopportunities to open low-cost accounts at federally insured banks or \ncredit unions via appropriate tax forms. Providing taxpayers with the \noption of opening a bank or credit union account through the use of tax \nforms provides an alternative to RALs and immediate access to financial \nopportunities found at banks and credit unions.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Bingaman and Durbin for \ncosponsoring this legislation. I also appreciate the efforts of \nRepresentative Jan Schakowsky who will be reintroducing the companion \nlegislation in the other body. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that will \nrestrict predatory RALs and expand access to mainstream financial \nservices.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The purpose of \nthe Fair Arbitration Act of 2007, like my earlier proposals, is to \nimprove the Federal Arbitration Act so that it will remain a cost-\neffective means of resolving disputes, but will do so in a fair way. \nThe Fair Arbitration Act will provide procedural protections to \neveryone who enters into a contract with an arbitration clause. This \nbill ensures that consumers, employees, and small businesses that enter \ninto contracts covered by the Federal Arbitration Act will have their \ndisputes resolved in accordance with fundamental principles of due \nprocess, and in a speedy and cost-effective manner.\n  Congress originally enacted the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925. It \nhas served us well for over three-quarters of a century. Under the Act, \nif the parties agree to a contract affecting interstate commerce that \ncontains a clause requiring arbitration, the clause will be enforceable \nin court. In short, the Federal Arbitration Act allows parties to a \ncontract to agree not to take their disputes to court, but to resolve \nany dispute arising from that contract before a neutral decision-maker, \ngenerally selected by a nonprofit arbitration organization, such as the \nAmerican Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum. The \nparties can generally present evidence and be represented by counsel. \nAnd the decision-makers will apply the relevant State law in resolving \nthe dispute. Arbitration is generally quicker and less expensive than \ngoing to court.\n  In recent years, there have been some cases where the arbitration \nprocess has not worked well, but thousands of disputes have been fairly \nand effectively settled by arbitrators. Such a system is even more \nimportant because of skyrocketing legal costs where attorneys require \nlarge contingency fees. Accordingly, I have opposed piecemeal \nlegislative changes to the act. Instead, I believe that the Senate \nshould approach the Federal Arbitration Act in a comprehensive manner.\n  The approach of reforming arbitration rather than abandoning the \narbitration process provides a better solution in several respects. \nArbitration is one of the most cost-effective means of resolving \ndisputes. Unlike businesses, consumers and employees generally cannot \nafford a team of lawyers to represent them. And their claims are often \nnot big enough so that a lawyer would take the case on a 25 percent or \neven a 50 percent contingent fee. In a 1998 article in the Columbia \nHuman Rights Law Review, Lewis Maltby, then the Director of the \nNational Task Force on Civil Liberties in the Workplace of the American \nCivil Liberties Union and a Director of the American Arbitration \nAssociation, explained how court litigation is often just too expensive \nfor most employees:\n\n       Even if the client has clearly been wronged and is \n     virtually certain to prevail in court, the attorney will be \n     forced to turn down the case unless there are substantial \n     damages. A survey of plaintiff employment lawyers found that \n     a prospective plaintiff needed to have a minimum of $60,000 \n     in provable damages not including pain and suffering or other \n     intangible damages before an attorney would take the case.\n       Even this, however, does not exhaust the financial \n     obstacles an employee must overcome to secure representation. \n     In light of their risk of losing such cases, many plaintiffs' \n     attorneys require a prospective client to pay a retainer, \n     typically about $3,000. Others require clients to pay out-of-\n     pocket expenses of the case as they are incurred. Expenses in \n     employment discrimination cases can be substantial. Donohue \n     and Siegelman found that expenses in Title VII cases are at \n     least $10,000 and can reach as high as $25,000. Finally, some \n     plaintiffs' attorneys now require a consultation fee, \n     generally $200-$300, just to discuss their situation with a \n     potential client.\n       The result of these formidable hurdles is that most people \n     with claims against their employer are unable to obtain \n     counsel, and thus never receive justice. Paul Tobias, founder \n     of the National Employment Lawyers' Association, has \n     testified that ninety-five percent of those who seek help \n     from the private bar with an employment matter do not obtain \n     counsel. Howard's survey of plaintiffs' lawyers produced the \n     same result. A Detroit firm reported that only one of eighty-\n     seven employees who came to them seeking representation was \n     accepted as a client.\n\n  Without arbitration, consumers and employees are faced with having to \npay a lawyer's hourly rate, which may amount to several thousand \ndollars to litigate a claim in court. If that is what consumers and \nemployees are left with, many will have no choice but to drop their \nclaim. That is not right. It is not fair. Thus, Professor Stephen Ware \nof the Cumberland Law School stated in a paper published by the CATO \nInstitute that ``current [arbitration] law is better for all consumers \n[than an exemption from the Federal Arbitration Act] except those few \nwho are especially likely to have large liability claims. . . .''\n  Thus, while some have argued that the Congress should enact \nexemptions from the Federal Arbitration Act for different classes of \ncontracts from automobile franchise contracts to employment contracts \nto chicken farmers, such exemptions would not help the overwhelming \nmajority of the people who could not afford a lawyer to litigate in \ncourt. This is where arbitration can give consumers and employees a \ncost-effective forum to assert their claims. Thus, before we make \nexceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act for special interests with \nfriends in Washington, I think it is our duty to consider how we can \nimprove the system for everyone.\n  We can improve the arbitration system, but we must take a balanced \napproach. In such an approach, we must protect the sanctity of legal \ncontracts explicitly protected under Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. \nConstitution. In any contract, the parties must agree to all the terms \nand clauses included in the contract document. This includes the \narbitration clause. This is basic contract law, and the basic premise \nof the Federal Arbitration Act for over 75 years.\n  Unfortunately, however, in certain situations consumers, employees, \nand small businesses have not been treated fairly. That is what the \nFair Arbitration Act is designed to correct.\n  The bill will maintain the cost savings of binding arbitration, but \nwill grant several specific ``due process'' rights to all parties to an \narbitration proceeding. The bill is modeled after consumer and employee \ndue process protocols of the American Arbitration Association, which \nhave broad support. The bill provides the following rights:\n  1. Notice. Under the bill, to be enforceable, an arbitration clause \nwould have to have a heading in large, bold print, would have to state \nwhether arbitration is binding or optional, identify a source that the \nparties may contact for more information, and state that a consumer \ncould opt out to small claims court.\n  This will ensure, for example, that consumers who receive credit card \nnotices in the mail will not miss an arbitration clause because it is \nlost in the ``fine print.'' Further, it would give all parties a means \nto obtain more information on how to resolve any disputes. Finally, the \nclause would explain that if a party's claims could otherwise be \nbrought in small claims court, the party would be free to do so. Small \nclaims court, unlike regular trial court, provides another inexpensive \nand quick means of dispute resolution.\n  2. Independent selection of arbitrators. The bill grants all parties \nthe right to have potential arbitrators disclose relevant information \nconcerning their business ties and employment. All parties to the \narbitration will have an equal voice in selecting a neutral arbitrator. \nThis ensures that the large company who sold a consumer a product will \nnot select the arbitrator itself, because the consumer with a grievance \nwill have the right to nominate potential arbitrators, too. As a \nresult, the\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\nfinal arbitrator selected will have to have the explicit approval of \nboth parties to the dispute. This helps ensure that the arbitrator will \nbe a neutral party with no allegiance to either party.\n  3. Choice of law. The bill grants the non-drafting party, usually the \nconsumer or the employee, the right to have the arbitrator governed by \nthe substantive law that would apply under conflicts of laws principles \napplicable in the forum in which the non-drafting party resided at the \ntime the contract was entered into. This means that the substantive \ncontract law that would apply in a court where the consumer, employee, \nor business resides at the time of making the contract will apply in \nthe arbitration. Thus, in a dispute arising from the purchase of a \nproduct by an Alabama consumer from an Illinois company, a court would \nhave to determine whether Alabama or Illinois law applied by looking to \nthe language of the contract and to the place where the contract was \nentered into. The bill ensures that an arbitrator would use the same \nconflict of laws principles that a court would in determining whether \nAlabama or Illinois law would govern the arbitration proceedings.\n\n  4. Representation. The bill grants all parties the right to be \nrepresented by counsel at their own expense. Thus, if the claim \ninvolves complicated legal issues, consumers, employees, or small \nbusinesses would be free to have their lawyer represent him in the \narbitration. Such representation should be substantially less expensive \nthan a trial in court because of the more abbreviated and expedited \nprocess of arbitration.\n  5. Hearing. The bill grants all parties the right to a fair hearing \nin a forum that is reasonably convenient to the consumer or employee. \nThis would prevent a large company from requiring consumers, employees, \nor small business owners to travel across the country to arbitrate \ntheir claim and to expend more in travel costs than their claim is \npotentially worth.\n  6. Evidence. The bill grants all parties the right to conduct \ndiscovery and to present evidence. This ensures that the arbitrator can \nhave all the facts before making a decision.\n  7. Cross examination. The bill grants all parties the right to cross \nexamine witnesses presented by the other party at the hearing. This \nallows a party to test the statements of the other party's witnesses \nand be sure that the evidence before the arbitrator is correct.\n  8. Record. The bill grants all parties the right to hire a \nstenographer or tape record the hearing to produce a record. This right \nis key to proving later whether the arbitration proceeding was fair.\n  9. Timely resolution. The bill grants all parties the right to have \nan arbitration proceeding completed promptly so that they do not have \nto wait for a year or more to have their claim resolved. Under the \nbill, a defendant must file an answer not more than 30 days of the \nfiling of the complaint. The arbitrator has 90 days after the answer to \nhold a hearing. The arbitrator must render a final decision within 30 \ndays after the hearing. Extensions are available in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  10. Written decision. The bill grants all parties the right to a \nwritten decision by the arbitrator explaining the resolution of the \ncase and his reasons therefor. If the consumer or employee takes a \nclaim to arbitration, he deserves to have an explanation of why he won \nor lost.\n  11. Expenses. The bill grants all parties the right to have an \narbitrator provide for reimbursement of arbitration fees in the \ninterests of justice and the reduction, deferral, or waiver of \narbitration fees in cases of extreme hardship. It does little good to \ntake a claim to arbitration if the consumer or employee cannot even \nafford the arbitration fee. This provision ensures that the arbitrator \ncan waive or reduce the fee or make the company reimburse the consumer \nor employee for a fee if the interests of justice so require.\n  12. Small claims opt-out. The bill grants all parties the right to \nopt out of arbitration into small claims court if that court has \njurisdiction over the claim and the claim does not exceed $50,000.\n  The bill also provides an effective mechanism for parties to enforce \nthese rights. At any time, if a consumer or employee believes that \nanother party violated his or her rights, the consumer or employee can \nrequest and the arbitrator may award a penalty up to the amount of the \nclaim plus attorneys fees. For example, if a defendant party failed to \nprovide discovery to a plaintiff party, the plaintiff could move for an \naward of fees. The amount of the fee award is limited, as it is in \ncourt, to the amount of cost incurred by the employee in trying to \nobtain the information from the company. This principle is taken from \nRule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After the decision, if \nthe losing party believes that the rights granted to him by the Act \nhave been violated, it may file a petition with the Federal district \ncourt. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the \nlosing party's rights were violated, it may order a new arbitrator \nappointed. Thus, if a consumer, employee, or small business has an \narbitrator that is unfair and this causes him to lose the case, the \nplaintiff can obtain another arbitrator.\n  This bill is an important step to continuing a constructive dialog on \narbitration. This bill will ensure that those who can least afford to \ngo to court can go to a less expensive arbitrator and be treated \nfairly. It will ensure that every arbitration carried out under the \nFederal Arbitration Act is completed fairly, promptly, and \neconomically. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to ensure that consumers, employees, and small businesses who \nagree in a contract to arbitrate their claims will be treated fairly \nunder the Federal Arbitration Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill authorize grants to carry out projects to provide \neducation on preventing teen pregnancies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teen \nPregnancy Prevention Responsibility and Opportunity Act, legislation \nthat creates a comprehensive approach to fighting teen pregnancy and \ngiving young people the support they need to make informed decisions.\n  The results of a 1997 congressionally-ordered study were released \nthis month. The 6-year study found that youth who participate in \nabstinence education programs are no more or less likely to engage in \nsex than those who do not participate in abstinence education programs. \nBoth groups are reported to have similar numbers of sexual partners, \nand to have sex for the first time at about the same age; around 15 \nyears old. This proves that abstinence-only education isn't working.\n  But rather than invest in proven programs, the Bush administration \ncontinues to insist on a narrow-minded, misguided approach of \nabstinence-only education. As this study demonstrates, abstinence-only \njust doesn't cut it. The United States continues to have the highest \nteen-pregnancy rate and teen birth rate in the western industrialized \nworld. In a human context, this impacts one-third of all teenage girls. \nIn a fiscal context, these unintended pregnancies cost the United \nStates at least $9 billion annually despite Federal appropriations of \nabout $176 million a\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\nyear towards promoting abstinence until marriage.\n  American taxpayers deserve a better rate of return on their \ninvestment. American youth deserve quality education, positive role \nmodels, effective after school programs, employment opportunities, and \nmedically and scientifically accurate family life education. The time \nis now for a new direction in sex education.\n  Adolescents need to know we care. They need to know we care as \nparents, as educators, as business people, as politicians, and as \nhealthcare providers. They need to know we want them to become \nsuccessful contributing members of society, but for that to happen we \nmust commit to and invest in them. We need to be opening doors for \nthese young people, and that is just what my Teen Pregnancy Prevention, \nResponsibility and Opportunity Act will do.\n  The Teen Pregnancy Prevention, Responsibility and Opportunity Act \nwill establish a comprehensive program for reducing adolescent \npregnancy through education and information programs, as well as \npositive activities and role models both in school and out of school.\n  While we have done a good job of progressively decreasing teen \npregnancy, we can do better. With the sons of teen mothers more likely \nto end up in prison, and the daughters of teen mothers more likely to \nend up teen mothers themselves, we must act now to break this \nproblematic cycle.\n  The time is now to make a real difference in the lives of our youth, \nand to give them the support they need to grow and lead positive lives.\n  Our schools, community and faith-based organizations need access to \nfunds to teach age-appropriate, factually and medically accurate, and \nscientifically-based family life education.\n  We need programs that encourage teens to delay sexual activity.\n  We need to provide services and interventions for sexually active \nteens.\n  We need to educate both young men and women about the \nresponsibilities and pressures that come along with parenting.\n  We need to help parents communicate with teens about sexuality.\n  We need to teach young people responsible decision-making.\n  And, we need to fund after school programs that will enrich their \neducation, and offer character and counseling services.\n  We know that after school programs reduce risky adolescent behavior \nby involving teens in positive activities that also provide positive \nlife skills. Teenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more \nlikely to wait to become sexually active, and to have fewer partners. \nThey are consequently less likely to become pregnant.\n  Let us join together to recommit ourselves to continuing to decrease \nthe incidence of teen pregnancy, and recommit ourselves to offering \nfamily life education and positive after school programs that will \nfoster responsible young adults.\n  The time is now to invest in our teens. We cannot afford to let doors \nclose on them. Instead we must continue to open the door of \nopportunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4617-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4617-S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 150--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \nTO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK, MAY 7 THROUGH 13, \n                                  2007\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Carper, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Lautenberg) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 150\n\n       Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an \n     opportunity to recognize the important contributions of \n     public servants and honor the diverse men and women who meet \n     the needs of the Nation through work at all levels of \n     government;\n       Whereas millions of individuals work in government service \n     in every city, county, and State across America and in \n     hundreds of cities abroad;\n       Whereas public service is a noble calling involving a \n     variety of challenging and rewarding professions;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local governments are \n     responsive, innovative, and effective because of the \n     outstanding work of public servants;\n       Whereas the United States of America is a great and \n     prosperous Nation, and public service employees contribute \n     significantly to that greatness and prosperity;\n       Whereas the Nation benefits daily from the knowledge and \n     skills of these highly trained individuals;\n       Whereas public servants--\n       (1) provide vital strategic support functions to our \n     military and serve in the National Guard and Reserves;\n       (2) fight crime and fire;\n       (3) ensure equal access to secure, efficient, and \n     affordable mail service;\n       (4) deliver social security and medicare benefits;\n       (5) fight disease and promote better health;\n       (6) protect the environment and the Nation's parks;\n       (7) enforce laws guaranteeing equal employment \n     opportunities and healthy working conditions;\n       (8) defend and secure critical infrastructure;\n       (9) help the Nation recover from natural disasters and \n     terrorist attacks;\n       (10) teach and work in our schools and libraries;\n       (11) develop new technologies and explore the earth, moon, \n     and space to help improve our understanding of how our world \n     changes;\n       (12) improve and secure our transportation systems;\n       (13) keep the Nation's economy stable; and\n       (14) defend our freedom and advance United States interests \n     around the world;\n       Whereas members of the uniformed services and civilian \n     employees at all levels of government make significant \n     contributions to the general welfare of the United States, \n     and are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism and \n     in maintaining homeland security;\n       Whereas public servants work in a professional manner to \n     build relationships with other countries and cultures in \n     order to better represent America's interests and promote \n     American ideals;\n       Whereas public servants alert Congress and the public to \n     government waste, fraud, abuse, and dangers to public health;\n       Whereas the men and women serving in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States, as well as those skilled trade and craft \n     Federal employees who provide support to their efforts, are \n     committed to doing their jobs regardless of the \n     circumstances, and contribute greatly to the security of the \n     Nation and the world;\n       Whereas public servants have bravely fought in armed \n     conflict in defense of this Nation and its ideals and deserve \n     the care and benefits they have earned through their \n     honorable service;\n       Whereas government workers have much to offer, as \n     demonstrated by their expertise and innovative ideas, and \n     serve as examples by passing on institutional knowledge to \n     train the next generation of public servants;\n       Whereas May 7 through 13, 2007, has been designated Public \n     Service Recognition Week to honor America's Federal, State, \n     and local government employees; and\n       Whereas Public Service Recognition Week is celebrating its \n     23rd anniversary through job fairs, student activities, and \n     agency exhibits: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends public servants for their outstanding \n     contributions to this great Nation during Public Service \n     Recognition Week and throughout the year;\n       (2) salutes their unyielding dedication and spirit for \n     public service;\n       (3) honors those government employees who have given their \n     lives in service to their country;\n       (4) calls upon a new generation to consider a career in \n     public service as an honorable profession; and\n       (5) encourages efforts to promote public service careers at \n     all levels of government.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution to \nhonor Federal, State, and local government employees during Public \nService Recognition Week. I am proud to be joined in this effort by \nSenators Voinovich, Lieberman, Collins, Levin, Stevens, Carper, Warner, \nand Lautenberg and by Representative Danny Davis, chairman of the House \nFederal Workforce Subcommittee, who is submitting this resolution in \nthe House.\n  We all recognize the important work performed by public servants and \nthe impact they have on all of our lives. Over hundreds of years, our \ncountry has grown and prospered due in large part to the dedication of \npublic servants at all levels of government. Each day public servants, \nin small and large ways, work to maintain, and in many cases enhance, \nthe quality of our lives.\n  Whether they are saving lives as firefighters, police officers, or \nmembers of the Coast Guard; preserving our environment by patrolling \nparks, discovering new ways to live ``green,'' or\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\nworking at wastewater treatment plants; working to improve government \nservices by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse; or working to keep our \nNation safe as members of our armed forces or as diplomats, public \nservants perform duties with excellence and professionalism that \nAmericans rely on every day.\n  Public Service Recognition Week is a great occasion to draw attention \nto and underscore the valuable contributions of those who dedicate \nthemselves to public service. For more than 20 years, the Nation has \nparticipated in a week-long celebration to highlight their \nachievements. This year, the 23rd annual Public Service Recognition \nWeek will take place May 7-13, 2007. State and Federal agencies across \nthe Nation plan to host activities to honor their achievements and \nimprove public understanding of their contributions.\n  As the Federal Government is facing what the Office of Personnel \nManagement calls a retirement tsunami, Public Service Recognition Week \nalso provides an opportunity for the Federal Government to showcase the \nrewarding and challenging careers in the public sector and inspire a \nnew generation of public servants. Working for the public good is a \nhigh and noble calling, and this annual celebration is the perfect \nopportunity for Federal agencies to recruit new employees.\n  I want to thank all public employees for the work they do day after \nday to make government effective, and I urge my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join in Federal, State, and local celebrations and \nrecognize the outstanding contributions made by public servants to our \ndaily lives. I ask my colleagues for their support for this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/17/senate-section/article/S4618-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 151--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING COWGIRLS \n   FOR THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY IN THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION \n                               TOURNAMENT\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 152) honoring the lifetime \n     achievements of Jackie Robinson.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor \nthe legacy and achievements of Jackie Robinson.\n  On Sunday, over 200 Major League players, manager, and coaches took \nto baseball fields across the Nation wearing Jackie Robinson's No. 42, \nwhich was retired throughout Major League Baseball in 1997. Sixty years \nago, on April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first African-\nAmerican to play in a Major League Baseball game.\n  The first athlete to letter in four sports in 1 year at the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, Jackie Robinson seemed \ndestined to make a name for himself. He began his baseball career in \nthe Negro Leagues, playing shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs. In \n1946, Jackie Robinson played for the Montreal Royals, leading the \nInternational League in batting average with a .349 average, and \nfielding percentage with a .985 percent. He began his major league \ncareer at the age of 28 playing first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers--\nthe only position that was open.\n  That year, he was named Rookie of the Year. In 1948, he was moved to \nsecond base and went on to lead the Dodgers to six National League \npennants in 10 years and a World Series championship. His inspiring \ncareer earned him recognition as the first African-American to win a \nbatting title, lead the league in stolen bases, play in an All-Star \ngame, play in the World Series, win a Most Valuable Player award, and \nbe elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1962.\n  Off the baseball diamond, Jackie Robinson lived a life of achievement \nthrough his work in the civil rights movement. In the business world, \nhe actively promoted Black enterprises in New York's Harlem \nneighborhood.\n  In March 1984, President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Jackie \nRobinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On October 29, 2003, \nCongress posthumously awarded Jackie Robinson the Congressional Gold \nMedal, the highest award Congress can bestow. His mission to expand \nopportunity for others continues today through the Jackie Robinson \nFoundation that has provided over $14.5 million in scholarships to \nstudents who might not otherwise be able to afford college tuition.\n  Jackie Robinson was a good friend of mine, and it is with great \nreverence that I introduce, today, a resolution with Senators Mark \nPryor and Mitch McConnell to honor and celebrate his achievements, \nrecognize his sacrifices, and remember his contributions to the Nation. \nHis courage and dignity taught the Nation about the strength of the \nhuman spirit when confronted with seemingly immovable obstacles. We can \nbest honor him by reflecting on the epigraph Robinson wrote for his own \ntombstone, ``The value of a life is measured by its impact on other \nlives.''\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
