Mr. President, I wish to put in the Record a statement by \nSenator Coleman. He would have voted aye if he had been here today. I \nask to have his statement printed in the Record.\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we are in the middle of an energy \ncrisis, and the only way we're going to get out of it is to \ndramatically transform how this country does energy.\n  That is what the Lieberman-Warner climate bill does--it takes on one \nof the greatest economic and national security threats America faces \ntoday: our energy insecurity.\n  Sometimes we must look around the mountain, we must look to our \nfuture and recognize where our path must lead. We must recognize that \nwe need massive and speedy development of domestically produced clean \nenergy sources.\n  If we had committed to this bill 10 years ago, we wouldn't be in the \ntight spot we find ourselves in right now. We needed carbon capture \ntechnology for coal, increased nuclear power, cellulosic ethanol, and \nwidespread renewable energy use yesterday.\n  This year, nearly half a trillion of our dollars will be sent \noverseas for energy we are capable of producing at home. The fact is, \nwe are being held hostage by a world oil market where much of the \nsupply is controlled by thugs and tyrants like Ahmadinejad and Chavez. \nBut, as we have found in Minnesota, we can grow our own fuel, and the \npotential of cellulosic ethanol to replace foreign oil makes today's \nrenewable fuels production look small, but it still hasn't reached \ncommercialization.\n  Meanwhile, nuclear energy is an affordable, zero-emissions source of \nenergy, yet we have not built a nuclear plant in this country in 30 \nyears.\n  And, due to environmental concerns, it is increasingly difficult to \nutilize one of our greatest sources of energy in the country: coal. We \nhave a 250 year supply of coal that we must find a way to use for \nenergy production because one thing is certain--America's energy needs \nare only increasing.\n  At the same time, we have abundant energy around us that has yet to \nbe tapped. When I am fishing on a beautiful morning up in Lake Ada back \nhome, the sunshine and steady breeze are a constant reminder of the \nrenewable resources that we can harness to power our homes and \nbusinesses.\n  The solutions to our energy woes are at our fingertips; it's time we \ngrabbed hold of the great opportunity at hand and lead an energy \nrevolution that will be the source for future security and increased \nopportunity for generations to come.\n  But, we can't wait for this revolution to come to us. I am skeptical \nthat we are just going to wake up one day and see cellulosic ethanol at \nthe pump or see a nuclear energy renaissance or clean coal with carbon \nsequestration or widespread use of renewables, unless we take bold \naction.\n  Mr. President, that's what this bill is about.\n  The Climate Security Act empowers Americans to do what we must do, \nwhich is to transform our production of energy. It sets up a cap-and-\ntrade system, just as was done in the 1990 Clean Air Act to combat acid \nrain, that gives greenhouse gas producers flexibility in meeting their \nobligations through submission of allowances. Listening to some of the \ndebate over this last week, one might think this bill is a windfall for \nthe Federal Government, but what this bill really does is allocate \nthese allowances to help the folks regulated in their transition to \nclean energy and to help energy consumers, both families and businesses \nwith their energy costs. Just look at what happens in 2012, when the \ncap begins:\n  Over 38 percent of allowances are given out for free to fossil-fired \npower plants, energy consumers, natural gas and petroleum facilities, \ncarbon intensive manufacturing facilities, agriculture and forestry, \nand states that are manufacturing and coal reliant;\n  Another 36 percent of allowances go to states and emitters to \nincentivize clean energy deployment and carbon sequestration; and\n  The 25 percent of the allowances that the Government does ``auction'' \ngo to programs that invest in our energy future by doing things like \ndramatically boosting clean coal technology, clean energy research and \ndevelopment, and worker training assistance.\n  In particular, the bill provides record investment in clean coal, \nrenewables, and cellulosic ethanol, including: $17 billion of support \nfor carbon capture and storage technology for coal to kick start this \ntechnology, $120 billion in incentives for carbon capture and storage, \nand my CO2 pipeline study proposal; bonus allowances for \nrenewable energy that I have strongly supported; $150 billion for \nrenewable energy; $92 billion for low-carbon electricity technology; \nand $26 billion for production of cellulosic ethanol.\n  But there is no doubt in revolutionizing our energy production, a \ntransition will be required that won't come easy. That's why, from the \ntime I cosponsored the first Lieberman-Warner proposal, I made clear \nthat as we work on this legislation, we have to keep in mind the single \nmother in St. Paul working two jobs who can't afford higher energy \nprices and we must protect the economy and American jobs.\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\n  I compliment Senators Lieberman and Warner for taking these concerns \nto heart. This substitute makes several critical changes from earlier \ndrafts to assist poor and middle class families with energy prices and \nto protect jobs.\n  First, this substitute dramatically increases the resources dedicated \nto help consumers, both families and businesses, with energy costs--\nbringing the total assistance to $1.7 trillion. $800 million of this \namount is targeted at a tax cut for low income Americans' energy costs. \nMeanwhile, this substitute increases by 40 percent the funding that \nwill go to energy consumers through their utility bill, bringing this \nprovision's assistance total to $900 billion.\n\n  Secondly, this bill includes a new allowance trigger at between $22 \nand $30 per allowance that provides an important off-ramp should costs \nbecome high. This trigger is critical because economic consequences \nescalate when the price of an allowance increases.\n  Many of the high energy cost and GDP estimates cited on the floor \nthis week have been taken from an EPA study that assumes an allowance \nprice of at least $46 per allowance. Under this substitute, prices \nwon't be allowed to get anywhere near that level.\n  Finally, this bill places an allowance purchase requirement on \nimporters of products like steel, chemicals, and other energy intensive \nproducts if a commission does not find that the country of origin is \ntaking comparable action to curb greenhouse gases.\n  There is a lot of concern that this bill will increase energy prices \nand hurt the economy. You will hear many of my colleagues cite studies \nwith drastic cost increase numbers. While this substitute amendment, \nwith the protections I just outlined, has yet to be analyzed, I believe \nmuch of the economic pain projected in some studies is overstated--even \nwithout the off-ramp.\n  For instance, the independent Energy Information Agency found in \ntheir High Cost scenario that there is a predicted electricity price \nincrease of 1.5 percent a year and a gas price increase of 2 cents per \nyear. Meanwhile, EIA has projected less than half of one percent effect \non GDP--again, this is before the off-ramp.\n  I do want to commend Senators Lieberman and Warner for their work on \nthis bill--they deserve much credit for taking this on, for pouring \nthemselves into this very difficult, complex task--taking on one of the \ngreat challenges of our day.\n  That's why I am so disappointed that we won't have a chance to \nconsider this bill on the floor. Mr. President, the Clean Air Act took \n5 weeks, we have been given less than 5 days on a much more \ncomprehensive piece of legislation. The process set up here robs us of \nan opportunity to take our energy crisis head on.\n  I have supported the Lieberman-Warner effort as a cosponsor, and I \ncontinue to support this bill, but I have always made clear that I \nwould work to improve the bill to protect Minnesota jobs. So, I have a \nfew amendments, some that I am introducing, some I am cosponsoring that \nsubstantively improve this bill--many of these changes are very small, \nbut the consequences of not including them will be very large in my \nstate.\n  Because of this process, I won't have the chance to offer my \namendment to create a fuel assistance fund that will lower Federal fuel \ntaxes by an amount equal to fuel price increases those driving cars and \ntrucks and riding on airplanes have to pay as a result from this bill. \nThis is an amendment to protect American consumers, it's common-sense, \nand it keeps the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust \nFund whole.\n  I won't have a chance to amend the bill to ensure that my state's \nmany waste-to-energy facilities are considered renewable. This is a \nsmall change, but without it, we could disadvantage an important clean \nenergy technology.\n  This bill needs a nuclear energy title. We need to boost tax \nincentives for nuclear power plants and improve the existing loan \nguarantee program. We need to train a workforce for the nuclear \nrenaissance that we'll need to meet our energy needs.\n  Meanwhile, we need to restore the transition assistance for rural \nelectric cooperatives that was included in earlier drafts of the bill, \nand we need to exempt steel process emissions as there is no feasible \ntechnological alternative to using carbon to produce iron ore. If these \nprocess emissions aren't excluded, we're going to send steel jobs \noverseas.\n  These amendments are designed to work within the structure of this \nbill, to augment it, to remove negative impacts that could hit \nMinnesotans--they deserve to be considered.\n  Mr. President, the challenge we face in solving our energy security \nproblems is great, but for the folks who don't think America can meet \nthis challenge, I would like to remind them of the fight we had over \nthe first Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, just a few years ago. I worked \nwith a bipartisan cast of colleagues to pass the first RFS in 2005, and \nat the time, it was criticized as onerous and too ambitious.\n  We thought we were aiming high by passing a 7.5 billion gallon \nrenewable fuels requirement by 2012. Today, in 2008, we have the \nrenewable fuel production capacity of 8.5 billion gallons--we have far \nout surpassed expectations of production at the time.\n  Driving around Minnesota's countryside, I have witnessed the source \nof this overwhelming success--local entrepreneurs, innovators, and \nvisionaries. And, the Minnesotans who have built our renewable fuels \nindustry, which contributes over $5 billion to the State's economy, \nhave transformed their local economies. The government sent the market \na strong signal, and the American people responded.\n  Mr. President, the time for an energy revolution is long overdue. We \ncannot afford delay, and it is my hope that we will be provided the \ntime we need to consider and pass this critical bill in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Lieberman-\nWarner Climate Security Act. I am deeply grateful that we are at last \nbeginning to address an issue that goes to the heart of our security, \nour economy, our ingenuity and our leadership in the world: Climate \nchange.\n  Over the course of this debate, I have no doubt that some will \ncontinue to argue that the science of global warming remains \n``inconclusive''--that there is simply too much uncertainty to take any \nsort of action.\n  But before we even go into the science of global warming, let us \nconsider all that is quite certain today because of our dependence on \nfossil fuels.\n  We can start with our national security, which is compromised because \nwe import oil to the tune of $300 billion every year, much of it from \nthe most unstable countries in the world, a great many of whom are no \nfriends to America.\n  We can then examine how this dependence puts our economy at risk, as \nfamilies and businesses struggle with ever-rising gas prices that now \ntop $4 per gallon, impacting our economic security and competitiveness \nalike.\n  We can also look at the public health implications, as asthma rates \nsoar, disease spreads to new regions and the developing world \nexperiences increases in climate-sensitive diseases, such as malaria, \nmalnutrition--diseases that acutely threaten children.\n  There is also the rise in extreme weather incidents of Katrina-like \nferocity that have increasingly become not the exception but the rule.\n  And finally, we can reflect on our waning moral leadership in the \nworld, due at least in part because of this administration's stubborn \ninsistence on abandoning the Kyoto Protocol entirely.\n  They didn't propose ways for the United States to improve a flawed \nbut noble effort important to virtually every other nation in the \ncivilized world. Nor did they demonstrate any commitment whatsoever on \nour part to leading the world in alternative energy production.\n  Instead, they simply let the problem fall to the next administration. \nThey picked up their chair and went home.\n  Whatever else you think about the science of climate change, surely \nyou must agree that American families have paid a price for our failure \nto act on these many related issues.\n  But I would immediately add, on the fundamental question of whether \nclimate change is real and whether human actions are responsible, there \ncan be no debate.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Global Warming, an international panel \ncomposed of hundreds of the\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nmost respected scientists in the world, conducted a comprehensive study \nof available climate change data.\n  And what they found was unequivocal. The IPCC concluded that, and I \nquote, ``most of the observed increase in globally averaged \ntemperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the \nobserved increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.''\n  In plain English, virtually the entire scientific community agrees on \ntwo points--one, that temperatures are rising because of greenhouse gas \nemissions, and two, that such increases are caused by human activity.\n  And so, let us be very clear: global warming is real, and we are \ncausing it. It is not in question. And it is a very big problem for all \nof us.\n  Yet even still, some continue to push back. Some acknowledge the \nscience behind climate change but argue we cannot take action because \nof the threat it poses to our economy.\n  They present us with what I believe is a false choice:\n  That we can choose environmental responsibility or economic \nprosperity, but not both.\n  I completely and emphatically disagree.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels may pose some of our \nbiggest problems. But breaking that dependence offers us the single \ngreatest opportunity for a brighter, more secure future.\n  How is that possible?\n  Because if so many problems can stem from a single source--and in the \ncase of energy, they surely do--then it is only logical that if we deal \nwith that problem, we can begin meeting those challenges as well.\n  We can begin creating a stronger, more prosperous America that relies \nnot on politically fragile corners of the globe for its security, but \non the ingenuity of America's small businesses and university \nlaboratories.\n  A stronger, more prosperous America that uses its abundant economic \nresources not to perpetuate anti-American sentiment abroad but to \ncreate jobs here at home--from the construction of energy efficient \nbuildings and renewable energy power plants to an auto industry that \nbuilds cars that lead the world in fuel efficiency.\n  An America that charges not simply our cities with helping us achieve \nthese goals but also rural communities across the country. That is not \nonly a stronger, more prosperous America; it is one more Americans get \nto be a part of.\n  As such, I believe we can no longer wait to move to quickly reduce \nAmerica's greenhouse gas emissions in a comprehensive way. That is why \nI have supported cap-and-trade proposals in the past, and I will \ncontinue to do so, because they offer a way for America to begin \ntackling global warming.\n  But I believe there is a more promising solution that too often gets \nlost in these debates: A carbon tax, a fee placed on each ton of carbon \ndioxide emitted from fossil fuels.\n  Such a solution has been endorsed by everyone from NASA scientist \nJames Hansen and former Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers to \nconservative Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, President George W. \nBush's former chief economic advisor.\n  Even Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State, George Schulze, has voiced \nsupport for the idea. All agree it is the most efficient way to address \nthe climate problem.\n  The idea is simple. We already know how much carbon is emitted from \nthe burning of various fossil fuels, and we already collect the data we \nneed to figure out how much to tax each sale of fossil fuels. As such, \nall that we would need to do to impose a carbon tax is set a price for \na ton of carbon. That price would increase over time, leading to \ndecreased carbon emissions as the cost of using dirty fossil fuels \novertakes the cost of investing in clean, renewable technologies.\n  I know ``new taxes'' have been anathema to American politics for \nyears. But a carbon tax eliminates the last incentive there is to \npollute because it is cheaper.\n  A carbon tax would reduce carbon emissions much more efficiently than \na cap-and-trade program. The Congressional Budget Office said as much, \nfinding that ``available research suggests that in the near term, the \nnet benefits . . . of a tax could be roughly five times greater than \nthe net benefits of an inflexible cap.\n  Put another way, a given long-term emission-reduction target could be \nmet by a tax at a fraction of the cost of an inflexible cap-and-trade \nprogram.''\n  Why? Because a tax provides the kind of long-term predictability for \nthe price of emissions a carbon allowance would not. It allows \ncompanies to more effectively plan over the long-term how they could \nmost cost-effectively reduce emissions.\n  Additionally, a carbon tax could be much more easily administered and \noverseen than a cap-and-trade program because the administrative \ninfrastructure already exists to levy taxes on the upstream sources of \nfossil fuels, with their carbon contents known quantities as well.\n  Unlike cap and trade, which would require a complex new \nadministrative structure to oversee and regulate the carbon market, we \ndon't have to start from scratch.\n  In my view, a carbon tax is a critical piece of the debate over \nglobal warming, and I look forward to engaging with Chairwoman Boxer \nand my other colleagues in making part of this discussion. If for no \nother reason than the short window of time with which we have to \naddress this problem before it is too late, it must be.\n  Allow me also to briefly address some other issues raised by the \nLieberman-Warner bill.\n  I appreciate all that Chairwoman Boxer and her colleagues on the EPW \nCommittee have done to take care of low-income consumers who will \nstruggle with rising energy prices and the increased cost of consumer \ngoods. The steps taken in this bill are certainly a good start.\n  However, I am concerned that we could be delivering rebates to low-\nincome consumers more efficiently than we do in this legislation. \nAlready, nearly 3,000 of the 5,400 households in my State who qualify \nfor heating assistance are exhausting their benefits in the dead of \nwinter every year.\n  We cannot put seniors and low-income households in the position of \nhaving to stretch tight household budgets to the breaking point simply \nto heat their homes, drive to work and put food on the table.\n  I look forward to working with Chairwoman Boxer and others to make \nsure our most vulnerable citizens are taken care of, which I know is as \nhigh a priority for her as it is the rest of us.\n  Lastly, I want to say a word about public transportation which falls \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. Given that the \ntransportation sector is responsible for a third of all U.S. greenhouse \ngas emissions, clearly we need to direct significant resources toward \npublic transit, which reduces the number of cars on the road.\n  While I thank Chairwoman Boxer as well as Senators Lieberman and \nWarner for recognizing transit's importance in this bill, I do believe \nmore needs to be done, and I look forward to working with them to make \nthat possible.\n  Ultimately, I believe this bill represents an important first step \ntoward grappling with what may prove to be the defining challenge of \nour age. And if we meet this challenge, it could mean the difference \nbetween rural America being left behind by the 21st century economy or \nbecoming the engine that drives it.\n  It may be the difference between small businesses being burdened by \nenergy costs or finding innovative ways to drive them down.\n  It may well be our very best chance to give our children and \ngrandchildren the future of hope, prosperity, and optimism I know we \nall want to give them.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity, yield the floor, and look \nforward to this debate continuing in the coming weeks and months.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues some \nthoughts regarding how to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and \na few key benchmarks I believe should be included in a national \nstrategy to address this environmental and economic security challenge.\n  The scientific evidence linking the effects of man-made releases of \ncarbon dioxide and the warming of the Earth's climate is clear. In \n2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\nChange analyzed the science on climate change and concluded with high \nprobability that the Earth is dramatically warming and that the \natmospheric concentration of CO2 is at the highest level in \n400,000 years. To forestall the most significant effects of predicted \nchanges in the world's climate over the next 50 years, the United \nStates and other major emitting nations must begin to transition to a \nlow-carbon economy. Although South Dakota may avoid the direct \nconsequences of rising sea levels or more powerful storms caused by \nclimate change, in many other respects my State is vulnerable to \nchanges in the Earth's temperature. More frequent and severe droughts \nwould dramatically harm the State's economy. The loss of productive \nfarmland, denuded pastureland, and scarce ground and surface water \nsupplies are probable under the current scientific modeling on a \nwarming planet. The Prairie Pothole Region, which is partially located \nin my State, and is the most important duck and geese habitat in North \nAmerica, is threatened by the effects of climate change. These changes, \nif borne out in the next generation, would have significant and severe \neconomic consequences for my State.\n  Understanding clearly the probable environmental harm from taking no \naction, I support a mandatory, nationwide program that limits \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I have voted in support of a nationwide plan \npreviously because it is important to reach agreement and understanding \non the complicated legislative, regulatory and economic choices from a \nnationwide strategy.\n  With the strong, peer-reviewed scientific conclusions linking climate \nchange to human caused greenhouse gas emissions, the future uncertainty \nand cost of a nationwide program to reduce these emissions challenge \nour path to producing the optimal bill. We need to take strong steps \nwith an early no regrets policy of action. Over the longer-term, \naddressing this problem will require changes in how we produce and use \nenergy. It is realistic to expect such a plan to have costs. Transiting \nto lower carbon forms of energy production not yet commercially \ndeployable could increase the price of producing energy. Creating \npolicies and incentives that contain those costs over the next several \ndecades to lessen impacts to consumers is a key concern of mine.\n  A nationwide plan that caps greenhouse gas emissions must make room \nfor the expansion of traditional fossil fuel generation sources to meet \ngrowing energy demand. I am a strong supporter of renewable energy--\nbiofuels, wind and solar energy can and should make up an increasingly \ngreater share of our country's energy mix. I support a mandatory, \nnationwide renewable electricity standard to increase the amount of \nrenewable electricity produced from less than 5 percent currently to a \nrequirement of 15 percent in the next 10 years. However, we need the \nfull suite of energy resources and that includes natural gas and coal. \nIn my State, we have a diverse mix of energy resources, including \nhydropower, wind, natural gas and coal-fired generation. To keep that \navailable and cost-competitive mix of fuels, a mandatory greenhouse gas \nreduction program must be linked to an aggressive and dedicated source \nof funding for reducing the emissions from conventional energy sources. \nCarbon capture and sequester is a path forward to keep coal as a fuel \nsource, but reduce harmful CO2 emissions. Commercially \ndeployable CCS technology is not yet available. It will take several \nmore years and billions of dollars in research and testing to develop \nthe right types of CCS processes that separate CO2 from the \nemissions stream. Accordingly, it is important to try to link \nreductions from existing sources with the likely path of technology \ndevelopment. Is it possible to completely match up reduction targets \nwith technology development? Probably not. Technology develops at an \ninconsistently timed pace. Nonetheless, a plan that includes an \nunrealistically optimistic emissions reduction schedule that does not \nmeet up with the resources for next-generation emission reduction \ntechnologies will break the program and hamper our efforts to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Part of the solution to this challenge resides in ensuring that \nincumbent as well as new entrant fossil fuel generators can manage \nprice and emission reductions and have the resources to invest in new, \nlow-emitting technologies. Allowance distribution should, as one \nfactor, take into consideration historic emissions in allocating \nemission allowances. A limited and tightly controlled auction and other \ndistribution calculations can be incorporated into this framework, but \nif we don't get this part of the program right it could swamp our \nefforts in other parts of the economy to wring carbon from the \nproduction process.\n  The good news is that South Dakotans can bring our strengths to \ncontributing to the solution of a low carbon and economically strong \nAmerica. Farmers, ranchers and forestland owners can play an important \nrole in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture practices and \nland management decisions that sequester carbon dioxide are cheap and \nefficient ways to comply with the requirements of a nationwide and \nmandatory program. The use of limited offsets and the flexibility of \nproducers and landowners to get credit for past, current and future \naction target an incentive that eases costs for other sectors of the \neconomy while at the same time creating an income stream for rural \nAmerica. A ton of carbon sequestered, verified, and accounted is as \npowerful as reducing a ton of carbon from the smokestack of an electric \nutility or the smelter from a manufacturing facility. There is a strong \ncoalition of Senators who believe that a vigorous offset program should \nbe part of a comprehensive climate bill. Properly administered, offsets \nlower costs and improve compliance which is why I am confident that \nsuch a plan strengthens the objectives of a low carbon economy.\n  Mr. President, I feel confident the Congress can come together and \naddress these challenges. Those deniers of the problem who throw up \nobstacles and simply say no to any and all avenues for action will find \nthemselves increasingly marginalized and ineffective as the American \npeople demand a serious response to a serious problem. My objectives \nand concerns should be viewed as a way to make an eventual policy more \nequitable and efficient. The consequences of taking no action are dire \nand simply unacceptable. Although the Congress will not find consensus \nthis year on tackling the problem, I am glad that the Senate has \nstarted a much needed debate on this issue and count myself in the vast \nmajority of citizens who feel we have the capability to curtail the \neffects of climate change.\n   (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, the Constitution places the power of \nthe purse squarely in the hands of Congress. The Lieberman-Warner \nclimate security bill and the Boxer substitute to it, however, thwart \nthe Constitution and longstanding tradition by shifting much spending \npower to the executive branch. In order to protect Congress's \nconstitutional role to make spending decisions, I have introduced an \namendment, cosponsored by Senators Murray, Dorgan, Leahy, Durbin, \nFeinstein, and Mikulski.\n  Enacting this climate change legislation in its current form would \nvest unelected executive branch boards and agencies with unprecedented \ndiscretion on Federal spending in excess of more than $1.4 trillion in \nnew and existing Federal programs over a span of 38 years.\n  Rather than Congress making decisions on funding and conducting \noversight of Federal programs as intended by the Constitution, much of \nthese responsibilities would be in the hands of the executive branch \nagencies.\n  In one specific case, the burden would be on Congress to stop \nexecutive branch decisions on Federal spending related to climate \nchange initiatives. The Climate Change Technology Board would simply \nhave to notify congressional committees 60 days in advance of a funding \ndistribution for a range of energy technology programs. The money would \nbe spent unless Congress could pass a law, signed by the President, to \nstop it. Effectively, the Senate could only stop the spending if it \ncould muster 67 votes.\n  The legislation would not expire until 2050, meaning that the \nexecutive branch would go unchecked on spending decisions related to \nclimate change\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\ninitiatives for 38 years. Our Founding Fathers clearly did not intend \nfor Congress to relinquish the power of the purse to any President for \nany issue--and certainly not for nearly four decades on such a crucial \nand timely issue.\n  The clock is certainly ticking for America to take more responsible \naction on the global climate security challenge. Congress should retain \nits active role in funding and oversight of climate security programs, \nas it does for every other Federal program. It would be irresponsible \nto concentrate such power in the executive branch and then sit on the \nside lines watching as Federal agencies take action without a \ncongressional check.\n  There is concern that the new funds raised in this bill through the \nauctioning of emissions allowances should be spent on the measures \nauthorized in this bill to address climate change. Some may worry that \nour amendment would allow these new receipts to just sit in the \nTreasury and not get spent on their intended purpose. That is simply \nnot the case.\n  Our amendment, No. 4920, addresses that concern head-on by granting \nthese receipts special budget treatment and requiring that they be \nallocated only to the specified purposes and programs authorized in \nthis climate change bill. The Committee on Appropriations would \ncontinue its rightful role in allocating these funds.\n  Under this approach--known as ``offsetting collections''--the amounts \nare appropriated annually in appropriations acts for the specific \npurposes allowed under the authorization act, but those appropriations \nare paid for by the auction receipts collected pursuant to the Boxer \nsubstitute. The receipts serve to offset the cost of the appropriation.\n  The ``offsetting collections'' model has worked successfully in the \npast. It has given the authorizing committees that have raised new fees \nthe comfort that their new revenues would be spent on their intended \npurpose. At the same time, it has given the Committee on Appropriations \nthe ability to continually oversee the spending of these funds and \nensure that they are spent responsibly.\n  For example, the Appropriations Committee has successfully \ncoordinated this approach with the Commerce Committee for new receipts \nthat were established after the September 11 tragedy for the costs of \nthe Transportation Security Administration. Every penny of the security \nfees that were newly established in the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act have been appropriated annually by my Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee Act and only for the purposes specified in \nthe authorizing law.\n  The purpose of our amendment is not to put a roadblock to these funds \nbeing spent. To the contrary, it is to keep honor with the intent of \nChairman Boxer and her legislation while simultaneously keeping honor \nwith the Constitution of the United States and the role of the \nlegislative branch.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there have been several companies, \norganizations, unions, and environmental groups that have come out \nagainst this bill by sending letters urging Senators to vote no on the \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese letters signed by the following groups:\n\n       Duke Energy, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, United Auto Workers, Farm Bureau, and \n     the United Mine Workers of America.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Farm Bureau,\n\n                                                     May 30, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: The full Senate is expected to debate climate \n     change legislation, S.2191, the Lieberman-Warner Climate \n     Security Act, during the week of June 2. We also expect that \n     there will be a Boxer substitute amendment that will be the \n     focus of the debate. The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     urges you to oppose the substitute.\n       Agriculture can play a significant role in addressing \n     climate change by reducing and sequestering carbon through \n     tillage practices, manure and soil management, and other \n     practices. These practices can also help to offset the \n     emissions reductions imposed by cap and trade legislation, \n     thereby reducing the costs of the bill to regulated \n     industries and to consumers. The Boxer amendment fails to \n     recognize these benefits that agriculture can provide.\n       While establishing a domestic offset market, the bill fails \n     to assure that domestic offsets will be available. It leaves \n     the decision whether to allow any agricultural offsets at \n     all, and which to allow, at the sole discretion of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. The bill establishes an \n     artificial cap of 15 percent on the number of domestic \n     offsets available, and further provides that any unfilled \n     portion of that amount may be filled by international \n     offsets. The cap on agricultural offsets stifles efforts of \n     producers to reduce or sequester carbon, and the cap on \n     offsets also increases the economic impacts of the \n     legislation on businesses and consumers.\n       The bill also stifles development of agricultural reduction \n     or sequestration projects by creating uncertainty as to \n     whether projects will even be approved for the offset market. \n     The bill requires any project to be completed first and the \n     carbon reduction or sequestration benefits be verified before \n     a decision to approve is made. This uncertainty creates a \n     disincentive for project managers and buyers of offsets to \n     enter into carbon reduction projects if they might not be \n     approved as offsets.\n       Many agricultural practices that reduce or sequester carbon \n     also have other environmental benefits. For example, reduced \n     tillage practices have soil erosion control and water quality \n     benefits in addition to sequestering carbon. By requiring \n     that projects may not be approved as offsets unless their \n     sole purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG), the bill \n     disqualifies many otherwise worthwhile projects that have \n     collateral environmental benefits, and may discourage the \n     development of these multi-benefit projects.\n       Finally, unilateral carbon mandates by the United States \n     that impose cost increases on American producers without a \n     corresponding and similar commitment from other countries \n     such as China, India or Brazil, among others, puts American \n     producers at a significant competitive trade disadvantage. \n     Any benefits from reduced GHG emissions by the United States \n     will be minimal if other countries continue to emit as usual.\n       Agriculture can play an important role in reducing and \n     sequestering carbon, and thereby ease the costs to industry \n     and to society of compliance with emission reductions. Its \n     role must be fully recognized in any climate change \n     legislation. The Boxer substitute fails to recognize this and \n     provides no assurances that agriculture will have any \n     opportunity to mitigate the obvious increased costs of this \n     legislation. We urge you to oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Duke Energy Corporation,\n\n                                      Charlotte, NC, June 2, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: I appreciate the tough decisions you may be \n     called on to make in the next several days as climate change \n     legislation comes to the Senate floor for, what I hope will \n     be, a healthy debate. I am grateful for the courtesy you've \n     extended Duke Energy and me personally in allowing us to make \n     our case for a fair climate bill that benefits the \n     environment without penalizing the customer.\n       As you are well aware, Duke Energy has been a strong \n     supporter of enacting a mandatory, economy-wide greenhouse \n     gas cap-and-trade program. As this issue has continued to \n     develop over the last several years we have taken a \n     leadership role in working with a wide group of affected \n     stakeholders on both sides of the debate to try and find \n     common ground and move this issue forward. I think we have \n     made progress in that regard, and I am confident more will be \n     made in the months ahead.\n       But we have said from the beginning that, as important as \n     it is for Congress to act on climate change, it is just as \n     important that Congress get it right. In our view, the \n     legislation Senator Boxer plans to offer on the Senate floor \n     does not meet that test. Its provisions, as written, would \n     impose excessive and unfair costs on our customers which, in \n     our view, would unnecessarily disrupt the regional and \n     national economies.\n       While costs cannot be a reason for inaction, they must be \n     part of the decision making process. Our country will require \n     time as we transition to a low-carbon economy and Congress \n     must find effective ways to cushion that transition, which is \n     particularly important for customers in states that depend \n     heavily on fossil fuel generation. Senator Boxer's amendment \n     makes some progress in trying to mitigate these economic \n     concerns, but it does not go far enough to ensure against \n     substantial electricity price increases on Day 1 of the \n     program. Customers in the 25 states whose generation is more \n     than 50 percent coal-fired will pay a disproportionate share \n     of these higher costs.\n       As previous successful cap-and-trade programs have shown, \n     there are more effective ways to achieve our environmental \n     goals, while keeping costs low. Providing transitional \n     allowances to fossil generators based on and equal to \n     historic emissions proved to be a win-win for customers and \n     the environment under the Acid Rain Program and Duke believes \n     this approach would have the same results under carbon \n     legislation.\n       If the measure to be debated were enacted into law, costs \n     to the average household, especially in those 25 coal-based \n     states, would increase rather quickly because a significant \n     number of emission allowances would have to be purchased \n     through an auction at a fluctuating price. These costs to \n     consumers would be in addition to increased costs for the \n     capital investments required for actually\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\n     lowering carbon emissions. The additional charges paid by \n     these customers to buy allowances will not lower carbon \n     emissions by one ounce, but will have a profound economic \n     impact on their everyday lives.\n       In 2007 Duke Energy provided electricity to more than 3.7 \n     million homes in South Carolina, North Carolina, Ohio, \n     Indiana, and Kentucky. More than 20 percent of these homes \n     had a combined income of less than $25,000 a year, with 7 \n     percent earning less than $10,000 a year. These families are \n     already struggling due to higher prices for other goods and \n     commodities and it is unfair and unnecessary to require them \n     to fund a substantial portion of the climate program through \n     increased energy bills. And while there are provisions \n     contained within the bill to assist low-income families with \n     their energy bills, it is somewhat disingenuous to tell them \n     they will get a rebate when they get back only a fraction of \n     what they put in.\n       As I have stated before, addressing climate change should \n     be a transition from where we are today to where we need to \n     be tomorrow. The program will not work if it is based on the \n     premise that there needs to be an immediate upheaval of our \n     current infrastructure base. Instead, legislation will work \n     if its intent is to build the foundation to transition our \n     economy to a low-carbon environment.\n       Even without a national climate change policy Duke Energy \n     is implementing steps to lower its carbon footprint. We \n     continue to invest in energy efficiency and over the next \n     five years plan to invest approximately $23 billion (almost \n     equal to our current market cap) to make our entire system \n     more efficient, retire inefficient plants and increase our \n     renewable energy portfolio. These investments show Duke \n     Energy's commitment to addressing climate change. But, this \n     transition will take time and cannot be accomplished \n     overnight.\n       While it is unfortunate that Duke Energy cannot support the \n     current climate change measure, we remain committed to being \n     a constructive part of the debate as this issue moves \n     forward. Strong leadership will be required to pass \n     legislation that protects our environment, protects our \n     economy and protects our customers and I look forward to \n     working with you to make this a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James E. Rogers,\n     Chairman, President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                            National Association of Manufacturers,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2008.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Manufacturers (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade \n     association representing manufacturers in every industrial \n     sector and in all 50 states, I urge you to oppose S. 3036, \n     the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, as introduced.\n       The NAM understands the importance of environmental \n     stewardship. Our member companies are committed to pursuing \n     reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, provided that \n     any commitments made by the United States are mirrored by \n     comparable commitments by our trading partners, are based on \n     sound science and cost-effectiveness, and are applied equally \n     throughout the economy.\n       The NAM opposes S. 3036's nationwide cap-and-trade program \n     because it:\n       Does not pre-empt conflicting state and local climate \n     change laws and/or regulations;\n       Imposes major new requirements on businesses without \n     sufficiently protecting U.S. competitiveness or funding the \n     research, development and commercial deployment of essential \n     new technologies;\n       Omits ``safety valve'' provisions that are key to ensuring \n     cost containment;\n       Is limited in scope and does not include all sectors of the \n     economy;\n       Unnecessarily increases demand on natural gas, driving up \n     energy costs and job losses;\n       Does not adequately promote global participation; and\n       Creates a multitude of conflicting and duplicative \n     regulations for manufacturers.\n       The NAM, in cooperation with the American Council for \n     Capital Formation, commissioned a study earlier this year to \n     assess the potential economic impacts of the Lieberman-Warner \n     legislation. The study concluded that, if adopted, the \n     legislation by 2030 could lead to net national employment \n     losses of up to 4 million jobs, electricity price increases \n     of up to 129 percent, gasoline price increases of up to 145 \n     percent and a loss of household income of up to $6,752 per \n     year.\n       Manufacturers are committed to working with Congress to \n     establish sensible and responsible federal climate change \n     policies that reduce GHG emissions, but these policies must \n     maintain a competitive playing field for American companies. \n     S. 3036 fails this test, and we oppose its passage. We will \n     be closely evaluating amendments that affect U.S. \n     manufacturers and workers and will be communicating our views \n     on these amendments prior to their final consideration.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on S. 3036, including votes on related amendments or \n     procedural motions, merit designation as Key Manufacturing \n     Votes.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jay Timmons,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               United Mine Workers of America,\n\n                                        Fairfax, VA, May 27, 2008.\n     Re: S. 2191\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chair, Environment and Public Works Committee, Senate Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Boxer and Inhofe: As President of the United \n     Mine Workers of America (UMWA), I am writing to explain why \n     we do not support S. 2191, the Lieberman-Warner Climate \n     Security Act of 2008.\n       The UMWA has participated in the global climate change \n     debate for more than 15 years, both domestically and abroad \n     as an NGO at all major negotiating sessions of the U.N. \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). Last July, we \n     were pleased to join the AFL-CIO and many of our labor \n     colleagues in endorsing the bipartisan Bingaman-Specter bill, \n     S. 1766.\n       Our support for S. 1766 reflected our agreement with its \n     emission reduction targets and timetables provisions to \n     accelerate the commercialization of carbon capture and \n     sequestration (CCS) technology, and projected moderate \n     impacts on the U.S. economy overall, and on coal utilization \n     in the electric utility sector. Recent analyses by EPA and \n     EIA confirm our judgment in this regard.\n       We met with Committee staff during the development of S. \n     2191, expressing our deep concerns about the Bill's overly \n     aggressive targets and timetables for near-term reductions, \n     particularly the magnitude of reductions required by 2020, It \n     is not feasible to deploy CCS technology on a large-scale \n     basis by that time. With the economy-wide emission trading \n     system employed by S. 2191, the electric utility and coal \n     industries would bear the brunt of the adverse economic and \n     job impacts associated with compliance. EIA's recent analysis \n     shows that over time, these adverse impacts will spread \n     across our manufacturing and industrial base.\n       The severity of these impacts cannot be justified on \n     environmental grounds in light of EPA's analysis of the \n     comparative global CO2 concentrations resulting \n     from alternative climate change bills before the Senate. In \n     essence, there is no significant difference among these bills \n     measured in terms of future atmospheric concentrations of \n     CO2.\n       The world's ability to stabilize future global \n     CO2 concentrations--the long-term goal of the U.N. \n     FCCC--depends overwhelmingly upon the willingness of major \n     developing economies like India, China, Brazil and Mexico to \n     accept meaningful commitments to reduce their future rate of \n     emissions. The magnitude of their commitments will not be \n     evident until the conclusion of the Copenhagen negotiations \n     scheduled for December 2009.\n       We appreciate the efforts that you and the Committee have \n     made to accommodate labor's interests in the initial bill, \n     the Committee mark-up, and the Manager's Amendment. CCS bonus \n     allowances, provision for Davis-Bacon compliance, inclusion \n     of the IBEW-AEP trade provisions from S. 1766, a limited \n     cost-containment ``off-ramp'' and additional technology \n     incentives are welcome additions. However, these measures do \n     not mitigate the severe adverse impacts that S. 2191 would \n     have on American workers, primarily due to the unrealistic \n     schedule of emissions reductions required by 2020, just 12 \n     years from now.\n\n                       Impact on Coal Utilization\n\n       Both EPA and EIA's analyses of S. 2191 indicate that U.S. \n     coal production for electric generation would be sharply \n     reduced due to the concentration of emission reductions in \n     the utility sector, in turn reflecting the low availability \n     of CCS technology when the 2020 reductions are required. \n     Emission reductions in the transport sector are minimal in \n     comparison.\n       The table below summarizes EIA's findings for electricity \n     generated by coal and natural gas under its business-as-usual \n     Reference Case, Core S. 2191 case, and ``Limited \n     Alternatives'' case for 2020 and 2030. ElA's core case \n     assumes that nuclear generation will triple by 2030. The \n     limited alternatives case constrains coal-based CCS, new \n     nuclear power, and renewables generation to reference case \n     levels.\n\n                                                       EIA S. 2191 PROJECTIONS OF COAL AND NATURAL GAS ELECTRIC GENERATION, 2020 AND 2030\n                                                                      [Billions of kilowatt-hours and pct. chg. from 2006]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    2006          2020 Ref.

We also note the potential for huge increases \n     in the demand for natural gas in the limited alternatives \n     case, with adverse implications for other industries and \n     consumers dependent on scarce gas resources. If EIA's core \n     case assumptions about the robust growth of nuclear power \n     proved optimistic, utilities would have little choice but to \n     switch from coal to natural gas on a massive, unprecedented \n     scale.\n       EPA's results are consistent with EIA's findings. EPA \n     projects that coal production for electric generation would \n     decline from 1.1 billion tons in 2010 to less than 800 \n     million tons in 2020, and to less than 700 million tons by \n     2025--a reduction of nearly 40% from 2010 production. \n     Electricity prices are forecast to increase 44% by 2030, \n     assuming that allowance cost can be partially passed through \n     to consumers.\n       EPA attributes the disproportionate concentration of \n     emission reductions in S. 2191 within the utility sector to \n     the ``relatively modest indirect price signal an upstream cap \n     and trade program sends to the transportation sector.'' EIA's \n     analysis of the distribution of CO2 emissions \n     expected in 2020 and 2030 under its core case and five \n     alternative cases shows a similar disproportionate impact on \n     the electric power sector.\n\n               Manufacturing and Other Industrial Sectors\n\n       Higher electricity and other fuel costs would depress \n     demand for industrial output and result in job losses across \n     of the economy.

At this rate, one billion dollars of reduced \n     manufacturing output translates to approximately 3,750 direct \n     job losses. A loss of $354 billion of industrial shipments \n     could represent the loss of 1.3 million jobs. Multiplier \n     effects for indirect job losses are typically a factor of 2 \n     to 3 times direct job losses, implying total potential job \n     losses of 2.7 to 3.9 million American workers.\n       Given the rising uncertainties about our future economic \n     growth, sacrificing an additional hundred billion dollars or \n     more of annual industrial output relative to other policy \n     measures is difficult to justify without a compelling \n     demonstration of offsetting environmental benefits. We do \n     not believe such a demonstration is possible for \n     differences of a few parts per million of global \n     CO2 concentrations 50 to 100 years from today.\n\n                             Looking Ahead\n\n       The global climate debate has progressed rapidly in the \n     past few years due to the commitment and sincere efforts of \n     leaders on both sides of the aisle in seeking balanced \n     solutions that can protect the American economy and jobs \n     while achieving significant reductions of greenhouse gases. \n     This is the basic objective that has guided our involvement \n     in this issue from the outset.\n       Legitimate debate remains about measures such as cost \n     containment, preemption of duplicative state and regional \n     cap-and-trade programs, emission offsets, international \n     trading, technology incentives and other provisions of S. \n     2191. We remain persuaded, however, that the key to striking \n     an appropriate balance must involve adjustment of unrealistic \n     targets and timetables that do not provide sufficient time \n     for the widescale commercial deployment of CCS technology. \n     Neither advance allowance auction reserves, as proposed by \n     the Manager's Amendment, nor additional CCS incentives will \n     allow CCS to play a major role in compliance plans by 2020. \n     It requires a decade or more to site, permit and construct a \n     single baseload facility.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in \n     the Senate as you seek to further improve S. 2191.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cecil E. Roberts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate is scheduled to consider \n     legislation to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, the \n     Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 (S. 2191). At \n     that time, we understand that Chairwoman Boxer and Senators \n     Lieberman and Warner intend to offer a manager's amendment \n     making a number of important changes in the bill that was \n     reported by the Committee on the Environment and Public \n     Works. Unfortunately, even with these changes the legislation \n     still contains serious defects that would undermine the \n     environmental benefits, while posing a threat to economic \n     growth and jobs. Accordingly, the UAW opposes this bill in \n     its current form. We urge you to insist that the legislation \n     must be modified to correct these defects.\n       The UAW agrees that climate change is a serious problem \n     that urgently needs to be addressed through the establishment \n     of an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. We commend \n     Chairwoman Boxer and Senators Lieberman and Warner for \n     crafting legislation that would establish this type of \n     program and achieve very significant reductions in greenhouse \n     gases. The UAW is pleased that this bill covers the electric \n     power, industrial and transportation sectors, which account \n     for the overwhelming percentage of greenhouse gas emissions. \n     We are also pleased that the transportation sector is covered \n     on an ``up-stream'' basis through the regulation of fuels, \n     which is the most economically efficient mechanism. The UAW \n     applauds the inclusion of transition assistance for workers. \n     And we welcome the provisions allocating allowances to states \n     whose economies rely heavily on manufacturing.\n       The UAW would especially like to commend the chief sponsors \n     of this legislation for including provisions (Sections 1111-\n     1115) establishing a Climate Change Transportation Technology \n     Fund that would use revenues from the auction of 1 percent of \n     the allowances each year to finance a manufacturer facility \n     conversion program. This critically important initiative \n     would provide grants to manufacturers to pay for up to 30 \n     percent of the costs to retool facilities in the United \n     States to produce advanced technology vehicles (hybrids, \n     clean diesels, fuel cells) and their key components. This \n     will help to speed up the introduction of these advanced \n     technology vehicles, thereby reducing oil consumption and \n     greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, it will provide a \n     significant incentive for auto and parts manufacturers to \n     retool facilities in this country to produce these vehicles \n     of the future and their key components. This can create tens \n     of thousands of jobs for American workers.\n       While recognizing these very positive provisions in S. \n     2191, the UAW still is very troubled by a number of \n     provisions and omissions.\n       1. Even though S. 2191 establishes an economy-wide cap-and-\n     trade program to reduce greenhouse gases, Section 1751 makes \n     it clear that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would \n     retain residual authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate \n     CO2 emissions. This effectively means that EPA \n     would be free to disregard key decisions that Congress will \n     make in considering S. 2191 concerning the timetable for \n     reductions in CO2 emissions, the appropriate point \n     of regulation, and the distribution of economic burdens. \n     Instead, EPA would be free to regulate CO2 \n     emissions from the electric power, industrial and \n     transportation sectors in ways that differ fundamentally from \n     S. 2191. The UAW believes it is inappropriate and untenable \n     to allow a federal agency to supersede decisions by Congress \n     in this manner.\n       2. Section 1731 of S. 2191 does not simply preserve \n     existing state authority to regulate greenhouse gas \n     emissions. Instead, as the Committee report makes clear, this \n     provision is drafted in a manner that would trump\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\n     pending litigation concerning the scope of existing state \n     authority--specifically whether state auto CO2 \n     tailpipe standards are preempted by federal law. The UAW \n     believes the courts should be allowed to resolve this \n     contentious issue. Thus, Section 1731 should be redrafted to \n     indicate that it is just preserving existing state authority, \n     not deciding what the scope of that authority is.\n       3. S. 2191 fails to deal with the important issue of how \n     state climate change measures will interface with the federal \n     cap-and-trade program. Instead, it simply calls for a study \n     on this issue (Section 1761). Because of this critical \n     omission, the unfortunate reality is that state climate \n     change measures would result in ZERO additional reduction in \n     greenhouse gas emissions beyond the level already mandated by \n     the federal cap-and-trade program established by S. 2191. \n     Although state measures could reduce emissions from a \n     particular sector, this would simply relax the pressure from \n     the federal cap on other sectors, without providing any net \n     environmental benefit. The UAW submits that this is a \n     nonsensical result. If the states are going to be allowed to \n     implement climate change measures that impose significant \n     economic burdens on particular industries, a mechanism should \n     be established to ensure that these state measures can \n     interface with the federal cap-and-trade program in an \n     appropriate manner, and thereby provide additional reductions \n     in greenhouse emissions.\n       The UAW believes this can easily be accomplished by \n     allowing entities regulated by state climate change measures \n     to purchase and retire allowances from the federal program to \n     satisfy the state standards (to the extent they are more \n     stringent than comparable federal standards). This would \n     guarantee that the state measures actually provide an \n     environmental benefit through additional reductions in \n     greenhouse gas emissions, while also allowing this to be \n     accomplished in the most economically efficient manner in \n     keeping with the fundamental premise of the federal cap-and-\n     trade program.\n       4. In our judgment, S. 2191 still does not deal adequately \n     with the problem of international competition. We recognize \n     that the manager's amendment includes a number of changes \n     that strengthen the provisions of the bill that are intended \n     to encourage other nations--especially India and China--to \n     adopt comparable climate change programs, and to prevent \n     American businesses and workers from being placed at an \n     unfair competitive disadvantage. However, the UAW is still \n     concerned that the definition of ``manufactured item for \n     consumption'' (Section 1301(13)) grants too much discretion \n     to the International Climate Change Commission and the EPA in \n     determining whether finished products (such as automobiles or \n     auto parts) are subject to the international reserve \n     allowance requirements. If these products are not covered, \n     this could pose a major threat to the jobs of American \n     workers. Thus, we believe this section of the legislation \n     needs to be redrafted to make it clear that these products \n     are in fact covered.\n       The UAW strongly urges the Senate to correct the foregoing \n     deficiencies in S. 2191. We believe all of these concerns can \n     be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the \n     essential thrust of S. 2191. If these problems are not \n     corrected, we urge you to oppose this legislation.\n       The UAW also urges you to reject amendments that may be \n     offered by various industries such as steel and airlines--to \n     exempt the coal or oil that they use from the requirements of \n     the cap-and-trade program. We firmly believe that a cap-and-\n     trade program covering most of the economy is the only fair \n     and effective way to meet the challenge posed by climate \n     change. To the extent any industries obtain special ``carve \n     outs'' for themselves, this will only serve to increase the \n     pressure on the rest of the industries and sectors that are \n     still covered under the cap-and-trade program. In the end, \n     this could unravel the prospects for enacting any meaningful \n     federal program to combat climate change.\n       The UAW recognizes that Senate consideration of S. 2191 \n     represents the beginning of a long process to determine \n     federal policy to address the serious threat posed by climate \n     change. The UAW looks forward to working with Congress and a \n     new administration to pass legislation establishing a federal \n     cap-and-trade program that resolves the concerns discussed \n     above, achieves major reductions in greenhouse gases, and \n     enhances prospects for economic growth and the creation of \n     jobs for American workers.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this critically \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2008.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, strongly \n     urges you to oppose cloture on the Boxer manager's amendment \n     to S. 3036, the ``Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of \n     2008.'' This week's truncated debate left many serious \n     questions unanswered as to how to control domestic and \n     international greenhouse gas emissions while keeping costs in \n     check and assuring a reliable energy supply. As the debate \n     vividly demonstrated, S. 3036 is not the proper vehicle to \n     answer those questions.\n       First, and foremost, S. 3036 will be very expensive. Its \n     predecessor, S. 2191, was forecast by a range of analyses to \n     result in two to four million lost jobs, as high as 60 to 80 \n     percent increases in household energy prices, as much as a \n     3.4 percent decrease in GDP, and an annual household cost of \n     compliance, ranging from $1,000 to $6,700. Although S. 3036 \n     was brought to the floor too rapidly for similar studies to \n     be completed, it is clear that the cost of purchasing \n     allocations under the bill would result in a $3.2 trillion \n     tax. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office recently \n     estimated that S. 3036 would result in tens of billions of \n     dollars annually in private sector mandates.\n       S. 3036 also creates a massive federal bureaucracy, via \n     more than 300 mandates, that must be translated into rules, \n     regulations and reports by the Executive Branch. The result: \n     a cavalcade of new bureaucrats, decades of costly \n     implementation and prolonged litigation. The Chamber's chart \n     summarizing this regulatory nightmare is available at: http:/\n     /www.uschamber.com/issues/index/environment/\n 080603climatechange.\n       Finally, although S. 3036 earmarks a tremendous amount of \n     money to provide support for the families impacted by the \n     legislation, it fails to support the research and development \n     of the technologies necessary to continue powering our \n     economy as fossil fuels are restricted by the cap. S. 3036 \n     also fails to address the problem of deployment, specifically \n     the streamlining of permits for low- and zero-carbon energy \n     technologies.\n       The Chamber strongly urges you to protect American jobs and \n     the economy by voting no on cloture on the manager's \n     amendment to S. 3036, and will include this vote in our \n     annual How They Voted scorecard.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I invoke cloture in order to move forward \nwith the debate and break the Republican filibuster so that we can \namend and improve the bill in order to begin to address the problem of \nglobal climate change. I oppose it in its current form and would have \nvoted no if the vote were on whether to pass the bill. For this reason, \nI joined with other Senate colleagues in a letter identifying many of \nmy concerns and outlining a way to move forward. A copy of this letter \nis printed at the end of this statement.\n  Chairman Boxer and Senators Lieberman and Warner have taken on a \nmatter of global significance, which will impact both present and \nfuture generations.\n  We are in agreement on the fundamentals: Global warming is occurring, \nand human activity is causing it. Scientists tell us that we need to \nact with urgency to attain the levels of global greenhouse gas \nconcentrations in the atmosphere that will prevent catastrophic impacts \nfrom occurring.\n  The impacts of global climate change are being realized already. We \nhave already been experiencing more heat waves, shorter winters, and \nmore frequent severe weather events.\n  In the future, the EPA estimates that an acceleration in heavy \nrainfall events will cause more runoff, stressing the sewer \ninfrastructure and harming water quality. Other projected future \nimpacts are even more alarming: Portions of countries and entire \nislands could be lost to rising sea levels, crop yields could \nsignificantly decline, water shortages are expected, and droughts, \nhurricanes, and floods will likely increase.\n  Most experts agree that these phenomena will have a huge impact on \npeople living in less developed countries and could result in the mass \ndislocation of millions throughout the world. Along with dire \nenvironmental and economic consequences, climate change could also \nimpact our national security. Heightened domestic and international \ntensions caused by competition for scarce resources such as fresh water \nor agricultural land may result in armed conflict in and between \nnations.\n  While we agree on the fundamentals of the problem, I have some \ndifferences with the approach of this bill regarding how to confront \nthe immense and complex problem of global climate change. I have \nconsistently argued that the best way of addressing global warming is \nthrough an effective and enforceable international agreement that binds \nall nations to reductions in greenhouse gases, including developing \nnations such as China and India. Proponents of this bill have argued \nthat U.S. action through this cap-and-trade bill will prompt action by \nother countries to reduce their emissions. The international provision \nin this bill that attempts to level the playing field may put some \npressure on other countries to act, but it will not automatically get \nthese\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\ncountries on board with us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at levels \ncomparable to ours. Unfortunately, if we do not get these other \ncountries on board, what we do in the United States as a result of this \nbill will only have a marginal impact on controlling global greenhouse \ngas emissions and could create a severe economic disadvantage to us.\n  This bill does not adequately assure American manufacturing a level \nplaying field. A recent Energy Information Administration analysis, \nEIA, projected manufacturing job losses in the hundreds of thousands \neach year if the Lieberman-Warner bill were signed into law. Cumulative \njob impacts in the manufacturing sector through 2030 are estimated at \nbetween 2 to 14 million manufacturing jobs. We have already lost 3.3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs since 2001, about 250,000 in Michigan alone. \nWe cannot afford to lose any more because of an unlevel playing field. \nSignificantly, EIA's projected manufacturing job losses can be \nattributed to manufacturers moving to countries with less stringent \nenvironmental standards. Without the proper protections, our actions \nmay ship manufacturing facilities and the greenhouse gas emissions that \ngo with them overseas, providing no environmental benefit while \nneedlessly hurting our economy.\n  The substitute amendment offered by Senator Boxer makes few \nimprovements to the Lieberman-Warner bill that was reported from the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The cost containment auction \nwill help to moderate emission allowance prices and help contain \ncompliance costs, which will ultimately help control prices that hard-\nworking consumers face. More assistance is provided to energy-intensive \nmanufacturers to transition to a carbon-constrained world, and more \nallowances are provided to reward early action. The substitute \namendment provides additional flexibility for covered sources to use \nEPA-verified offsets, which will also help control the costs of this \nbill. The substitute also includes some carbon market oversight \nmechanisms that will help monitor the new emission allowance trading \nmarket created by this bill. However, one of the changes in the \nsubstitute could have damaging impacts to our domestic auto industry \nbecause it could lead to potentially conflicting State regulations for \ngreenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources and potentially highly \nunfair discriminatory impacts on U.S. manufacturers as a result of \nthose state regulations.\n  I have filed a number of amendments and have cosponsored others that \nwill strengthen the bill to protect American jobs, reduce the burdens \non working families and consumers, and also protect the environment.\n  One of my amendments would provide Americans with protection from \neconomic disruptions in case the costs of the bill exceed a certain \nlevel. Specifically, my amendment would suspend the compliance \nrequirements of the cap-and-trade program if the emission allowance \nprice reaches a prohibitively expensive amount. This amendment would \nprovide an effective backstop if the various cost containment \nmechanisms included in the bill turn out to be less effective than \nexpected and would prevent harm to the US economy.\n  Another amendment I filed would protect the competitiveness of U.S. \nmanufacturers in international markets. While I am pleased that the \nbill sponsors included an important provision that would help level the \ninternational playing field between U.S. manufacturers and \ninternational competitors not facing similar greenhouse gas limits, if \nthis provision does not survive a WTO challenge, the bill provides no \nrecourse to correct the situation. My amendment would suspend this \nprogram and compliance obligations of manufacturers that face global \ncompetition if a foreign country retaliates against the international \nallowance requirement that would be imposed by this bill. Also, \nadditional allowances would be provided to these manufacturers to \ncompensate for their higher production costs that would result from \nthis bill. This amendment would help keep manufacturers and jobs in the \nUnited States if the international reserve allowance program in title \nXIII results in retaliation by other countries.\n\n  I also joined Senators Specter and Brown in filing an amendment that \nwould strengthen the international reserve allowance program to ensure \nthat importers bear the same responsibility as American manufacturers \nwith respect to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The bill attempts to \ndo this by requiring certain importers to submit emissions allowances \nto account for the greenhouse gas emissions of their products if the \nproduct comes from a foreign country that has not taken comparable \naction to limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, the bill defines \n``comparable action'' in such broad terms that it would likely exclude \nmany countries that in fact have not taken similar actions. The bill \ngives discretion to the International Climate Change Commission that \nwould be established by the bill to determine that a foreign country \nhas taken comparable action if they are using state-of-the-art \ntechnologies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, without considering the \nmagnitude of the reductions achieved by these technologies.\n  The Specter-Brown amendment would determine that a foreign country is \ntaking comparable action only if actual greenhouse gas reductions are \ncomparable to those achieved in the United States. The amendment would \nalso broaden the types of imports that would be required to submit \nemission allowances by including both direct and indirect emissions \ngenerated in the course of manufacturing the product. The substitute \namendment only includes direct emissions and emissions associated with \nthe electricity used to manufacture the product, which fails to account \nfor emissions associated with other inputs used to make downstream \nproducts. The Brown-Specter amendment corrects the competitive problem \nthat would be faced by U.S. manufacturers.\n  I also filed an amendment that would provide more allowances to \nfossil fuel-fired electric utilities whose prices are regulated. A \ncoal-fired powerplant is limited in its ability to reduce its \ngreenhouse gas emissions because this depends entirely on the \nefficiency of the generating plant. A Congressional Research Service \nanalysis found that efficiency improvements on the order of 4-to-6 \npercent could be achieved by improving an existing unit, which would in \nturn have a 4-to-6 percent reduction in carbon emissions. The only way \nto further reduce emissions from a powerplant would be to install \ncarbon capture and sequestration technology, which is not expected to \nbe commercially available until sometime after 2030. Because the \nelectric utilities can do very little to address greenhouse gas \nemissions at existing plants, it is only fair to provide emission \nallowances to these facilities that power homes, retail establishments, \nand industry with vital electric power. Limiting additional allowances \nto utilities whose prices are regulated will prevent companies from \nrealizing windfall profits, which occurred in the European Union.\n  I continue to be concerned about provisions of this bill that could \nresult in both conflicting cap-and-trade systems and conflicting \nunderlying regulations for greenhouse gas emissions. I believe that \nCongress should adopt a mandatory Federal economywide cap-and-trade \nprogram that will be the single regulatory regime for overall control \nof greenhouse gas emissions. Existing State laws and initiatives should \nbe integrated into the Federal cap-and-trade program where the policies \ndo not conflict, but in areas where the regulations or programs \nconflict or overlap, there must be a single clear national authority. \nFederal authority in this area should be made clear in the statutory \nlanguage to prevent conflicts in regulation, preserve overall \nefficiency, and ensure harmonization of regulations.\n  I am also concerned about other provisions of the Boxer substitute. \nThese provisions, taken together, seek to preserve state authority and \nto reward States that have been leaders in the effort to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency. I applaud \nefforts to encourage energy efficiency, and I have no concerns about \nthat aspect of these provisions. I am very concerned, however, that \nrewarding States for leadership in greenhouse gas emission reduction \nefforts in the way laid out in this bill may have the effect of setting \nup an unworkable system that will result in confusion, at best, and \nregulatory chaos, at worst.\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\n  Section 614 would provide additional allowances to States that are \n``leaders'' in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nincrease energy efficiency. A leader is not defined by the act, \nhowever, and the EPA Administrator is given the task to establish a \nsystem, by regulation, for ``scoring historical State investments and \nachievements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy \nefficiency.'' To qualify as a leader under the terms of the bill, it \nappears that a State must have set more stringent standards than the \nFederal Government. To receive the reward of additional allowances, \nhowever, a State must either have never established a cap-and-trade \nsystem or have terminated its cap-and-trade program. In other words, on \nthe one hand, the bill is encouraging States to set their own standards \nin order to qualify for additional allowances, but then, on the other \nhand, the States are told to terminate their programs in order to \nreceive the additional allowances. That sounds to me like regulatory \nchaos. Worse still, the bill does not actually require States to \nterminate separate cap-and-trade programs it simply provides a \nfinancial incentive to do so. Therefore, if the financial incentive is \nnot sufficient for the State to decide to terminate its program, there \nis too great a likelihood there will be conflicting and confusing \nFederal and State cap-and-trade systems.\n\n  It simply does not make sense to have competing Federal and State \ncap-and-trade programs. It simply will not work. If a State were to \nimplement a more stringent cap-and-trade program that allowed regulated \nentities to purchase Federal emissions allowances to satisfy State \ncompliance requirements, this would in turn increase demand for the \nFederal allowances, which would increase the price of Federal \nallowances. Thus, such an action by a State would affect entities in \nother States because the Federal allowance trading market is \nnationwide.\n  Another provision of this bill that gives me cause for concern is \nsection 1731, entitled ``Retention of State Authority'', which purports \nto be a savings clause that simply preserves authority under existing \nprovisions of law. I am concerned, however, about language in Senate \nReport 110-337, the report accompanying S. 2191, which states in part, \n``The purpose of this section is to make it absolutely clear that this \nbill does not affect the validity of these State and local greenhouse \ngas emissions laws and regulations (and any related laws or \nregulations), so long as these laws require state and local reductions \nof greenhouse gas emissions at least as stringent as those required by \nfederal law. There will be no express, implied, field, or conflict \npreemption of these regional, state, or local efforts.'' The report \nlanguage concludes by saying, ``In interpreting the scope of this \nsavings clause, the courts should follow the applicable precedent that \ncalls for a narrow reading of federal preemption of state and local \nauthority and a broad reading of this savings clause.'' Because of that \nconcern, I have filed an amendment that would make clear that nothing \nin this act confers authority on either the Federal Government or State \ngovernment to establish new standards in this area.\n  Lastly, I want to speak to why I am so concerned about the potential \nfor conflicting State and Federal regulations in this area, \nparticularly as it relates to greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. \nThe State of California has already issued regulations to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions from vehicles by establishing fuel economy \nstandards that would apply to vehicles sold in that State. A number of \nother States have either adopted similar regulations or indicated that \nthey intend to do so. The net effect of these regulations adopted in \nmany States across the country--if allowed to go into force--would be a \npatchwork of potentially conflicting regulations because the average \nfuel economy standard required in each State would be driven by the \nsales mix of vehicles in that particular State.\n  Moreover, the regulations adopted by the State of California--the \nmodel regulations that other States would adopt--include a provision \nthat is highly discriminatory against our domestic manufacturers. The \nCalifornia regulations have an exemption for manufacturers who sell \nless than 60,000 vehicles in the State. The effect of this exemption is \nthat the California law would only regulate vehicles made by Ford, GM, \nChrysler, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Other manufactures, such as \nVolkswagen, which is the fourth largest automaker in the world, would \nbe exempt from the California law. In addition, automakers from Korea, \nIndia, and China and their vehicles would be exempt from the California \nconstraints. Surely, we do not want to perpetuate such a discriminatory \nState law around the country. However, if the provisions of this bill \nconfer new authority on State governments to set separate standards, we \nmay do just that.\n  In response to questions I posed to Senator Boxer, the manager of the \nbill for the majority, concerning the scope of State and Federal \nauthority in this bill, I have obtained from Senator Boxer answers to \nmy questions to her, which clarify her intent as the author of the \nlanguage in question. I will ask that the text of the questions and her \nanswers be printed at the end of my statement.\n  I have highlighted a number of ways this legislation could be \nrepaired. I filed amendments and cosponsored other filed amendments, \nwhich would do that. I agree with many provisions in this bill. The \nbill attempts to provide the necessary funding and technical resources \nso that we can successfully transition to a low carbon economy and \nrecognizes at least in part the burdens of this transition. I am \npleased that the substitute amendment provides more funding for \nmanufacturing States to implement a variety of programs and measures \nthat would help mitigate any negative impacts from global warming or \nthe regulatory requirements of this bill. I am also pleased that the \nbill funds advancements in technology that could provide jobs and also \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The bill establishes a national wildlife adaptation fund with \nmandatory funding that could be used for a very broad range of \nactivities including Great Lakes restoration projects. In developing a \nplan for wildlife adaptation, the bill specifically requires the \nPresident to consider the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy \nwhich was developed with extensive public involvement. I have long \nsupported the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, but the lack \nof funding has presented a serious impediment to implementing it. The \nPresident's plan must include measures to protect, maintain, and \nrestore coastal ecosystems to ensure that the ecosystems are more \nresilient to withstand the additional stresses associated with climate \nchange, including water level and temperature changes in Great Lakes. \nThe National Wildlife Adaptation Fund would be distributed to federal \nagencies for a series of wildlife programs, and the Great Lakes are \neligible to receive funds through many of these programs. Each agency \nhas the discretion to allocate funds to its various programs so it is \nunknown how much money the Great Lakes would receive.\n  To be sure, far-ranging action is needed to confront the daunting \nchallenges of global climate change. While we are just now beginning to \nsee the preliminary impacts of global warming, most scientists agree \nthat the problems of climate change will only worsen in the future. I \nam hopeful that this debate has laid a foundation for us to move \nforward and for the United States to lead in what may be the defining \nissue of our planet's future environment. The potential costs of global \nclimate change are tremendous, and these costs will only mount if we \nwait too long to address this critical problem. Clearly, we need to act \nto avert a global catastrophe. However, this action must be taken in a \nway that does not needlessly sacrifice additional American \nmanufacturing jobs and further burden the working men and women of our \ncountry with higher gas, food, and energy prices. We need to invest in \nadvanced technology that will help create jobs and spur our economy as \nwell. With significant investment in research and development, public-\nprivate partnerships and incentives for manufacturers to invest in new \ntechnologies, we can make great technological leaps to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions not only here but around the world.\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the materials to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, United States Senate, S-221, the Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader and Chairman Boxer: As Democrats from \n     regions of the country that will be most immediately affected \n     by climate legislation, we want to share our concerns with \n     the bill that is currently before the Senate. We commend your \n     leadership in attempting to address one of the most \n     significant threats to this and future generations; however, \n     we cannot support final passage of the Boxer Substitute in \n     its current form.\n       We believe a federal cap and trade program must not only \n     significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also ensure \n     that consumers and workers in all regions of the U.S. are \n     protected from undue hardship. A federal cap and trade \n     program is perhaps the most significant endeavor undertaken \n     by Congress in over 70 years and must be done with great \n     care. To that point we have laid out the following principles \n     and concerns that must be considered and fully addressed in \n     any final legislation.\n       Contain Costs and Prevent Harm to the U.S. Economy: We hope \n     that you recognize, as we do, the inherent uncertainty in \n     predicting the costs of achieving the emission caps set forth \n     in this or any climate legislation. While placing a cost on \n     carbon is important, we believe that there must be a balance \n     and a short-term cushion when new technologies may not be \n     available as hoped for or are more expensive than assumed. \n     There are many options to deal with the issue and all should \n     be up for discussion in order to meet our environmental and \n     economic goals. Ultimately, we must strive to form a \n     partnership with regulated industries to help them reduce \n     emissions as they transition from an old energy economy to a \n     new energy economy which will protect both our environment \n     and our economy.''\n       Invest Aggressively in New Technologies and Deployment of \n     Existing Technologies: There is no doubt that we need a \n     technological revolution to enter into a low carbon economy. \n     It is critical that we design effective mechanisms to augment \n     and accelerate government-sponsored technology R programs \n     and incentives that will motivate rapid deployment of those \n     technologies without picking winners and losers. We also want \n     to include proposals to provide funding for carbon capture \n     and storage and other critical low carbon technologies in \n     advance of resources being available through the auction of \n     emission allowances. We also need to aggressively deploy \n     existing energy efficiency technologies now to retrofit \n     millions of homes, buildings and manufacturing facilities to \n     reduce electricity costs for everyone.\n       Treat States Equitably: Just as some groups of consumers \n     will be more severely affected by the cost of compliance, so \n     too will our states. The allocation structure of a cap-and-\n     trade bill must be designed to balance these burdens across \n     states and regions and be sufficiently transparent to be \n     understood.\n       Protect America's Working Families: Any legislation must \n     recognize that working families are going to be affected most \n     significantly by any cap and trade legislation. Price relief \n     for these families must be included in any federal cap and \n     trade program. For instance, one way to provide some relief \n     would be to provide additional allowances to utilities whose \n     electricity prices are regulated, which would help to keep \n     electricity prices low.\n       Protect U.S. Manufacturing Jobs and Strengthen \n     International Competitiveness: The Lieberman-Warner bill \n     contains a mechanism to protect U.S. manufacturers from \n     international competitors that do not face the same carbon \n     constraints. If this mechanism does not work, or is found to \n     be noncompliant with the World Trade Organization, then the \n     program needs to be modified or suspended. The final bill \n     must include adequate safeguards to ensure a truly equitable \n     and effective global effort that minimizes harm to the U.S. \n     economy and protects American jobs. Furthermore, we must \n     adequately help manufacturers transition to a low carbon \n     economy to maintain domestic jobs and production.\n       Fully Recognize Agriculture and Forestry's Role: \n     Agriculture and forestry are not regulated under the bill but \n     they can contribute to reducing emissions by over 20% \n     domestically. Furthermore, international deforestation \n     contributes to 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. \n     Strong, aggressive and verifiable offset policies can fully \n     utilize the capabilities of our farmers and forests. A strong \n     offset policy can also reduce the costs of a cap and trade \n     program while maintaining our strong environmental goals.\n       Clarify Federal/State Authority: Congress should adopt a \n     mandatory federal cap-and-trade program that will be the \n     single regulatory regime for controlling greenhouse gas \n     emissions. Existing state laws and initiatives should be \n     integrated into the federal cap-and-trade program where the \n     policies do not conflict. Federal uniformity in this area \n     should be made clear in the statutory language to prevent \n     conflict in regulation, preserve overall efficiency, and \n     ensure harmonization of regulations. Where a conflict exists, \n     federal law needs to clearly prevail.\n       Provide Accountability for Consumer Dollars: The cap and \n     trade program developed in the Lieberman-Warner bill has the \n     potential to raise over $7 trillion. Much of these funds will \n     be indirectly paid for by consumers through increased energy \n     prices. The federal government has a fundamental obligation \n     to ensure these funds are being spent in a responsible and \n     wise manner. The development of any cap and trade program \n     must recognize the sensitivity of this obligation and \n     eliminate all possibility of waste, fraud or abuse.\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure that any \n     final bill will address the problems of climate change \n     without imposing undue hardship on our states, key industrial \n     sectors and consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Debbie Stabenow, John D. Rockefeller, Carl Levin, Blanche \n           Lincoln, Mark Pryor, Jim Webb, Evan Bayh, Claire \n           McCaskill, Sherrod Brown, Ben Nelson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n              Questions of Senator Levin to Senator Boxer\n\n       Would you be able to provide answers to these questions \n     prior to the cloture vote on the Boxer Substitute to S. 3036?\n       Relative to the pending substitute,\n       1. Does the substitute (or underlying bill) directly or \n     indirectly establish or provide federal or state authority to \n     set standards relative to greenhouse gas emissions from \n     mobile sources?\n       2.

Question: Does this bill in any way amend, change, or \n     modify the other statutes relating to the authority of the \n     Federal and State governments to adopt vehicle emissions \n     standards? Answer: No.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the cloture vote on \nthe climate change legislation pending before the Senate.\n  Global warming is a problem that we must address and the sooner the \nbetter. We must meet it with a strong and mandatory regulatory system. \nOf all the possible options, a cap-and-trade system makes the most \nsense. Turning that concept into legislative language is not easy, and \nturning it into legislative language that can become law is far harder \nstill.\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\n  The substitute amendment before us is the product of a lot of hard \nwork and passion to do the right thing. I applaud that and thank the \nsponsors for their sincere efforts. There are many ideas in this \namendment that I support, but, as the sponsors know, I also have many \nconcerns about the substance of their proposal. I am sorry that we will \nnot have a chance to debate the many complex and far-reaching issues \nthey present.\n  I have been in the Senate for 25 years. I have learned, and firmly \nbelieve, that the only way to write legislation that stands a good \nchance of becoming law is to ensure that all sides have a legitimate \nopportunity to comment on and contribute to legislation as it is being \nwritten. I know very well from my own experience that in bills as \ncomplicated as this one, many Senators will have concerns that they \nwould like to see resolved. It is the prerogative of the authors to \ninclude these issues or not. But it is important to assure all Senators \nthat their concerns have been carefully and openly considered and that \neven if the sponsors don't share those concerns, the right of Senators \nto have them considered by the full Senate will be protected. Without \nthese assurances, it is much harder to ask Senators to support the \nfinal product and work for its passage. I hope that when we return to \nthis issue, we can use such a process to produce a bill that will be \nsigned into law.\n  I am especially disappointed by the tactics we have seen in recent \ndays from the other side of the aisle to slow this bill's progress and \nfrustrate the amendment process. While Senators certainly have the \nright to use all 30 hours of postcloture debate time following cloture \non the motion to proceed and to make the Senate clerks spend 9 hours \nreading the text of a long substitute amendment, it is hard to square \nthose actions with any sense of real concern about this critical issue \nwe should be working on.\n  We will be turning to the Defense bill later this month. I have a \nhard time imagining that the same tactics will be applied. That would \nbe totally inconsistent with our responsibilities for national \nsecurity. Similarly, the tactics of the past few days have been totally \ninconsistent with our responsibility to deal seriously with this \nimportant issue.\n  I have struggled with this cloture vote. A vote for cloture can be \nseen as a message vote that rejects the tactical maneuvering we have \nseen to prevent consideration of this bill. At the same time, if \ncloture is invoked it will mean that only a tightly prescribed set of \namendments would be in order. I do not believe that the problems in the \nlegislation before us can be adequately corrected under postcloture \nprocedural constraints. Ultimately, though, we must send a message \nabout how important this issue is and how it should not be hamstrung by \nobstructionist parliamentary tactics. That is why I voted for the \ncloture motion laid down by the majority leader.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Climate Change Act of 2008 wisely \nrecognizes that chemicals such as hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, and \nhydrochlorofluorocarbons, HCFCs, are valuable commercial products that \nare used in refrigeration equipment, home and automobile air \nconditioners, aerosols, insulating foams, and other products and should \nbe treated differently than other greenhouse gases. These important \ngases are essential to the energy efficient operation of many of the \nappliances and refrigeration equipment American consumers and \nbusinesses rely upon. Having a separate market for HFCs is designed to \nreduce emissions of these gases over time, while safeguarding the \nbusiness model of the producers and users of these gases in energy \nefficient equipment and products.\n  The Montreal Protocol treaty has been widely praised as a model of \ninternational cooperation to phase out the production of many ozone \ndepleting substances including Freon and other CFC-based gases. \nAccordingly, the industry substituted HFCs for these substances, but \nnow these gases are thought to contribute to anthropogenic global \nwarming. The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phaseout \nof HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs.\n  The regulation of hydrofluorcarbon refrigerants represents a major \ncomponent of the Climate Security Act of 2008, and will have a \nsignificant impact on jobs, taxpayers, businesses that manufacture and \nimport these chemicals, and the millions of users of these chemicals in \nrefrigeration and air conditioning equipment as well as other \napplications. The businesses in this industry sector have a commendable \ntrack record of protecting the environment, and are successfully making \nthe transition from ozone-depleting refrigerants to HFCs. Now, as there \nis a call to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs to \naddress global warming, we must recognize the need for a regulatory \nregime that reflects the industry's complex marketplace dynamics, cost \nto the economy, and ensures fair and equitable treatment for producers, \nimporters, and end users.\n  It takes about 10 years for industry to develop a new class of \nrefrigeration gases with the required thermodynamic properties, low \nflammability and toxicity, and reduced global warming potential than \nwhat is currently in use. At this time, there is no known commercially \navailable replacement for HFCs. The gas providers and equipment \nmanufacturers will have to invest a significant amount of time and \nmoney to develop these new, safe refrigeration gases and the compatible \nequipment that can use them.\n  I believe that we can come to a reasonable and balanced approach on \nthis issue. The fact is that we need a realistic baseline. The baseline \nfor 2012 should be set at an amount necessary to avoid a supply \nshortage, the cost of which will be borne by small businesses and \nconsumers. One study suggests that 365 million metric tons is an \nappropriate baseline. Such a baseline will provide for a smoother \ntransition in subsequent years, which also will result in less cost to \nsmall businesses and taxpayers without any adverse effect on the \nenvironment.\n  I encourage Congress, the EPA, the gas producers, and the end-use \nequipment manufacturers to work closely together to establish a more \nreasonable emission cap and timeline for the transition from HFCs to a \ncost-effective, low greenhouse gas potential, alternative substitute. \nThrough cooperation, I am sure we can establish a program that will \nguarantee the future development of economically sound and \nenvironmentally friendly alternatives for these important chemicals.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is disappointing that a minority of \nSenators has chosen to delay and stall rather than allowing us to \nconsider the serious matter before the Senate--climate change. In order \nto have the opportunity to debate and vote on amendments, I support \ncloture on the Climate Security Act of 2008, S. 3036. The Climate \nSecurity Act is far from perfect, but it represents a serious effort to \nreduce greenhouse gas pollution, lessen our dependence on foreign oil, \nand spur new technologies and green job opportunities. By supporting \ncloture, we can begin to do the hard work of improving this legislation \nso that we can enact a workable, effective cap-and-trade program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week the Senate has undertaken the \nbeginning of a historic debate on global warming. For the past week we \nhave attempted to pass this important legislation that will reduce the \ncarbon dioxide pollution that causes global warming, while using market \nincentives to create American jobs. Unfortunately it appears the other \nside of aisle has no interest in enacting this important global warming \nlegislation. I am disappointed a minority in the Senate are blocking \nour efforts to move forward on this important bill.\n  The time for debate about the existence of global warming has ended. \nWe are staring down the barrel of global crisis if we do not \naggressively address this problem now, and not 5 years from now or when \nthe oil companies decide the time is right.\n  The most recent assessment of global climate change published by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, in November found that \nthe Earth's climate indisputably has warmed over the past century. Most \nof this increase is very likely due to the increase in greenhouse gas \nconcentrations created by humans--primarily from the use of fossil \nfuels. As we look around us every day and see all of the exhaust gases \nemanating from factories, buildings, and vehicles, it only\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nstands to reason that human activity now, and for much of the last \ncentury, increasingly has become a factor in the quality of the air we \nbreathe and in the natural processes of our environment.\n  The U.S. Climate Change Science Program, CCSP, recently released the \nfirst of several climate change reports, and their assessment was \nstark. They report that even under the most optimistic carbon dioxide \nemission scenarios, we can expect a host of profound impacts that range \nfrom changes in sea level and regional and super-regional temperature \nhikes, to increased incidence of disturbances such as forest fires, \ninsect outbreaks, severe storms, and drought.\n  If we do not take aggressive action now to curb emissions, our \nenvironmental and economic future is bleak. Even as we speak, our world \nis experiencing alarming and detrimental changes from manmade \ngreenhouse gases. The Arctic Sea ice melted in 2007 to the smallest \ncoverage since satellite measurements began in 1979--perhaps 50 percent \nbelow sea ice levels of the 1950s. The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data \nCenter at the University of Colorado projects that the Arctic Ocean \ncould be ice-free in summer as early as 2030.\n  As if to highlight the urgency, while the EPA was recently delaying a \ndecision over whether to add polar bears to the threatened species list \ndue to a decrease in their habitat, more than 160 square miles of \narctic ice collapsed away from the Wilkins Ice Shelf. If we needed any \nclearer signal that now is the time to address this problem, the \npartial collapse of an arctic shelf formed more than 1500 years ago \nshould leave no doubt.\n  How do we responsibly and aggressively address this problem? \nAccording to the Bush administration, we should talk about curbing \nglobal climate change on the one hand, while quietly eroding the safety \nnet that had been designed to better protect our environment with the \nother.\n  We need only to look at the recent unprecedented intervention by this \nadministration in the EPA's decision to override the institutional \nadvice of the EPA's own experts--not to mention the Clean Air Act--and \nstop California, Vermont, and 15 other States from setting their own \ntailpipe emission standards. Even the release of CCSP research on \nclimate change last week had to be mandated by court order--and during \nthe course of this research, scientists left the CCSP alleging the \nadministration was rewriting the science for political purposes.\n  Add to all of this the auctioning of environmentally sensitive public \nlands for oil development, the weakening of air quality regulations for \ncorporate polluters, and the billions of dollars of handouts in the \nform of subsidies to oil companies at the expense of renewable energy, \nand it adds up to 8 years of an administration that cares more about \ncorporate profits than the public's health and our environment's \nprotection.\n  This legislation is not a perfect solution, but its goals are \npositive and its solutions are constructive. The annual reductions in \nemissions, funding for renewable energy technologies, and a cap-and-\ntrade system designed to reward companies that invest in cleaner energy \nare innovative solutions to a problem that won't just go away on its \nown.\n  Failure to address global warming is a failure to address weather \ncatastrophes that can destroy entire Nations, a failure to address the \nloss of species that will never return, and a failure to pass along to \nfuture generations--our children, our grandchildren, and beyond--the \nkind of world we want for them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the consensus among scientists, whose \nexpertise I respect, is that there's something happening to the climate \nof this planet that we need to be concerned about. As a result, I \nbelieve that the Congress needs to enact climate change legislation to \naddress global warming It is one of the significant challenges of our \ntime. Addressing the issue of climate change will require a national \ncommitment of all the resources that are available to us to change \ncourse and protect our planet.\n  I voted no on the motion to invoke cloture today, but this should not \nbe seen as a statement of my opposition to enact mandatory, climate \nchange legislation in the future. The specific proposal that has been \nbrought to the floor of the U.S. Congress by Senators Boxer, Lieberman, \nWarner, Kerry, and others is a legitimate and thoughtful piece of \nlegislation.\n  The Senate has voted on climate change legislation in 2003, 2005, and \nnow in 2008. In all three cases, many Members have expressed their \nopposition to any mandatory legislation. Yet, during this 5-year \nperiod, there has been a significant shift in public awareness, the \ncertainty of the science, and the demand for legislative action. I hope \nthat industry in this country will understand what we are required to \ndo and start preparing for it.\n  When there is a new President and a new Congress in 2009, I predict \nthat there will be another debate, and there will be passage of \nlandmark U.S. climate change legislation. Major pieces of landmark \nlegislation such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, \nand others took several Congresses to be refined and enacted. I believe \nthat time for climate change legislation will be in the 111th Congress.\n  In order for our country to dramatically shift our energy use to a \nlower greenhouse gas emitting blend, a strong commitment from all \nsectors of the economy is needed. We need a ``moon shot'' approach to \nincreasing energy efficiency and conservation, renewable energy \nproduction and technologies that allow us to capture and sequester \ncarbon emissions from fossil fuel energy generation.\n  I am a big fan of renewable energy, including wind, solar and \ngeothermal energy as well as biofuels. In order for these energy \nsources to become a larger portion of the energy used in this country, \nhowever, we need to demonstrate a robust commitment to funding research \nand development to increase the efficiency of renewable energy and \ndrive the costs down so they are competitive with fossil energy \nsources. Until they are cost-competitive, we need to provide long-term \nincentives that signal certainty to potential investors. Even as we \nstrongly support our renewable energy research, development and \ndeployment, we also need to understand that in order to meet our energy \nneeds we will need to continue to use fossil fuels--but use them in a \ndifferent way.\n  For example, we use coal to produce about 50 percent of the \nelectricity we now use in this country. Coal is going to continue to be \na significant part of our energy future, so that means we must make a \nmajor research push to find ways to the capture the carbon and \nsequester the carbon.\n  The climate change bill that is now on the floor includes what is \ncalled ``kick start'' funding and ``bonus'' funding that its authors \nsay addresses the needs of the industry to get carbon capture and \nstorage. However, the bill does not provide any funding for the \nsubstantial research and development that will be necessary to find \nways to capture the carbon and safely sequester it.\n  Similarly, advancing renewable energy will require substantial \nfunding, of which there is not enough in the underlying bill. There is \nmoney in the underlying bill for demonstration and commercialization of \ntechnologies, both in the renewable area and carbon capture and \nstorage. But there is not the kind of funding that will be necessary to \nfund the research and development at the front end of the process for \nboth carbon capture and renewables.\n  I prepared and filed amendments to address those two deficiencies. \nTogether, my amendments would add $30 billion in the first 12 years to \ncarbon capture and storage and renewable energy. The amendments provide \na full commitment by our country to fund the necessary research and \nprovide the opportunity to succeed in both areas on the front end. We \nwill not succeed in our quest to address global warming unless we \ninvest in these areas of research. The product of research for the \nenvironmentally safe use of coal and the expanded use of renewables is \nwhat will allow us to meet the targets in the global warming bill.\n  Today, however, we find a tangled procedure in the United States \nSenate by which we are asked to vote to shut off debate and vote \ncloture on the Boxer substitute. This means that my amendment and \nothers designed to improve the bill will not be allowed to\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\neven be offered. That is because the minority blocked the process when \nthe bill came to the floor, so no amendments have been allowed to be \noffered. Therefore, none are pending, and post cloture, only pending \namendments can be voted upon.\n  In short, voting for cloture means I would be voting to deny myself \nthe opportunity to offer the important amendments I have just \ndescribed. I am not prepared to do that. I am prepared to seriously \naddress global warming. I will count myself as someone who is going to \nvote to advance appropriate legislation to address global warming. But \nI am not going to vote this morning to prevent myself from offering the \namendments that I think are necessary to make this legislation work.\n  Let me state again, I think my colleagues that have brought the \nWarner-Lieberman-Boxer bill to the floor today have done some good \nwork, and I am appreciative of their effort. The bill in its current \nstate is not ready to become the law of the land. We need to have a \nserious debate about this legislation, amendments need to be \nconsidered, the bill needs to be modified in significant ways before it \nshould be passed by this Congress.\n  Let me repeat, a piece of legislation that will have some of the most \nsignificant consequences for the environment, for the economy, and for \na way of life than anything we have done in many decades in this \nCongress has been brought to the floor and will now be subject to a \ncloture vote without any opportunity to offer an amendment. That is not \na process that I can support.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of \namendment No. 4950, which I have offered to the Climate Security Act, \nS. 3036, along with Senators Snowe, Wyden, and Cantwell.\n  This amendment is intended to improve section 412, the market \noversight and enforcement provisions. I helped author section 412 of \nthe Climate Security Act with Senator Dodd and Senator Whitehouse, and \nI believe this amendment will improve the underlying provision by even \nmore clearly prohibiting speculation, fraud, and false reporting by \ntraders in carbon markets.\n  Specifically, this amendment would add a ``prohibitions'' subsection \nto section 412, to establish that it is illegal:\n\n       No. 1, to knowingly provide to the President, or his \n     designee, any false information relating to the price or \n     quantity of emission allowances sold, purchased, transferred, \n     banked, or borrowed by the individual or entity, with the \n     intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled;\n       No. 2, to use in connection with the purchase or sale of an \n     emission allowance any manipulative or deceptive device or \n     contrivance--within the meaning of section 10(b) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j(b))--or;\n       No. 3, to otherwise cheat or defraud another market \n     participant.\n\n  Including these prohibitions, which were part of the Emission \nAllowance Market Transparency Act that I introduced with Senator Snowe, \nclearly establishes the legal framework under which market manipulation \nin these markets will be pursued. But unlike our legislation, the \namendment does not instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to \nenforce these prohibitions. Instead, the amendment instructs the \nPresident to decide which agency must conduct enforcement within 270 \ndays of enactment.\n  I believe this amendment is necessary because it will establish that \nthe full legal history of the Securities Exchange Act's \nantimanipulation provision forms the foundation upon which the carbon \nmarket's principles-based regulation must stand. It gives guidance to \nfuture regulators on the intent and meaning of the core principle that \n``the market shall be designed to prevent fraud and manipulation.'' And \nit adds teeth to that principle by making manipulation and fraud in \nthis market a defined crime subject to severe penalty.\n  With this amendment, authority to prevent fraud and manipulation in \ncarbon markets will mirror the authority over natural gas and \nelectricity markets that Congress granted to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission in 2005, as well as the authority over crude oil \nthat Congress granted to the Federal Trade Commission in 2007. By \nmirroring proven market oversight mechanisms that protect market \nparticipants and consumers, this amendment allows us to slip already \nbroken-in regulatory concepts onto a new market.\n  I believe this amendment will strongly discourage traders from \nseeking to manipulate the market. If we don't set up a framework for \noversight, the greenhouse gas market could turn into a Wild West. The \nmarket--estimated to be worth as much as $100 billion annually--would \ninvite the worst kind of manipulation, fraud, and abuse. The resulting \nvolatility would affect consumer energy costs.\n  This is not a hypothetical. In 2000 and 2001, newly created \nCalifornia energy markets lacked the basic protections in this bill. \nThe electricity and related natural gas markets emerged before the law \ncaught up, and much of the manipulation that resulted, shockingly, was \nlegal.\n  Enron, for instance, ran a market where only they knew the prices. \nWithout market transparency laws, this one-sided market was legal. \nEnron manipulated natural gas and electricity prices--but nothing in \nthe Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act made this manipulation \nunlawful.\n  Only years later, after millions of consumers had been harmed, after \nbillions of dollars had been lost, and after the entire West had \nendured an energy crisis largely fabricated by traders, did Congress \nact.\n  In 2005, Congress succeeded in prohibiting manipulation in natural \ngas and electricity markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nhas put this authority to good use. It has performed aggressive natural \ngas market oversight, and has brought its first manipulation case, \nagainst Amaranth--a notorious hedge fund that allegedly manipulated \nnatural gas prices month after month.\n  This Nation needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and most \neconomists agree that a cap-and-trade system with a greenhouse gas \nmarket would be the most cost efficient way to guarantee emissions \nreductions.\n  Economists also tell us that markets are most efficient when buyers \nand sellers have complete information, no market participant can cheat \nanother, and prices result from supply and demand, not manipulation.\n  Bottom line: this amendment improves a provision designed to protect \nthe integrity of greenhouse gas emissions markets, and it should be \nincluded as part of any cap-and-trade legislation approved by Congress.\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 308(a) of S. Con. Res. \n21, the 2008 budget resolution, I previously filed revisions to S. Con. \nRes. 21, the 2008 budget resolution. Those revisions were made for \nSenate amendment 4825, a complete substitute for S. 3036, the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008.\n  The Senate did not adopt Senate amendment 4825. As a consequence, I \nam further revising the 2008 budget resolution and reversing the \nadjustments made pursuant to section 308(a) to the aggregates and the \nallocation provided to the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for Senate amendment 4825.\n  Mr. President, this will be the final revision to the 2008 budget \nresolution. This week, Congress passed S. Con. Res. 70, the 2009 budget \nresolution. The 2009 budget resolution now replaces the 2008 budget \nresolution for purposes of budget enforcement in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S. Con. \nRes. 21 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--S.

Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the \npreeminent environmental challenge facing our generation--climate \nchange. I believe we must urgently address this looming issue--in \npartnership with the rest of the world--and I commend the bill's \nauthors for finally getting this dialogue started after years of White \nHouse and congressional inaction.\n  Scientists have determined conclusively that an ongoing buildup of \ngreenhouse gas emissions is causing the Earth's climate to warm and \nwill likely lead to drought, flooding, and other catastrophic natural \ndisasters.\n  The most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange report found that about 1 billion people will be affected by \nwater shortages because of declining snow cover on land currently used \nby one-sixth of the world's population.\n  The report also predicts global warming will parch large swaths of \nthe Earth, threatening the existence of up to 30 percent of its animals \nand plants.\n  Global warming's impact on the Pacific Northwest could be \nparticularly harmful because our temperatures are rising faster than \nthe global average. In Washington, climate change is expected to alter \nthe region's historic water cycle, threatening drinking water supplies, \nwildlife and salmon habitat, and the availability of emissions-free \nhydropower. We are also already seeing the ominous beginning of ocean \nacidification off our coastline.\n  According to a University of Washington analysis, temperatures in the \nPuget Sound region will rise about 2 degrees by 2050. Cascade mountain \ntemperatures could rise 10 degrees or more, causing snowpacks to be \nreduced to just 20 percent of their current levels by 2090.\n  In the eastern half of my State, temperatures are expected to rise \neven faster. By 2050, parts of the Columbia Basin could be up to 5 \ndegrees hotter. In 2090, much of the basin will be up to 8 degrees \nwarmer, very harmful to eastern Washington agriculture.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion of what the accumulation of \ngreenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide is doing to change the Earth's \natmosphere. I am very concerned about that. But today I would like to \nhelp my colleagues appreciate carbon dioxide is also slowly, silently, \nbut surely devastating our oceans and the marine life that depend on \nthem.\n  I would like to share with you the silent devastation of ocean \nacidification.\n  Since the start of the Industrial Revolution 130 years ago, humans \nhave released more than 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere, increasing the global atmospheric carbon dioxide \nconcentration by 35 percent. But while carbon dioxide is accumulating \nin our atmosphere, it is also being rapidly absorbed by our oceans. At \nleast one-third of our carbon dioxide emissions end up in the oceans--\nmore than half a trillion tons since the start of the Industrial \nRevolution.\n  For decades, we assumed that the oceans absorbed these greenhouse \ngases to the benefit of our atmosphere, with no side-effect for the \nseas.\n  Science now shows that we were wrong. Today, ocean acidification is \nactually changing the very chemistry of the oceans. As carbon dioxide \nis absorbed, seawater becomes more acidic and begins to withhold the \nbasic chemical building blocks needed by many marine organisms.\n  According to National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration \nscientists, humans have increased the oceans' acidity by 30 percent \nsince the start of the Industrial Revolution. In such acidic waters, \ncoral reefs--the rainforests of the sea--cannot build their skeletons. \nIn colder waters like the waters of Washington State, scientists \npredict a more acidic ocean could dissolve the shells of the tiny \norganisms that make up the base of the ocean's food chain.\n  A recent article in last month's journal Science detailed how acidic \nseawater is already moving closer to shallow waters off of Washington \nState, the habitat for most of my State's marine life.\n  These frightening findings were a surprise to researchers who didn't \nexpect finding acidic water for several more decades. Because ocean \nacidification has the capacity to lead to a total collapse of ocean \nfood chains, it will have major impacts on coastal communities that \nrely on the ocean's bounty.\n  And when we add ocean acidification to the effects of carbon dioxide \ncoming from a warming atmosphere--increasing ocean temperatures, \nchanging winds and currents, and rising sea levels, it is clear that \nour carbon emissions will impact our ocean environments in ways far too \ndevastating to ignore.\n  Not many people think of orca whales, salmon, coral reefs, or oysters \nwhen they drive their cars to work each day, but as ocean acidification \nbegins to take its toll, there is definitely a connection between the \ncarbon emissions we emit and the ocean environments we enjoy and depend \non.\n  Last week, I held a Commerce Committee field hearing in Seattle to \nexamine how climate change and ocean acidification are impacting the \nmarine environments of my State. What I heard from my constituents was \nnothing short of frightening.\n  Brett Bishop, a fifth-generation shellfish farmer in Mason County, \nWA, told me how his business is being devastated by the impacts of \nclimate change and ocean acidification. His story can be summed up by \ntwo words he said to me: ``I'm scared.''\n  Climate change is killing his business, and threatens to destroy \neverything his family has worked for over the past 150 years. If things \ncontinue on their current path and Mr. Bishop can't grow his shellfish, \nthen the bank will foreclose on the mortgage, his 27 employees will be \nleft jobless, and his family will lose their farm, their homes, and \ngenerations of hard work.\n  This is not some obscure scientific theory pieced together by \nacademic scientists. This is real, and it is happening now. Today it is \nshellfish farmers in Mason County, WA. but who will fall victim \ntomorrow? Commercial fishermen? Coastal tourism from dead coral reefs? \nRecreational fisheries?\n  These are frightening possibilities--but very real ones that our \nNation will face in the coming years. And unfortunately, if we don't \nact, Brett Bishop will be one of the millions of Americans with similar \nstories. And, unfortunately, these dangers are largely under the radar \nbecause they occur beneath the surface of the ocean.\n  That is why one of the amendments to the Climate Security Act I am \npleased to be part of includes a bill I introduced with Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey called the Federal Ocean Acidification \nResearch and Monitoring Act. Our bill, which passed the Senate Commerce \nCommittee unanimously last December, would establish a much-needed \nFederal research program on ocean acidification.\n  This amendment also incorporates my Climate Change Adaptation Act\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\nwhich was also approved unanimously by the Senate Commerce Committee. \nThis important legislation ensures that our Government plans for the \nchanges that global warming will inevitably bring. Because the reality \nis that even if we were somehow able to stop using fossil fuels today, \na certain degree of warming and ocean acidification will still occur \nover the next two or three decades. Planning for the future isn't just \ncommon sense--it is responsible Government.\n  That brings me back to the Climate Security Act the Senate is \ndebating today. This is the first comprehensive effort to legislate on \nclimate change that has come through the committee process. It is a \nhistoric feat, and in many ways it reflects the complexity of this \nissue and the varied views and stakeholder interests that accompany any \neffort to cap and trade climate change emissions.\n  I commend Senators Boxer, Lieberman, and Warner for their leadership \nin beginning this process and starting us on the path we know we must \ntake soon. As Sun Tzu said in the ``Art of War,'' ``the journey of a \nthousand miles begins with a single step.''\n  Unfortunately, it looks like our debate may end up being largely \nconfined to floor statements because opponents of the bill will succeed \nin blocking the consideration of any amendments. The minority even \nforced our hard-working Senate clerks to read the entire text of the \nbill, word for word, for almost 9 hours on Wednesday. Unfortunately, \nthat is about as fitting an example of how opponents want to stall, \ndelay, and preserve the status quo as one can imagine.\n  While I do believe we must act urgently and decisively to control our \nNation's and planet's greenhouse gas emissions, I do have a number of \nconcerns about the pending legislation.\n  Ironically, many of my concerns stem from the fact that Washington \nState is blessed with abundant, affordable, and emissions-free \nhydropower. Unfortunately, this bill fails to recognize that Washington \nState has significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions than other parts \nof the country and how that dynamic poses unique energy challenges \ngoing forward.\n  Some of these challenges are that Washington's hydropower system is \nlargely tapped out, so any future electricity generation will largely \ncome from relatively more polluting sources for which we will not \nreceive any emission allocations under the pending legislation. \nSimilarly, the bill does not provide Washington with any allocations we \nwill need to provide electricity to the 1.5 million people moving to \nthe Puget Sound region by 2020, unlike other parts of the country that \nrely primarily on fossil fuel generation.\n  As currently drafted, the bill also effectively penalizes the Pacific \nNorthwest for its years of aggressive energy efficiency measures, which \nhave avoided the construction of 3,400 megawatts of additional \ncapacity. In other words, if we would have built fossil fuel plants \ninstead of conserving, we would be getting emission allocations for it \ntoday. In addition, since we have already taken advantage of many of \nthe low-hanging efficiency ``fruit,'' additional efficiency savings \nwould be relatively more costly than in other parts of the country.\n  I also believe the legislation needs to more carefully consider how \nFederal climate legislation might preempt or overturn the \ngroundbreaking efforts in Washington State, such as the Western Climate \nInitiative.\n  As a scarred veteran of the Western energy crisis, I also have strong \nconcerns that there are not enough safeguards in the bill to prevent \nexcessive speculation and manipulation of emission allocation trading \nmarkets. Even today we see what happens when there is not enough \ntransparency and clear rules of conduct in energy markets. Excessive \nspeculation and possibly market manipulation artificially elevate \nprices and hurt consumers.\n  And finally, we need to make sure that anything we do is actually \ngoing to do the job. Unfortunately, I understand that the emission-\nreduction caps proposed by this legislation are actually not strong \nenough to slow or stop global warming according to the latest science.\n  While I am disappointed that there probably won't be an opportunity \nto improve the historic legislation before us today, I am proud that \nafter Congress came under new management last year we were able to \ncraft and pass the greenest, most important energy bill in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The Energy Independence and Security Act, which became law last \nDecember, will create cleaner, more diverse sources of energy supply, \nbuild new growth industries that support high-wage ``green-collar'' \njobs, give consumers and businesses more affordable energy choices, and \nprotect our environment. For instance, this landmark energy legislation \naggressively boosts energy efficiency efforts by making our lighting \nand appliances more efficient and reducing the Federal Government's \nenergy use.\n  Under the new law, fuel economy standards will increase for the first \ntime in over two decades to a nationwide average of 35 miles per \ngallon, up from 25 miles per gallon today, by 2020 for all vehicles, \nincluding SUV's and light trucks. By 2030, these measures will displace \nthe equivalent of one-third of our foreign oil needs and save American \nconsumers at least half a trillion dollars in energy costs.\n  And the new energy law includes mandates and incentives that biofuels \nfrom nonfood feedstocks such as agriculture and wood waste become a \nmuch more significant part of our Nation's effort to end our dependence \non fossil fuels and imported oil.\n  All together, these measures and others will reduce our Nation's \ncarbon dioxide emissions by the same amount as all of our vehicles on \nthe road produce today.\n  I think it is important to note that while tackling climate change \nwill not be easy or free, moving to a clean energy system, which is a \nprerequisite to any serious effort to reduced greenhouse gases, has \nmany benefits beyond reducing greenhouse gases and the costs of \ninaction will be far more significant.\n  According to a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council and \nTufts University, if the United States doesn't do something soon to \ndramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could cost the country \n$3.8 trillion annually from higher energy and water costs, real estate \nlosses from hurricanes, rising sea levels, and other problems.\n  According to the Apollo Alliance, a labor-environmental partnership, \ninvesting $30 billion per year over 10 years would create 3.3 million \njobs and boost the Nation's GDP by $1.4 trillion. The Apollo Alliance \nestimates that dollars invested in clean energy create more jobs than \nthose invested in traditional energy sources because renewable energy \nis more labor intensive. It is possible for a Nation to grow while \nbeing environmentally conscious. For example, the British economy grew \nby about 40 percent since 1990 while their greenhouse gas emissions \ndecreased by 14 percent.\n  The science is undeniable that human activities are changing the \nworld we know and love and depend on for our well being. We are already \nseeing the effects on our oceans, our forests, our crops, and our \nwildlife--and unless we act, I am afraid the worst is yet to come.\n  We will only succeed in combating climate change if we work together, \nacross the aisle here in Congress, across our States with their very \ndifferent greenhouse gas profiles, and across the world. By working \ntogether we can find a path forward to solve this greatest of \nchallenges. And if we do it right, the solutions we create will also \nhelp address other pressing needs such as providing more clean and \nrenewable energy sources, high-wage manufacturing jobs, and new export \nmarkets.\n  Our Nation and the world is waiting for us to take action--and the \nlead in preventing and mitigating the catastrophic effects of global \nclimate change. Our children and their children and all of the world's \ncitizens' future depends on it. I look forward to continuing this \ndialog with my friends on both sides of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a \nperiod for the transaction of morning business, with Senators permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes each, and that Senator Chambliss be the \nfirst to be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, but I \nwill not object, I ask to have printed in the Record a statement by \nSenator McCain. If he were here, he would have voted for cloture.\n Mr. McCain. Mr. President, today, Senator John McCain released \nthe following statement on S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner Climate \nSecurity Act of 2008:\n\n       Global climate change is the most important environmental \n     challenge facing not only our nation, but the entire world. I \n     am confident that given the will, the federal government can \n     be a lead advocate for ensuring that America is doing its \n     part to reduce global warming, and join in the global effort \n     that is needed to address this world-wide environmental \n     issue.\n       Like many of my colleagues, I believe this legislation \n     needs to be debated, amended, improved, and ultimately, \n     enacted. While my schedule precludes me from being in \n     Washington, DC, tomorrow to cast my vote, if I were able, I \n     would vote to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment. \n     That does not mean I believe the pending bill is perfect, and \n     in fact, it is far from it. For example, the provisions to \n     impose Davis Bacon mandates should be removed. Most \n     importantly, it must include provisions championed by Senator \n     Graham and myself that would ensure that nuclear power, a \n     proven and clean energy source, is included among the \n     technologies supported in our efforts to address global \n     warming. Nuclear energy is an emission-free source of \n     electricity for the nation, which is why it simply must be \n     part of the comprehensive solution to addressing climate \n     change, and if it is not, I could not support the \n     legislation's final passage.\n       Unfortunately, despite the commitment and tireless efforts \n     of the bill sponsors, Senators Lieberman and Warner, it \n     appears that for now, the Senate, at the direction of the \n     Majority Leader, will choose to put politics above policy, \n     and Congress will fail to act yet again on this critical \n     issue. But rest assured, we will not give up until we finally \n     succeed in enacting needed, comprehensive cap and trade \n     legislation to address this urgent problem.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues. I wish to say, in \naddition to the names Senator Warner put in yesterday, we had \nstatements from Senators Obama, Clinton, Biden, and Kennedy, which \nmeans if all had been here, the vote would have been 54 votes. We are \nvery pleased with this and we thank them very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today, June 6, 2008, the 64th \nanniversary of D-day, to commend our Armed Forces for their ongoing \ncontributions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries where they are \ncurrently deployed, as well as their history of service and sacrifice \nfor our country and for the causes of freedom and democracy worldwide.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the Board of Visitors \nmeeting for the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, \nwhich is located at Fort Benning, GA. WHINSEC, as it is called, \nprovides security cooperation and strategic partnerships with countries \nin the Western Hemisphere in order to support democracy and human \nrights, and they have made a tremendous contribution since WHINSEC's \ninception in 2000.\n  The chairman of the Board of Visitors of WHINSEC, who is a Roman \nCatholic bishop, commented that members of the military are ``agents of \nmercy.'' He is correct, and ultimately that is the role our military \nhas played in the world in the 64 years since U.S. and Allied forces \nlanded on the beaches of Normandy.\n  No one joins the military to get rich and famous, since the life of \nmilitary personnel almost always takes place behind the scenes and out \nof the headlines. Many people join the military to achieve a better way \nof life and associate with a bigger cause than themselves. The military \nhas provided a way for countless numbers of Americans to improve their \nown quality of life and learn the skills they need to succeed. We \nshould be proud of the positive effect the military has on those who \nserve in its ranks.\n  But there is one thing everyone who serves in the military has in \ncommon, they join to serve. They join, realizing their service makes \nthe lives of their fellow Americans better and more secure. But also, \nthey know their service makes the lives in other countries safer and \nmore prosperous.\n  Without question, that is the result of the service of our military \npersonnel over the last 64 years in places such as Germany, France, \nBosnia, Kosovo, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, Grenada, Panama, Haiti, \nVietnam, and countless other locations where U.S. military personnel \nhave served and sacrificed. These countries are more prosperous today \nbecause of the commitment of our Nation's military personnel.\n  No military, and no institution for that matter, is perfect. However, \nwe should not be surprised that year after year the United States \nMilitary remains one of the most trusted professions. They deserve that \nposition based on their commitment to a cause greater than themselves, \ntheir integrity, and their commitment to excellence. Today, there are \n1.4 million personnel serving on Active Duty in our Nation's military, \nalong with 1.2 million serving in the Reserve components. All of them \ndeserve our appreciation and gratitude for their service, their \nsacrifice, and their contribution to our Nation's security and \ncontributions to freedom and democracy around the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing thanks for them and for \nthe key role they have played and continue to play in serving and \nsacrificing for our country and for those in other countries where they \nare serving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5350-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5350-S5351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to address an environmental issue, \nan economic issue, and a moral issue. Future generations will look back \non global warming as the defining issue of our time. Our children, \ntheir children, and their children will look back on this issue and \njudge us on how we confronted it.\n  If we treat global warming politically, as so many of the other side \nof the aisle did today, if we abdicate our responsibility, if we ignore \nreality, if we twiddle our thumbs as the destructive effects of global \nwarming intensify, we will lose our chance to shape the future because, \nsimply put, we will be squandering it.\n  I applaud Senator Boxer, the chairwoman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, a tireless advocate for clean air, safe drinking \nwater, and healthy families.\n  This was not an easy vote. This entire week I have listened to the \nspeeches on the Senate floor, and I have listened to my colleagues \nspeak eloquently on the need for global climate change legislation. I \nfully agree with the environmental goals of this bill--mandatory caps, \nthe science-based timeline. This, as I said, is the moral question of \nour generation. I have the utmost respect for my colleagues who have \nworked so long and so hard to craft this historic legislation and for \nenvironmental advocates in Ohio and across the country. I am 100 \npercent committed to passing a robust, mandatory cap-and-trade policy. \nHowever, while we have been debating climate policy, Ohioans have been \ngetting bad news.\n  This has been a particularly tough week for my State. In the last 7 \ndays, Ohioans learned that our State may soon lose another 10,000 jobs. \nThose are not just jobs. They are the building blocks, the foundation \nfor individual achievement, family security, and community \nsurvivability. They are about health care, they are about opportunity, \nthey are about sending kids to college, they are about admission to the \nmiddle class.\n  Now that foundation is crumbling--10,000 good-paying jobs in 1 week. \nSince 2001, Ohio has lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  We have, to be sure, a moral obligation to our planet. For me, that \nobligation stems from Scripture which makes each of us a steward of our \nplanet, of this Earth. We also have an opportunity and obligation to \nOhioans and\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nto all Americans. We have the opportunity and the obligation to write \nglobal warming policy that is sustainable, equitable, beneficial, both \ndomestically and globally, both environmentally and economically. We \ncan do that. We can write a bill to do that. We can write a law to do \nthat or we can settle for a work that I believe is still in progress.\n  I cannot settle and could not settle a moment ago in my vote for this \nlegislation because it needlessly may hurt my State because it fails to \nprotect against what could be a policy that exports emissions rather \nthan eliminating emissions.\n  I submitted five amendments to this bill that were designed to \nproduce a final bill that would combat global warming without \nundermining American families, without hurting families from Galion to \nGallipolis, from Cincinnati to Ashtabula. Unfortunately, after today's \ncloture vote, there was no opportunity to debate and vote on those \namendments. Given the chance, I would have fought to redistribute the \nfinancial burden imposed by this bill so Ohio would receive a fair \nshare, rather than the short end of the stick.\n\n  I would have fought to provide sufficient transition assistance for \nenergy-intensive manufacturing so our Nation does not lose those \ncrucial national-security oriented, in many cases, crucial jobs. I \nwould have fought to ensure domestic manufacturers a level playing \nfield with companies from countries without global warming \nrequirements.\n  A plant shuts down in Steubenville or Lima, OH, a plant that has \nfollowed Ohio and national environmental law over the years, and moves \nto China. We lose our jobs, and emissions get even greater because the \nChinese do not have the environmental laws we do. That is part of the \nproblem with U.S. trade policy. That is another time for another speech \nand another day. But if we don't take this right step to ensure \ndomestic manufacturers a level playing field with companies from \ncountries without global warming requirements, we might as well throw a \ngoing-away party for the steel industry, the cement industry, the glass \nindustry, aluminum industry, the chemical industry, for foundry after \nfoundry after foundry in Ravenna, Chillicothe, Mansfield, and Marion. \nWe might as well pray for a miracle when it comes to global warming \nbecause as we export those jobs to countries that have weak \nenvironmental laws, we will be exporting emissions so they come in \nquantities of twice as much from smokestacks in China than they come \nfrom smokestacks in Ohio.\n  I would have fought for greater capital investment in emerging green \nbusinesses and manufacturing. We need to go green to achieve our goals. \nWe need to rebuild our manufacturing sector to remain a self-sufficient \nnation and the strongest economy on the planet.\n  We can pass legislation that can be a jobs legislation, energy \nlegislation, environmental legislation if we do the right thing and \nencourage our companies and our investors to build solar panels and \nsolar cells, to build fuel cells, to build wind turbines, to move \nforward on all the kinds of biomass energy production that we know how \nto do in this country.\n  Why wouldn't we invest in the research, infrastructure, job training, \nand the commercialization needed to secure our independence from \nforeign oil, to fight global warming, to revitalize our economy? Mr. \nPresident, why wouldn't we?\n  I would have fought for resources to help coal communities diversify \ntheir economies. If we ignore these communities, we breed poverty. Go \nwith me to southeast Ohio and look at the number of people who are \nlining up in food pantries, lining up for food to get through the week, \nto get through the month, to get through the winter and now the spring, \nas most people in those families hold jobs, often full time, often part \ntime. They don't pay enough because of what has happened to coal miners \nand what has happened to industry in southeast Ohio.\n  We, in moral terms and practical terms, cannot let that happen. If we \nignore these communities, as I said, we breed more poverty. That is not \na prediction, that is a fact.\n  I was not given the opportunity to offer my amendments. I will have \nthe opportunity to push for legislation that capitalizes on our \nNation's strengths, that leaves a legacy of which we can be proud for \nfuture generations.\n  We can do it, we must do it, and with Senator Boxer's leadership, we \nwill do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise for two purposes. One is to speak \nfor a couple minutes about today's anniversary of D-day and then also \nto talk about a Pennsylvanian who lost his life in Iraq and was this \nweek awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I, first, wish to speak \nabout D-day.\n  We observe this anniversary today, 64 years, but we have to think \ntoday about how we do that. We know what happened on D-day. For so many \nAmericans, prior to just a number of years ago, it was a piece of \nhistory we read about in the history books. We learned a bit about it \nin school, but for a new generation of Americans, D-day has meant what \nwe saw in the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Thank goodness for that \nfilm because it captured so much of the horror, so much of the \nsacrifice and the valor of our troops.\n  So we remember those Americans who gave their lives that day to save \nthe world--literally to save the world from the horror that could have \nbefallen the world if the axis powers were successful, and if D-day did \nnot go as well as it did, they might have been successful.\n  I am remembering today not just a generation of Americans, the \n``greatest generation'' of Americans as we know them now, who \nsacrificed so much, but I am thinking of people from my home State. I \nthink Pennsylvania had more Medal of Honor winners in World War II than \nany other State. One of them was in my home area, Lackawanna County, \nGeno Merli, who served in Europe, in that theater of the war, and was \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and passed away a couple of \nyears ago. So when I think of D-day, and I think of those sacrifices, I \nam thinking of heroes such as Geno Merli and so many others who gave \nthe ultimate sacrifice. His Medal of Honor pertained to his combat not \non D-day but in a related theater of war.\n  We think about those who came back. We think about those who served \nand came back, many of them wounded permanently and irreparably, just \nas we see today with some of our troops in Iraq, and it brings to mind \nAbraham Lincoln's words in two contexts. One is the context of those \nwho have served. He talked about the soldier--him who has borne the \nbattle--that we must care for him who has borne the battle. And I think \none way to honor those who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan or around \nthe world or in wars like World War II is to remember something my \nfather said years ago when he was serving as Governor of Pennsylvania, \nand he talked about praying for our troops, as important as that is, \nbut he also talked about praying for ourselves; that we may be worthy \nof their valor.\n  I believe the only way we can be worthy of the valor of those who \nserved in World War II on D-day or served in Iraq or Afghanistan or \nanywhere around the world--in Vietnam, in the Korean War, whatever the \nconflict was--we can't just honor them by remembering and commemorating \nand talking about battles and all of the information that we can impart \nabout war. We have to, if we are going to be worthy of their valor, do \nthe right thing today, not just when we commemorate D-day but every \nday.\n  There are at least two things we can do to pay tribute to those who \nserved and to be worthy of their valor. One way is to make sure those \nwho survive a war and come back to the United States have not just some \nhealth care but the best health care. And we have to fund it. \nFortunately, in the last two budgets we have been doing that. We have \nbeen meeting or exceeding the budget on veterans health care.\n  The second thing we must do, at the very least, is make sure anyone \nwho serves in combat has an opportunity to be educated as best we can \nprovide. That is why the vote on the GI bill recently was so essential, \nso central to meeting that basic obligation, so caring, as Abraham \nLincoln said, for\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nhim--and increasingly her--who has borne the battle, and making sure \nthey have an education.\n  Today, when we remember the service of those who gave their lives, \nand in some cases gave sacrifice and survived D-day, I think we have to \nmeet the obligation that service imposes on us in the Senate and as \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5352-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5352-S5353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      SPECIALIST Ross A. McGinnis\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Finally, I want to speak for a couple of moments about a \nPennsylvanian. As I have mentioned before, there are more World War II \nMedal of Honor winners from Pennsylvania than anywhere else. We did \nsome research, and you can go down the list of people who have served \nfrom Pennsylvania, who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of \nHonor, and we note that 378 Pennsylvanians have received the Medal of \nHonor out of about 3,467 overall, so a high percentage.\n  We had 25 Medal of Honor winners from World War II and in Operation \nIraqi Freedom; one is the person I want to spend a couple of moments \ntalking about. Operation Iraqi Freedom has only four, I am told, four \nMedal of Honor winners across the Nation, so Pennsylvania has one of \nthose four, and his name is Specialist Ross A. McGinnis, 1st Platoon, C \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat \nTeam, 1st Infantry Division.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na two-page document entitled, ``The Story of PFC Ross A. McGinnis,'' as \nwell as a news story from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette from this week.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I will not read all of it, but I wanted to \nread the description of his sacrifice and the reason he was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, so rare for any soldier to be so awarded. \nHere is part of the official report. This is December 4, 2006.\n\n       During the course of the patrol, an unidentified insurgent \n     positioned on a rooftop nearby threw a fragmentation grenade \n     into the Humvee. Without hesitation or regard for his own \n     life, McGinnis threw his back over the grenade, pinning it \n     between his body and the Humvee's radio mount. McGinnis \n     absorbed all lethal fragments and the concussive effects of \n     the grenade with his own body. McGinnis, who was a private \n     first class at the time, was posthumously promoted to \n     specialist. Specialist McGinnis's heroic actions and tragic \n     death are detailed in the battlescape section of this website \n     and in his Medal of Honor Citation.\n\n  He was a young man from Knox, PA, 19 years old, when he gave, as \nAbraham Lincoln also said, ``The last full measure of devotion to his \ncountry.'' And I have used that line a lot because it applies so well \nto those who have given their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan and other \nplaces around the world, but at no time--at no time--that I have used \nthat line from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address has it applied \nbetter than it does in this instance, for Ross. A McGinnis, 19 years \nold, born June 14, 1987, in Meadville, PA, though he grew up in Knox, \nPA. He was a 2005 graduate of Keystone Junior-Senior High School, and \nhis parents were with President Bush this week when he was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  So we are thinking of him today, on D-day, but we should make sure \nthose memories we have of his service, and all those who have served in \nany conflict, be the inspiration for our hard work in the Senate, to \nmake sure we are doing everything we can to earn the valor they gave so \nheroically for our country. And that has to be about making sure our \ntroops are given what they need when they are on the battlefield, but \nalso ensuring that when they come home, the help doesn't stop at the \nshoreline; that they are given the best health care and the best \neducational opportunities.\n  So, Mr. President, I will conclude with this: We pay tribute to those \nwho have served our country, especially today, in remembering those who \nserved on D-day, but in a special way we are thinking of Ross A. \nMcGinnis, his service, his sacrifice, and we are praying for his \nfamily.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   The Story of PFC Ross A. McGinnis\n\n\n  1st Platoon, C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd \n               Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division\n\n       Spc. McGinnis' dedication to duty and love for his fellow \n     Soldiers were embodied in a statement issued by his parents \n     shortly after his death:\n       ``Ross did not become our hero by dying to save his fellow \n     Soldiers from a grenade. He was a hero to us long before he \n     died, because he was willing to risk his life to protect the \n     ideals of freedom and justice that America represents. He has \n     been recommended for the Medal of Honor . . . That is not why \n     he gave his life. The lives of four men who were his Army \n     brothers outweighed the value of his one life. It was just a \n     matter of simple kindergarten arithmetic. Four means more \n     than one. It didn't matter to Ross that he could have escaped \n     the situation without a scratch. Nobody would have questioned \n     such a reflex reaction. What mattered to him were the four \n     men placed in his care on a moment's notice. One moment he \n     was responsible for defending the rear of a convoy from enemy \n     fire; the next moment he held the lives of four of his \n     friends in his hands. The choice for Ross was simple, but \n     simple does not mean easy. His straightforward answer to a \n     simple but difficult choice should stand as a shining example \n     for the rest of us. We all face simple choices, but how often \n     do we choose to make a sacrifice to get the right answer? The \n     right choice sometimes requires honor.''\n       Ross Andrew McGinnis was born June 14, 1987 in Meadville, \n     PA. His family moved to Knox, northeast of Pittsburgh, when \n     he was three. There he attended Clarion County public \n     schools, and was a member of the Boy Scouts as a boy. Growing \n     up he played basketball and soccer through the YMCA, and \n     Little League baseball. Ross was a member of St. Paul's \n     Lutheran Church in Knox, and a 2005 graduate of Keystone \n     Junior-Senior High School.\n       Ross's interests included video games and mountain biking. \n     He was also a car enthusiast, and took classes at the Clarion \n     County Career Center in automotive technology. He also worked \n     part-time at McDonald's after school.\n       His mother, Romayne, said Ross wanted to be a Soldier early \n     in life. When asked to draw a picture of what he wanted to be \n     when he grew up, Ross McGinnis, the kindergartner, drew a \n     picture of a Soldier.\n       On his 17th birthday, June 14, 2004, Ross went to the Army \n     recruiting station and joined through the delayed entry \n     program.\n       After initial entry training at Fort Benning, Georgia, \n     McGinnis was assigned to 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry \n     Regiment in Schweinfurt, Germany. According to fellow \n     Soldiers, he loved Soldiering and took his job seriously, but \n     he also loved to make people laugh. One fellow Soldier \n     commented that every time McGinnis left a room, he left the \n     Soldiers in it laughing.\n       The unit deployed to Eastern Baghdad in August 2006, where \n     sectarian violence was rampant. Ross was serving as an M2 .50 \n     caliber machine gunner in 1st Platoon, C Company, 1st \n     Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment in support of operations \n     against insurgents in Adhamiyah, Iraq.\n       According to the official report, on the afternoon of Dec. \n     4, 2006, McGinnis' platoon was on mounted patrol in Adhamiyah \n     to restrict enemy movement and quell sectarian violence. \n     During the course of the patrol, an unidentified insurgent \n     positioned on a rooftop nearby threw a fragmentation grenade \n     into the Humvee. Without hesitation or regard for his own \n     life, McGinnis threw his back over the grenade, pinning it \n     between his body and the Humvee's radio mount. McGinnis \n     absorbed all lethal fragments and the concussive effects of \n     the grenade with his own body. McGinnis, who was a private \n     first class at the time, was posthumously promoted to \n     specialist. Spc.

By \n     turning himself into a human shield, he gave his life to \n     protect the other men in his crew.\n       Mr. Bush presented the Medal of Honor, America's highest \n     military decoration, to Tom and Romayne McGinnis, parents of \n     the 19-year-old soldier. About 300 people--including the four \n     soldiers who survived the grenade blast--attended the \n     ceremony in the East Room of the White House. It ended with \n     everybody standing and applauding for Spc. McGinnis.\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n       By then, Mrs. McGinnis was fighting back tears. Mr. Bush \n     turned and kissed her on the cheek, causing her to smile. \n     Then he escorted her from the room.\n       Afterward, Mrs. McGinnis said the president had told her he \n     might cry if she did.\n       Tom McGinnis said his son, a restless and below-average \n     student until his senior year of high school in Knox, would \n     have savored this day of acclamation had he lived to see it.\n       ``He'd have had a great time. He'd have enjoyed the \n     spotlight,'' Mr. McGinnis said.\n       In an earlier interview, he said he is certain his son \n     never thought of medals or glory. Friendships and \n     relationships were all that motivated his son, Mr. McGinnis \n     said.\n       Sgt. Ian Newland, the only soldier to be seriously injured \n     in the explosion, walks with a cane now. At 28, he said his \n     goal is to run again, though doctors tell him he won't. He \n     wants to accomplish all he can each day--his only way of \n     repaying Spc. McGinnis.\n       In a news conference after the ceremony, Sgt. Newland said \n     each moment of the grenade explosion is burned into his \n     memory. Even so, he said, it took a few days of reflection \n     for him to fully grasp the magnitude of Spc. McGinnis' \n     sacrifice.\n       The crew was rolling through a Baghdad neighborhood the \n     morning of Dec. 4, 2006. Spc. McGinnis rode atop the Humvee \n     in a hatch, manning a .50-caliber machine gun.\n       A man on a roof threw a grenade that dropped straight \n     through the hatch and into the Humvee, where the other four \n     soldiers essentially were trapped.\n       Spc. McGinnis could have dived onto the street to safety. \n     Instead, he jumped back inside the Humvee and pinned the \n     grenade between his back and the vehicle.\n       It exploded a second or two later, piercing Spc. McGinnis' \n     body armor and blowing the doors off the Humvee. Shrapnel \n     tore into Sgt. Newland's head and all four limbs.\n       As he looks back on that day, Sgt. Newland said he focuses \n     on two things: ``The pain. The grief.''\n       The other three soldiers--Sgt. 1st Class Cedric Thomas, \n     Sgt. Lyle Buehler and Spc. Sean Lawson--were not hurt \n     physically. Sgt. Buehler said survivor's guilt weighs on him. \n     Had the grenade rolled in front of him, he would have been in \n     the position to cover it. As it happened, only Spc. McGinnis \n     knew where the grenade was.\n       The others say Spc. McGinnis took little seriously except \n     soldiering.\n       ``The first time I met him, he had me laughing,'' Spc. \n     Lawson said.\n       In his combat team in the 1 st Battalion, 26 Infantry \n     Regiment, Spc. McGinnis developed a reputation for doing \n     impressions, the soldiers said. So spot-on were his \n     imitations that a drill instructor even laughed when he was \n     the object of one of them.\n       The youngest man in his unit, Spc. McGinnis looked out for \n     his crew as though they were brothers. Sgt. Thomas offers the \n     most succinct description of the 6-foot, 136-pound beanpole, \n     saying: ``He is a hero.''\n       Mr. McGinnis said his son knew that four lives were more \n     valuable than one, so he instinctively reacted to save the \n     others.\n       He remembers his son as an ordinary kid who made plenty of \n     mistakes, then got interested in military service and \n     fulfilled his potential in the Army.\n       ``It wasn't an exciting story until right to the end,'' Mr. \n     McGinnis said.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to my chief \ncounsel on the Judiciary Committee, Cindy Hayden, who is with me today. \nWe all depend so much on our staff. They give of themselves, they give \nof their time, they are committed to their beliefs, and serve America, \nand we are never able to say thank you to all of them, but on special \noccasions, I think it is important to do so. In saying my thanks to \nher, I am saying thanks to all my staff, and to all the staff of the \nSenate, who serve us so well, often without ever receiving credit.\n  I am pleased for her because she will be starting a new chapter in \nher professional life, though her departure will be a tremendous loss \nto my staff and the Senate at large. I am glad she will be in DC, \nworking close by, so we can call on her when we need her help.\n  Cindy Hayden is an exceptional person. I feel a great loss at her \ndeparture. Each day that we have worked together, she has shown an \nunwavering dedication to our shared values, to her State, and to her \nNation. Her passion for the law is unmatched, and her commitment to the \nrule of law is unwavering. I trust her judgment, her political \ninstincts, and her values. I have relied on her to manage my Judiciary \nstaff and the multitude of important issues that committee handles. \nWith so many issues arising on a daily basis, it is sometimes not \npossible for me to personally be aware of them all. In everything from \njudicial nominations, immigration, and any number of constitutional \nissues, Cindy has exhibited an intellectual capacity, a tenacity to \nprinciple, a strong work ethic, and a professional integrity that is \nabove reproach.\n  Before joining my staff, she had a distinguished academic career at \nmy undergraduate school, Huntington College, and the University of \nAlabama School of Law. At Huntington, Cindy had an outstanding record \nof academic excellence, receiving degrees in both chemistry and \npolitical science. I think chemistry is pretty impressive and would \ncertainly get your attention when you looked at a resume. She then went \nto law school at the University of Alabama, where she graduated cum \nlaude and served as managing editor of the Journal of Legal Profession \nand was a member of the moot court board. While in law school, she \nclerked in the office of the Alabama Attorney General under my \nsuccessor, now Eleventh Circuit Judge Bill Pryor, a brilliant legal \nmind himself.\n  Immediately after taking the bar, Cindy started working as counsel on \nmy staff, and for the past 6 years worked her way up to chief counsel. \nHer work on the Senate Judiciary Committee has been extraordinary, and \nI believe the committee is a better place for her service. The \ncommittee takes on an enormous number and wide variety of complex and \nsometimes controversial issues. It is one of the most demanding \ncommittees in the Senate. To be successful as an attorney on that \ncommittee you must not only be hard working and intelligent and someone \nwho works very long hours, but you must also be a strong negotiator, \nable to frame arguments in a passionate, respectful, and intellectually \nhonest way. She has done all that with seemingly effortless skill.\n  I would note that the Judiciary Committee has attracted, and has \nright now, a host of superior attorneys who serve all of us. They are \nan excellent team, indeed. I would be remiss not to mention her stellar \nwork on immigration. Since she arrived in my office, Cindy has worked \ntirelessly to protect the rule of law in this country, and as it turned \nout, she found herself at the center of a national debate on how to fix \nthe broken immigration system in our country. Those of you who have \nworked on either side of the issue have certainly had to deal with \nCindy and her relentless advocacy as she became the go-to person on \nimmigration, providing a wealth of information and knowledge for all \ninvolved.\n  Indeed, her ``alerts'' that were sent out--always meticulously \naccurate--were picked up routinely all over the country by media \noutlets as accurate depictions of developments, as they were occurring \nso rapidly during that intense debate. So whether you were for her or \nagainst her in principle, everyone can certainly agree she handled \nherself with dignity, courage, tenacity, and capability during that \ndebate.\n  Evidence of her dedication and influence on the committee and its \nstaff can be seen by what some of her colleagues have had to say about \nher. And this is a good team, indeed. Ed Haden, my former chief \ncounsel, who hired her, said:\n\n       Cindy immediately made a difference when she started on the \n     committee. Her intelligence, work ethic, initiative, and \n     willingness to stand up and defend her position made her a \n     great asset. Her unflinching integrity and solid core values \n     made her a success as a lawyer and as a friend.\n\n  And I would add that she was raised right. She has great values, as a \nproduct of Cullman, AL. She grew up in the heart of Alabama and was \nraised in an outstanding way.\n  William Smith, my former chief counsel and current executive director \nof the Americans for Limited Government Research Foundation, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       I have met and worked with a number of great lawyers. Cindy \n     Hayden is in a category more select than great. She is one of \n     the few superior lawyers I have met. I was privileged to \n     serve with her on the Judiciary Committee and I count her a \n     true confidant. Our motto in the office was, ``we work from \n     sun to sun; our work is never done.'' Cindy has lived up to \n     and surpassed that calling. On top of this, she is a great \n     American. The only group I know that will truly celebrate her \n     departure will be illegal aliens.\n\n  That is what William Smith said. Brian Darling, director of Senate \nRelations for the Heritage Foundation said this:\n\n       Cindy has been a hero to conservatives nationwide who \n     believe in the rule of law.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n     Without Cindy and ``Team Sessions''' tireless efforts to \n     educate the American public on the contents of the secretly \n     drafted amnesty bill, the bill may have become law.\n\n  Wendy Fleming, General Counsel for the Senate Steering Committee \nsays:\n\n       Cindy Hayden is a great American, a smart lawyer, and a \n     wonderful friend. During her time on the Judiciary Committee, \n     Cindy has displayed unwavering devotion to Senator Sessions, \n     the people of Alabama, and her conservative principles. I am \n     honored to have had the opportunity to work with Cindy.\n\n  Brooke Bacak, former Counsel for me and current Chief Counsel for \nSenator Coburn says:\n\n       I have had the privilege of knowing Cindy for 10 years. \n     Having first met in College Republicans, I learned about her \n     conservative convictions very early in our friendship. Cindy \n     has proven to be a true patriot, and I am grateful for the \n     role that she has played in the U.S. Senate. But beyond our \n     political and professional association, Cindy has become a \n     true friend. She and her husband, Matt, are two of the most \n     generous people I know. From birthdays to illnesses, the \n     Haydens always make time to be with their friends. Their \n     kindness has made a difference to me and many others. I wish \n     Cindy the very best in her new job and hope she knows how \n     much she will be missed.\n\n  Joe Matal, Counsel for Senator Kyl says:\n\n       If you look closely at the corpse of last year's \n     immigration bill, you will find a series of small squares \n     holes in its back. Those holes were produced by Cindy's \n     heels, stomping that bill to death.\n\n  Rita Lari Jochum, Chief Counsel for Senator Grassley, says:\n\n       Cindy Hayden has served Senator Sessions, Alabama and our \n     country extremely well. A committed advocate for conservative \n     principles, Cindy has been tenacious in her drive to do what \n     is right. We all are going to miss a great friend and skilled \n     colleague.\n\n  Lauren Petron, Chief Counsel for Senator Brownback, says:\n\n       Cindy is a principled conservative, a tireless advocate, a \n     talented lawyer, a trusted colleague, and a dear friend. She \n     is truly a person who lives out her values and beliefs. I \n     feel privileged to have worked with her on the Judiciary \n     Committee, and I am certain that she will be a great success \n     in all her future endeavors.\n\n  John Abegg, Counsel for Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:\n\n       Cindy continued a long line of outstanding chief counsels \n     for Senator Sessions. She is smart, principled, and tough, \n     but has a kind heart as well. She worked tirelessly to serve \n     Senator Sessions' Alabama constituents and the people of the \n     United States, and she did so with distinction.\n\n  Alan Hanson, my Legislative Director says:\n\n       Cindy is a serious and accomplished professional with a big \n     heart and disarming wit. While I will miss being her \n     colleague in the Senate, I know Cindy will do well in all her \n     endeavors and wish her the best.\n\n  Ajit Pai, Deputy General Counsel for the FCC says:\n\n       Staffers on both sides of the aisle would agree that Cindy \n     Hayden brings to the table a welcome combination of \n     intelligence, dedication, and likeability. It was my \n     privilege to have worked with her on Senator Sessions' staff, \n     and it will always be my privilege to call her a friend.\n\n  Bradley Hayes, my Senior Counsel says:\n\n       I have had the honor to work with both talented \n     professionals and close, personal friends. In Cindy Hayden, \n     I've had the rare privilege to work with an individual who \n     encompasses both. I have had the pleasure to work with Cindy \n     since the day I started in the Senate almost three years ago. \n     On a daily basis, I have been able to battle liberals with a \n     person whom I not only respect and admire, but someone whose \n     friendship I will value long after her departure. From her \n     first day in the Senate, Cindy has worked tirelessly to \n     promote conservative principles and has been a tremendous \n     asset for both Senator Sessions and the U.S. Senate. The \n     State of Alabama and the nation as a whole are better because \n     of her selfless work these past six years. Though she leaves \n     us to carry on the fight, the lessons she has taught me, and \n     others who have worked with her, will ensure that Cindy's \n     legacy of fidelity to the rule of law and conservative \n     principles will continue for years to come.\n\n  These are just some of the statements from the staffers whom Cindy \nhas worked with that reflect their respect for her.\n  I will just conclude personally by saying I never had a staffer to be \nmore involved than Cindy in as sustained and intense a period of debate \nas we find ourselves in on the immigration debate. It was a constant \nevery day struggle, and things were always rapidly changing.\n  We believe the bill on the floor, though it had a lot of support and \nmany good things in it, was not the right approach to solving our \nillegal immigration problems in America. We decided someone had to be \nactive in that and raise those issues. Cindy was just fabulous, and I \ndepended on her. Day after day, her work and the respect she engendered \nthroughout the country played a big role in the final result, in which \nthe bill was pulled down without passage in that form.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these words. As \nI speak about her, again I want to note I share my thoughts and these \ncomments about so many of our staffers who serve America in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5354-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5354-S5355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come before our body today because we \nare dealing with such an incredibly important issue. It is an issue \nthat is full of technicalities but also a lot of passion, a lot of \nincredible passion about how we take care of this incredible blessing \nof a planet we have been given, take care of its climate and its \nenvironment and all of the incredible things it does for us, and what \nwe have a responsibility to do in return.\n  As a daughter of an Arkansas farmer, I was taught at an early age in \nlife to be a good steward of the land we have been given, to understand \nthere will be future generations who will need it, who will cherish it, \nand who will learn from it. Today, my husband Steve and I continue to \ninstill those principles in our twin boys through all kinds of \ndifferent activities, whether it is the Scouts they have participated \nin, whether it is their athletics, whether it is the fishing and \nhunting they love to do, whether it is the canoeing and camping we do \non the beautiful rivers of Arkansas in the great outdoors--being \ntogether and sharing time, being together and being respectful of this \ngreat environment we have been given.\n  Since the issue of global climate change first came before the \nSenate, it has become abundantly clear to me and I think to millions of \nAmericans as well as those in this body that we have to take action on \nthis issue if we have any hope of correcting it. We have had our heads \nin the sand for quite some time. It is important that we get busy. It \nis important that we get busy in making a difference, in changing our \nculture in many ways in order to be better equipped to deal with the \nproblems we have in this environment.\n  But it is also abundantly clear that we also have to make sure that \nour head is not in the clouds and that we are being realistic about the \neconomy we have created, about the number of people on the face of this \nEarth who depend on this economy, and how critically important it is to \nprovide the kind of partnership and empowerment to our existing culture \nto make the transition from what we have to what we want to have in \nterms of dealing with our climate through the economic engines we have \nin this great land, in this great country.\n  As many of my colleagues have mentioned, the environmental impact of \ninaction threatens our coastline, the polar icecaps, weather patterns, \nand animal migration, but it also threatens our ability to be \ncompetitive in the world marketplace and to grow the kinds of jobs we \ntruly want to grow if we ignore the opportunities that exist if we do \nthis correctly. If we do this correctly, we can not only provide the \nkind of move in the right direction that will be positive for our \nenvironment, but we can also seize the opportunity to empower industry \nand our economy in a way that we can grow jobs at the same time.\n  While the environmental danger that climate change poses is so \nconsiderable, I am also very concerned about many aspects of this bill. \nThe reality is that the bill we have here before us today cannot pass. \nWe cannot pass this legislation and believe the problem is going to be \nfixed because there are multiple problems. It is not just the climate \nand not just the environment,\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nit is all of the things that contribute to it. As we move forward, it \nis the hard-working Americans who participate in this economy whom we \nhave to consider.\n  The pathway to saving the planet will require that we partner with \nthe business community and empower them to transition from an old \nenergy economy and energy technologies dating back centuries, to the \nemerging energy economy and the emerging energy technologies needed for \na new, cleaner economy and a new, cleaner environment. Failure to do so \ncould lead to the loss of jobs in communities all across our Nation.\n  But it could also lead to a failed environmental policy because the \nfact is, if we do not get this right now, we could spend the next 2 or \n3 years dealing with legislation that might not work, is not going to \nhave all of the intricacies and all of the matters dealt with that need \nto be dealt with. And 3 years down the road, what happens? We repeal \nit? We have wasted 3 precious years, 3 or 4 precious years, where we \ncould have been working productively to reach the goal of strengthening \nour economy and preserving our environment.\n  Another concern is the unintended hardships the bill might place on \nthe elderly and working families, particularly in my State. I am sure \nother Senators have those same concerns.\n  In a State with a median income level of $37,420, ranking Arkansas \n48th among all States, many of my constituents live paycheck to \npaycheck absolutely every week. I am rightfully concerned about a bill \nthat could drive up utility rates, with the costs being passed on to \nconsumers. And for my constituents, even a $15-per-month increase in \ntheir energy bills would be devastating. Now, for some of us, $15 we \nwill notice, but it might not make a difference between whether we are \ngoing to sign our kids up for Little League or whether we are going to \nbe able to help our grandparents or our parents with their prescription \ndrugs or even put food on the table. But for some hard-working \nAmericans, those kinds of increases could mean an awful lot. That is \nwhy it is all the more important that we get this bill right.\n  I want to support climate change legislation. That is something I \nfeel very passionate about. I want to because I believe it is \nultimately our responsibility to preserve and protect our planet for \nfuture generations. I truly believe we can no longer afford to put our \nheads in the sand about this issue. We have to move forward. We have to \nexpress the importance and the urgency of this issue. But I also echo \nthat it is critically important we get it right. That is why I say the \ndevil is in the details.\n  As we move forward in these discussions on what we are doing, we have \nto pay critical attention to the details of this bill. It is why we \ncannot afford to have, as I said, our heads in the clouds about the \nrealities of the issues that are associated without fully understanding \nthe impact of this bill as we have looked at it today, as currently \nwritten, on industry and working families of this country.\n  I dedicate myself to making sure not only that we passionately look \nat this issue for all the right reasons of preserving our environment \nbut that we also equally as passionately look at this bill to make sure \nthe mechanisms that partner us with the economy and the engines of \neconomy we get right.\n  I am committed to working closely with the sponsors of the \nlegislation as well as the industries in my State and all across this \nNation. We have an obligation, an obligation and a responsibility not \nonly to protect this environment but also to protect the incredible \nworking families whom we represent, the hard-fought jobs they work in \nday-in and day-out to care for their families, and the good corporate \ncitizens that are trying their best to make sure those jobs stay in \nthis country.\n  I believe we can craft a proposal that will appropriately balance the \nneeds of business and consumers, especially those most vulnerable to an \nincrease in energy costs or a shift in our culture of energy, to \nprotect our environment for our children and our grandchildren but also \nto keep that balance in recognition with how important that impact is \non our communities across our States and across this great country.\n  I do so appreciate all of the hard work, the enormous effort so many \nSenators have put into this bill. Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner \nand, of course, Chairman Boxer have all invested a tremendous amount of \ntime in this bill. As we continue to move forward in looking at this \nissue, in looking for solutions, I hope that in their leadership they \nwill embrace all of the Senators who have great ideas in terms of how \nwe can move forward in making this a success, in preserving our \nenvironment but ensuring that the working people of this country and \nthe hard-fought industries that are here providing the jobs we want to \nsee stay in this great country, that they are going to have a seat at \nthe table and come up with a bill that will benefit everybody.\n  While I still have some questions about what we are dealing with and \nthe debate we had and will continue to have, I want to keep my door \nopen. I want to work with my colleagues to address the real and the \nlong-term issues of climate change in the weeks and months ahead. But I \nalso want to make sure our focus does not lose sight of the other \nconsequences that come from this bill.\n  I appreciate the debate we have had, and I look forward to the coming \nmonths as we will continue to refocus ourselves, rededicate our time to \nmaking sure--making sure that any bill we come up with that we come to \nthe floor and ask one another to give a final vote on will be a bill \nthat we have embraced from all different perspectives of finding the \nsolutions we need.\n  This underlying bill is clearly not that bill, and many of us have \ngrave concerns about where the priorities are in this bill and how we \nmake those priorities more positive in all directions. I look forward \nto regaining our time and energy and being able to come back and talk \nabout these issues and really solve all of the problems, all of the \nconsequences that come with our ultimate passion of wanting to ensure \nthat we do take a stand on climate change and that we do embrace our \nopportunity to make sure we do not make it irreversible in terms of \nwhat climate change is; that we will work hard to ensure that our \nchildren and our grandchildren will have an incredible planet to be \nable to live on, to work on, and again to reach their every potential \nand their every possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5355-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for \ncoming to the chair a little early in order to allow me a chance to \nmake a statement. It was a considerable courtesy and one that is much \nappreciated.\n  I will open my remarks by saying: Well, here we go again. I have come \nto the floor several times already to warn of what appears to be a loss \nof integrity and legal scholarship at the once proud Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Department of Justice.\n  First, back in December, I pointed out the, shall we say, \n``eccentric'' theories that arose out of the OLC's analysis that \ngreenlighted President Bush's program for warrantless wiretapping of \nAmericans. Those opinions had been secret. These theories came to light \nafter I plowed through a fat stack of classified opinions held in \nsecret over at the White House and pressed to have the particular \nstatements declassified.\n  My colleagues may recall that these theories included the following:\n\n       An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no \n     constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new \n     executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms \n     of a previous executive order. Rather\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\n     than violate an executive order, the President has instead \n     modified or waived it.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, Executive orders have the force \nof law. A theory like this allows the Federal Register, where the \nexecutive orders are assembled, to become a screen of falsehood behind \nwhich illegal programs can operate in violation of the very executive \norder that purports to control the executive branch. So that was a fine \none.\n  Here is another:\n\n       The President, exercising his constitutional authority \n     under Article II--\n\n  That is the section of the Constitution that provides for the \nPresidency and the executive branch of Government. Article I \nestablishes the Congress; article II establishes the executive branch--\n\n     can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the \n     President's authority under Article II.\n\n  I think the expression for that is ``pulling yourself up in the air \nby your own bootstraps,'' and it runs contrary to widely established \nconstitutional principle. The seminal case of Marbury v. Madison, which \nevery law student knows, says it is emphatically the province and the \nduty of the judiciary to say what the law is. And none other than the \ngreat Justice Jackson once observed:\n\n       Some arbiter is almost indispensable when power . . . is . \n     . . balanced between different branches, as the legislature \n     and the executive. . . . Each unit cannot be left to judge \n     the limits of its own power.\n\n  Yet this was the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Here is the one I found perhaps most personally nauseating:\n\n       The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal \n     [opinions.].\n\n  A particularly handy little doctrine for the White House, when it is \nthe legality of White House conduct that is at issue. Wouldn't it be \nnice if you could come into the courts of America or face the laws of \nAmerica with a principle that the law-determining body has to follow \nyour instruction? If criminals had that, no one would ever go to jail. \nIt is inappropriate in our system of justice.\n  So I found these theories pretty appalling. I found them to be, \nfrankly, fringe theories from the outer limits of legal ideology. They \nstarted me worrying about what is going on at the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  Then we came to the OLC opinions the Bush administration used to \nauthorize waterboarding of detainees. Then, again, I came to the floor \nbecause I was flabbergasted, horrified to discover that to reach its \nconclusions, the Office of Legal Counsel totally overlooked two highly \nrelevant legal determinations and then went and drew language out of \nhealth care reimbursement law--health care reimbursement law--in order \nto justify allowing the administration to torture and waterboard \nprisoners.\n  What were the highly relevant legal determinations the Office of \nLegal Counsel overlooked? Well, one was that it was American \nprosecutors and American judges who in military tribunals after World \nWar II prosecuted Japanese soldiers for war crimes, for torture, on \nevidence of their waterboarding American prisoners of war. Missed it.\n  The other major thing the OLC overlooked was that the Department of \nJustice itself prosecuted a Texas sheriff as a criminal for \nwaterboarding prisoners in 1984. The sheriff's conviction went up on \nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, one row \nunder the U.S. Supreme Court, and the appeals court, in a public \nopinion, described the technique as ``water torture.'' The opinion used \nthe term ``torture'' over and over again. All a legal researcher has to \ndo is type the words ``water torture'' into the legal search engines, \nLexus or Westlaw, and this case comes up: United States v. Lee, 744 F2d \n1124.\n  How did the wide-ranging legal analysis that ranged as far afield as \nhealth care reimbursement law for guidance miss a case that is bang on \npoint, that was prosecuted by the Department of Justice itself, that is \nreported in a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals, that describes \nthis exact technique as ``water torture''? How, indeed.\n  After this, I began to refer to whatever it is that the Office of \nLegal Counsel has now become as George Bush's ``Little Shop of Legal \nHorrors.''\n  Now we have this. The FISA statute contains what is called an \nexclusivity provision. The FISA statute of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act is the law that governs our surveillance authority on \nforeign intelligence matters. It is an active issue before this body \nright now, and the exclusivity provision is actively being discussed. \nHere is how it reads:\n\n       [FISA] shall be the exclusive means by which electronic \n     surveillance . . . and the interception of domestic wire, \n     oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.\n\n  ``Exclusive means.'' It seems pretty clear. And exclusivity \nprovisions such as this in statutes are not uncommon. More on that \nlater.\n  But let's look at what the Office of Legal Counsel said about that \nlanguage. This is language Senator Feinstein and I have had \ndeclassified. Similar to the others, it was buried in a classified \nopinion:\n\n       Unless Congress made a clear statement in the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act that it sought to restrict \n     presidential authority to conduct wireless searches in the \n     national security area--which it has not--\n\n  ``Which it has not''--\n\n       then the statute must be construed to avoid such a reading.\n\n  Well, this is particularly devilish because we have had a long \nargument through the FISA debate with the administration over the \nexclusivity provision. Senator Feinstein has led the charge on this, \nwith strong bipartisan support from Senators Hagel and Snowe, and never \nonce, in all these discussions, have I heard the administration say: \nOh, there is a problem with the exclusivity language in the FISA bill. \nThere is a loophole in it. It is not as strong as it could be. There is \nsomething Congress did in the exclusivity clause that would open a way \nfor the President to wiretap Americans without a warrant.\n  Never once been said. But behind the scenes, in secret opinions, they \nproclaimed that some loophole exists. I do not see the loophole: FISA \n``shall be the exclusive means . . . .'' Where are you going to \nchallenge it? Are you going to say: Well, maybe the hole is that they \nreferenced the national security area? But the national security area \nis where our foreign intelligence surveillance exists. Well, maybe it \nhas to do with wireless searches? No, wireless searches are precisely \nwhat the FISA act is all about. Maybe it has to do with Presidential \nauthority? Well, who else wiretaps? We do not in Congress. The judges \ndo not. Of course, it is the executive branch.\n  So maybe it is that they do not think it was a clear enough \nstatement? Well, let's take a look at that and start with a case from \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was discussing a statute that \ngave the Court ``exclusive'' jurisdiction. Chief Justice Rehnquist \nwrote for the Supreme Court that this was ``uncompromising language.''\n  He continued:\n\n       [T]he description of our jurisdiction as ``exclusive'' \n     necessarily denies jurisdiction of such cases to any other \n     federal court.\n\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist said:\n\n       This follows from the plain meaning of ``exclusive.''\n\n  The Chief Justice then cited to Webster's New International \nDictionary for that plain meaning. My Webster's defines ``exclusive'' \nas ``single, sole,'' ``excluding others from participation.'' That \nsounds clear to me. The ``single'' means, the ``sole'' means, the means \nthat excludes others from participation.\n  Lower courts have discussed the FISA statute's own exclusivity \nprovision directly. Chief Justice Rehnquist was talking about a \ndifferent exclusivity provision. The FISA exclusivity provision was the \nsubject of a case called United States v. Andonian, cited 735 F. Supp. \n1469. The court said this. Let me read three sentences talking about \nthe exclusivity language in FISA.\n\n       [This language] reveals that Congress intended to sew up \n     the perceived loopholes through which the President had been \n     able to avoid the warrant requirement. The exclusivity clause \n     makes it impossible for the President to ``opt-out'' of the \n     legislative scheme by retreating to his ``inherent'' \n     Executive sovereignty over foreign affairs . . . . The \n     exclusivity clause . . . assures that the President cannot \n     avoid Congress' limitations by resorting to ``inherent'' \n     powers as had President Truman at the time of the ``Steel \n     Seizure Case.''\n\n  By using this exclusivity clause, the court concluded:\n\n       Congress denied the President his inherent powers outright. \n     Tethering Executive reign,\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n     Congress deemed that the provisions for gathering \n     intelligence in FISA and Title III were ``exclusive.''\n\n  Now, there still may be a constitutional question about whether the \nPresident's Article II powers exist, no matter whether Congress has \npassed a particular statute. But there can be no real question about \nthe intention or the effect of FISA's exclusivity provision.\n  I have sat and stared at FISA's exclusivity provision and the OLC \nlanguage side by side, and I cannot make sense of how they came to that \nconclusion. Congress says, plain as day, FISA is the exclusive means, \nand OLC says Congress did not say that.\n  So I wonder, maybe there is some strange legal use of the term \n``exclusive'' that I missed in my 25 years of lawyering. Then I find \nthis Court decision that says this very language in the FISA statute \nmeans Congress ``intended to sew up the perceived loopholes,'' that \nthis language ``makes it impossible for the President to `opt-out' '' \nof the FISA requirements; that it ``assures that the President cannot \navoid Congress's limitations,'' and that by this language ``Congress \ndenied the President his inherent powers outright.''\n  Then I thought, maybe that is just a district court decision. That is \na lower court. But here is the Supreme Court of the United States \nlooking at an exclusivity clause in another statute and calling it \n``uncompromising language,'' taking that word ``exclusive'' at its \nplain dictionary meaning. There is literally no way I can see to \nreconcile OLC's statement with the clear, plain language of Congress.\n  I have, in the past, expressed the fear that the Office of Legal \nCounsel, under veils of secrecy, immune from either public scrutiny or \npeer review, became a hothouse of ideology, in which the professional \nstandards expected of lawyers were thrown to the winds, all in order to \nproduce the right answers for the bosses over at the White House.\n  Well, as I said at the beginning, here we go again. Oh, one more \nthing. When the Department of Justice sent me the letter acknowledging \nthat there was nothing that needed to be classified about this phrase, \nthey also said this phrase was now disclaimed--their opinion was now \ndisclaimed; not just declassified but disclaimed--by the Department of \nJustice.\n  The letter reads:\n\n       [A]s you are aware from a review of the Department's \n     relevant legal opinions concerning the NSA's warrantless \n     surveillance activities, the 2001 statement addressing FISA \n     does not reflect the current analysis of the Department.\n\n  But that does not answer this: What went wrong at the OLC? What led \nto this disclaimed opinion in the first place, and other opinions I \nhave had to come to the floor about? Has it been put right? This is an \nimportant question because this is an important institution of our \nGovernment, and we need to be assured it is working for the American \npeople, that it is of integrity and that it is back to the standards of \nlegal scholarship that long characterized the once-proud reputation of \nthat office.\n  We do not have that assurance. There is a continuing drumbeat of what \nappears to be incompetence, and we need the reassurance. We are \nentitled to the reassurance. Something has to be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Department's letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Whitehouse: This \n     responds to your letter, dated April 29, 2008, which asked \n     about a particular statement contained in a classified \n     November 2001 opinion of the Department's Office of Legal \n     Counsel addressing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \n     The statement in question asserted that unless Congress had \n     made clear in FlSA that it sought to restrict presidential \n     authority to conduct warrantless surveillance activities in \n     the national security area, FlSA must be construed to avoid \n     such a reading. The statement also asserted the view in 2001 \n     that Congress had not included such a clear statement in \n     FlSA. As you know, and as is set forth in the Department of \n     Justice's January 2006 white paper concerning the legal basis \n     for the Terrorist Surveillance Program, the Department's more \n     recent analysis is different: Congress, through the \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force of September 18, \n     2001, confirmed and supplemented the President's Article II \n     authority to conduct warrantless surveillance to prevent \n     catastrophic attacks on the United States, and such authority \n     confirmed by the AUMF can and must be read consistently with \n     FlSA, which explicitly contemplates that Congress may \n     authorize electronic surveillance by a statute other than \n     FlSA.\n       We understand you have been advised by the Director of \n     National Intelligence that the statement in question, \n     standing alone, may appropriately be treated as unclassified. \n     We also would like to address separately the substance of the \n     statement and provide the Department's views concerning \n     public discussion of the statement.\n       The general proposition (of which the November 2001 \n     statement is a particular example) that statutes will be \n     interpreted whenever reasonably possible not to conflict with \n     the President's constitutional authorities is unremarkable \n     and fully consistent with the longstanding precedents of OLC, \n     issued under Administrations of both parties. See, e.g., \n     Memorandum for Alan Kreczko, Legal Adviser to the National \n     Security Council, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney \n     General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Applicability of 47 \n     U.S.C. section 502 to Certain Broadcast Activities at 3 (Oct. \n     15, 1993) (``The President's authority in these areas is very \n     broad indeed, in accordance with his paramount constitutional \n     responsibilities for foreign relations and national security. \n     Nothing in the text or context of [the statute] suggests that \n     it was Congress's intent to circumscribe this authority. In \n     the absence of a clear statement of such intent, we do not \n     believe that a statutory provision of this generality should \n     be interpreted so to restrict the President constitutional \n     powers.''). The courts apply the same canon of statutory \n     interpretation. See, e.g., Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \n     U.S. 518,530 (1988) (``[U]nless Congress has specifically \n     provided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant \n     to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military \n     and national security affairs.'').\n       However, as you are aware from a review of the Department's \n     relevant legal opinions concerning the NSA's warrantless \n     surveillance activities, the 2001 statement addressing FISA \n     does not reflect the current analysis of the Department. \n     Rather, the Department's more recent analysis of the relation \n     between FISA and the NSA's surveillance activities \n     acknowledged by the President was summarized in the \n     Department's January 19, 2006 white paper (published before \n     those activities became the subject of FISA orders and before \n     enactment of the Protect America Act of 2007). As that paper \n     pointed out, ``In the specific context of the current armed \n     conflict with al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations, \n     Congress by statute [in the AUMF] had confirmed and \n     supplemented the President's recognized authority under \n     Article II of the Constitution to conduct such surveillance \n     to prevent further catastrophic attacks on the homeland.'' \n     Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National \n     Security Agency Described by the President at 2 (Jan. 19, \n     2006). The Department's white paper further explained the \n     particular relevance of the canon of constitutional avoidance \n     to the NSA activities: ``Even if there were ambiguity about \n     whether FlSA, read together with the AUMF, permits the \n     President to authorize the NSA activities, the canon of \n     constitutional avoidance requires reading these statutes to \n     overcome any restrictions in FISA and Title III, at least as \n     they might otherwise apply to the congressionally authorized \n     armed conflict with al Qaeda.'' Id. at 3.\n       Accordingly, we respectfully request that if you wish to \n     make use of the 2001 statement in public debate, you also \n     point out that the Department's more recent analysis of the \n     question is reflected in the passages quoted above from the \n     2006 white paper.\n       We hope that this information is helpful. If we can be of \n     further assistance regarding this or any other matter, please \n     do not hesitate to contact this office.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             Brian A. Benczkowski,\n                      Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer again \nfor his courtesy and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank you.

Mr. President, today is a noteworthy anniversary. It \nis the anniversary of D-day, the day the largest invasion force in the \nhistory of man landed on the beaches of Normandy.\n  They came from across the world--133,000 brave soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen--from England, Canada, and the United States. On that particular \nday, more than 10,000 soldiers died, giving their lives so that their \nfamilies, their\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\ncountry, and the rest of the world could live in peace and be free.\n\n  The bravery and honor of those men has come to be known with three \nsimple words: ``the greatest generation.'' Their sacrifice in battle \nand their continued service once they got home defined everything that \nwas good and right about America. We honored their service and \nsacrifice with parades and public ceremonies and memorials to the \nfallen, but it was also honored in another way. We gave them the chance \nto go to college and pursue an education. We gave them the chance to \nbuild a better future for themselves and their families. Those of us \nwho served in that terrible war got the chance to begin the innovation \nthat drove America into the future. We received the GI bill for our \nservice.\n  Many veterans of World War II have served in the Senate, many of whom \nwere honored by medals of valor. We still have someone who served in \nWorld War II who earned the Medal of Honor--Senator Dan Inouye from \nHawaii--for his incredible bravery in World War II, for his bravery \nunder fire.\n  I am who I am today because of the GI bill. One of my dreams was to \ngo to college--a dream that came true because of that bill, the GI \nbill. Eight of the sixteen million World War II veterans got an \neducation because of that bill. It was paid for, and it even carried a \nsmall stipend for the expenses that one had as a college student. Now \nwe need to start to build a new greatest generation. I want the \nveterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan to have the same \nopportunity--an opportunity that enables them to contribute to their \nfamilies and our Nation.\n  A college education is a key to that opportunity, but college costs \nhave jumped so high--57 percent just in the last 6 years. The current \nGI bill does not cover those costs. So our brave veterans are forced to \npay for their tuition and books out of their own pockets, watch their \ndebts get worse and worse, and some cannot get to college at all.\n  We often say we honor our veterans, but now is the time to show them \nwhat we mean. That is exactly what our new GI bill does. Our bill \ncloses the gap between the cost of college and the amount the veteran \npays for their education. I am proud to be working with my colleagues. \nThe occupant of the President's chair right now, Senator Jim Webb of \nVirginia, started this process--this bill--16 months ago. Others, \nincluding Senator Chuck Hagel, Senator John Warner, and I, and more \nthan half of the Senate, are fighting to get them the benefits they \nearned. They deserve no less.\n  The Senate has voted. The House has voted. Now we plead with \nPresident Bush to join with the majority of the Congress, all of the \nleading veterans organizations, and the American public in support of \nour bill. Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, more \nthan 1.5 million Americans have worn the uniform and served our Nation \nwith honor and distinction. Now it is time for us to stand with our \nveterans who have served since 9/11 so they, too, can build a future \nfor their families.\n  After D-day, Americans recognized the sacrifice our troops made and \ncame together to honor that service. Now is the time for us to stop \nplaying politics and come together once again.\n  Our veterans have earned a new GI bill. On this D-day anniversary, \nlet's give them the respect and the benefits they deserve.\n  I close with once again commending our colleague, Senator Jim Webb, \nwho has himself a distinguished military record and insisted from his \nearliest days that we take care of our veterans so they can take care \nof America and regain the leadership this country has lost and will \nretrieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5358-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GI BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I wish to talk just for a moment today \nabout the cloture vote on climate change legislation earlier today, but \nfirst, while I am getting some charts together, I wanted to mention \nalso that this is the 40th anniversary that was yesterday of the death \nof Robert Kennedy.\n  I was driving to the Capitol listening to a news report about that \nday 40 years ago when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles, \nCA, and I was thinking about the fact that I was a very young man back \nthen working on the Robert Kennedy Presidential campaign in my State \nwhen I heard that he had been assassinated. It was such an unbelievable \nblow to me and to all of the others who worked on the campaign and to \nso many other Americans who believed his campaign for the Presidency \nheld such great promise.\n  Most young people in this country today know nothing about a 1968 \nPresidential campaign by Robert F. Kennedy. It was an extraordinary \ntime, and he was an extraordinary man. I wish to read just a couple of \ncomments by the late Robert F. Kennedy, who was, by the way, a Senator \nand served in this body, as well as served as Attorney General of this \ncountry.\n  He gave a speech once that I have often quoted. It was a speech he \ngave in South Africa. Many will know these words. In his speech he said \nthis:\n\n       Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us \n     can work to change a small portion of the events, and in the \n     total of all these acts will be written the history of a \n     generation . . . it is from numberless diverse acts of \n     courage and belief that human history is thus shaped. Each \n     time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot \n     of others, or strikes out against injustice, they send forth \n     a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million \n     different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a \n     current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of \n     oppression and resistance.\n\n  He gave that speech June 6, 1966, at the University of Cape Town in \nSouth Africa. People often talk about those ripples of hope that can \nsweep down the mightiest walls of resistance and oppression, and that \npassion and that dream and belief still exist today.\n  I reread this morning the speech Robert Kennedy gave during his \nPresidential campaign in Indianapolis, IN, on the evening of April 4, \n1968, when Martin Luther King was assassinated. The crowd that had \ngathered for Robert Kennedy's appearance did not know that Dr. Martin \nLuther King had been assassinated and Robert Kennedy came to that area \nof Indianapolis. He was asked not to go because of concerns about his \nsafety. He went anyway and he gave one of the most wonderful speeches. \nIt was without a note, just an extemporaneous speech that had so much \npassion. I shall not read it today, but I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen--I'm only going to talk to you just \n     for a minute or so this evening. Because . . .\n       I have some very sad news for all of you, and I think sad \n     news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love \n     peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King \n     was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.\n       Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to \n     justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of \n     that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time \n     for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of \n     a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.\n       For those of you who are black--considering the evidence \n     evidently is that there were white people who were \n     responsible--you can be filled with bitterness, and with \n     hatred, and a desire for revenge.\n       We can move in that direction as a country, in greater \n     polarization--black people amongst blacks, and white amongst \n     whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make \n     an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to \n     comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of \n     bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to \n     understand, compassion and love.\n       For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled \n     with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, \n     against all white people, I would only say that I can\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n     also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a \n     member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\n       But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have \n     to make an effort to understand, to get beyond these rather \n     difficult times.\n       My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He once wrote: ``Even in \n     our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon \n     the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes \n     wisdom through the awful grace of God.''\n       What we need in the United States is not division; what we \n     need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the \n     United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love \n     and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling \n     of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, \n     whether they be white or whether they be black.\n       (Interrupted by applause)\n       So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for \n     the family of Martin Luther King, yeah that's true, but more \n     importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of \n     us love--a prayer for understanding and that compassion of \n     which I spoke. We can do well in this country. We will have \n     difficult times. We've had difficult times in the past. And \n     we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end \n     of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not \n     the end of disorder.\n       But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority \n     of black people in this country want to live together, want \n     to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all \n     human beings that abide in our land.\n       (Interrupted by applause)\n       Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many \n     years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the \n     life of this world.\n       Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our \n     country and for our people. Thank you very much. (Applause)--\n     Robert F. Kennedy, April 4, 1968.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5359-S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLIMATE SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the vote this morning was a vote dealing \nwith climate change. This vote, however, was not a yes or no on climate \nchange legislation; the vote was on a cloture motion to invoke cloture. \nI voted against invoking cloture. I wish to make sure those who have \nworked so hard on the legislation we were considering do not feel that \nvote diminishes the work they have done.\n  I believe there is something happening to the climate of this planet. \nI believe there is something dealing with global warming that threatens \nour future. I believe we have a responsibility to address it. I commend \nthose who worked on the legislation and brought it to the floor of the \nSenate. It was a good start. It was not perfect and needed amendments \nin my judgment. A tangled web was created on the floor of the Senate \nthrough no fault of the majority leader who brought this to the floor. \nHe indicated at the first moment that he wished this to be an open \nprocess with open debate and open opportunity for amendments. The \ntangled web that then ensued was a web that led us to a cloture motion \nand the filing of a cloture motion. Voting for cloture meant that we \nwould be prevented from offering an amendment post cloture. I did not \nbelieve I wanted to put myself in that position because I have two \namendments that have been filed. I had two amendments which I wished to \noffer and get them pending. Because of procedural hurdles, I was \nprevented from doing so because I was prevented from calling up \namendments, even though they were filed. I wasn't very interested in \nsupporting a cloture motion which would then prevent me from having the \namendments considered by the Senate as we move forward to finish the \npiece of legislation. So that represents my view of why I would not \nsupport cloture.\n  I filed an amendment dealing with additional funding for coal and \ncarbon capture and storage programs. I think we need to do a couple of \nthings if we are going to have a global climate change bill work. First \nof all, at the front end, for the first 5, 10, 12 and 14 years, we have \nto have a kind of Manhattan Project in which we decide for renewable, \nefficiency and clean coal energy resources that we are going to break \nout of the box and move forward very, very, very aggressively.\n  If we are going to deal with this issue, we have to move solar and be \nserious about developing substantial capabilities in solar energy. That \nrequires a massive amount of research and development. We have to be \nserious about wind energy and geothermal and biomass as well. We have \nto be serious about a whole range of renewable energy resources.\n  We have not been serious in this country. In 1916 we said to oil and \ngas companies: If you want to go find oil and gas, good for you, God \nbless you. We want to provide big tax breaks for you for doing it. \nThese permanent tax breaks have lasted forever regarding oil and gas.\n  What did we do with those who were pursuing renewable energy? In 1992 \nwe said: We will give you some tax incentives. By the way, they will be \ntemporary and kind of shallow, and we will extend them five times for a \nvery short term, and we will let them expire three times. That is a \npathetic, anemic response for a country that ought to, in my judgment, \ngallop full speed ahead toward the use of renewable energy. But you \nhave to have conservation and renewable energy research and development \ncommitments to achieve that goal.\n  In addition to that, we are going to have to continue to use coal in \nour future. Forty-eight percent of our electricity comes from coal. We \nare not in a position where we can simply say we are not going to use \ncoal. At the front end of this bill, we need to create a substantial \namount of resources to engage in the research and development, \ndemonstration and commercial deployment of projects that allow us to \nuse coal to produce electricity without injuring our environment. That \nmeans capturing carbon and sequestering carbon. That is central to the \nfuture use of coal and other fossil fuels.\n  Now, it is not as if it can't be done. We are doing it in some areas, \nbut we need so much more work on the research and development end.\n  This is a plant in North Dakota. It is the only one like it in North \nAmerica. We produce synthetic natural gas from lignite coal. We take \npieces of coal, and we produce synthetic gas from it. It works very \nwell. In fact, it is one of the world's largest demonstrations for \ncapturing and storing carbon. We capture 50 percent of the carbon from \nthis plant; put it in a pipeline; move it to Saskatchewan, Canada; and \ninvest it underground into Canadian oil wells to pump up and produce \nmore oil.\n  Most oil that is drilled from underground pools only provides about \n30 percent of its potential. The rest remains in the ground. If you can \nuse CO2 from fossil fuels at electric power plants and other \nfacilities, that CO2 would not be released into the \natmosphere to impact the climate. At the same time, you can use that \nCO2 instead for beneficial purposes and invest into an oil \nwell. Thus, you not only put the CO2 underground and \nsequester it, you also enhance domestic oil development and production.\n  There are a lot of things going on. But the underlying bill didn't \nhave nearly enough funding at the front end, in my judgment, for the \nresearch and development component. My filed amendment would shift $20 \nbillion in funding in the bill to say we are going to get serious. This \nis going to be a Manhattan-type project to find ways to continue to use \nour most abundant resource and do so without spoiling our environment.\n  There is research going on but not nearly enough. I can give you a \ncouple of examples.\n  A Texas company came to see me. They are taking coal for electricity. \nThey have a couple of small demonstration projects which burn coal to \nproduce electricity. They are treating the effluent that comes from the \nplant chemically, and as it comes out of the plant, they are capturing \nthe CO2 and producing byproducts, including hydrogen, \nchloride, and baking soda. The baking soda contains CO2. In \nfact, this company brought me some cookies and said these come from \ncoal. They are making the point that, by capturing the CO2 \nfrom a coal plant, you can end up with baking soda used for baking \ncookies. It is a clever way to describe that there are innovative ways \nto capture CO2 and protect our environment, even as we use \nour most abundant domestic resource.\n  This photo is of single-cell pond scum, called algae. I was in \nArizona recently and saw a demonstration plant that is producing algae \nby taking CO2 off of a plant and putting it in greenhouses \nthat produce algae. Algae is produced in water which need sunlight and \nCO2 to grow. So it consumes CO2 by producing \nalgae, single celled pond\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\nscum. It grows quickly, increasing its bulk in hours. They can harvest \nit for diesel fuel. So you actually capture the CO2 and \nproduce a beneficial use which is a biodiesel fuel. There are ways for \nus to do this.\n  My point is that if we are going to have a bill that works, you need \nto have dramatic funding commitment for research, development and \ndemonstration up front. That was not the case with the pending bill. I \nknow some will argue that it is. This is known as the kick-start fund \nfor coal and is largely for demonstration and deployment. That is \ndifferent from the massive need for additional research we need. We \nneed a Manhattan Project to make these investments. That is a different \nkind of funding than the research and technology we need if we are \ngoing to decide that we are going to unlock the mystery and use our \nmost abundant resource in the future. We continue to need investments \nin research and development as well as demonstration and deployment \nprograms for coal to thrive in a carbon constrained world.\n  I am also a fan of wind energy, energy from the wind, for producing \nelectricity. It makes sense. That doesn't contribute environmental \nproblems like emitting greenhouse gases. Also, there is geothermal and \nbiomass, the production of ethanol, and hopefully cellulosic ethanol in \nthe future.\n  I was visited by Dr. Craig Venter the other day who is working to \ncreate microbes and bacteria that would essentially eat the coal or \nconvert it into liquid fuels as it is being processed by these microbes \nwhile underground. That is pretty exciting. I also mentioned the other \nday that we are studying termites in the science area of our \nGovernment. These are the kinds of things people might ridicule. They \nsay why are we spending all this money to study termites. Termites eat \nyour house. When they eat wood, we understand now they produce methane \ngas, as a lot of living things do. We are trying to figure out what in \nthe 200 microbes in the gut of a termite might allow them to eat your \nhouse. If we can figure out how to break down woody products, it is \nimportant in terms of producing future energy from cellulosic ethanol.\n  There is a lot to do. If we are going to be serious about climate \nchange and global warming--and we should be, in my judgment--two things \nare necessary: One, we need to have kind of a Manhattan Project that in \na very short period of time is going to find ways to dramatically \nincrease the use of renewables. Second, we are going to dramatically \naccelerate our effort to determine how we can use coal and other fossil \nfuels and still protect our environment by capturing and sequestering \ncarbon or providing a beneficial use of carbon. That is expensive, but \nwe can get that done. That was the amendment I had, which would shift \n$20 billion to the front end of this to say: Let's do this in a serious \nmanner.\n  I wanted to indicate that my vote on cloture earlier today should not \ndiminish the work and effort and intent of others with respect to \nclimate change. I think something is happening in our climate. Most of \nus believe we will be seeing climate change legislation passing through \nthe Congress at some point in the near future--perhaps as early as next \nyear. When it is done, it needs to be done in a manner that is \nreflective of all of strengths and resources of our country to move \nahead in unison in doing the right thing in the right way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5360-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5360-S5361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRICE OF GASOLINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I spent part of this morning visiting with \nsome experts about the issue of energy speculation and the price of \ngasoline. I am very concerned about the price of gasoline. I come from \na State that not only produces a lot of energy but uses a lot of \npetroleum products. We are a farm State and a big State with a sparse \npopulation. North Dakota is spread over the equivalent of 10 \nMassachusettses in landmass. We use a lot of energy per capita. When \nthe price does what it has been doing recently, it is very harmful to a \nrural State that does a lot of family farming and requires people to \ntravel a lot because of its sheer size.\n  Here is what happened to oil prices in the last year: They have \ndoubled. There is no justification for that--none. There is no \njustification for this at all. Get this, crude oil futures hit a record \n$139 per barrel today.\n  I used to teach a little economics in college--not in a serious way. \nI taught the supply and demand intersection and what happens to price. \nI understand all that. If we take a look at supply and demand, there is \nnothing that justifies what is happening in the futures market with \nrespect to oil prices.\n  Now back up 14 months, in fact, to the time prior to the price of oil \ndoubling and ask yourself what happened in this world. Were we \noblivious then to the fact that India and China were going to want more \nfuel in their economies? I understand there are probably 150 million \nChinese who want to drive cars. Where are they going to get the fuel? A \nlot of folks in India want to drive cars too. I understand all of that. \nThese signals were already in the market 16 and 18 months ago. That is \nnot different.\n  Here is also what I understand. Since the first part of this year, \nour inventories of petroleum stocks have been going up in this country \nand use has been going down. People are driving slightly less and using \nless. So what is happening to price? It has doubled.\n  I will tell you what I think is happening. On the oil commodity \nmarkets, we have a dramatic orgy of speculation and carnival of greed. \nAre all of the speculators who are neck deep in these markets there \nbecause they want oil or want to hold oil? Have they tried to lift a \n42-gallon drum? I don't think so. They want to make money speculating. \nAs a result all of this excess speculation, they are driving up the \nprice of a commodity. That damages this country and injures most \nAmericans.\n  This is what has happened to speculation. This Congress and this \nPresident have a responsibility to stop it. When excess speculation \ndamages an economy, damages the country and its people, we have a \nresponsibility to stop excess speculation.\n  This is a picture of NYMEX, where they trade commodities. Most people \nhave seen pictures of the floor of a trading session like this. In \nfact, I think it was 80 years ago when Will Rogers talked about these \nguys buying things they will never get from people who never had it. At \nNYMEX, they trade futures contracts.\n  Let me describe what one fellow testified before the Energy \nCommittee. By the way, he has had 30 or 35 years as an executive \nanalyst in these markets. Fadel Gheit said this:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. I called it the world's largest gambling hall. It's \n     open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is totally unregulated. This is \n     like a highway with no cops and no speed limits, and \n     everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  Mr. President, the New Jersey Star Ledger wrote:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent to \n     the cost of a barrel of oil.\n\n  The president of Marathon Oil, Clarence Cazalot, Jr., said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  Here is an oil executive saying this price isn't justified.\n  Stephen Simon, a senior vice president at Exxon, said on April 1, \n2008:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel.\n\n  Mr. President, how did we get here? On December 15, 2000, in this \nChamber, one of our colleagues, Senator Gramm from Texas, stuck a \nlittle provision into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which was \nincluded in a very big piece of legislation that was being enacted. I \nbelieve it was the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000, a large \nsupplemental bill being done. That little provision changed everything. \nPrior to that time, prior to Senator Gramm from Texas putting this \nprovision into law, every futures contract in this country was subject \nto regulation and oversight. Senator Gramm stuck a provision in a very \nbig piece of legislation that said essentially certain commodity \nprovisions need not be subject to regulation and oversight. Then it \nstarted. That was called the Enron loophole.\n  I know something about that because I chaired the hearings at which \nthe late Ken Lay, the CEO and president of Enron Corporation, \ntestified. He raised his hand, took an oath, sat down, and\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\nthen took the fifth amendment. He ran one of the biggest energy \ncompanies in this country. We found out that at least part of it was a \ncriminal enterprise. It benefitted greatly by the actions of the \nCongress, and only a few in the Congress knew what they were trying to \ndo. That created this loophole by which Enron and others down the road \ncould create an energy market that was unregulated, outside of the view \nof regulators and of the grasp of regulators.\n  So now, going forward from December 15, 2000, to today, what is \nhappening is that we have seen, outside of the purview of regulators, a \ndramatic amount, an obscene amount of speculation in energy markets.\n  I have met with experts who have said that there is no speculation \nhere. Yesterday, I met with a person yesterday, someone who is an \nexpert in this area and runs a major corporation, who said there is no \nspeculation here. That is just wrong. That is false on its face. All \none has to do is look at what is happening in these markets. Can \nanybody, anyplace, anytime, anywhere tell us that something has \nhappened in the last 14 months in terms of the market fundamentals that \njustifies doubling the price of oil or gasoline? There is nothing that \njustifies that.\n  This Congress cannot sit around any longer. I know the President and \nthe Vice President opposed responding to the electricity crisis out \nWest when they first came to office. I recall when some of us in \nCongress were trying to take some action against what was happening to \nhijack wholesale electric prices on the West Coast by the Enron \nCorporation that they stood by idly. I and others pushed and pushed. \nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said there is nothing going on \nthere. Dick Cheney made fun of us, saying these markets are working, we \njust don't like markets. The President didn't want to do anything. We \nfinally found out what was something illegal happening. Every day was \ncriminal. They were manipulating supply in a criminal way, and there \nare people sitting in prison for it. Ken Lay died beforehand, but he \nwas on his way to prison because it was a criminal enterprise he was \nconducting. And the Vice President was belittling those of us in \nCongress who were trying to do something about it. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission was dead asleep, very content to do nothing.\n  That cannot continue to be replicated now. We have to do something to \nsoak the speculation out of these futures markets. There needs to be a \nfutures market for energy, I support that. There are legitimate hedging \nrequirements, I understand that. There needs to be liquidity, I \nunderstand that. But when you have excessive speculation that damages \nthis country and runs up the price of oil to double the price when, in \nfact, the market fundamentals do not justify it. Hedge funds, \ninvestment banks, and many others rush into these markets in order to \nmake profits through speculation and the public be damned. It doesn't \nmatter what it does to the country, then something is wrong, and it is \nthe responsibility of the Congress to act. It is our responsibility and \nrequirement. We cannot sit around and ignore this any longer.\n  I had a call from the owner of a trucking company in North Dakota the \nother day. They have been running a trucking firm for years. His dad \nran it, and his family has been running it for four or five decades. He \nsaid: I don't think we can continue. We can't afford the price of \ndiesel fuel.\n  I understand we have had 12 airlines that have gone into bankruptcy. \nI know of five in the last 6 or 8 weeks. The fact is, this country \ncannot exist without a vibrant aviation industry. We have to have \nairline companies that are able to move Americans back and forth across \nthe country. The price of jet fuel is even worse than the description I \njust offered with respect to gasoline and oil.\n  We need to work on this issue in a very aggressive and urgent way, \nand we need to do something that shuts down this speculation. I \nindicated yesterday that I am working on legislation to try to do that \nand to try to make certain we have a completely regulated system with \nrespect to the trading of these contracts.\n  First of all, they ought to be regulated. Some say that, if we try to \nregulate them here, they will move offshore. We ought to be able to \nregulate it. If you are in this country, you want to play games in the \ncommodities markets as a speculator, if you are picking up a telephone \nand trade commodities in this country, as far as I am concerned, you \nought to be regulated with respect to your order of commodities \ncontract.\n  A lot of work is being done. As I said, I spent part of this morning \nwith experts who understand the complexities and the vagaries of these \ncommodity markets and especially the oil markets and the speculation \nthat is occurring. I side with those who believe there is excessive \nspeculation and that there is a requirement that we do something about \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, we are getting ready to \nconsider the gasoline bill next week and all its ramifications for the \nAmerican public who are suffering under $4 and $4-plus gas.\n  A few days ago, this Senator showed a photograph of a town in north \nFlorida, Madison, FL, in Madison County, downtown, the local Shell Oil \nstation. Regular in the State of Florida, reflected in that photograph \nof a few days ago, was at $4.10 a gallon.\n  It goes without saying that our people are hurting. And I can tell \nyou, having had 18 townhall meetings last week all over my State, that \nhurting has turned into frustration, and that frustration is turning \ninto anger.\n  Now, there is a new poll out this week that reflects the increasing \nnumber of Americans who believe it is the supply and demand of oil that \nis driving these prices to record highs--just the supply and demand. We \nknow we have a very tight world oil market, and we know places such as \nIndia and China in fact are consuming more oil, and their demand is \nhigher. We understand that makes the world's oil markets all the more \ntight. And believe it or not, because of that, and because of this \nconstant amount of information coming out from the oil sector about \nsupply and demand creating the tight oil market, the American people \nare believing that is the cause of these record oil prices, believing \nthat translates into these very high gasoline prices.\n  It is interesting because it is just at a time that the Senate has \nvoted to close the so-called Enron loophole, which is perhaps the real \nculprit to blame in the shocking runup of the oil prices.\n  Now, what is the Enron loophole? Back in the year 2000, legislation \nwas passed that exempted oil and metals from being regulated on the \ncommodity futures exchange. That meant that as contracts for future \npurchase of oil and metals are being traded, there is no government \noversight, no government regulation of how much those can go up. So as \nlong as the participants bidding for those futures contracts continue \nto bid the price of those oil contracts higher and higher, in fact the \nprice of that oil on the world market continues to go higher and \nhigher, much over and above what normal supply and demand would cause \nthe price to be.\n  This closing of that Enron loophole has just occurred. It is still in \nthe works because even though it was added to the farm bill, the farm \nbill was vetoed by the President. The veto was then overridden and, \ntherefore, it came into law immediately upon the override. \nNevertheless, we found that we omitted a section of the farm bill, so \nwe are going back and redoing that all over again. We just passed the \nfarm bill again in its entirety in the Senate yesterday, last night. It \ndoes have the\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nEnron loophole closure in the bill. Presumably, that will be passed by \nthe House, go down to the President for signature, he will veto it \nagain, and then it will come back to both Houses for overriding, like \nwe did before about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and the Enron loophole will be \nclosed. There are a bunch of us, including this Senator, who were \ncosponsors of this provision. Hopefully, it is going to address this \nloophole.\n  But what happened in the past? It was enacted back in 2000--in \nDecember of 2000. I believe that loophole, when enacted, was exploited \nby energy traders. This is based on the mounting evidence that we see \nover and over. It is at least a partial cause of the huge runup in the \ngas prices.\n  Well, I think we need to do more on this Enron loophole. There have \nbeen some commentaries by some experts that say we should be closing it \nfurther. And if we need to do that, this Senator is certainly ready to \ndo it. But right now what needs further examination is how we got to \nthis point in the first place. How did this provision in law, leaving \nthis huge hole big enough to drive a Mack truck through get to this \npoint where it essentially exempted the trading of oil futures from \nFederal commodities regulation? How did that become the law of the \nland? What was the role of lobbyists and oil companies and investment \nbanks and commodity speculators? We need answers to those questions.\n  We have seen through testimony to the Congress and from other reports \nthat unchecked commodities trading plays a very significant role in \nrising gasoline prices. We know high gas prices are not merely a \nfunction of supply and demand in the marketplace. In fact, we ought to \nknow this from several years ago.\n  A subcommittee, led by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, found that \nsupplies were mostly adequate, but it found something else was missing. \nWhat was the role that caused these prices to be jacked up? Just a few \ndays ago, financier George Soros told our Senate Commerce Committee--in \nfact, just this past Tuesday--that a dramatic increase in commodities \ntrading in recent years has contributed to the oil bubble and its \n``harmful economic consequences.''\n  Indeed, loosely regulated speculators appear to have bid up oil \nprices to these unrealistic highs. There are also links between oil \ncompanies and investment banks in the oil futures trading. And this is \nwhat these reports are showing. The Senate investigations subcommittee, \nin a bipartisan way, under the leadership of Senator Levin, released a \nreport finding that there was lax Federal oversight of oil and gas \ntraders due to the loophole slipped into the law in 2000, and it was \nslipped in at the behest, according to the Levin report, of the now \ninfamous Enron Corporation, along with oil companies and investment \nbanks. That is according to the Levin report.\n  Other links between soaring oil prices and vast sums of money now \nflowing through these commodity markets were uncovered by a Homeland \nSecurity panel and our colleague, Independent-Democrat Senator Joe \nLieberman. In fact, a top oil executive for a major oil company \nrecently testified before a House panel that crude oil, under normal \nsupply and demand, ought to be around $55 a barrel, based on the rule \nof supply and demand. Yet last week it went up to $135, and it is \nsomewhere in the $130-a-barrel range today.\n  Mr. President, I think those investigations into the cause of the \nrunup of the price of oil ought to continue. An estimated one-third of \nthe amount of the runup of the price of oil can be blamed on \nspeculators having poured tens of billions of dollars into the \nunregulated energy commodities markets in the wake of that so-called \nEnron loophole that deregulated those commodities markets. In essence, \nthe loophole exempted electronic trading of energy and metal by large \ntraders--exempted them from Federal commodities regulation. Since then \nthe price of oil and natural gas has skyrocketed, and that is all \ndespite reports that the supplies are mostly adequate.\n  Next week we are going to try to take up legislation aimed at getting \nat this situation of high gas prices. This Senator intends to address \nthis issue.\n\n  If, in fact, as that oil company executive said, supply and demand \nought to cause oil to be trading at $55, why is it trading in excess of \n$130? What role do the unregulated commodities markets play, and how \ndid that get into law? How much of that capital out there is flowing \ninto that because those markets are unregulated, thereby driving up \nthat price to what we have today?\n  We see one Federal agency that otherwise regulates futures trading \nhas said it will investigate allegations of short-term manipulation of \ncrude oil prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also said it \nwould work with British regulators to monitor large trades of crude oil \nby a London futures exchange known as ICE, Intercontinental Exchange. \nSome of the founding members of that intercontinental exchange, it has \nbeen reported, were instrumental in getting the Enron loophole through \nCongress back in the year 2000. It was ill-conceived public policy at \nbest, and it should be reversed. Next week we are going to have a \nchance to do something about it because we have legislation on the \nprice of gasoline coming to the Senate floor.\n  By having greater oversight and regulation on oil trading, we \nobviously have to go beyond that and look to our commitment to a \ncomprehensive national energy policy. Fifty percent of the oil we use \ngoes into transportation, and most of that is for our personal \nvehicles. So it should not take a rocket scientist to realize we must \nfocus on conservation measures like 40 miles per gallon as a fleet \naverage for our vehicles. We finally broke through and got through the \nSenate 35 miles per gallon phased in over the next 12 years. Maybe we \nought to accelerate that.\n  We ought to look at providing bigger tax breaks for hybrid and plug-\nin hybrid vehicles. Ultimately, we must look to the research and \ndevelopment of electric and hydrogen-powered cars.\n  All of this is going to fall in the lap of the next President. The \nnext President is going to have to urge us--and I hope we will support \nthe next President--to enact a national energy program to transition us \nfrom gasoline to alternative, synthetic, and renewable fuels to power \nmuch of this economic engine of America.\n  President Kennedy led us on such a monumental task, and that was the \ntask to escape the bonds of Earth within a decade, to go to the Moon, \nand return safely. We did that. We must act with the same urgency now. \nWhile we are at it, we are going to have to make ethanol from things \nthat we do not eat. While we are at that, we are going to have to pay \nattention to how we power, not just our cars and trucks, but our homes \nand our industries.\n  We need to develop solar and wind and thermal energy and safe nuclear \npower. The world is begging for change. One of the most enormous \nchanges that needs to be brought about is how we utilize and how we \ncreate energy and how we are going to utilize and create energy for the \nfuture. We have a chance to do that next week when we take up this \nlegislation about the high price of gasoline.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5362-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5362-S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN REMEMBRANCE OF JAMES BYRD, JR.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a life that was \nuntimely taken and to recall a horrific hate crime that shocked a \nnation. Ten years ago this week James Byrd, Jr., was dragged 3 miles--\nchained to the back of pickup truck--on a rural road in Jasper County, \nTX, to his death. It was said that a blood trail of body parts and \npersonal effects stretched over 2 miles, with Byrd's severed head, \nright arm, and neck found almost a mile from where his tattered torso \nwas discarded. Byrd's face had been spray painted black.\n  James Byrd was a victim of the cruelest form of racial intolerance. \nHe was murdered for no other reason than for the color of his skin. To \nthink that such a senseless crime could occur in the wake of so many of \nour Nation's civil rights milestones is disheartening. It is also a \nstark reminder that much work remains to be done in protecting \nminorities and ending intolerance.\n  No American should have to live in fear because of their sexual \norientation, race, gender, national origin, or disability. As a nation, \nwe cannot afford to become complacent. We must forever strive to reach \nthe golden rings\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nof democracy--that is, equality, opportunity, freedom and tolerance. We \nmust also remain vigilant and guard against individuals and groups that \nseek to marginalize and terrorize whole groups of individuals. That is \nwhy, as I have done many times before, I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to enact Federal hate crimes legislation this year. We must \npass this legislation and send a message that crimes of intolerance and \nhate are especially deplorable.\n  The Government's first duty is to defend its citizens and to defend \nthem against violence and harm associated with intolerance and hate. I \nhave introduced legislation, the Matthew Shepard Act, with my colleague \nSenator Ted Kennedy, to ensure that the Government has all the \nresources necessary to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. \nThe Matthew Shepard Act would better equip the Government to fulfill \nits most important obligation of protecting all of its citizens.\n  On this anniversary of the death of James Byrd, let us renew our \nNation's commitment to protecting all Americans regardless of their \nsexual orientation, race, religion, national origin, gender, \ndisability, or color by passing the Matthew Shepard Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5363-S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during the Senate recess at the end of \nlast month, I visited the central front in our Nation's fight against \nal-Qaida: Pakistan. During my 4-day stay, I met with a broad range of \npolitical officials from numerous parties, including the Pakistan \nPeople's Party of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the PLM-N of \nformer Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, as well as with President Pervez \nMusharraf, Pakistani intelligence officials, the ousted chief justice, \nand representatives of Pakistan's civil society. Outside of Islamabad, \nmy visit included a trip to Peshawar, in the tumultuous Northwest \nFrontier Province, where I met with local officials, and Kashmir, where \nthe United States has funded numerous successful humanitarian and \ndevelopment programs in the wake of the devastating 2005 earthquake.\n  The breadth of this trip was commensurate with the critical \nimportance of Pakistan to our country's national security. Despite \nrecent claims by CIA Director Michael Hayden that al-Qaida is now on \nthe defensive, including in its safe haven in Pakistan, I traveled \nthere because it is out of that country that we face our most serious \nnational security threat. As the intelligence community has said again \nand again, the fight against al-Qaida begins in Pakistan. According to \nthe State Department's 2007 terrorism report which was released this \npast April, al-Qaida and associated networks remain the greatest \nterrorist threat to the United States. That threat emanates from the \nreconstitution of some of al-Qaida's pre-9/11 capabilities ``through \nthe exploitation of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas.'' \nThe report added that instability in Pakistan, ``coupled with the \nIslamabad brokered cease-fire agreement in effect for the first half of \n2007 along the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier, appeared to have provided \nAQ leadership greater mobility and ability to conduct training and \noperational planning, particularly that targeting Western Europe and \nthe United States.''\n  During my visit, I conducted extensive discussions with Pakistani \nleaders about ceasefire negotiations, in the Federally Administered \nTribal Areas, FATA, as well as in the Swat region of the NWFP. I remain \nskeptical about those negotiations and am particularly concerned that \nthose in the FATA region will give al-Qaida room to plot against our \ntroops in Afghanistan and our citizens here in the United States. The \nnew civilian-led Government in Pakistan is seeking a different approach \nfrom that of President Musharraf, and that is understandable--it has, \nin fact, been mandated by the people of Pakistan, and it is high time \nthey have a responsive government that heeds their call. A key part of \nthis new approach will require success in reining in the military \napparatus, which has historically controlled much of Pakistan's foreign \npolicy--sometimes overtly with a military dictator running the country \nand other times more discreetly from behind a screen of a civilian-led \ngovernment. But as Pakistan's new Government seeks to reconcile these \ncomplex, multilayered issues, it must not do so at the expense of the \ngrave threats emanating from the border region. We must address those \nthreats head-on because what happens in the terrorist safe haven of \nFATA is central to our national security, and we cannot afford to be \ndistracted or complacent. To do so would be to the detriment of our \nsafety and security as well as that of our friends and allies.\n  At the same time, any long-term counterterrorism strategy in the FATA \nmust include serious economic reforms, legal political party \ndevelopment, and initiatives to integrate FATA with the rest of \nPakistan. This will not be easy, but it is long overdue and will help \nensure we are using all the tools at our disposal to fight al-Qaida and \nassociated terrorist threats. The growing extremism and creation of a \nterrorist safe haven in FATA has emerged out of decades of political \nmarginalization and ensuing poverty. In working closely with the FATA \npolitical agents and local law enforcement, as well as the Government \nof Pakistan, we need to help create sustainable development strategies \nthat provide opportunities for engagement while ensuring sufficient \nfinancial resources are allocated to those in need now and in the years \nto come.\n  This must include not only traditional development projects but \ninstitution building and political engagement in a region long deprived \nof such opportunities. The people of the FATA must have alternative \nlivelihood options that help facilitate opposition to terrorists and \nextremists.\n  At the same time, we must find Osama Bin Laden and his senior \nleaders, and we must work to neutralize forces that plot or carry out \nattacks against Americans. But that cannot be our only goal. This fight \nruns much deeper than a simple manhunt--if we are serious about \ncountering al-Qaida, and preventing another Bin Laden from emerging, we \nmust shift our assistance to be more aligned with the needs of the \nlocal population and expand our development assistance throughout a \ncountry where poverty and anti-Western sentiment are pervasive.\n  This administration's policies toward Pakistan have been highly \ndamaging to our long-term national security. By embracing and relying \non a single, unpopular, antidemocratic leader--namely, President \nMusharraf--President Bush failed to develop a comprehensive \ncounterterrorism strategy that transcends individuals. He also \nencouraged Pakistanis to be skeptical about American intentions and \nprinciples. The recent elections provide a window of opportunity as the \npeople of Pakistan soundly rejected President Musharraf's leadership in \nfavor of political parties that promised a new direction. Although \ndomestic politics remain fragile, we have an opportunity to reverse our \nhistory of neglect and mixed signals by expanding our relationships and \nsupporting fundamental democratic institutions instead of one strong \nman--something the President may still be reluctant to do. We must do \nthis so that our counterterrorism partnership can withstand the ups and \ndowns of Pakistan's domestic politics, reflecting a more wide-ranging \napproach that does not ratchet up the already high levels of anti-\nAmerican sentiment in that country.\n  Any enduring counterterrorism partnership must recognize that \nPakistan, despite the coups and military dictatorships that have marred \nits history, has a democratic tradition, a vibrant civil society, and a \nlarge and educated middle class whose interests and values frequently \ncoincide with ours. By working with those Pakistanis and supporting \ntheir desire to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, \nwe align ourselves with the moderate forces that are critical to the \nfight against extremism. Supporting the Pakistani people as they seek \nto strengthen democratic institutions is not just an outgrowth of our \nvalues--it is in our national security interests. The counterterrorism \nefforts we need from Islamabad must be serious and sustained in a way \nthat only democratic processes can ensure.\n  For these reasons, I have been deeply disappointed by the Bush \nadministration's failure to condemn the illegal dismissal of the chief \njustice of Pakistan and scores of other judges and its\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nrefusal to call for their reinstatement. The ousting of the judges has \nbecome a cause celebre for Pakistan's civil society. It prompted the \ncreation of a ``Lawyers' Movement''--a moderate, democratic uprising \nthat Americans should embrace. During my time in Pakistan, I visited \nwith the chief justice and shortly thereafter called for the judges to \nbe reinstated because it is a clear violation of the basic tenets of \nthe rule of law. I was asked whether I had made such a call in support \nof a particular political party and whether I also sought the removal \nof President Musharraf. I responded that those are issues for the \nPakistanis to determine, and I continue to believe that is the case. \nIndeed, while the political landscape in Pakistan remains turbulent and \nfragile, I have no intention of meddling in domestic affairs. \nNonetheless, it is unacceptable for the United States to sit back in \nthe face of such fundamentally undemocratic actions. We cannot be \nselective in the democratic principles we support--that is not \nconsistent with our values, and it is shortsighted in terms of our \nnational security.\n  Mr. President, the emergence of a new civilian leadership in Pakistan \nprovides an opening for us to develop a new approach--a new \nrelationship--that includes a sustainable, comprehensive \ncounterterrorism partnership. We must seize this opportunity because, \ndespite a great deal of anti-American sentiment, in many areas the \nPakistanis are ready and willing to work with us. This is not to say \nthat this process will be free from challenges--there are already \nserious hurdles that must be dealt with, including negotiations in the \nFATA and NWFP, both of which are cause for concern. In the end, we must \nrecognize that the new leadership reflects a broad cross-section of \nPakistan, and by fully engaging them, we can take an important step \ntoward defending our national security interests in the central front \nin the fight against al-Qaida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5364-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREIGHT RAIL INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the impact the \nfreight rail industry has on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. \nAccording to a recent Department of Transportation study, freight \ntraffic is expected to increase 67 percent by 2020--against a backdrop \nof concerns about global climate change, the stringency of clean air \nstandards, increased traffic congestion, high energy prices, and the \nneed for greater energy independence. Freight rail is the most energy \nefficient and environmentally friendly mode of land transportation. \nToday, freight rail can move a ton of freight 436 miles on a single \ngallon of diesel. U.S. freight railroads have significantly reduced \ntheir carbon intensity and fuel efficiency. In 1980, 1 gallon of diesel \nfuel moved 1 ton of freight by rail an average of 235 miles. In 2007, \nthe same amount of fuel moved 1 ton of freight by rail an average of \n436 miles roughly equivalent to the distance from Boston to Baltimore \nand an 80-percent increase over 1980. Depending upon the type of cargo \nbeing transported and the number of cars, a single freight train is \ncapable of being as productive as 500 trucks.\n  I am pleased that CSX is working with Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, \nWest Virginia, and Pennsylvania on the National Gateway. The National \nGateway is a plan to create a more efficient rail route linking Mid-\nAtlantic ports with midwestern markets, improving the flow of rail \ntraffic between these regions by increasing the use of double-stack \ntrains. This public-private partnership will upgrade tracks, equipment \nand facilities, and provide clearance allowing double-stack intermodal \ntrains.\n  The National Gateway proposes preparing three major rail corridors \nfor double-stack clearance: I-95 corridor between North Carolina and \nBaltimore, MD, via Washington, DC; I-70/I-76 corridor between \nWashington, DC, and northwest Ohio via Pittsburgh, PA; and Carolina \ncorridor between Wilmington, NC and Charlotte, NC. The result will be \nthousands of new jobs, improved railway reliability, and the diversion \nof heavy trucks from crowded highways leading to reduced emissions and \nhighway maintenance costs and improved road safety.\n  Since the I-70/I-76 corridor between Washington, DC, and northwest \nOhio is a highly traveled route, it is well-located to become an \nefficient link between the east coast and midwestern markets. Expansion \nof rail infrastructure in Columbus, OH, and North Baltimore, OH, will \nhelp alleviate some of the freight congestion in the Chicago, \nCincinnati and Cleveland areas. The National Gateway project would \nbuild a new rail terminal in North Baltimore, OH, and expand intermodal \ncapacity in Columbus, creating thousands of new jobs. I look forward to \nworking with the Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and \nPennsylvania delegations to make this partnership a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5364-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO KELLY CONE AND LISA SCHWARTZ\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last month, I was contacted by SFC \nJohn Cone and CPT David Schwartz, both forward deployed in Iraq at \nTactical Psychological Operations headquarters. For each of these \nsoldiers, this is their second deployment in support of the global war \non terror. While both of these soldiers are dedicated and decorated \nservicemembers as well as public servants serving as civilian law \nenforcement officers at home, I want to honor in the Record of the \nSenate today their devoted and compassionate spouses back home.\n  Prior to their deployment in January 2008 with the 310th Tactical \nPsychological Operations Company, Detachment 1620 at Fort Gillem, their \nspouses, Kelly Cone and Lisa Schwartz, established a family readiness \ngroup to help support the deployed soldiers and their families back \nhome. While Mrs. Cone and Mrs. Schwartz are both caring and devoted \nmothers at home with many other responsibilities, they took it upon \nthemselves to create a Web page for their Family Readiness Group and \nbegan conducting regular information meetings and monthly ``coffee \nchat'' sessions with the families and spouses of the deployed soldiers.\n  These sessions not only kept the families inspired but also kept them \ninformed regarding the details surrounding the deployment of their \nloved ones. Attendance has been high and the families receptive, each \nof the members providing input and assistance as needed. I was simply \namazed to learn of all of their efforts and accomplishments in keeping \nthe information channels and support networks fully functioning. For \nexample, the Family Readiness Group recently mobilized to assist one of \nits members, a young woman who had gone into labor, and helped \ncoordinate the redeployment of her husband from Iraq.\n  These two determined spouses did not stop with their Family Readiness \nGroup efforts alone and have set about to aid in the establishment of a \nFamily Readiness Group for the remainder of the 310th Company, set to \ndeploy in the summer of 2009. They will host a Family Day in August to \nbring the new and old members together.\n  Mrs. Cone and Mrs. Schwartz serve as shining examples of today's Army \nspouses. Today's military spouses understand and seek to support their \nloved ones who have been called up and deployed into harm's way. It is \nmy hope that the efforts of Kelly Cone and Lisa Schwartz will serve as \na model for other families with deployed loved ones. It gives me a \ngreat deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the Senate \nfloor these dedicated and loving spouses for their outstanding efforts, \npatriotism, and selfless achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5364-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5364-S5365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING ALAN F. HARRE ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I wish to extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Alan Harre on the occasion of his retirement from \nthe presidency of Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, IN.\n  I have known Alan for many years and have greatly valued his \ninsightful guidance. He is a man of singular character and faith whose \nleadership has been an important cornerstone for Valparaiso University \nand the community in which it resides since his arrival there in 1988.\n  As the University's 17th president, Dr. Harre has overseen an \nexciting two\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\ndecades of growth and expansion on campus. With his support a center \nfor the arts was built, as was the Kade-Duesenberg German House and \nCultural Center, the Christopher Center for Library and Information \nResources, and the Kallay-Christopher Hall. In addition, several \nrenovation and structural expansion projects owe their success to Dr. \nHarre's commitment and vision toward making Valparaiso a world-class \ncollegiate environment.\n  But perhaps President Harre's most impressive achievements have very \nlittle to do with mere brick and mortar building projects. They include \na considerable expansion of the university's nationally ranked graduate \nprograms, greater enrollment of minorities and international students, \nthe establishment of 11 endowed chairs and professorships to attract \nand retain high caliber instructors, and technological upgrades that \noffer students 21st century tools and skill-sets.\n  While President Harre will be dearly missed back in Valparaiso, I am \nconfident that the legacy he leaves behind will continue to be a great \nboon for this lauded institution of learning. I wish Alan every success \nas he pursues new challenges and adventures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5365-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO SHAWNEE MISSION NORTH NAVAL JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICER \n                             TRAINING CORPS\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \nNaval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, NJROTC, of Shawnee Mission \nNorth High School in Overland Park, KS, for their outstanding \nperformance in the 2008 NJROTC Nationals competition. For 3 consecutive \nyears, the Shawnee Mission North NJROTC, under the leadership and \nguidance of Chief Warrant Officer 4 Dennis C. Grayless, USMC (Ret) and \nChief Petty Officer Christopher W. Neven, USN (Ret), has qualified to \ncompete in the prestigious NJROTC National Academic, Athletic and Drill \nChampionship hosted by the Navy League of the United States at the \nPensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL. The NJROTC Nationals, or \n``Navy Nationals'' as it is affectionately referred to by the \nparticipants, is the most comprehensive test of overall JROTC training \nand performance in existence today. The Nation's finest NJROTC units \nfrom each of the 11 Navy Areas participate in this two-day academic, \nathletic, and drill competition. There is no competition in JROTC that \nprovides a more comprehensive test of program quality.\n  Earlier this year, the Shawnee Mission North team was recognized as \nthe Area 9 Most Outstanding Unit after sweeping the NJROTC Area 9 \nChampionship Drill Team Competition. The team placed first in armed \nexhibition, unarmed exhibition, armed regulation, unarmed regulation, \npush-ups, curl-ups/sit-ups and in the 16 x 100 shuttle relay. While \nthey placed second in the competition for Color Guard, 8 x 200 oval \nrelay, academics, and personnel inspection. As 2008 Area 9 Regional \nChampion, the team qualified to return to the Navy Nationals for the \nthird consecutive year.\n  At the 2008 national competition, the Shawnee Mission North team \nplaced first in the Nation in the Armed Regulation Drill and finished \nseventh in the overall competition. Cadet Dylan Warnick received \nindividual honors by finishing third in the Nation in the male curl-up/\nsit-up competition by completing 320 cadenced curl-ups/sit-ups in 5 \nminutes. Cadet Bethany Krzesinski received individual honors by \nfinishing sixth in the Nation in the female curl-up/sit up competition \nby completing 268 cadenced curl-ups/sit-ups in 5 minutes. While Cadet \nMichael Hoffman received individual honors by tying for fifth in the \nNation in the male push-up competition by completing 114 cadenced push-\nups in 5 minutes.\n  As reflected in the success achieved by the Shawnee Mission North \nNJROTC unit, it is apparent the breadth and depth of commitment, \ndedication, hard work, resolve and motivation each member of this team \npossesses. The Shawnee Mission North NJROTC unit has been recognized as \na Naval Honor Unit (1992-1999), a Naval Distinguished Unit (2000, 2007, \n2008), recipient of the Unit Achievement Award (2003), a Chief of Naval \nEducation and Training Unit (1988, 1989), the 2007 National Academic, \nAthletic and Drill Champions, and the 2008 Area 9 Most Outstanding \nUnit. Five of its graduating cadets have enlisted into the U.S. Armed \nForces; one has been awarded an NROTC scholarship to attend Purdue \nUniversity; and two cadets from the junior class have been accepted \ninto the 2008 summer semester at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD.\n  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in recognizing and congratulating the Shawnee Mission North \nNaval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps 2008 National Championship \nTeam: Sara Atwood, Michael Barr, Jessie Biggs, Andrew Boyce, Amiee \nBusch, Robert Byrd, Matthew Carlyon, Bryan Chapple, Faith Cole, Amanda \nFuller, Tyler Gearin, Darrell Hayes, Joshua Hoffman, Michael Hoffman, \nAlisyn Katsantones, Stacey Kennedy, Bethany Krzesinski, Lauren Lawson, \nMegan Lawson, Shelby McIntosh, Justin Manford, Kyle Middaugh, Timothy \nOehlert, Philip Park, Brandon Patrick, Aaron Patterson, Jeremy Payne, \nJersey Payne, Devin Root, Niklas Rueter, Djourdan Stephens, Aliana \nSwiercinsky, Brandon Ware, Dylan Warnick, Gregory Wynn, and Rachel \nYearsley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5365-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO HENRY AND HOMER MONTGOMERY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish today, June 6, 2008, the \n64th anniversary of the Allied Powers' invasion of Normandy, to pay \ntribute to Henry and Homer Montgomery, two brothers who answered their \nNation's call to duty. These brothers, like so many of their peers, \ngave up the comforts of home to go to an unfamiliar land to fight in \ndefense of our Nation.\n  Henry Montgomery, now 92, hit the beach at Normandy on June 7, 1944. \nHe served in the European theater as an artilleryman and motorcycle \ncourier, walking much of the way between Normandy and Berlin. This \njourney of nearly 1,000 miles was so arduous that when he arrived in \nBerlin, he was medically discharged and returned to our shores on a \nhospital ship.\n  Homer Montgomery, now 82, served in the Pacific theater toward the \nend of World War II halfway around the world from his brother. He was a \nMilitary Police officer who served through the end of the war.\n  The contributions made by these two brothers are an excellent example \nof the sacrifices made by our greatest generation. They were able to \nsee our nation and our allies emerge from the war victorious and return \nhome unlike so many of their brothers in arms. Their commitment to this \nstruggle and that of their comrades was critical to securing our \nliberties, and our nation is forever indebted to them.\n  And so, Mr. President I am honored to pay tribute to these two great \nAmerican patriots. May they greatly enjoy the freedom they have secured \nfor all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5365-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3021.

Res. 588\n\n       Whereas, at great personal risk and sacrifice, Dr. Feng \n     Shan Ho authorized the issuance of Chinese visas to Jewish \n     persons so they could emigrate from Austria and escape the \n     horrors of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas it is necessary to honor Dr. Ho posthumously \n     because, in the ultimate demonstration of selfless \n     humanitarianism, Dr. Ho never sought recognition for his \n     courageous actions;\n       Whereas 70 years ago, Adolf Hitler's troops crossed into \n     Austria and announced the Anschluss (the annexation of \n     Austria to Germany), thereby applying all anti-Semitic \n     decrees to Austrian Jews;\n       Whereas the Nazis brutally persecuted more than 200,000 \n     Austrian Jews, by forcibly\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n     segregating them, depriving them of their citizenship and \n     livelihoods, and interning them in concentration camps;\n       Whereas the fierceness of the persecution in Austria became \n     the model for the future persecution of Jews in other Nazi-\n     conquered territories;\n       Whereas the Nazis initially assumed a policy of coerced \n     expulsion, with the goal of eventually removing all Jewish \n     persons from Europe;\n       Whereas most other foreign consulates, although besieged by \n     desperate Jews, offered no help;\n       Whereas a young Chinese diplomat in Vienna, Dr. Feng Shan \n     Ho, refused to stand by and witness the destruction of \n     innocent human beings, and authorized the issuance of visas \n     for all Jews who asked;\n       Whereas word spread quickly and Jewish persons formed long \n     lines in front of the Chinese Consulate to obtain the \n     lifesaving visas;\n       Whereas the Chinese ambassador in Berlin ordered Dr. Ho to \n     stop authorizing visas for Jews, but Dr. Ho nevertheless \n     continued, at risk to his career, to prepare the visas;\n       Whereas in 1939, the Nazis confiscated the Chinese \n     Consulate building, on the grounds that it was a Jewish-owned \n     building;\n       Whereas, when the Chinese government refused funds to \n     relocate the Consulate, Dr. Ho reopened the Consulate in \n     another building and personally paid all the expenses;\n       Whereas in May 1940, Dr. Ho left Vienna, having authorized \n     visas for thousands of Austrian Jews;\n       Whereas after 4 decades in diplomatic service to China, in \n     1973, Dr. Ho moved to the United States to join his children;\n       Whereas Dr. Ho became a United States citizen and lived in \n     San Francisco until September 28, 1997, when he passed away \n     at the age of 96;\n       Whereas the world only knows of Dr. Ho's courageous actions \n     because of a chance discovery among his diplomatic papers \n     after his death, and the full extent of Dr. Ho's heroism is \n     still being uncovered; and\n       Whereas in 2000, the State of Israel posthumously made Dr. \n     Ho an honorary citizen of Israel and granted him one of \n     Israel's highest honors, the title of Righteous Among the \n     Nations, ``for his humanitarian courage in issuing Chinese \n     visas to Jews in Vienna in spite of orders from his superior \n     to the contrary'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and salutes the great courage and humanity of \n     Dr. Feng Shan Ho for acting at great personal risk to issue \n     Chinese visas to Jews in Vienna between 1938 and 1940; and\n       (2) recognizes his heroic deeds in saving the lives of \n     thousands of Jewish persons by allowing them to escape the \n     Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5373-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4976.

Res. 588\n\n       Whereas, at great personal risk and sacrifice, Dr. Feng \n     Shan Ho authorized the issuance of Chinese visas to Jewish \n     persons so they could emigrate from Austria and escape the \n     horrors of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas it is necessary to honor Dr. Ho posthumously \n     because, in the ultimate demonstration of selfless \n     humanitarianism, Dr. Ho never sought recognition for his \n     courageous actions;\n       Whereas 70 years ago, Adolf Hitler's troops crossed into \n     Austria and announced the Anschluss (the annexation of \n     Austria to Germany), thereby applying all anti-Semitic \n     decrees to Austrian Jews;\n       Whereas the Nazis brutally persecuted more than 200,000 \n     Austrian Jews, by forcibly segregating them, depriving them \n     of their citizenship and livelihoods, and interning them in \n     concentration camps;\n       Whereas the fierceness of the persecution in Austria became \n     the model for the future persecution of Jews in other Nazi-\n     conquered territories;\n       Whereas the Nazis initially assumed a policy of coerced \n     expulsion, with the goal of eventually removing all Jewish \n     persons from Europe;\n       Whereas most other foreign consulates, although besieged by \n     desperate Jews, offered no help;\n       Whereas a young Chinese diplomat in Vienna, Dr. Feng Shan \n     Ho, refused to stand by and witness the destruction of \n     innocent human beings, and authorized the issuance of visas \n     for all Jews who asked;\n       Whereas word spread quickly and Jewish persons formed long \n     lines in front of the Chinese Consulate to obtain the \n     lifesaving visas;\n       Whereas the Chinese ambassador in Berlin ordered Dr. Ho to \n     stop authorizing visas for Jews, but Dr. Ho nevertheless \n     continued, at risk to his career, to prepare the visas;\n       Whereas in 1939, the Nazis confiscated the Chinese \n     Consulate building, on the grounds that it was a Jewish-owned \n     building;\n       Whereas, when the Chinese government refused funds to \n     relocate the Consulate, Dr. Ho reopened the Consulate in \n     another building and personally paid all the expenses;\n       Whereas in May 1940, Dr. Ho left Vienna, having authorized \n     visas for thousands of Austrian Jews;\n       Whereas after 4 decades in diplomatic service to China, in \n     1973, Dr. Ho moved to the United States to join his children;\n       Whereas Dr. Ho became a United States citizen and lived in \n     San Francisco until September 28, 1997, when he passed away \n     at the age of 96;\n       Whereas, the world only knows of Dr. Ho's courageous \n     actions because of a chance discovery among his diplomatic \n     papers after his death, and the full extent of Dr. Ho's \n     heroism is still being uncovered; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, the State of Israel posthumously made Dr. \n     Ho an honorary citizen of Israel and granted him one of \n     Israel's highest honors, the title of Righteous Among the \n     Nations, ``for his humanitarian courage in issuing Chinese \n     visas to Jews in Vienna in spite of orders from his superior \n     to the contrary'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and salutes the great courage and humanity of \n     Dr. Feng Shan Ho for acting at great personal risk to issue \n     Chinese visas to Jews in Vienna between 1938 and 1940; and\n       (2) recognizes his heroic deeds in saving the lives of \n     thousands of Jewish persons by allowing them to escape the \n     Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5375-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.J.

Mr. President, today the price of oil is $132 a barrel. I \ndo not know how the stock market is going to wind up, but with the slap \nin the face the economy got today with the unemployment rate \nskyrocketing and the price of oil $132 a barrel, the stock market is \ndown about 300 points. How it is going to wind up today, I do not know.\n  Mr. President, on the global warming bill we just completed--and I \nsay ``completed''--we were unable to offer amendments, we were unable \nto legislate on this most important piece of legislation. The \nRepublicans said what they wanted to do is anytime we mention ``global \nwarming,'' they would mention ``gas prices.''\n  Well, today, we do not have to guess what we are going to do next \nbecause I am going to file cloture on the most important piece of \nlegislation dealing with gas prices we have done in some time.\n  So, Mr. President, we, as I have indicated, heard the Republicans \nspeak at length about the problem of high gas prices. In doing so, they \nfollow the lead of the majority who have been not just speaking about \nhigh gas prices for months but now working to find some solutions. We \nintroduced something called the Consumer-First Energy Act. It was \nblocked by the Republicans. But now maybe, with gas prices even higher \nthan they were a month ago, our Republican friends are finally ready to \njoin our pursuit of solutions. Perhaps now, after taking their gas \nprices on the floor of the Senate for a week and talking about it and \ntalking about it, they are ready to back their words with action. So \nnext week they will have a chance--it will be Tuesday morning--to vote \non gas prices. We are going to return to that legislation that will \nrelieve the burden of record gas prices for American consumers, both in \nthe long term and the short term.\n  What is in this bill? The President will remember, one of the things \nin the bill previously--we had five sections of the bill--one of them \nsaid: Mr. President, with the gas prices as high as they are, why do \nyou continue to take this oil, the best oil there is--the sweet crude--\nand pump it into the Petroleum Reserve when it is almost filled \nanyway? So we did that, and that now is not happening anymore. He is \nnot pumping that because we peeled part of that off and passed it \nindividually.\n\n  So what is left in our legislation? First, it ends in billions of \ndollars in tax breaks for oil companies--oil companies whose executives \nhave been hauling in record profits while we pay record prices for \ngasoline. I don't know what it is in Virginia, but in Nevada the price \nof gas is now more than $4 a gallon.\n  As I sat on the floor of the Senate earlier this week, a friend of \nmine whom I went to high school with--his name is Ted Sandival and I \nhave done legal work for him over the years when I practiced law and we \nhave maintained a relationship--called me. I was wondering what was \nwrong. In the whole conversation, the only thing he expressed to me \nthat he was concerned about was that he always wanted to buy a diesel \nvehicle because they last so much longer. So he bought a diesel vehicle \nand he said: Harry, I can't afford to put fuel in it anymore. I am\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\npaying almost $5 a gallon for diesel fuel.\n  Well, the oil companies are making record profits. The oil executives \nare making record salaries and bonuses and are getting record amounts \nof compensation, and we don't think it is appropriate at this time for \nthe American taxpayers to continue paying billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks to the oil companies. We are going to vote on this Tuesday \nmorning.\n  The other section of our bill forces oil companies to do their part \nby investing part of their profits in clean and affordable alternative \nenergy.\n  Third: We protect the American people from price gougers and greedy \noil traders who manipulate the market.\n  Finally, a bipartisan section of this bill. Senators Specter and Kohl \ncame to see me yesterday, both longtime members of the Judiciary \nCommittee who believe that OPEC and others who are colluding to keep \noil prices high should be subject to this Sherman Antitrust Act. \nSenator Specter went through all the legal reasons, and as we all know, \nhe is a real legal scholar. So I am convinced he is right and we should \ndo this.\n  The Consumer First Energy Act does exactly what it promises: It ends \nmore than 7 years of the Cheney energy policy that has lined the \npockets of modern-day oil barons and left the American people to pay \nthe bill.\n  Finally, it puts consumers first. Is this a silver bullet ending all \nthe problems? Of course not. But it is a bill that will solve some of \nthe energy problems we have in our country today.\n  This legislation is an important step that will make a difference, as \nI have said, in the long and the short run. So I hope the minority will \nput their votes where their mouths have been all week. Passing this \nsmart, responsible bill will help put American families first and help \ntake another step on the road to a renewable revolution.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, normally what we do is ask unanimous consent to move \nforward on this legislation. We know the minority, if they were here, \nwould object. They are not here, so rather than embarrass anyone, I \nwill now move to proceed to Calendar No. 743, S. 3044, and send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I filed cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthe legislation that I outlined, S. 3044, which is the Consumer First \nEnergy Act. I am going to shortly move to proceed to H.R. 6049, the \nRenewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. However, prior to doing \nthat, I was going to ask unanimous consent that if cloture were invoked \non the motion to proceed to S. 3044, that then the cloture motion on \nH.R. 6049 would be withdrawn. Since there is no one from the Republican \nside here to launch an objection, which I am told they would do, I am \nnot going to ask for unanimous consent today but will do so on Monday \nwhen a Republican is here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/06/senate-section/article/S5376-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.
