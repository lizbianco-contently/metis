Mr. President, this morning there will be a brief period of \nmorning business until 10:20, and then we will proceed to executive \nsession to consider the nomination of Randy Smith, to be a U.S. Circuit \nCourt Judge, and Marcia Morales Howard, to be a U.S. District Judge. \nDebate on these nominations is limited to a total of 10 minutes equally \ndivided and controlled between the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. At 10:30, the Senate will proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of these two nominations.\n  I would like to indicate to Members that a third rollcall vote is \nlikely shortly after these votes on the adjournment of the Senate, so \nMembers should plan on three votes instead of two.\n  Following these votes there will be morning business, with the first \nhour controlled by Senator Leahy and then the Republican leader or his \ndesignee will control an hour.\n  Mr. President, in a short time, we will approve the first circuit \ncourt judge of this Congress. The distinguished Republican leader and I \nhave had conversations about having as little acrimony--in fact, \nhopefully none--on circuit court judges. The last Congress will be \nnoted for a number of things and one will be the contentiousness of the \ncircuit court judges that came before the Senate. I have made a \ncommitment to my friend from Kentucky that we will move forward on \nthese. We have had conversations with the President, and he is going to \ndo his best to send us circuit court judges that are not people who \ncause a lot of heartburn on this side, and we think that is totally \npossible and in keeping with the standards President Bush wants for \nthese circuit court judges. So this is a time when we are going to try \nto work together to move forward.\n  Randy Smith is the first, and I say to everyone, it wasn't easy to \nget him here. He has been nominated for one position and then another \nposition. There was a little holdup to begin with, but we are beginning \nto work through this, as we wish to do. We have members of the \nJudiciary Committee who\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\nunderstand this and the two managers of this committee, the chairman, \nSenator Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator Specter, know of our \nconcern, and that is the concern of Senator McConnell and myself, and \nwe are going to do our very best to make sure this is not our last \ncircuit court judge but the first of a significant number who can at \nleast meet the standards of Congresses similarly situated as ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1984-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of my good \nfriend, the majority leader, about the circuit court judge situation. \nWe are off to a good start. I wish to thank him, and I wish to thank \nChairman Leahy for moving the Randy Smith nomination to the Ninth \nCircuit. As the majority leader has indicated, that vote will be at \n10:30. We have had very good conversations, the majority leader and \nmyself, about restoring comity to the Senate on the business of dealing \nfairly with the President's nominations for circuit court judgeships.\n  The President has met the Senate halfway--some would say more than \nhalfway--demonstrated by his actions at the beginning of the Congress \nand by the people he has chosen to resubmit for our consideration. The \nPresident's efforts have been recognized and lauded by the Washington \nPost, the Los Angeles Times, and several other publications. These \npapers have noted the burden is now on the Senate to reciprocate and \ntreat the President's nominees fairly, and we are off to a good start \nin doing that.\n  Moving the Smith nomination today is an act of good faith on the part \nof the majority leader and Senator Leahy, which I and others on this \nside of the aisle appreciate. It is a good beginning. Of course, it is \nonly a beginning, but it is a good beginning. As I have said, the \nPresident should be treated as fairly as his three immediate \npredecessors, each of whom finished their terms with the Senate in \ncontrol of the opposition party. Yet those Presidents received an \naverage of 17 circuit court nominations confirmed. If this President is \nnot treated as fairly as his predecessors, then, of course, the comity \nand cooperation in the Senate might be harder to come by. But there is \nno indication that will be the case, and I am not predicting it. In \nfact, I am optimistic we are going to be able to move through these \nnominations with a high level of fairness and comity. Again, I wish to \nthank both Senator Reid and Chairman Leahy for their fair treatment of \nthis first judge as we begin to move down the path toward getting a \nreasonable number of circuit court nominees confirmed during this 2-\nyear period.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes on the judicial nominations \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1984-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak to the Senate \nregarding the fact that we are contemplating adjournment for a recess \nof approximately 12 days without having taken any votes on the question \nof Iraq. The Senator from Nebraska and I sent a letter to both leaders \nyesterday, expressing our deepest disappointment and disapproval about \nthe failure of this institution to address the most consequential issue \nof our time. We are at a critical crossroads with this preeminent \nissue. Yet the Senate, in keeping with its historical traditions and \npractices, has failed to grapple with this monumental question.\n  Therefore, the Senator from Nebraska and I have said we should have a \nvote on the motion to adjourn for this particular recess because we \nobject to recessing without the Senate having any agreement, any \nunderstanding, any debate, any votes on this most profound question. It \ndoes no honor to the Senate or to this country. As I said earlier in \nthe week when I expressed my disappointment that we have yet to \nconstruct an agreement on how to even move forward procedurally to \ndebate a nonbinding resolution, irrespective of where my colleagues may \nstand on this question, whether you are in the majority or in the \nminority, various viewpoints ought to be able to be expressed, and we \nought to be able to have votes in the Senate. Unfortunately and \nregrettably, that has not occurred, at a time in which the President \nhas already indicated his plan for the troop surge and which is already \nunderway. There is a majority in the Senate who are in opposition to \nthe troop surge and to that specific mission. Others have different \nviewpoints on the question. But irrespective, we know there are a \nmajority in the United States who are in opposition to the troop surge.\n  The Senator from Nebraska and I, in fact, moved across the political \naisle and joined the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nMichigan on the Biden-Levin-Hagel-Snowe resolution on January 17, when \nit was introduced in the Senate. Here we are today, a month later, and \nthere has been no consequential action on the question of Iraq.\n  The House of Representatives is debating and will be voting. As I \nsaid on Monday, when our troops are on the frontlines, the Senate is on \nthe sidelines. While the House of Representatives is debating and \nvoting, the Senate is dithering. That is regrettable because we have \nsome serious questions about the President's troop surge. We ought to \nbe able to express our views on the floor of the Senate and to have \nthose votes. This is a critical moment in our Nation. The Senate has \nlost its sense of the place it now occupies--or should occupy--in \nhistory.\n  If we look back at major moments of the Senate historically, the \nSenate has risen to the occasion, but we haven't on this question. So \nwe are going to adjourn for the recess without having a plan on how we \nare going to proceed on this question, without any votes, on the major \nissue of our time.\n  So what has changed in the last 3 days? There have been no \nnegotiations. There has been no consensus. There has been no agreement. \nThere has been no understanding of how we are going to proceed and how \nwe are going to debate this question. And we are going to recess. Well, \nthe troop surge isn't taking a recess. The men and women in uniform on \nthe frontlines in Iraq are not taking a recess, the Iraq war is not \ntaking a recess, but the U.S. Senate is taking a recess.\n  My primary objection to the troop surge has been rooted in the fact \nthat I examined the track record and concluded we should not commit any \nmore troops to instilling a peace that the Iraqis are not willing to \ninstill for themselves and to seek for their own nation. They are \nfighting amongst themselves rather than for themselves.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with the father of a soldier who died last Friday \nwhile supporting our Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  SSG Eric Ross of Maine, stationed in Texas, and two of his brothers \nin arms were killed as they entered a booby-trapped building in Baquba. \nWhat was even more tragic is the Iraqi squad that was accompanying \nthem, who were supposed to go in with them, refused to go in. What did \nthey know? Why did they refuse to go in? Where were their allegiances? \nWho were they fighting for? Those are the kinds of circumstances and \nsituations to which\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\nour troops have been subjected. There will be infinitely more of those \nexamples, given the mission the President has proposed in Baghdad.\n  The father of the soldier told me: My son's first interpreter was a \nspy. Those are the kinds of precarious and dangerous circumstances \nunder which our soldiers are facing extraordinary challenges. Now they \nare being requested to go door-to-door in Baghdad, as this soldier was \ndoing in Baquba. His father said they were going door to door, clearing \nthem out, only to find they were coming back in. That is the \ncircumstance our troops will face in this very dangerous mission in \nBaghdad.\n  While we are on recess, all of this will be underway. Yet we have no \nplan to debate and to vote on our respective views and positions on \nthis question.\n  This is not in keeping and consistent with the traditions and \npractices of the Senate. I have served in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate for 29 years. I have witnessed and been \npart of debates that range from Lebanon to the Persian Gulf to Somalia \nto Bosnia to Panama. We were able to exercise our views, whether we \nwere in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. I am deeply \ndisappointed that we are at this juncture, that we are planning to \nadjourn for a previously scheduled recess without having established a \nrecord on behalf of the Senate for the people of this country. We are \ntheir voice. We reflect their will. We should have the opportunity to \ndebate and to vote on the various questions.\n  The fact is, we have allowed the gears of this deliberative process \nto become jammed with the monkey wrenches of timidity and partisanship. \nI reject that because at a time in which the American people are deeply \nconcerned about the direction of our mission in Iraq, the Senate is \ndeadlocked and stalemated.\n  That is why I object to the motion to adjourn. I hope my colleagues \nwill express their objections, likewise, irrespective of where Members \nstand on the question. I hope Members express disappointment and \ndisapproval that we will recess without having taken a stand on this \nmonumental issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1985-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRAQ DEBATE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  Mr. President, I have the deepest respect for the Senator from Maine. \nI care about her a lot. She is a good legislator and a very strong \nwoman, strong person, someone who stands up for what she thinks is \nright. I admire her for that.\n  However, those are interesting comments that I have just heard from \nmy friend regarding an Iraq debate. While I respect the Senator from \nMaine and, as I have said I appreciate her sense of urgency, I say with \nall due respect, she is coming late to the party.\n  Last week, when Senators had the opportunity to hold an important \ndebate about Iraq, she and others chose to prevent that debate. Some of \nthem, including my friend from Maine, voted against their own \nresolution by not invoking cloture. While it is heartening to know that \nthey would like to have an Iraq debate now, where were they last week? \nWhere were they when the Senate was trying to send a message to \nPresident Bush to stop the escalation? Where were they when we were \ntrying to send a message in standing up for our troops in Iraq? The \nanswer: Obstructing. Playing politics.\n  Don't tell me about politics. They were putting the political needs \nof the White House ahead of our troops' need for a new direction in \nIraq.\n  If not for the actions that took place last week, we could have been \nfinished with this debate regarding the escalation in Iraq. We could \nhave already sent a strong message to President Bush that he stands \nalone in supporting escalation. We could have joined the House in \nexpressing our support for the troops and our opposition to the so-\ncalled surge. But because there was a political game being played with \nthe war, the American people still do not know where their Senators \nstand on escalation.\n  I take it from comments I have heard--not only from the Senator from \nMaine but from others on the other side of the aisle--that a number of \nMembers had a change of heart; that, in the future, I would hope, many \nof them will be joining us in an important Iraq debate.\n  Everyone within the sound of my voice should understand, we are in \nthe Senate. Procedurally it is very difficult, many times, to get from \nhere to there. I started as quickly as I could to process this matter. \nOn Tuesday, I moved to rule XIV so we could have the House resolution \nbefore the Senate. I would hope we will have that opportunity soon.\n  This week, the House of Representatives is debating a bipartisan \nresolution on escalation. Last night, as I have indicated, I started \nthe process--again, moving one step further to bringing the legislation \ncloser to the floor of the Senate, a resolution saying we support our \ntroops and we oppose the escalation.\n  When the Senate returns after the break, we will deal with the House \nresolution in some manner. The American people deserve, as I have said, \nto know where every Member of the Senate stands on the so-called surge. \nIt is an important issue facing our country.\n  I repeat what I said about the Senator from Maine. I care about her a \nlot. But I really am somewhat lost in the logic of her debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, using some of my leader time, let me \nrespond briefly to my good friend, the majority leader.\n  The Senate Republicans are fully prepared to have a debate on the \nIraq war. We were prepared to have a debate on the Iraq war last week. \nWe anticipated it. The issue is whether the Senate will operate like \nthe House. It will not.\n  In the House, they have one Iraq resolution. The minority gets no \nvoice at all, up or down, on one proposal. As my good friend, the \nmajority leader, and certainly the majority whip said repeatedly over \nthe years, the Senate is not the House. Senate Republicans are anxious \nto have the Iraq debate. We are not trying to avoid it in any way, \nwhatever. But there will be, at the very least, a proposal that a \nmajority of Senate Republicans support in the queue to be considered so \nthat we will have an alternative.\n  Now, the majority leader and I have had a number of discussions about \nthis issue over the week. I am still hopeful we can work this out and \nhave a process for going forward that is fair to Senate Republicans. \nHowever, I am very confident that Senate Republicans will insist on \nhaving at least one alternative favored by a majority of our Members. \nAgain, I am not anticipating that we will end up in the same position \nwe were last week. The majority leader and I are continuing to talk \nabout it.\n  But fundamental fairness is essential on the most important issue \nconfronting the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have two votes scheduled at 10:30. We \nwere supposed to have 15 minutes reserved for Senator Leahy and myself, \nand I know Senator Hagel is in the Senate and wants a little time.\n  With the majority leader in attendance, I wonder if we might adjust \nthe timing so we can talk about these judges at least for a few \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the question is an excellent question. \nWe have, as the Senator knows, a funeral taking place today for Dr. \nNorwood. We changed the vote around from 11 o'clock until 10:30 today \nso a large contingent of Senators and House Members can attend the \nfuneral. If we do not start the votes at 10:30, they will not be able \nto attend.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I accept that. May I use the last 4 minutes to speak?\n  I will yield to the Senator from Nebraska for a minute.\n  Mr. HAGEL.

We were prepared to have a debate on the Iraq war last week. \nWe anticipated it. The issue is whether the Senate will operate like \nthe House. It will not.\n  In the House, they have one Iraq resolution. The minority gets no \nvoice at all, up or down, on one proposal. As my good friend, the \nmajority leader, and certainly the majority whip said repeatedly over \nthe years, the Senate is not the House. Senate Republicans are anxious \nto have the Iraq debate. We are not trying to avoid it in any way, \nwhatever. But there will be, at the very least, a proposal that a \nmajority of Senate Republicans support in the queue to be considered so \nthat we will have an alternative.\n  Now, the majority leader and I have had a number of discussions about \nthis issue over the week. I am still hopeful we can work this out and \nhave a process for going forward that is fair to Senate Republicans. \nHowever, I am very confident that Senate Republicans will insist on \nhaving at least one alternative favored by a majority of our Members. \nAgain, I am not anticipating that we will end up in the same position \nwe were last week. The majority leader and I are continuing to talk \nabout it.\n  But fundamental fairness is essential on the most important issue \nconfronting the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have two votes scheduled at 10:30. We \nwere supposed to have 15 minutes reserved for Senator Leahy and myself, \nand I know Senator Hagel is in the Senate and wants a little time.\n  With the majority leader in attendance, I wonder if we might adjust \nthe timing so we can talk about these judges at least for a few \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the question is an excellent question. \nWe have, as the Senator knows, a funeral taking place today for Dr. \nNorwood. We changed the vote around from 11 o'clock until 10:30 today \nso a large contingent of Senators and House Members can attend the \nfuneral. If we do not start the votes at 10:30, they will not be able \nto attend.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I accept that. May I use the last 4 minutes to speak?\n  I will yield to the Senator from Nebraska for a minute.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1986-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1986-S1988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NORMAN RANDY SMITH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH \n                                CIRCUIT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nMARCIA MORALES HOWARD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE MIDDLE \n                          DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations en bloc.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Norman Randy \nSmith, of Idaho, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth \nCircuit and Marcia Morales Howard, of Florida, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Middle District of Florida.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we consider nominations for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench, including Judge Norman Randy Smith \nto the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Smith was \nnominated to a seat on the Ninth Circuit designated a judicial \nemergency by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Judge Smith's \nnomination easily could have been confirmed in the last Congress--and \nthe emergency addressed many months ago--had the Bush administration \nchosen the common-sense approach it has now followed of nominating \nJudge Smith--who is from Idaho--to Idaho's seat on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Instead, the President picked a fight by insisting on nominating \nJudge Smith to a California seat on the Ninth Circuit. Judge Smith had \nbeen nominated to fill the seat last occupied by Judge Stephen Trott, \nan appointee from California who made a personal decision to move to \nIdaho. I know of no precedent for shifting a circuit seat based on a \njudge's personal decision to change his or her personal residence. That \ngenerated opposition from the California Senators and created an \nimpasse. I supported the California Senators, as I had Senators \nSarbanes and Mikulski in a similar circumstance when this President \nsought to fill a Maryland seat on the Fourth Circuit with someone from \nVirginia.\n  I have tried for some time to get the President to redesignate the \nSmith nomination and nominate him to fill the Idaho vacancy. At long \nlast, the President has done the right thing. The White House finally \nchanged course and the President nominated Judge Smith for the Idaho \nseat on the Ninth Circuit. I thank the President for finally doing the \nright thing.\n  With the cooperation of the Senators from California and the other \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee, we were able to avoid having a \nhearing on Judge Smith's nomination in this Congress and to expedite \nhis consideration, now that he has been designated for the Idaho \nvacancy. We were able to report Judge Smith's nomination last Thursday. \nToday, at long last, Senator Craig and Senator Crapo and the people of \nIdaho will have a judge on this important court from their home State.\n  We have worked hard since convening this Congress to make significant \nprogress in our consideration of judicial nominations. At our first \nexecutive business meeting, the Judiciary Committee reported out five \njudicial nominations little more than 2 weeks after they were sent to \nus. Three of these were for vacancies determined by the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts to be judicial emergencies. All five were \namong those returned to the President without Senate action at the end \nof last year when Republican Senators objected to proceeding with \ncertain of the President's judicial nominees in September and December \nlast year. All five were confirmed only 3 weeks after they were \nnominated.\n  Last week, we reported another five nominations, including the \nnominations we consider today. We reported nominees from the home \nStates of Senator Specter and Senator Grassley and I want to thank \nSenator Casey and Senator Brown for expediting their consideration of \nnominees from their home States and approving them so quickly after \ntaking office. I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides \nof the aisle on our Committee, and in the Senate, to consider quickly \nand report 10 judicial nominations so far this year, allowing us to \nfill vacancies and improve the administration of justice in our \nNation's Federal courts.\n  With the five confirmations last week we have confirmed more of \nPresident Bush's nominations in the 18 months I have served as \nJudiciary Committee Chairman than in the more than two years when \nSenator Hatch chaired the Committee with a Republican Senate majority \nor during the entire last Congress with a Republican Senate majority.\n  With Judge Smith's confirmation today, we will have confirmed a \nnomination to one of the Nation's important circuit courts little more \nthan a month after the Republicans agreed to resolution allowing the \nSenate to organize. That is more than the total of President Clinton's \nnominations to circuit court vacancies confirmed by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate during the entire 1996 session. Today, with this one \nconfirmation we will surpass the Republican total for an entire session \nof the Congress.\n  Last week, we also held the first judicial nominations hearing of the \nnew Congress and considered three more nominees, two of whom are \nnominated to fill judicial emergency vacancies. We held that hearing on \nFebruary 6. When a Republican chaired the Committee in 1999 and there \nwas a Democratic President, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was \nnot held until June 16. We could have postponed this hearing because it \nwas at the same time as the Senators briefing on the new National \nIntelligence Estimate about the deteriorating situation in Iraq. As I \ndid after 9/11, and after the Senate buildings were shut down by the \nanthrax letters, I chose to go forward with the nominations hearing.\n  I know some on the other side of the aisle have tried to raise a \nscare since I, again, became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. They \nrant as if the sky is falling and as if we would not proceed on any \njudicial nominations. On the contrary, we have proceeded promptly and \nefficiently.\n  I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus \nnominees. After this week's confirmations, according to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts there will be 51 judicial \nvacancies, 24 of which have been deemed to be judicial emergencies. Of \nthose 24 judicial emergency vacancies, the President has yet to send us \nnominees for 17 of them. That means two-thirds of the judicial \nemergency vacancies are without a nominee from the President.\n  We will continue moving forward efficiently as long as the President \nsends us qualified, consensus nominees.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, just a brief response to the distinguished \nmajority leader about motives as to debate on Iraq.\n  I don't know a Senator who has been clearer or more concise on this \nadministration's positions on Iraq than the senior Senator from \nNebraska. To suggest that some on this side are impeding or trying to \nprotect the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, specifically \nescalating our military involvement in Iraq, is a bit off the mark.\n  The fact is, the minority leader is very clear in his purpose. I have \nsupported that. Minority rights are the essence, the foundation of this \nbody. The minority should have an opportunity to present their \nresolution or resolutions. It should not be dictated to by the \nmajority.\n  Make it very clear, those on this side who have pushed for this \ndebate are very clear in our position. I doubt if there is anyone who \nhas been clearer than this Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is only a minute left before 10:30, \nnot enough time to discuss. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized at \nthe conclusion of the third vote for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not hear the request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My request--we were supposed to speak, but the time has \nbeen consumed otherwise. With only less than a minute left until 10:30, \nI have asked for consent to speak for 10 minutes at the conclusion of \nthe third vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. At the conclusion of the third vote?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me amend that to ask for 10 minutes for the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have an hour reserved after the third vote anyway. \nCertainly, if the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to take his 10 \nminutes ahead of that hour, I have no objection.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask consent to that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro terrpore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Vote on Nomination of Norman Randy Smith\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

There are now 2 minutes equally \ndivided before a vote on the Howard nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, two Senators from Florida rise \nto lend our support to Judge Howard, who is currently a magistrate \njudge and is an excellent choice. It is the privilege of Senator \nMartinez and myself to support the outstanding choice of Judge Howard \nto be a Federal district judge.\n  Judge Howard is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and the \nUniversity of Florida Law School.\n  I want to make reference to a note I received from Judge Howard \ntelling a bit about something unusual, because her parents arrived here \nfrom Cuba. This is what she writes:\n\n       My parents arrived here with very little other than an \n     education and a willingness to work. Their success and my \n     nomination are truly a testament to the opportunity that \n     exists here simply by virtue of being an American. My parents \n     never let my brother, my sister, or me forget how fortunate \n     we were to be in a country where we could be whatever we \n     wanted to be or that we had a duty to give back to our \n     country.\n\n  That is the kind of person who will be a successful Federal district \njudge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague \nSenator Nelson in advancing the nomination of Marcia Morales Howard as \na Federal district court judge for the Middle District of Florida. This \noutstanding woman lawyer from Florida not only has a distinguished \nacademic background, having graduated from the University of Florida \nCollege of Law, being an editor of the Law Review there, but she also \nhas been an accomplished litigator for 13 years with two very fine law \nfirms in the State of Florida, Foley & Lardner and McGuireWoods. In \n2003, she became a Federal magistrate. As a magistrate, she has \ndistinguished herself in the Middle District of Florida where she would \nbe serving as a Federal district court judge.\n  I know her and her family. I know what an outstanding American she \nis. I am very proud that with the magnitude of importance of a Federal \nappointment for a lifetime, we have someone of this competence, this \ndedication, and this quality to serve in this important post. I am \ndelighted not only for the opportunity to advance the nomination but \nalso to tell of the judicial nominating commission Senator Nelson and I \nhave formed in the State of Florida, which I frankly believe is a model \nfor bipartisan cooperation and also seeking the best and most qualified \non the merits by positioning the nomination before a group of \ndistinguished lawyers who then see the applicants, study their \nqualifications, and make recommendations.\n  I am delighted to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of \nMarcia Morales Howard for Federal district judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Judge Marcia Morales Howard, nominated to \nthe Middle District of Florida, has the bipartisan support of both \nFlorida Senators. With valuable experience as a Federal magistrate \njudge and as a former civil litigator, Judge Howard is well versed in \nlitigation matters in Federal court. Judge Howard graduated from \nVanderbilt University with a B.S. in 1987, and received her J.D. with \nhonors in 1990, from the University of Florida, College of Law, where \nshe served as Symposium Editor for the Florida Law Review.\n  As a litigator in private practice, Judge Howard worked mostly on \ncomplex civil litigation matters in Federal court as an Associate with \nthe law firm of Foley and Lardner, and later worked on labor and \nemployment law cases as an Associate, and then Partner, at the law firm \nof McGuireWoods, LLP. Judge Howard has also shown her dedication to \nserving others by providing pro bono legal services through the \nJacksonville Area Legal Aid and pro bono seminars through the \nJacksonville Center for Independent Living to disabled individuals \ninforming them of their rights under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.\n  I understand that Judge Howard is a first generation Cuban-American. \nShe is being called upon to fill a position in one of the fastest \ngrowing areas in Florida. Senator Nelson has been a strong supporter of \nthis nomination and has pressed for early action. I thank both Senators \nfrom Florida for their interest in this nomination. I also understand \nthat Judge Howard's grandfather celebrated his 100th birthday just 2 \nweeks ago, on February 1. Her confirmation today is testimony to the \ngreat promise that America holds for people from all parts of the \nworld, that the granddaughter of someone who came to America can become \na Federal judge.\n  I congratulate the nominee and her family on her confirmation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I claim 1 minute as ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee?\n  I think Senator Nelson and Senator Martinez had important things to \nsay about the nominee, but I don't think anybody heard them. So if I \ncould have the attention of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The nominee has an outstanding record, having served as \na United States magistrate. She graduated from Vanderbilt in 1987, and \nfrom the University of Florida College of Law, with honors, in 1990. \nShe has an outstanding professional record. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Marcia Morales Howard, of Florida, to be a \nU.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Florida.\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), \nthe Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), and the Senator from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Inhofe).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 63, the House Iraq resolution; that there \nbe 12 hours of debate; that the debate be divided equally between the \ntwo leaders; that no amendments or motions be in order; and that the \nSenate vote on passage of the concurrent resolution at the conclusion \nof that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course, I will object. This is right \nback where we were a week ago. As the distinguished majority leader and \nthe distinguished majority whip have said on numerous occasions in the \nlast couple of years, the Senate is not the House. Senate Republicans \nare going to insist on fair treatment on the most important issue on \nthe minds of the American people today; that is, the war in Iraq. The \nSenate simply cannot--and I have heard Senator Byrd make these points \non numerous occasions--cannot operate this way. The Senate Republicans \ninsist on one or more amendments on the most important issue \nconfronting our country--the war in Iraq.\n  What I had hoped was that the distinguished majority leader and \nmyself would be able to work out a consent agreement that would allow \nus to have--he would pick his amendment, and it is apparent the \namendment the majority would like to have is the House-passed \nconcurrent resolution, and then there would be an alternative, at least \none alternative. Many of my Members would like to have more than one \nalternative in this extremely important debate, but at least one \nalternative on this side of the choosing of the majority of \nRepublicans. So, therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have told the distinguished Republican \nleader that when we get to the matter dealing with implementing the 9/\n11 recommendations, that will be a vehicle which will be open to debate \nand amendment.\n  The unanimous consent request I propounded would complete work on the \nIraq surge issue within a matter of hours, as I indicated, so that we \ncould move within a day, 1 day, to 9/11 and amendments--Warner, Gregg, \nMcCain, whatever amendments the minority wanted to offer; they would \ncertainly be permitted to do that.\n  We find ourselves in a very unusual position, Mr. President. We tried \nto proceed to this matter before. Everyone has heard the arguments used \nto stop us from going forward on this issue. Cloture was not invoked. \nWe need not go over all the reasons, some of which have been outlined \nby the distinguished Republican leader just a few minutes ago. But \nthere have been those on the other side of the aisle who think we \nshould be in next week. Mr. President, speaking for this Senator, I am \nhappy to be in next week. If you want to be in next week, we can do \nthat. I have things in Nevada I have wanted to do for a while because I \nhave been here for 5 weeks, but that is OK, I can take care of that, as \neveryone else can, if necessary. But we find ourselves in the same \nposition, that there is a hesitation on behalf of the minority to go \nforward on now a very simple matter--a very simple matter.\n  The Warner-Levin amendment was a little more complicated than the \nsimple House measure which says we support the troops and we are \nagainst the surge. That is what we think should be disposed of quickly. \nWe can move to 9/11, all the debates on other things people want to do \nwith Iraq and other issues. Certainly, they can do that. We can spend \nconsiderable time on that. As long as progress is being made, there is \nno reason to file cloture. There are other things we need to do the \nfollowing week during the work period.\n  We are anxious to go forward on this issue. We have, again, been \nstopped from doing that. All the plaintive cries about not being able \nto debate Iraq--there were opportunities to debate Iraq, and they were \nturned down. I was disappointed, as I said earlier today, that the \npeople crying the loudest are the people against going forward on Iraq.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the order is Senator \nLeahy has 1 hour right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is to be \nrecognized first for 10 minutes and then Senator Leahy.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are not here today, I assume, to \ndebate the substance of the Iraq matter, but it is important to \nremember that both the majority leader and the majority whip in \nDecember were saying a surge might be a good idea, and now they are \nsaying the only resolution we should have before the Senate is one \ncondemning a surge. Let me repeat, that is not the way the Senate \nworks.\n  So I would like to propose a unanimous consent request, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nconsultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to \nthe following concurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a \nconcurrent resolution, if received from the House, the text of which is \nat the desk; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution which is to be \ndischarged from the Foreign Relations Committee; the McCain-Graham-\nLieberman amendment regarding benchmarks; the Gregg amendment related \nto funding.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 12 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nprovided further, that no amendments be in order to any of the \nmeasures; further, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to four consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent \nresolutions in the following order, with no further action or \nintervening debate: first, McCain-Lieberman-Graham, then Gregg, then \nWarner.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution that does not \nreceive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on the adoption be \nvitiated and the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous \nstatus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again, this is an attempt to divert \nattention from the issue before this body; that is, whether there \nshould be a surge in Iraq. That is it--an escalation. And this attempt \nby my friend, the Republican leader, to divert attention from this very \nimportant resolution--we support the troops, we oppose the escalation--\nis now going to be obfuscated if, in fact, we agree to this request, \nand therefore we will not.\n  This body is going to have the opportunity to vote up or down if, in \nfact, we can proceed to the resolution. This body will have an \nopportunity to vote up or down: Do you support the troops? Do you \nsupport the surge?\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if this were to be allowed, this would \nbe the second bill in a row where no amendments would have been offered \nto a 49-member Republican minority. I have been here a couple of \ndecades now, and I am having a hard time recalling a situation such as \nthis. This is the kind of thing Senator Byrd would get on his feet and \ndecry as inappropriate in a body that thrives on debate and \nresolution. It is astonishing to me that it is being suggested, on the \nsingle biggest issue confronting the American people, that we would \nhave 1 choice, dictated by a Democratic majority of 51 in a body of \n100. That is simply unacceptable to this side of the aisle.\n\n  I think the message here from this discussion this morning is that \nthe majority leader and myself ought to sit down, work out a consent \nagreement, a reasonable consent agreement to both sides, and structure \nthe debate for our return.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the minority leader aware of the \ncontent of the measure that is proposed by myself, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Graham, and others? What it is, is a proposal to set up \nbenchmarks but also to support the surge or the change in strategy.\n  Can the Republican leader explain to me why it is we shouldn't have a \nproposal that opposes the surge, with a vote on that, and a proposal \nthat supports it and a vote on that?\n  I have only been around here 20 years, not nearly as long as Senator \nByrd has, whom Senator McConnell referred to, but aren't we allowed to \nhave competing resolutions to debate, with time agreements, such as the \nminority leader proposed? Why in the world would we not agree to a \nresolution that would be in opposition to the resolution the majority \nleader insists on voting on by itself? I have never seen the Senate \nwork this way. I have never seen the Senate only allow one proposal to \nbe debated and voted on. We have a proposal that we think deserves \ndebate and votes.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky, who has been here longer than I have \nbeen, if he has ever seen anything quite like this on a major, \ncompelling, overwhelming issue before the American people?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Arizona \nthat I am as astonished as he is.\n  This side was willing, after considerable discussion back and forth, \nto go down to one alternative, and the Senator from Arizona graciously \nagreed that his would not be the one, that we would offer the Gregg \namendment. Even that was an astonishing concession on the part of the \nminority, an astonishing concession on the part of the minority to a \nrather narrow majority to get the debate going. The vote we had a week \nor so ago was to continue the debate.\n  The message is clear: The majority can gridlock the Senate over this \nissue with its insistence there be no choices or the majority leader \nand I can sit down and do what we should do, which is to reach a \nreasonable consent agreement for the consideration of alternatives on \nthe single biggest issue confronting America today.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield to the Senator from Kansas for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I just wanted to make it clear to myself \nand others what we are facing here; that is, there would be only one \nvote we would have on the resolution that was passed in the House, \nwhich I feel I could not vote for because it is nonbinding--it is, \nagain, to support the troops but not the mission, which I think is \ncertainly unique in regards to how people feel about this--and that, \nbasically, the McCain resolution, which I support, which sets out the \nbenchmarks to give to General Petraeus and to give to Prime Minister \nMaliki to gain some kind of catalyst or effort that would say: Look, \nthis is where the Senate stands, and hopefully we can get these things \ndone so that we can see some progress, to see if it is possible to \nachieve some security in Iraq and give that Government a political \nsettlement. And the second amendment I am talking about is the one of \nSenator Gregg, as I understand it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are allowed to yield for questions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would just ask what the play is, if I \ncan do that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kansas that the \nstatus of the majority here is that we would have no alternatives at \nall.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the one I would ask about, if I can ask a \nfurther question, is that of Senator Feingold. It seems to me, if we \nare going to have a full debate, all choices need to be considered, and \nthe amendment offered by Senator Feingold should be considered and \nshould be made in order. That has taken a lot of courage for him to \noffer such an amendment in a very forthright manner. I will say that I \ndon't agree with it, but in discussions about the ramifications of all \nof these resolutions, which are nonbinding and which I call confetti \nresolutions because they do not do anything except send very difficult \nmessages to everybody, I think that ought to be made in order and that \nought to be a choice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would certainly agree with my friend \nfrom Kansas that it might be in order to have multiple amendments on \nthe other side, but certainly that would be up to the other side to \ndecide.\n  Let me just conclude before yielding the floor that the message here \nis clear: Senate Republicans are going to insist on being treated \nfairly. Secondly, I am hoping the majority leader and myself can \nstructure an appropriate consent agreement so that we can consider this \nmatter in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wrote down the plaintive cries from my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle: never seen the Senate work this \nway.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished senior Member of this body, \nSenator Byrd, who has a fine memory, we have memories. Now, there are \n10 Senators\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nhere who may not, but we remember, on a multitude of issues when we \nwere in the minority, when we had no opportunity to debate anything or \nto offer amendments on anything.\n  One of the other words issued was ``astonished.'' Mr. President, we \nare in the U.S. Senate. Anyone with any memory whatsoever understands \nhow we were treated before, but when I became the majority leader, I \nsaid that I believed in the Golden Rule. I said I would treat people \nthe way I want to be treated, that this is not any time to retaliate. \nIn fact, I have followed the Golden Rule. We have had bills, such as \nthe matter dealing with ethics or the matter dealing with minimum wage, \nand, of course, the CR we just finished had input from both sides or it \nwould not have passed.\n  So I would say this: We can go with the unanimous consent request I \nhave propounded, and within a few hours, when that day ended, the 12 \nhours ended, we could be on whatever amendments they wanted to offer to \nthe homeland security measure.\n  I will go one step further than that. My friend from Arizona has \nsuggested that he be allowed to offer his amendment. I would accept \nthat, that we do the House-passed resolution and we do the McCain \namendment and we spend 12 hours on those two matters the minute we get \nback here after this break, or if they want to do it tomorrow or \nMonday, I would agree to that.\n  So my proposal, without a lot of fancy words here, Mr. President, is \nwe would take up the House measure that is now before this body--it is \ngoing through the process and is at the desk--and also do the McCain \namendment. Those two matters, those two resolutions, one opposing the \nsurge and one in favor of the surge. No other amendments would be in \norder. We could do that. We can have a debate on that, and then still, \njust a matter of hours later, we can move to homeland security, and the \npeople who believed they had been left out of the debate could offer \nwhatever amendments they wanted to on homeland security. That is my \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object \nmomentarily, once again the majority leader seeks to choose the \nRepublican amendment. We were there last week when the majority leader \nindicated that he would agree to an amendment on each side but that he \nwanted to pick our amendment. So I am constrained to object on the \nbasis that we on this side would choose, if we were to only have one \nresolution, what it would be. I, therefore, object.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, \nat a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with \nthe Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to the following \nconcurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a concurrent \nresolution, if received from the House, the text of which is at the \ndesk; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution which is to be discharged \nfrom the Foreign Relations Committee; McCain-Lieberman-Graham regarding \nbenchmarks; and Gregg related to funding.\n  I would further ask consent there be a total of 12 hours of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; provided \nfurther that no amendments be in order to any of those measures; \nfurther, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto four consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent resolutions \nin the following order, with no further action or intervening debate: \nthe Gregg amendment; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution; the House \nresolution; and the McCain-Lieberman-Graham benchmarks.\n  Finally, I ask consent that any resolution that does not receive 60 \nvotes in the affirmative, the vote on the adoption be vitiated and the \nconcurrent resolution be returned to its previous status.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the request be modified to say \nthat the amendments that would be in order would be the House measure \nto which we referred, where we are in favor of supporting the troops \nand against the surge, and the McCain amendment.\n  I would say editorially, Mr. President, that is what the Senator from \nArizona asked, and we will give it to him. We will have that debate, \none in favor of the surge and one against the surge.\n  I ask my friend to modify his request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Republican leader modify his request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think the majority has already \noffered this suggestion just a while back.\n  Mr. REID. I am asking if the minority leader will modify his request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I, therefore, object.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has heard this song before. We \nheard it 2 weeks ago, and we have listened as seven or eight Members on \nthe other side have come to the floor repeatedly day after day. They \nhave sent letters and held press conferences saying they earnestly want \nus to move forward on this issue, though they voted against it. They \nvoted against the motion for cloture that would have brought us to a \ndebate on the issue, and it is on their own legislation.\n  We offered them two Republican amendments, the Warner amendment and \nthe McCain amendment, one opposing the surge and one supporting the \nsurge. They wouldn't accept it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. When they did not accept this, a cloture motion was filed \non a motion to proceed, and they voted against it. They have come back \nsince saying they want the opportunity to debate. They can't have it \nboth ways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order to proceed is called for. Under \nthe previous order, the Senator from Pennsylvania is to be recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had requested 10 minutes to speak on \nthe judges, but I want to use a few moments here to talk about what is \non the table.\n  We have just seen the Senate, for the better part of an hour, with a \nmajority of the Senators on the floor, demonstrate gridlock and \nparalysis. I have an observation to make--and perhaps it would be an \nadmonition or a warning--that the Senate is about to become irrelevant. \nWe have, on the other side of the Rotunda, the House of Representatives \ntaking up the issue of Iraq, which all Members here, with the speeches \njust made, agree is the most pressing issue facing the country, but the \nSenate can't address it. And the Senate can't address it because the \nmajority leader has exercised his right under rule XV to fill the tree, \nwhich precludes any action by the Republicans, unless we Republicans \nexercise our right to withhold cloture.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to yield but on additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will yield to the Senator from West Virginia for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I just want to interpose a point here.\n  I think I heard the Senator make reference to the majority leader \nhaving the right to fill the tree. No, he doesn't. He does not. He has \nthe right if no other Senator seeks recognition. But once the majority \nmakes a motion or sends an amendment to the desk, at that second he \nloses the floor until the Chair states its business, and while he has \nlost the floor, another Senator can seek recognition. I merely make the \npoint the majority leader does not have ``the right.'' No other Senator \nhas ``the right'' to fill the tree. If other Senators do not intervene, \nthen of course he will fill it.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may regain the floor because I have \na very limited time, my observations after being here for 26 years-plus \nare that when the majority leader then seeks recognition again, he gets \nit.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And when he makes the amendment in the first-degree and \nthen he seeks recognition again, he gets it, an amendment in the second \ndegree, and he does fill the tree.\n  Last week I proposed to change the rule. This rule has been exercised \nby Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, Senator Byrd, and all the majority \nleaders in the last two decades. I think it is time we change the rule.\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n  We are not going to change the rule now. But I do believe that the \nSenate is in real danger of becoming irrelevant. I don't think we ought \nto be dominant over the House of Representatives, but I think we ought \nto at least be equal.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No; I wish to finish. I think we ought to at least be \nequal. What we have is that we are close to anarchy. We have been \ndebating the debate all week. The House has rules which we wouldn't \nwant, where the Rules Committee goes off and comes back and limits what \nthe House of Representatives can do. Sometimes that is despotism, and \nbetween anarchy and despotism, it is a fairly tough choice. But right \nnow, I am finding it difficult--impossible--to answer my constituents \nabout what the Senate is doing. I tell them the tree is filled. They \nthink I am talking about an orchard. I tell them we are debating \nwhether we are going to have a debate, and they can't understand what \nwe are doing.\n  I counted the Senators on the floor during the exchange between the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader. We had more than 50 Senators \nhere sitting around on the debate for a debate without reaching a \nresolution. I think Senator McConnell is correct. I do not say that in \nthe partisan sense, if I can attract the attention of the distinguished \nRepublican leader. I think he is correct. But I repeat I do not say it \nin a partisan sense. There ought to be an accommodation and there ought \nto be an agreement reached between the leaders. When you have the \nproposal to have a variety of resolutions, that is the way of the \nSenate.\n  Senator McCain has been here for 20 years. Senator McConnell has been \nhere for 22 years. I have been here for 26 years. Senator Byrd has been \nhere for--I can't count that high--48 years, going onto 49. This is not \nthe way the Senate ought to work. But it is the way the Senate has \nworked, with all the majority leaders in the last two decades \nexercising their right of recognition and filling the tree and tying up \nthe Senate.\n  Now the Senate is finally caught. We are finally caught where America \nand the world sees what we are doing. It is a little ridiculous to have \nthis kind of gridlock and this kind of paralysis.\n  How much time do I have left, Mr. President? I have to talk about the \njudges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me yield to the Senator from West Virginia who \nwanted recognition--for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding. I have this comment. First of all, I wish to congratulate the \nSenator. He is very observant. He is concerned about the Senate. He \nunderstands the rules. But while he understands the rules, we do not \nneed any more rules. We have rules. Senators need to insist on their \nrights as Senators and they ought to speak up so they can be heard and \nthey ought to pay attention. We don't need new rules. We have rules \nthat have been here for many years, and they have been tried and tried \nand tried again. We need to read the rules. Senators should read the \nrules and Senators should understand that they are Senators and they \nshould be proud of that fact. We should demand that the rules be \nobserved. I could do that. Every Senator can. We don't need new rules. \nWe simply need to understand the rules we have. We need to insist on \nthose rules, and the Chair ought as well to insist that the rules be \nobserved.\n  No Senator needs to seek recognition to have the rules observed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, regular order. May I reclaim my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me for a parliamentary \ninquiry? What is the time situation? The Senator has 3 more minutes. \nWhat follows the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 hour in morning \nbusiness, succeeded by the Republican leader.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have been around for a little while. I would like to \nsee if I could have 3 minutes following the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have \nyielded already to Senator Specter on my hour. So far I have been \ndramatically changing and changing the schedule of my office to \naccommodate everybody. The Senator from Alaska is one of the oldest and \ndearest friends I have here. If he wants 3 minutes, I will not object \nto him following Senator Specter for 3 minutes. But then I will insist \nand will not yield on my hour after that because we created too many \nproblems already in my schedule.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the sequence of speakers, I ask that \nfollowing Senator Leahy's 1 hour, there be 5 minutes for Senator Crapo \nand 5 minutes for Senator Craig to talk about a judicial nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As a final statement, it is my hope that the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and Republican leader, Senator McConnell, before \nthe day is up, will come to terms and will announce some accommodation \nso that there can be a fair resolution of the debate--so this body does \nnot become irrelevant and we do not present a picture to the American \npeople of gridlock and paralysis, but we show we are still the world's \ngreatest deliberative body because we are about to cede that title to \nthe House of Representatives which as we speak is deliberating, which \nwe are not doing--and that we take up the Iraqi issue and we show the \nAmerican people and the world we can reach an accommodation, we can \ndebate in accordance with the traditions of the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to seriously consider the resolution I introduced \nto change rule XV.\n  I agree with Senator Byrd. We do not need more rules, but we need a \nlittle modification of rule XV.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not been here as long as my good \nfriend from West Virginia, but I am the senior Member of this side. I \ncannot remember a time when we tied together the concept of filing a \nfirst-degree amendment, then a second-degree amendment, with cloture so \nit entirely shut off any participation by the minority. It has been \nstated here it has happened. I do not recall that. I do recall back in \nthe days of the Clinton administration, Senator Byrd had a proposal, a \nsimilar proposal, but we had a big ruckus. I am sure the Senator \nremembers. Senator Dole was our minority leader then.\n  This is a defining moment for the Senate. Because as the Senator from \nPennsylvania has indicated, if the majority of one can go to the House \nand negotiate a bill and bring it back and there are not going to be \nany amendments, we are going to file a first-degree amendment, a \nsecond-degree amendment, and have cloture or else--the Senate is \ntotally irrelevant.\n  Having been in the minority and in the majority, I think the majority \nought to think twice. There is only one vote difference here right now, \ntwo votes when our good friend from South Dakota comes back. But as a \npractical matter, the rights of the minority--really the whole \ncountry--depend upon the minority in the Senate having an opportunity \nto voice some of the concerns about what has happened in the House.\n  I say, in all sincerity, this is a defining moment. I believe the \nmessage we are trying to send on this Iraq resolution is wrong. I think \nit is harming the people who represent us in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even \nAfghanistan is coming back. We are going to have to send a new group, \nthe 175th, over there to deal with al-Qaida in Afghanistan, again.\n  Our people need support, and we need to be able to articulate the \nreasons why we support them. If we follow the outline of the majority \nleader, we will not have that chance except by talking and talking. But \nno amendments.\n  It is not right. It is not the Senate. I do not intend to stand by \nand see the\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nSenate lose its role under the Constitution to be the second House of \nthe Congress. This is not a rubberstamp for the House. That is what we \nwill be if we follow the intention of the majority leader now.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I \ncannot think of any issue more important to the Senate.\n  I have said many times that the 100 men and women who serve here are \nprivileged to do so. Someday, someone from our State will replace us. \nThat is the genius of the Founders of this country. However, there are \nonly 100 Members. There are 300 million Americans. The 300 million \nAmericans expect the 100 Senators to speak for them. They do not have \nthat opportunity themselves.\n  I consider it a great privilege to be here. I used to sit up in the \ngallery when I was a law student and watch the Senate, and I thought \nthen as I do today that the Senate should be and often is the \nconscience of the Nation.\n  I heard the debates during the time of the Vietnam war. I became the \nonly Vermonter to actually vote on whether to continue that war. Today, \nwe have a different war but many people in this country are as \nconcerned. Those for the war in Iraq, those against the war in Iraq.\n  I go to my State of Vermont and everywhere I go, whether I am in \nbuying groceries and people come talk to me or I am at the gas station \nor if I am shoveling snow--and yesterday we had 2\\1/2\\ feet of snow at \nmy home in Vermont--people stop and want to talk about the war in Iraq. \nMy guess is it is no different in any other State.\n  These are very patriotic, very honest, very concerned people, and \nthey have legitimate questions. They always ask: Why isn't the Senate \ndebating the war in Iraq?\n  A week ago, Senator Reid, the distinguished majority leader, tried \nevery which way to provide the Senate with an opportunity to debate a \nbipartisan resolution on Iraq. That effort failed, and it failed again \nearlier today. It was blocked by some in the Republican Party who \ninsisted on a separate vote that was nothing more than a political \nploy. Instead of a debate on the President's policy, they wanted the \ndebate to be about who supports the troops. We all support the troops, \nbut we have some very different views about the President's policy that \nput brave American men and women in harm's way.\n  As so often is the case when anyone asked a question, expressed \nreservations or outright opposed the President's policy in Iraq, the \nPresident's defenders accuse his detractors of not being patriotic or \nof not supporting the troops. What blatant balderdash that is.\n  For years I have fought for veterans' benefits, for fair treatment \nfor the National Guard, for armor for our troops who were sent by this \nadministration into battle unprepared--and still, 5 years later don't \nhave the armor their vehicles need to withstand the roadside bomb \nblasts. I have fought to replace the depleted stocks of equipment that \nour troops need and depend upon so their families do not have to send \nto them what the Government should be providing. The absurd accusation \nthat it is unpatriotic to disagree with a policy that has resulted in \nthe deaths of thousands of American soldiers and created a terrorists' \nhaven in a country that, before our invasion, posed no threat to the \nUnited States, has worn thin.\n  It reminds me of my days as a prosecutor, when a defendant was caught \nred-handed. What would they do? They would usually attack the accuser. \nThey could not say ``You caught me breaking and entering.'' Rather, \ntheir defense was ``I was set up.'' Or ``He made me do it.'' That is \nwhat has been going on since President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and \nformer Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld ignored all advice to the contrary \nand led us into this costly fiasco.\n  These are the people who, when they had a chance to get Osama bin \nLaden--and we all want to see Osama bin Laden brought to justice for \nthe attacks on September 11--when they had him cornered in Afghanistan, \nthey decided instead to invade Iraq. Iraq did not pose a threat. Iraq \ndid not have weapons of mass destruction. The intelligence was as \nequivocal as it was distorted and manipulated. But the President was \nfixated on Iraq, and he has remained so ever since.\n  Remember how the Vice President confidently said we would be welcomed \nas liberators? Some welcome. Remember the President, dressed up in a \nflight suit on an aircraft carrier so he could make a rousing speech \nunder the sign ``Mission Accomplished.'' Thousands of Americans have \nbeen killed or injured in Iraq in the years since that phony photo op.\n  The flawed policies of this administration have thrust our troops \ninto the maw of a bloody civil war. Our troops are not responsible for \nthe mistaken policies they have been asked to implement. Policymakers \nin Washington are responsible for that and only we can change those \npolicies.\n  My youngest son was a member of the Marine Corps. He was called up \nduring the first Gulf War. He saluted and was ready to do his duty, as \nare all the loyal men and women in our armed services. That was a \ndifferent war. Thank God it was over so quickly. Neither he nor many \nothers called up were in harm's way.\n  But the policymakers made this policy and only they can change it, \nnot the troops on the ground. The polls show, unmistakably, that a \nmajority of the American people want the Congress to debate and vote on \nthe Iraq war. They know it is the key issue of the day. They see it is \na widening civil war. They want their sons and daughters to come home \npursuant to as sensible a plan as we can muster.\n  It is that simple. We ought to be debating that. If there are \nSenators who feel the troops should be there longer, that more of them \nshould be sent there, then come to the Senate and say so. But also, \nthere are those who feel we have to do all we can to bring our men and \nwomen home. We should have the opportunity to debate and vote on it.\n\n  The costs of this misadventure have not just been onerous, they have \nbeen catastrophic. More than 3,000 Americans killed, more than 20,000 \nwounded. My wife and I have visited some of the wounded. These are \ndevastating wounds, crippling wounds, blinding wounds, wounds that \ndisable people for the rest of their lives. And tens of thousands of \ninnocent Iraqis have lost their lives.\n  In material terms, we are fast approaching the $1 trillion mark. We \nare throwing money out the door at a rate of more than $2 billion per \nweek to fund this war. We are told about the things we cannot afford in \nAmerica because we have to fund the war in Iraq. We are cutting funds \nfor law enforcement, for police on our streets so we can pay for police \nin Iraq. We can't upgrade our hospitals. And on and on.\n  And the international reputation of America, which has brought us \ngreat influence, has now been tarnished, especially among our allies, \ntarnished and diminished.\n  Where are we in Iraq? We are in the midst of a civil war among \nreligious and ethnic factions, an insurgency that\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nshows no signs of diminishing and out-of-control organized crime. It is \nhard to say we have made any real progress toward the larger objective \nof bringing democracy to Iraq and the Middle East.\n  It is time we face this grim reality. Our soldiers' lives are in the \nbalance. America's reputation is in the balance. America's ability to \nset an example for the rest of the world is in the balance.\n  I made a brief statement on Tuesday about a column in last Sunday's \nWashington Post by retired LTG William Odom. I know General Odom. I \nworked with him on some of the most significant intelligence matters in \nthis country. He has one of the most distinguished military \nintelligence careers. He continues to provide powerful insights on \nnational security. In his piece entitled ``Victory Is Not An Option,'' \nhe outlines how this administration's entire policy in Iraq, including \nthe so-called surge strategy, is based on a self-defeating inability to \nface reality.\n  The reality, according to the general, is that we are not going to \nmake Iraq a democracy. The longer we stay, the more likely Iraq will be \nanti-American at the end of our intervention. Think of that, after $1 \ntrillion.\n  Our invasion made civil war and increased Iranian influence \ninevitable. No amount of military force will prevent those outcomes. \nMeanwhile, our presence is only stoking al-Qaida's involvement in Iraq.\n  The reality is that supporting our troops does not mean keeping them \nthere to carry out a failed strategy. It means pursuing a course that \nprotects the country's interests and prevents more Americans from dying \nin pursuit of an ill-defined, open-ended strategy that cannot succeed.\n  General Odom knows we need to begin an orderly withdrawal from Iraq. \nHe argues we should join with other countries in the region, those \nwhose input this administration has often ignored, and seek to \nstabilize the region through sustained, high-level diplomacy. These \nviews are in line with those of some of our senior military officers, \nnational security experts and many in Congress, and I might say a \nmajority of the American people. The people we are here to represent.\n  Look at what the administration and defenders of the Republican Party \noffer instead: We get filibusters when it is time to debate the \nPresident's Iraq policy, we get the same old rhetoric about not \nsupporting the troops, and we get a bill from the President for another \n$100 billion to send 20,000 more troops and continue the war. If the \nPresident cannot face the reality that even some Members of his own \nparty increasingly have come to accept, then it is our responsibility--\nI would also say our patriotic duty and our moral duty--to act.\n\n  A nonbinding resolution that sends a clear message in opposition to \nan escalation of troops is far better than the years of silence of a \nrubberstamp Congress. But we know the President will ignore it. He has \nalready said so. We know it is only a first step.\n  I will support binding legislation by Senators Obama and Feingold to \nbegin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. It is not our \nrole to choose sides in this civil war, and it is a prescription for \ndisaster. It is not our troops' role to die trying to force these \nwarring factions to settle their age-old differences.\n  We need to continue to fight the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. \nWe need to deploy sufficient forces and intelligence assets to track \ndown international terrorists around the world. We need to do a lot \nbetter job of policing our borders, without denying entry to innocent \npeople who are fleeing persecution.\n  General Odom is right, keeping our troops in Iraq is not making us \nsafer. We should be bringing our troops home. We should be bringing \nthem home with the thanks of a nation for doing their duty. Congress \nhas the power to force the President to change course. That is what the \nAmerican people want. That is what we should be debating.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1993-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1993-S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 214\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I saw the distinguished Senator from Arizona on the floor a \nmoment ago, and I told him I would notify him because I know he is \ngoing to object. I also see the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who \nwill. But, Mr. President, what I am going to do is the following: I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 24, S. 214, a bill to preserve the \nindependence of U.S. attorneys, that the committee-reported amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And I will not object, but I wish to say a word before \nwe proceed further. I just want to urge my colleagues to accept this \nunanimous consent request by Senator Leahy to move forward legislation \non restoring the longtime procedure for appointing interim U.S. \nattorneys.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after objection is heard, if it is \nheard, Senator Leahy be permitted to yield 5 minutes to me and then he \nimmediately regain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is one unanimous consent request pending \nat this time, and that needs to be resolved before we move forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nremaining of the hour the Senator from Vermont has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know people are about to object. I can \nassure the Senator from New York--so he will not have to repeat his \nrequest--that he is going to be getting time after the objection is \nmade. I am going to make a statement, a very short statement, but I \nwill yield at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nArizona does desire to object to this unanimous consent proposal and \ncould not be here on the floor, so on his behalf, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Judiciary Committee reached \na bipartisan consensus to reverse recent changes to the law governing \nappointments of interim U.S. attorneys. These changes were made, with \nlittle transparency, during final negotiations of the reauthorization \nof the USA Patriot Act. Through my staff, I had objected at the time, \nbut to no avail. These changes invited and abetted an apparent abuse of \npower by this administration that threatens to undermine the \neffectiveness and professionalism of U.S. attorneys offices around the \ncountry.\n  I continue to support Senator Feinstein's efforts to combat these \nabuses. I thank Senator Schumer for chairing our hearing into this \nmatter last week and Senator Specter for his active involvement, which \nhelped lead to a bipartisan solution. I urge the Senate to follow the \ncommittee's lead and approve the Specter, Feinstein, Leahy substitute \nto S. 214, the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of \n2007.\n  During the Patriot Act reauthorization last year, checks on the \nauthority of the Attorney General to appoint interim U.S. attorneys to \nfill a vacancy temporarily were removed. The change to the law removed \nthe 120-day limit for such appointments and removed the district \ncourt's role in making any subsequent interim appoints. This change in \nlaw, accomplished over my objection, allowed the Attorney General for \nthe first time to make so-called interim appointments that could last \nindefinitely.\n  Regrettably, we do not have to imagine the effects of this unfettered \nauthority. We learned recently that the Department of Justice has asked \nseveral outstanding U.S. attorneys from around the country to resign \ntheir positions. Some are engaged in difficult and complex public \ncorruption cases. Yesterday, one of the U.S. attorneys who has been \ntold to resign, Carol Lam of the Southern District of California,\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nannounced two indictments stemming from her office's investigation of \nnow-convicted former Congressman Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham. A Federal \ngrand jury handed up indictments of San Diego defense contractor Brent \nR. Wilkes for bribery and of Wilkes and the former No. 3 official at \nthe CIA, Kyle ``Dusty'' Foggo, for conspiring to defraud the United \nStates. Apparently, Ms. Lam's reward for her efforts at rooting out \nserious public corruption is a pink slip.\n  We also understand the Attorney General has or is planning to appoint \ninterim replacements for the U.S. attorneys he is removing, raising a \npotential of avoiding the Senate confirmation process altogether. This \nis an end-run around our system of checks and balances.\n  Many Senators have raised concerns about this practice, and several \nhave asked the Attorney General about the reasons for the interim \nappointments. The situation in Arkansas highlights the troubling nature \nof this new authority and its abuse. The Attorney General removed \nrespected U.S. attorney Bud Cummins and replaced him with the interim \nappointment of Tim Griffin, a former political operative for Karl Rove. \nThis appointment was not made pursuant to an agreement with the two \nhome State Senators.\n  In our hearing last week, Paul McNulty, the second in command at the \nDepartment of Justice, testified that Mr. Cummins' dismissal was not \nrelated to how well he did his job. In fact, Mr. McNulty said he had no \n``performance problems,'' but was removed merely to give an opportunity \nto Mr. Griffin, a person whom he admitted was not the ``best person \npossible'' for the job and who is reported to have been involved in an \neffort during the 2004 election to challenge voting by primarily \nAfrican-American voters serving in the Armed Forces overseas. This was \nnot a vacancy created by necessity or emergency. This was a vacancy \ncreated by choice to advance a political crony.\n\n  Since this administration has been creating these vacancies by \nremoving U.S. attorneys as it chooses for whatever reason--or no good \nreason--on a timeline it dictates, how can it now claim not to have had \ntime to fill spots with Senate-confirmed nominees? Why were agreed upon \nreplacements not lined up before creating these vacancies? Why were \nhome State Senators not consulted in advance? I would note that every \none of the U.S. attorneys who was asked to resign was someone chosen by \nthis administration, while the Attorney General served as White House \ncounsel, nominated by this President, approved by the home State \nSenators and confirmed by the Senate. This is a problem of the \nadministration's imagination and choosing, like so many others.\n  With respect to the law that has governed for the last few decades, \nthe authority given to the Attorney General to make a time-limited \ninterim appointment has not proven to be a problem. For example, last \nCongress, the time from nomination to confirmation of U.S. attorney \nnominations took an average of 71 days, with only three taking longer \nthan 120 days and two of those only a few days longer.\n  The Department opposes the district court's role in the law that \nexisted prior to the changes enacted in a Patriot Act reauthorization \nconference. This was a conference in which Democratic Members were \nexcluded. The Department claims the district court's role in filling \nvacancies beyond 120 days to be inconsistent with sound separation of \npowers principles. That is contrary to the Constitution, our history \nand our practices. In fact, the practice of judicial officers \nappointing officers of the court is well established in our history and \nfrom the earliest days. Morrison v. Olson should have laid to rest the \nso-called separation of powers concern now being trumpeted to justify \nthese political maneuvers within the Justice Department. It is not just \na red hearing but a bright red herring. Certainly no Republicans now \ndefending this administration voiced concern when a panel of judges \nappointed Ken Starr to spend millions in taxpayer dollars going after \nPresident Clinton as a court-appointed prosecutor.\n  I have heard not a word from the apologists who seek to use the \nConstitution as a shield for these activities about what the \nConstitution says. The Constitution provides congressional power to \ndirect the appointment power. In article II, the part of the \nConstitution that this administration reads as if it says that all \npower resides with the President, the President's appointment power is \nlimited by the power of Congress. Indeed, between its provisions \ncalling for appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate and \nfor the President's limited power to make recess appointments, the \nConstitution provides:\n\n       But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such \n     inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President \n     alone, in the courts of law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n  Thus, the Constitution contemplates exactly what our statutes and \npractices have always provided. Congress is well within its authority \nwhen it vests in the courts a share of the appointment power for those \nwho appear before them.\n  Regrettably, this latest abuse of power follows this administration's \npoliticization of U.S. attorneys offices. A recent study of Federal \ninvestigations of elected officials and candidates shows that the Bush \nJustice Department has pursued Democrats far more than Republicans. The \nstudy by Dr. Donald C. Shields, professor emeritus from the Department \nof Communication, University of Missouri-St. Louis, and Dr. John F. \nCragan, professor emeritus from the Department of Communication, \nIllinois State University, found that between 2001 and 2006, 79 percent \nof the elected officials and candidates who have faced a Federal \ninvestigation were Democrats and only 18 percent Republicans. The \nadministration's track record is not good and it again appears caught \nwith its hand in the cookie jar.\n  Before 1986, 28 U.S.C. 546, the law governing the appointment of U.S. \nattorneys, authorized the district court where a vacancy exists to \nappoint a person to serve until the President appointed a person to \nfill that vacancy with the advice and consent of the Senate. When \nCongress changed the law in 1986 to allow the Attorney General to \nappoint an interim U.S. attorney, it carefully circumscribed that \nauthority by limiting it to 120 days, after which the district court \nwould make any further interim appointment needed. I was pleased that \nSenator Feinstein worked so hard with Senator Specter to craft a \nworthwhile consensus measure to reinstate these vital limits on the \nAttorney General's authority and bring back incentives for the \nadministration to fill vacancies with Senate-confirmable nominees. This \nmeasure has bipartisan support on the committee. We reported it out 13-\n6 after debating and voting down several amendments.\n  U.S. attorneys around the country are the chief Federal law \nenforcement officers in their States, and they have an enormous \nresponsibility for implementing antiterrorism efforts, bringing \nimportant and often difficult cases, and taking the lead to fight \npublic corruption. It is vital that those holding these vital positions \nbe free from any inappropriate influence and subject to the check and \nbalance of the confirmation process. The Specter, Feinstein, Leahy \nsubstitute to S. 214 is a measure that passed our committee with \nbipartisan support and I urge the Senate to take it up and pass it \ntoday so that we can curb the abuses we have seen.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 7 minutes of \nmy time be yielded to the Senator from New York--does the Senator want \nmore than that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will take 5.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That 5 minutes of my time be yielded to the Senator from \nNew York and the remainder of my time be yielded to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank our leader on the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont, for his leadership on \nthis issue, as well as for yielding time. It is unfortunate that the \nunanimous consent request of the Senator from Vermont was objected to.\n  Now, I would like to report to my colleagues on both the hearing we \nhad,\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nwhich is public record, and, more to the point, the private meeting we \nhad yesterday with the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. McNulty, who was \ngracious and who is a very fine person. But neither the hearing nor the \nprivate meeting we had allayed our fears. In fact, they increased them \nin a variety of ways.\n  As we know, at least seven U.S. attorneys were summarily fired in \nrecent weeks. The Attorney General has flatly denied that politics has \nplayed a part. But the bottom line is, even at the hearing it was \nadmitted that one U.S. attorney was fired without cause and replaced by \nsomebody who had worked for Karl Rove and the Republican National \nCommittee and did not have much of a record being a prosecutor. Even \nmore troubling was the firing of the U.S. attorney from San Diego, of \nthe Southern District of California, who was in the midst of a very \nhigh-level investigation that led to the conviction of Congressman \nCunningham and, yesterday, the indictment of two more in that. So it is \nhardly a concluded investigation.\n  The bottom line at yesterday's briefing by the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral did little to alleviate our concerns that politics was involved \nin several of these firings and, in fact, raised those concerns.\n  It seems, when you have a preliminary look--we did not get a look--\nbut a preliminary description of the EER reports, the evaluations, that \nmost of the U.S. attorneys, not all but most of the U.S. attorneys who \nwere fired had very fine recommendations.\n  There were a few policy disputes, but particularly in the area of the \nU.S. attorney from the Southern District of California, in the midst of \nan ongoing investigation, there was some policy disagreement about how \nto deal with those crossing the border. She was told to change it. And \nthere is no knowledge or observation whether she changed it or not, and \nyet she was fired in the midst of a much more serious, much more high-\nprofile political investigation.\n  So the idea that people were fired for no cause, the idea that some \nmay have been--and this is not proven, but certainly the hearing and \nthe private meeting increased rather than decreased my concerns--fired \nfor political reasons because they may have either, in some cases, not \ndone what the Justice Department wanted them to do--particularly, \nremember, this was right before election time--or may have been going \nforward with a very serious investigation into local political \nofficials remains a real possibility.\n  We asked to see the EER reports at the hearing. At the private \nmeeting yesterday, Paul McNulty, Deputy U.S. Attorney General, said \nsome of the information was taken under confidence. These are \nevaluations, and they ask lawyers, judges, fellow U.S. attorneys how \nthe office is doing and how the U.S. attorney is doing. And if they \nwere to reveal their names, it might jeopardize the confidentiality of \nfuture EER reports. That is a reasonable assertion. So we asked, could \nwe get the reports and redact the names of those who were saying this \nis a good or bad U.S. attorney? Mr. McNulty said he would get back to \nus on the issue. We await.\n  But make no mistake about it: We will get those EER reports. Either \nthey will be given to us with the necessary redaction--and I have \nspoken to my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein--or we will \nask Senator Leahy, our leader on this issue, through the Judiciary \nCommittee to subpoena them. We will see them. If they show that the \nU.S. attorneys were doing a good job, if they show that they were \npeople who should be there, there will be real trouble.\n  It means two things. First, we will get to the bottom of this. There \nare still too many troubling questions out there. If we have to have \nanother hearing, we will. Second, it means whatever the investigation \nfinds, there is enough troubling evidence out there now that the \nlegislation Senator Feinstein has authored, and Senator Leahy and \nmyself have cosponsored, should be passed immediately. Therefore, it is \nregrettable there was objection that we don't move to rectify the \nsituation and do it right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nholding the hearing in his subcommittee, for his leadership, for \nunderstanding what is at stake, and for being willing to be out in \nfront on doing something about it.\n  What I want to do for the American public is lay out the history of \nthis particular issue and place it in context.\n  Unbeknownst to any of us, in March 2006, in the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization, a provision was included that allows the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint an interim U.S. attorney for an indefinite period of \ntime. You might ask, what is wrong with that? What is wrong is that it \navoids Senate confirmation. Prior to this change, the law stated that \nthe Attorney General could appoint interim U.S. attorneys but only for \n120 days. After that time, the authority to appoint an interim U.S. \nattorney would fall to the district court. Why? Because that provided \nan incentive to the administration to present a U.S. attorney nominee \nto the Senate for hearing, for questions, for review, and for a vote on \nconfirmation.\n  This structure created in 2006 was relatively new. It was enacted \nduring the Reagan administration in a broader bill by Strom Thurmond \nthat was described as a technical corrections bill on criminal \nprocedures. Before that, from 1898 until the Thurmond bill was enacted, \ndistrict courts held the sole authority to appoint interim U.S. \nattorneys. That existed for almost 100 years. It was critical then, as \nit is now, that all U.S. attorneys receive Senate confirmation. By \nhaving the district courts make that interim appointment, it assured \nthat the confirmation would take place.\n  No one expected the rash of firings from the Department of Justice. I \nfirst learned about the Department's actions early in January. At that \ntime I learned that main Justice in Washington had placed calls to at \nleast seven, possibly more, U.S. attorneys and asked them to resign by \na date specific in January. I was also told that the intention was to \nbring in outside lawyers from main Justice or from elsewhere to take \nover these posts and to serve without confirmation for the remainder of \nthe Bush presidency.\n\n  The Department of Justice has now acknowledged in public and at a \nhearing that such calls were made to ``less than 10'' U.S. attorneys \nasking them to step aside. We also know that prior to this action, \nthere were already 13 U.S. attorney vacancies pending, with only two \nnominations presented by the administration to the Judiciary Committee. \nThis means that if you add the 7 to 10 U.S. attorneys who were asked to \nresign to the current 11 vacancies without nominees, there could be \nbetween 18 and 21 U.S. attorney positions throughout the country that \nthe Attorney General could fill without securing Senate confirmation. \nThat is over 20 percent of U.S. attorneys nationally that could be \nfilled for the remaining 2 years of the Bush presidency without going \nthrough Senate confirmation.\n  This new provision slipped into the PATRIOT Act would also allow the \nnext President to put in place all 93 U.S. attorneys and let them serve \nthe entire 4-year term without the benefit of confirmation. This change \nwas a mistake. I suspect the amendment to the PATRIOT Act came from the \nJustice Department, was quietly put in the bill, and none of us at the \ntime were the wiser. And then suddenly, at a certain point, the Justice \nDepartment said: OK, let's begin to remove some of these people and \ngive some of our own bright young people an opportunity to step up and \nbecome a U.S. attorney. This is wrong, and the Justice Department has \nbacked away from it.\n  Let me talk about a few of the U.S. attorneys involved. According to \npress reports, at least three were given glowing reviews from their \nperformance audits in the recent past. According to the Las Vegas \nReview-Journal, Daniel Bogden, the U.S. Attorney for Nevada, said \nWednesday that he was stunned to hear the Department of Justice \nrequested that he step down from his post because of performance \nreasons. He went on to say:\n\n       To this date, no one from the department has previously \n     identified any issues with my performance or the performance \n     of my office.\n\n  A similar story has surfaced about Washington U.S. Attorney John \nMcKay. The Seattle Times reported last week:\n\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n\n       Seven months before he was forced to resign as U.S. \n     attorney for the western district of Washington, John McKay \n     received a glowing performance review from Justice Department \n     evaluators.\n\n  The article went on to quote the report which stated:\n\n       ``McKay is an effective, well-regarded and capable leader \n     of the [U.S. attorney's office]'' . . . according to the team \n     of 27 Justice Department officials.\n       Yet on December 7th, Michael Battle, director of the \n     Justice Department's executive office for U.S. attorneys, \n     called McKay and asked him to step down.\n       ``I was told to resign by the end of January,'' McKay \n     confirmed . . . ``I asked what the reason was, and they told \n     me there was none.''\n\n  Then, of course, there is former-Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins. \nIn a story that ran last month, Mr. Cummins stated that the Director of \nthe Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, Michael Battle, made it clear \nthat although he was being asked to leave, ``it was not about me but \nabout their desire to give someone else the opportunity to have the \nappointment.''\n  Mr. Cummins said he specifically asked if his job performance was a \nproblem when he got the call:\n\n       [Mr. Battle] assured me it was exactly to the contrary.\n\n  These are three cases that have been documented where U.S. attorneys \ndid not have any performance-related concerns as alleged by the \nDepartment. In addition, I have heard similar reports about other U.S. \nattorneys. I want to speak in specific about one. That is the U.S. \nAttorney from San Diego, CA. Today is U.S. Attorney Carol Lam's last \nday in office. I want to commend her. I thank her for the work she has \ndone in that office. She was sworn in as U.S. attorney in September of \n2002 and was appointed by the President in November 2002. Prior to \nserving as U.S. attorney, she was a judge of the Superior Court of San \nDiego, and she served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the southern \ndistrict of California for 11 years. So she was no newcomer. She has \nbeen successful in bringing many of the country's most important \ncorruption cases. I want to go through a few of them.\n  In March of 2004, Steven Mark Lash, the former chief financial \nofficer of FPA Medical Management, was sentenced for his role in \ndefrauding shareholders and lenders of FPA. The collapse of the company \nleft more than 1,600 doctors being owed more than $60 million and \npatients reported being unable to obtain medical care because FPA had \nceased paying providers. Thank you, Carol Lam.\n  In January 2005, Mark Anthony Kolowich, owner of World Express Rx, \npled guilty to conspiracy to selling counterfeit pharmaceuticals, \nconspiracy to commit mail fraud and smuggle pharmaceuticals, and \nconspiracy to launder money. Mr. Kolowich had run an Internet pharmacy \nWeb site where customers could order prescription drugs without a valid \nprescription. The judge called him the kingpin and architect of an \nelicit pharmaceutical ring that recruited many others to smuggle drugs \nacross the United States-Mexico border at San Ysidro. Ms. Lam also \nannounced that charges had been filed against five other individuals in \na related case involving MyRxForLess.com. Thank you, Carol Lam.\n  In July 2005, Ms. Lam brought a case against San Diego councilman \nRalph Inzunza, along with Las Vegas lobbyist Lance Malone, were \nconvicted on multiple counts of extortion, wire fraud conspiracy, and \nwire fraud. They were accused of trading money for efforts to repeal a \nlaw.\n\n  In November 2005, Ms. Lam secured a guilty plea from former \nRepresentative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham for taking more than $2 \nmillion in bribes in a criminal conspiracy case involving at least \nthree defense contractors, after he accepted cash and gifts and then \ntried to influence the Defense Department on behalf of donors. He also \npled guilty to a separate tax evasion violation for failing to disclose \nincome in 2004. Thank you, Carol Lam.\n  In addition, earlier this week, Carol Lam announced two more \nindictments of Kyl ``Dusty'' Foggo, former top officer at the CIA, and \nBrent Wilkes, a defense contractor accused of bribing Duke Cunningham \nand the prime benefactor of the secret CIA contracts. Thank you, Carol \nLam.\n  This woman was called and told to resign by a date specific, after \nshe has done all of this good work. Ms. Lam and the San Diego U.S. \nAttorney's office have also pursued and successfully prosecuted other \nimportant cases, including:\n  In September 2005, the president of the San Diego chapter of Hell's \nAngels pled guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. Guy Russell \nCastiglione admitted that he conspired to kill members of a rival \nmotorcycle gang, the Mongols, and to sell methamphetamine. Thank you, \nCarol Lam.\n  Then in December 2005, Daymond Buchanan, member of Hells Angels, was \nsentenced to 92 months in Federal prison for participating in a pattern \nof racketeering. He admitted in his guilty plea that he and other \nHell's Angels also inflicted serious bodily injury upon one victim and \nthat another Hell's Angel brandished a firearm during the offense.\n  At that time, Ms. Lam announced:\n\n       With the president, sergeant at arms, secretary, treasurer, \n     and six other members of the Hell's Angels convicted of \n     racketeering charges and facing long prison sentences, the \n     San Diego chapter of the Hell's Angels has been effectively \n     shut down for the foreseeable future.\n\n  Thank you, Carol Lam. And what does she get? Fired without cause.\n  In September, 2006, Jose Ernesto Beltran-Quinonez, a Mexican \nnational, pleaded guilty to making false statements about weapons of \nmass destruction. Mr. Quinonez was sentenced to 3 years in Federal \nprison for making up a story about Chinese terrorists sneaking into the \nUnited States with a nuclear warhead. That hoax prompted a massive \ninvestigation, Federal warnings, discussions at one of President Bush's \nsecurity briefings, and a nationwide hunt for the group of Chinese \nsupposedly plotting the attack.\n  Thank you, Carol Lam.\n  In December 2006, Mel Kay, of Golden State Fence Company, and Michael \nMcLaughlin, pleaded guilty to felony charges of hiring illegal \nimmigrants and agreed to pay fines of $200,000 and $100,000, \nrespectively. The company, which built more than a mile of the 15-foot-\nhigh fence near the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego, agreed \nseparately to pay $5 million on a misdemeanor count, one of the largest \nfines ever imposed on a company for an immigration violation.\n  Thank you, Carol Lam.\n  These are just some of the important cases Carol Lam has pursued \nduring her tenure. She does not deserve this kind of treatment.\n  In addition, during her previous time in the office, Ms. Lam \nprosecuted and convicted several high-ranking members of La Cosa \nNostra, a Chicago-based organized crime family. She also secured a \nguilty plea and settlement of $110 million against National Health \nLaboratories, Inc., in a Medicare fraud case.\n  Ms. Lam has had a distinguished career and she served the Southern \nDistrict of San Diego well, and everyone in that district knows that. I \nregret that main Justice does not. I am quite disappointed that main \nJustice chose to remove her, especially given the ongoing work in which \nthe office is involved.\n  Now, like Senator Schumer, I was present yesterday when the Justice \nDepartment briefed us and several other Senators as to why they asked \nthese U.S. attorneys to leave. With the record I just pointed out, \nnothing that was said yesterday justifies asking this U.S. attorney to \nleave without cause--nothing. That is why this is an issue. I believe \ntheir intent was to bring in people from the outside to give some of \ntheir bright young people an opportunity. This might not be wrong, if \nthey weren't also attempting to avoid confirmation. Without \nconfirmation, the Department of Justice could bring in political \noperatives or anybody else. That is wrong.\n  If I had not been given this information, we never would have known \nabout these events because the likelihood is that these U.S. attorneys \nwould have just quietly resigned and retired to another job or retired \ninto society somewhere else. This is not the way we should function. \nThat is why this is a major issue. That is why the Majority Leader of \nthe Senate wishes to bring this bill to the floor--to put it back to \nwhere it was prior to that provision being put into the Patriot Act \nwithout our knowledge and without debate.\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\n  I hope the U.S. attorney bill will come to the floor of the Senate, \nand I hope we can change it back. I hope we can go out and say to the \nAmerican people that this will never happen again and every U.S. \nattorney will have confirmation before the Senate of the United States.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my support for the \nlegislation put forward by Senator Feinstein on the interim appointment \nof U.S. attorneys. This legislation represents a compromise between \nSenator Specter and Senator Feinstein and I commend them for the \nbipartisan example they have set in addressing this issue.\n  Senator Pryor and I came to this debate because of the interim \nappointment of a U.S. attorney in Arkansas, but the importance of this \nissue goes beyond the qualifications of Tim Griffin for that position. \nThe Founding Fathers created this Government around a system of checks \nand balances, with three coequal branches. As we all know, one of those \nbranches is filled with officials who are not elected, such as Mr. \nGriffin. The Founding Fathers knew that if the executive branch was \nallowed to appoint all of the members of the judiciary without any \nconsultation with the legislative branch, it would make the judiciary \nbranch simply an extension of the executive.\n  What we are talking about today is another in a long line of attempts \nby this administration to undermine the system of checks and balances \nby expanding the authority of the executive branch. These abuses of \npower have almost always related to provisions that are necessary for \nthe smooth operation of government. Of course we need the ability to \nappoint a U.S. attorney in a time of crisis when Congress is not in \nsession, but do we need that authority extended to a point where a \nsitting President can make a judicial appointment with no set \ntermination? Absolutely not. The law the administration changed in the \nPATRIOT Act was well structured to provide the ability to appoint in \ntimes of emergency, while respecting the Senate's role in the process. \nThe compromise put forward by Senators Feinstein and Specter seeks to \nrestore that.\n  The Senate's role in the confirmation process is vital as it provides \na second review of the qualifications of a nominee and allows \nconstituents a better opportunity to evaluate a nominee and state their \nsupport or opposition. I fear that this effort to diminish the Senate's \nrole in the confirmation process is indicative of this administration's \ngeneral attitude toward a vital provision of our Constitution and to \nthe system of checks and balances in general. If given the choice, it \nwould appear that this administration clearly favors less transparency \nin government, not more. If allowed to continue, I feel certain that it \nwould result in the average constituent having much greater difficulty \ngetting their voice heard on the appointment of nonelected officials. \nThe power of our democracy rests with the people, and that is something \nwe must never forget. It is for that reason that I support Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Specter and urge my colleagues to join with them \nin order to pass this legislation\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I regret that we have not been allowed to \nmove forward at this time on S. 214, a bill to preserve the \nindependence of U.S. attorneys.\n  This legislation is ready for floor action. It was the subject of a \nlengthy hearing in the Judiciary Committee and was favorably reported \nby that committee with bipartisan support.\n  The bill would protect U.S. attorneys from being used as political \npawns. It would limit the power of the Justice Department to appoint \nlong-term replacements for departing U.S. Attorneys and instead \nauthorize the chief Federal judge in a district to appoint a temporary \nreplacement while the permanent nominee undergoes Senate confirmation. \nThis is the process that was followed for decades until it was changed \nin the Patriot Act reauthorization.\n  Last month, we learned that at least seven U.S. attorneys had been \ndirected by the Department of Justice to resign. One of these was the \nU.S. attorney in my State of Nevada, Daniel Bogden.\n  Let me take just a moment to thank Dan Bogden for his service. He has \nbeen the chief Federal prosecutor in Nevada since his appointment in \n2001. He is a former Washoe County deputy district attorney and had \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorney for 10 years before being \nappointed as chief Federal prosecutor. He made it a priority to \nprosecute violent criminals and drug traffickers and his efforts have \nmade Nevada safer. I appreciate all the remarkable work he has done for \nour State.\n  The Deputy Attorney General testified that the U.S. attorneys who \nwere forced out had ``performance issues.'' As far as I am concerned \nthat is nonsense. Dan Bogden's last job evaluation described him as \nbeing a ``capable'' leader who was highly regarded by the Federal \njudges and investigators in our State.\n  What is really going on here? According to news reports, the decision \nto remove U.S. attorneys was part of a plan to ``build up the back \nbench of Republicans by giving them high-profile jobs.'' In fact, at \nleast one of the fired U.S. attorneys was replaced by a GOP opposition \nresearcher who is known as a protege of Karl Rove.\n  So what has happened might well be called ``Crony-gate.'' It may not \nbe as far reaching a scandal as Watergate, but it is a scandal \nnonetheless. It represents a breach of the long tradition of \nindependence that allowed these powerful Federal prosecutors to do \ntheir jobs without fear of political retribution. Now every U.S. \nattorney will be looking over his or her shoulder to see if Karl Rove \nor other White House aides approve of their decisions.\n  The administration is in a position to ignore the Senate and place \nits own loyalists in these key jobs because of a little known change \nincluded in the Patriot Act last year at the insistence of the Justice \nDepartment. This provision lets the Attorney General make interim U.S. \nattorney appointments with no time limits, no residency requirements, \nand no need for Senate confirmation.\n  I applaud Senators Feinstein, Pryor, Leahy, and others for addressing \nthis problem swiftly. Their bill will help ensure that the people of \nNevada have a say in who will be their next U.S. attorney. The Senate \nconfirmation process for U.S. attorneys ensures transparency and \naccountability. We need to keep politics out of the justice system.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1997-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1997-S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF NORMAN RANDY SMITH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about a tremendous \nevent that happened in the Senate, and that is that the Senate today \nconfirmed my good friend, Randy Smith, to be a judge on the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  Madam President, today really is the conclusion of a sometimes \nunnecessarily long and difficult process for the confirmation of Judge \nSmith. Judge Smith was originally nominated by the President back on \nDecember 16, 2005, for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nthat was vacated when Idaho Judge Stephen Trott took senior status.\n  Earlier this year, through negotiations with the White House, Judge \nSmith was renominated to a different Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit \nthat had been vacated when Judge Thomas Nelson took senior status.\n  Since 1996, Judge Smith has served as district judge for the Sixth \nJudicial District of Idaho. Judge Smith earned his undergraduate and \nlaw degrees from Brigham Young University. Throughout his career, both \nin private practice and as a judge, Judge Smith has continued to be a \nstudent and teacher of the law. He taught courses in business law and \ntax law at Brigham Young and later at Boise State University. Since \n1993 he has served on the faculty at Idaho State University teaching \nlegal environment and business law.\n  Prior to becoming a judge, Randy Smith spent more than 15 years in \nprivate practice, gaining significant experience before both State and \nFederal courts. He is a member of the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. District Court for the State \nof Idaho, U.S. Tax Court, the Idaho Supreme Court, and all of the other \ncourts of the State of Idaho.\n  In addition to his current position as district judge in Idaho, Judge \nSmith also serves from time to time as pro tem justice on the Idaho \nSupreme Court, as a judge on the Idaho Court of Appeals, also, and as a \ntemporary judge in district courts throughout the State of Idaho. He \nliterally handles approximately 100 Federal and State civil cases each \nyear.\n  In 2004, Judge Smith received the George C. Granata, Jr., Award \npresented by the Idaho State judiciary in recognition of demonstrated \nprofessionalism as an Idaho trial judge, and for motivating and \ninspiring his colleagues on the bench by his character and actions. In \n2002, he received the Outstanding Service Award from the Idaho State \nBoard of Commissioners. Judge Smith is also a member of the board of \ndirectors and is a past president of the Idaho State Civic Symphony.\n  The American Bar Association has given him its unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating for his nomination to the Ninth Circuit.\n  It is my honor today to personally congratulate Judge Smith. As I \nsaid, he is a personal friend. I have known him for years and have \nwatched him give service to the people of the State of Idaho of the \nhighest caliber. He has shown himself to have the principles and values \nto be the kind of judge that America needs. He understands that we need \na conservative understanding and interpretation of the U.S. \nConstitution, and that the role of a judge is interpretation of the \nlaw, not creation of the law. He understands the value that comes from \nhaving solid adherence to the principles of our Constitution as issues \nare adjudicated. He will be a tremendous new asset and addition to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As I said at the outset, this has been a long, sometimes very \nunnecessarily burdensome and difficult process to get his nomination to \nthe floor. I am sure that the strength he will bring to the Ninth \nCircuit was shown by the vote of confidence given to him today, a \nunanimous vote by the Senators present, 94 to 0, confirming him to be \nthe next judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This is a tremendous day for Randy Smith, but it is also a tremendous \nday for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the people who live in that \ncircuit, and, frankly, for the people of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S1998-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1998-S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THREE MONTANA HEROES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Saint Luke explains in his Gospel:\n\n       The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath sent me \n     to heal.\n\n  Delivering care to the sick and injured is the Lord's work. To heal \nthe sick at great risk to one's own safety reflects the best that we \ncan be as the Lord's servants.\n  I am here to honor three healers from my home State of Montana--\nambulance pilot Vince Kirol, paramedic and firefighter Paul Erikson, \nand registered nurse Darcy Doyle. These Montana heroes died tragically \nduring an air rescue mission on February 6.\n  Their deaths are a tremendous loss to their families, to Benefits \nHealthcare, and to all of Montana. These dedicated individuals were en \nroute to Bozeman from Great Falls in dangerous weather to pick up a \npatient who had suffered a severe head injury that required immediate \nsurgery.\n  Every minute counted. The victim's injury had to be treated as \nquickly as possible. The longer it took to get him to the hospital, the \nworse his chances were for survival. The only way to get the patient \nthe care he needed was by air transport. So the dependable air \nambulance team at Benefits Healthcare was called. Vince, Paul, and \nDarcy responded to the call without hesitation and without concern for \ntheir own safety.\n  They knew that somebody's life was hanging in the balance. This is \nthe type of pressure-filled situation in which they have always \noperated.\n  Montana is a large State, it is a beautiful State, with rural and \nisolated areas, where people who are injured may need immediate rescue, \nmay need it right away, including air ambulance transportation to a \ntrauma center.\n  Unfortunately, there are not enough hospitals in Montana that can \ngive the kind of care someone with severe injuries immediately needs.\n  So-called level 1 hospitals have operating rooms, surgeons, and \nradiologists available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, waiting and ready \nfor any patient with severe injuries who is brought in. There are no \nlevel 1 hospitals in Montana.\n  Level 2 hospitals have the right facilities, but the doctors are not \nin the hospital around the clock to be available immediately when a \npatient arrives. There are only three level 2 trauma centers in \nMontana.\n  It is very expensive to run hospitals and offer this high-level, \nspecialized care. Only three hospitals in Montana--one in Missoula, one \nin Billings, and one in Great Falls--offer such services, so every \npatient who needs a trauma center has to go to one of these hospitals. \nThis makes air ambulance transportation even more important, given \nMontana's 800-mile span and mountainous terrain.\n  The Benefits medevac program provides 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week \nair ambulance transportation in Montana and the Northwest. Aircraft \nrespond to isolated areas, accident scenes, and hospitals to bring \npatients to the regional emergency center as quickly as possible.\n  These dedicated pilots, nurses, and paramedics who operate the \nBenefits medevac program provide honorable and essential services to \nMontana. The three Benefits professionals who lost their lives last \nweek were trying to do just that.\n  Darcy Dengel was a 27-year-old registered nurse.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wanted to take just a few minutes to kind of review where we are \nhere in the silence that abounds in this Senate. The question about \nwhat is going on is kind of mystifying for much of the public looking \nin and saying: What are they doing wasting time?\n  There was some talk about the terrible situation we are in in Iraq, \nand I spoke as one of those who say we have had enough. We have had \nenough there. We have lost over 3,000 people, and the Iraqis have lost \nsubstantial numbers. One would have to be really hardhearted not to be \nmoved when you look in the paper and you see a child weeping over a \ndead mother or a brother or a sister or people lying in the street dead \nfrom brutal attacks from this internal civil war while we are trying to \nfigure out what we do to protect our people.\n  What is it that we want to accomplish with the votes that have been \ntaken here? I think it is fair to say that what we would like on this \nside of the aisle, and I am sure there are many colleagues on the other \nside who feel as we do but would be out of step politically if they \ntook the vote we want to take, to approve or disapprove of sending more \ntroops into that death trap, to say how long we want to stay there.\n  What do we have to prove by supporting the President's order, the \nPresident's interest in the so-called surge? They try to disguise the \nword. The word is ``escalate.'' It is not ``surge.'' ``Surge'' can be \ninterpreted many ways, but ``escalate'' is very clear: Put more people \nthere. Put more people in harm's way. Put more people in an abyss from \nwhich there is no way, that anyone has told us, out of the situation.\n  We get the argument: Oh, you want to cut and run. No. Do you want to \nstay and die? Is that what the alternative is? Ask the families who \nhave children, brothers, fathers, and mothers there. They come in to \nsee me, people who have someone who is in Iraq, and they are scared to \ndeath about what kind of news they will get some night.\n  I had a woman in the office one day, with a group of other people, \nsobbing so hard that she couldn't talk. Why? Because her son had been \nwounded--a light wound but enough to earn him a Purple Heart--and he \nwas being sent back on hazardous duty. He was willing to do it. His \nmother didn't want him to do it. But at what point do we say the pain \nis so excruciating that we can't stand it?\n  It has nothing to do with cut-and-run. I wore a uniform in World War \nI. Others here have worn the country's uniform, some in Vietnam, some \nin Korea. We have had a lot of experience with wars. But in each case, \nif we didn't have an objective, we fared very badly. That was true, \nunfortunately, in Vietnam, where we finally had to wrap it up and go \nhome, leaving 58,000 of our brothers and sisters still there, if not \nphysically, in sharp memory. And now we see what is happening here.\n  I bring to our attention the fact that in Iraq, in the month of \nJanuary, we lost 83 of our bravest. Thus far in February, we have \nalready lost 48 members of the American military. And the Iraqis have \nsuffered deaths. Look at the number of people who have been murdered \nthere with suicide bombs, roadside bombs, and brutal murders, with \nhands tied behind their backs and blindfolded. It goes on and on. If we \ncould wish it away, if we could see an end to it, I would be more than \nwilling to leave troops there to kind of monitor the last parts of a \nwar that is one of the worst America has been in, but what we see is \nnot only the numbers that are perishing daily, weekly, but the tactics \nthey are using now with shooting down helicopters. That wasn't \nsomething we saw before.\n  Suddenly now, in the past couple of weeks, three helicopters have \nbeen taken down by enemy fire. That changes the complexity of things \nbecause helicopters were an integral part of our capacity to fight \nback. If we can't do that, does that mean we have to put more people on \nthe ground, that we have to lose more people? It ought not to be that \nway.\n  Last week, we took a vote here, and it was a vote that would limit \ndebate. We, the Democrats, led the charge there because we wanted to \nget on with the issue of whether we wanted to send more troops than we \nhave there now. The number, estimated to be at 21,000 in combat, means \nthat 48,000, roughly, would be the total number because you need the \nsupport groups as well. That vote was disguised as something else, \nwhich is what our friends are doing today--disguising what their intent \nis. Their intent is to escape the responsibility they took when they \nvoted against closing the debate the other day. That is what happened.\n  They have a lot of discomfort over there. I see my colleague from the \nState of Minnesota is here now, and if I am not mistaken, he was one of \nthose who said: Let's cut the debate and get on with the issue. That is \nwhat his message was that day. And so there is abject discomfort with \nthe vote that was taken because people at home interpreted that in a \ndifferent way. They are not interested so much in our tactical \nmaneuvering here or the process; they want to know: Do we want to send \nmore troops into that inferno or do we want to try to figure out a way \nto get out of there as quickly as practicable? That is the question.\n  So they voted the wrong way. And now, Heaven forbid, we had something \nwe could vote on, and that was voted on by way of closing the debate, \nwhich was developed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman now of \nthe Armed Services Committee, and supported fully by Senator John \nWarner, who himself was a veteran and served at the time of World War \nII, who agreed with him that we ought to show our displeasure. There \nwasn't anything radical in it. We weren't calling the other side names. \nWe just said we want to stop this escalation. We don't want to put more \ntroops out there in harm's way. We don't want to see more limbless \nveterans. We have almost 800 now, veterans who have lost one limb at \nleast, and we have 25,000 who have been injured. And there are a lot of \nsevere injuries that you can't see because they are internal injuries. \nThey are injuries of the mind. They are injuries of the spirit. There \nare a lot of them; 30,000 with PTS, post-traumatic stress, in addition \nto those who have the physical, visible wounds we see.\n\n  So we want to get on with the vote. Let us have an honest count here \nabout whether you are for escalation or\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nagainst it. Do you want to throw more into the Iraqi war? Do you want \nto put more sons and daughters there or do you want them to start \ncoming home and reuniting them with their families? That is the \nquestion. Instead, it is dressed up here. If we voted to adjourn, it \nwould be a sign that we are not supporting the troops. Baloney. We \nsupport the troops fully. Each and every one of them over there now is \na hero to us, each and every one, because many of them disagree with \nthe policy that got them there, the falsification of whether there were \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes in morning business \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask further unanimous consent that the additional time \nof the Senator not be charged against the minority. It was our time. I \nwant to be sure his time is not charged against the minority so we can \nfinish morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank our colleague from Minnesota.\n  What we see is a deliberate attempt to avoid the question: Yes or no, \nhow do you stand on the escalation of this war? How do you stand on \nsending more sons and daughters into that hell on Earth?\n  It is time to stand up and be counted and not to permit the public, \nacross this land of ours, to be fooled by debate structures, by \ndelaying tactics. It is time to stand up and be counted, but we cannot \ndo that. The other side will not permit us to do it, and we know how to \ncount votes so we know we do not have enough to do what we would like \nto.\n  But the House has taken the bull by the horns. The House is \nconsidering it, and it is very favorably being considered there--not \nyet voted--legislation that says we are against this escalation. \nRepublicans as well as Democrats there are going to join. What we are \nsaying here is let us simply vote on that. That is what has been asked \nfor by our leadership.\n  I hope we will be able to conclude this debate, find out and let the \nAmerican people know where we stand, each one of us. When we raise our \nhand, each one of us will be making a declaration: Do we think it is \nnecessary to put more of our troops out there, to run them through \nthere at the risk of their limbs, or lives, and disrupt family life, \nleaving children without a guiding parent on one side, to let the bills \naccumulate, worry about the mortgages? These are people, for the most \npart, who were reservists. They have served once, served twice--a year \neach--and now a third callup is being talked about because the \nPresident has decided--against the will of many outstanding military \nexperts, those who have served at the highest rank. They say no, it \nwill not help. But the President of the United States is very stubborn \non this issue, despite all of the opposition--opposition here, \nopposition across this country. The numbers are around 70 percent of \nthe people do not want us to continue to do this, or send in any more \ntroops. I hope we can resolve the truth here in short order.\n  I yield the floor with thanks again to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I intend to speak in morning business and \nto talk about an issue of great importance in Minnesota, access to \nhealth care in rural communities, but I have to make one comment in \nresponse to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Iraq is the most important issue facing America today. There is no \nquestion about it. I want to raise some concerns about the surge in \nBaghdad. I understand we are fighting a war against insurgency and \nforeign fighters in Anbar Province. If those commanders on the ground \nneed more, I am going to give it to them. I have great concerns about \nthe surge. We need to debate this. It is absolutely mind boggling to \nwatch what is going on with this playing around with rules. The bottom \nline is Senators should have the right to debate. Senators should have \nthe right to offer amendments and we should be voting on whether you \nsupport a surge, we should be voting on whether you support continued \nfunding, we should be voting on whether there should be benchmarks. We \nshould do what the Senate does, which is debate, have discussion, and \nthen vote. What the majority is attempting to do is to forestall that, \noffering something that they know is something the Senate does not do, \noffering something they know the American public--the public wants us \nto debate this and vote on it. So instead they offer a resolution \nwhich, they know, will gather objection, a resolution on which they \nwill allow no amendments, no discussion about other things other than a \nproposal that comes out from them. That is absurd. That is not the \nSenate. It is not the greatest deliberative body in the world. We \nshould do better. The American public deserves better, and I hope our \nleaders can come together and figure out a way to structure a debate so \nopinions can be laid out and they can be discussed and then we can \nvote--not on one thing that a 51-person majority says, but the way the \nSenate does it: We put it on the table and vote.\n  I may disagree with some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle \non some of that, but everyone has a right to lay out their amendments \nand their proposal, and we should do so on Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2000-S2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Let me focus on an issue of concern to me. I represent \nthe State of Minnesota. They call it the ``flyover country.'' They may \nsay the same thing about Colorado on occasion. I saw a New Yorker's \nview of the world. No offense to my colleagues from New York. It is New \nYork, Florida, L.A., maybe Chicago was in between. I didn't see Denver \nor St. Paul. There are smaller towns on there, but they are on the map \nand they are important.\n  William Jennings Bryan once said:\n\n       Burn down our cities and leave our farmland and the cities \n     will rise up again like magic, but burn down our farms and \n     grass will grow up in the streets of every city in America.\n\n  The Presiding Officer understands that. He comes from a family which \nhas worked the land. He gets that. Like many great orators, there is \nsome hyperbole there, but it still rings true, whether it is food, \nvalues, or leadership--all of America depends on what our rural \ncommunities produce\n  So what happens in America's small towns is a big deal. I would like \nto take this time to speak on behalf of Minnesotans and other folks \nliving in rural communities. These families face some daunting \nchallenges when it comes to accessing health care.\n  The urgency of this issue is brought home to me by the upcoming \nclosure of a rural hospital in Ivanhoe, MN. The town in southwestern \nMinnesota, county seat of Lincoln County, got its name from Sir Walter \nScott's novel. Ivanhoe is filled with hard-working people who have \nsurvived generations of drought, grass hoppers, blizzards, and \nunreliable farm prices and policies. This is yet another difficult \nblow. As a result, this community will lose jobs, access to health care \nand part of their community identity.\n  There is an array of issues facing hospitals like Ivanhoe. For them, \nit was the declining number of admissions at the hospital and declining \nreimbursement payments that put them at a severe competitive \ndisadvantage in the health care market--and ultimately led to the \ndecision. Unfortunately, their story is not unique.\n  About 21 percent of the population lives in rural areas, but only \nabout 9 percent of doctors work there. Only 2.4 percent of specialists \nwork in rural areas.\n  Nearly half of all rural residents have at least one major chronic \nillness. Yet they average fewer physician contacts per year than those \nin urban communities.\n  I believe that access to health care should not be dependent on where \nyou live. Every person in America deserves the same quality care.\n  Unfortunately, as it stands right now, many rural communities in \nMinnesota and across the country don't have the personnel capabilities, \ntechnology or money to provide their residents with the health care \nthey need--\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nthey are getting squeezed at every angle. For the stability of rural \ncommunities and the health of the Americans that live there, we need to \nfind solutions.\n  That is why I am taking this opportunity to introduce a package of \nbills which seek to give rural areas access to some tools they can use \nto promote the health of their communities.\n  The burden of chronic illness is heavier in rural areas. Rural areas \nreport higher rates of chronic diseases, including heart disease and \ncancer.\n  Mental health issues are also significant. For example, a national \nstudy that 41 percent of rural women were depressed or anxious compared \nto less than 20 percent of urban women and that 40 percent of all \nvisits to rural practitioners are due to stress.\n  Providing adequate mental health care in rural communities has become \na national problem.\n  In rural areas, where specialized mental health services are scarce, \naccessing the proper mental health care is difficult. Primary care is \noften the only system for delivering mental health services and \nproviders are seeing an increase in mental health issues in their \nclinics. Today I introduced the Working Together for Rural Access to \nMental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors Act.\n  This legislation would allow Federal grants to be given to States to \nprovide assistance to rural communities to conduct collaborative \nefforts to improve access to mental health care for youth, seniors, and \nfamilies. Grants could go toward operation of mobile mental health \nservices vans or telemental health.\n  Rural residents face serious health care issues not only in terms of \nillness but also in terms of lack of easily accessible services. One in \n5 Americans lives in rural areas but only 1 in 10 physicians practice \nin rural areas. Forty percent of the rural population lives in a \nmedically underserved area.\n  Critical access hospitals are the foundation on which is built the \nhealth of our Nation's rural communities. I don't have the time right \nnow--we are kind of pushing the envelope on morning business--but it is \nimportant that my colleagues understand.\n  The critical access hospital program was enacted as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 in order to preserve access to health care \nservices in rural communities. Critical Access Hospitals represent a \nseparate provider type with its own conditions of participation as well \nas a separate reimbursement method for Medicare.\n  With 80 Critical Access Hospitals in Minnesota, the third largest \nnumber of Critical Access Hospitals in the Nation, this program is of \ncrucial importance to the health care infrastructure of my State. \nMinnesota's Critical Access Hospitals provide care to 1.6 million \npatients a year. They are there to provide health care to their \ncommunities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n  I have visited these hospitals throughout my State and have been \nimpressed time and time again by their commitment to the health of \ntheir communities and their stewardship of the resources that they have \nbeen given. I appreciate the work of the Minnesota Hospital Association \nin representing their Critical Access Hospital members and for being a \ngreat resource in protecting this important program.\n  The Critical Access Hospital program continues to make an important \ninvestment in the safety net of our rural communities.\n  This program has been the single most important factor in helping our \nNation's rural hospitals not only survive also provide new quality \nhealth care services and resources.\n  Without the Critical Access Program, rural communities had been \nhaving a difficult time supporting a local hospital. People were \ndriving hours just to receive basic health care. Just talk to Al Vogt, \nCEO of Cook Hospital & C He will tell you that the Critical Access \nHospital program has preserved care in Cook and many other small \ncommunities across Minnesota. As his community ages, Al has seen many \nseniors have to choose between gas or food money. If leaving town to \nget the very basics of health care was the only option, there are a \nnumber of folks who would forego the needed care. Seniors and others \nliving in rural areas deserve better. Critical Access Hospitals provide \nfor them.\n  Despite the growing disparities in access to health care for \nAmericans in rural areas, support for Critical Access Hospitals has not \nbeen what it should be.\n  Critical Access Hospitals are not being reimbursed in a way that \nallows them to fully account for their costs of offering services. \nThese health providers, already stretched thin, are being asked to \nabsorb the difference.\n  With that in mind, today I introduced the Rural Health Services \nPreservation Act, which ensures that Critical Access Hospitals get \nreimbursed the same amount under Medicare Advantage Programs as they \nwould under Medicare.\n  Right now, interim Critical Access Hospital payments reflect the \nprevious year's costs--not the current year's costs. Factoring in \ninflation and the rapid growth of the medical economy, rural hospitals \nare being left to pay a bill that is much larger than their share.\n  Specifically, my Rural Health Services Preservation Act ensures \nCritical Access Hospitals receive not less than 101 percent of cost for \ninpatient, swing-bed, and outpatient hospital services provided to \nMedicare patients covered under a Medicare Advantage plan.\n  This bill would create certainty in terms of payments, and accurately \nreflect the true cost of health care in our Critical Access Hospitals.\n  Critical Access Hospitals are important regional hubs in rural areas. \nThese hospitals serve as medical homes to the folks that live nearby, \nbut also provide patient care to visitors who are in town to do some \nfishing, camping or hunting. When a critical medical event occurs, it \nis crucial that the physicians who care for a patient have information \nabout their medical history in order to avoid medical errors.\n  Let me tell you a story I heard recently from Lori Wightman, \npresident of the New Ulm Medical Center. Recently, a 55-year-old \narrived in the New Ulm Medical Center emergency room with chest pain. \nHe was having a heart attack. Within 82 minutes this same patient was \nassessed, transported, and had his heart vessel opened at a tertiary \nhospital 100 miles away.\n  This situation was a success because New Ulm Medical Center had the \nability to transmit information about the patient quickly and easily. \nNot all hospitals are fortunate enough to have this vital service.\n  That's why I introduced the Critical Access to Health Information \nTechnology Act to help Critical Access Hospitals compete for Federal \nhealth technology grants. Essentially, this bill would give smaller \nrural hospitals a competitive edge for H-I-T grants.\n  Even when a situation is not immediately life-threatening, technology \ncan play an important role in disease management in rural communities. \nAs I mentioned earlier, rural areas are facing serious personnel \nshortages. They have around 20 percent of the population, and only 10 \npercent of the docs and only 2.4 percent of the specialists.\n  Remote monitoring technologies collect, analyze, and transmit \nclinical health information. These technologies are emerging to extend \nthe provision of health care services to areas where there is a \nshortage of physicians or where patients are homebound. Essentially, \nthese technologies allow physicians to monitor and treat patients \nwithout a face-to-face office visit, thereby increasing access to \nphysicians for patients living in rural areas. We have the ability \ntoday, if you simply lift up the phone the doctor can tell what your \nblood pressure is and how you are feeling. Minnesota prides itself as \nbeing the center of medical technology. We have the Medronics, Boston \nScientific, St. Jude's cardiac pacemakers--we can do a lot with remote \naccess technology. We have to make sure it is in our rural communities.\n  For that reason, I also introduced the Remote Monitoring Access Act, \nwhich would allow Medicare to cover physician services involved with \nthe remote management of specific medical conditions, such as \ncongestive heart failure and diabetes.\n  Specifically, my bill would create a new benefit category for remote \npatient management services in the Medicare physician fee schedule. \nUnder this category, Medicare would cover physician services involved \nwith the remote management of specific medical conditions.\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\n  Not only are physicians in short supply in many of rural communities, \nbut other health professionals are as well. That is why I introduced \ntoday a bill that focuses specifically on issues related to increasing \nnursing faculty. I am told by my friends in nursing that the problem is \nnot that people don't want to go into nursing, but that it is difficult \nto get nurses to leave the clinic to spend time in the classroom.\n  Personnel is one piece of the puzzle and building up our health care \ninstitutions in rural area is another.\n  The Critical Access Hospital program has provided financial stability \nto many struggling rural hospitals that are the cornerstones of their \ncommunities. It is essential that Congress protects this program now \nand into the future. Prior to this program, hospital closures were \ncommon and the rural health care system was fragile.\n  Without the Critical Access Hospital program and support for rural \nproviders, there would be a floodgate of small community care systems \nclosing and potentially converting many small towns into ghost towns.\n  Debra Boardman, president and CEO of the Riverview Healthcare \nAssociation in Crookston has shared her story with me:\n\n       The Critical Access Hospital program has afforded many \n     rural hospitals the opportunity to modernize their facilities \n     and helps assure they will remain viable and accessible to \n     the residents of rural America. Prior to receiving Critical \n     Access Hospital designation in 2001, RiverView Healthcare \n     Association had not done a major building project since 1976. \n     With this designation we were able to afford to physically \n     restructure our building and update our infrastructure to \n     accommodate the way health care is provided in the 21st \n     Century.\n       Since that time we have also been able to add new \n     physicians, vital new health care services and programs. As \n     the largest employer in the county, a secondary benefit of \n     the program is that it has made RiverView Healthcare \n     Association a more secure economic engine for our local rural \n     community.\n\n  Because of the important role that Critical Access Hospitals play in \ncommunity stability, I have introduced a bill to provide direct and \nguaranteed loans to complete the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nthe Nation's Rural Critical Access Hospitals within the 5 years covered \nby the new farm bill.\n  In more ways than we can possibly measure, rural communities are the \nheart of America. They provide us with food, energy and more \nimportantly the values and leadership that keep our Nation on track. \nJust as we care for our bodily heart, we need to care for our spiritual \nheart in rural America or the whole Nation will suffer.\n  That is why my legislation attempts to raise the needs of our small \ntown neighbors to become a national priority. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to consider joining me in ensuring that every American has \naccess to the care that they need to lead healthy and productive lives. \nI invite you to cosponsor one of my seven bills aimed at doing just \nthat.\n  From birth, through chronic disease management, to end-of-life care \nCritical Access Hospitals meet the health-care needs of our \ncommunities. And our communities trust that we will continue to do so \nfar into the future.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

It is something \nthat shouldn't be drug out, but I don't think asking for three, or four \neven, amendments to this resolution is something that would drag it out \nbecause that is what allows full discussion, and we certainly need a \nfull discussion on the record on the ways forward.\n  I think it is also appropriate for us to do that in light of the \ndivision of powers between the executive and legislative branches. The \nPresident is the Commander in Chief, and he or she must move forward in \nthat capacity. We are the funding arm, the legislative body. We are \nentitled to put forward our ideas, but there is one Commander in Chief. \nI think it is important we have this discussion to put forward our \nideas, but it needs to be a full discussion of the ideas.\n  I would urge the Democratic leader, the majority leader, to bring \nthis issue forward in a way that we could debate various options. I \nhave been in this body certainly during debate on contentious issues \nwherein we are given different viewpoints to allow people to vote, and \non one that is so important and so critical, I think it is important \nfor us to have multiple viewpoints put forward. So even as one who does \nnot support the troop surge, which I don't believe is the wise route to \ngo, I believe this body should have options.\n  I would not support a cloture motion that says we will only have one \noption to vote on. I don't think that is a fair or an appropriate \nprocess for this body to follow. I think it is important that we have a \nfull debate on the full range of issues.\n  My goodness, for us to take a couple of weeks to discuss this would \nnot be inappropriate, given the importance and the magnitude and the \nseriousness of the moment.\n  I support the troops. We all support the troops, and we need to \nsupport the troops in the field. That doesn't mean we can't have a \ndebate, but it also doesn't mean we should be limited to just one \nthought that we can have to vote on. We should have a multiple set of \nideas, fully vetted and fully discussed.\n  As I have traveled across this country and in my home State, this is \none subject about which people have a lot of different viewpoints and a \nlot of different ideas. Everybody supports the troops, but they may not \nagree with how the war is proceeding. They think there ought to be \nother tactics employed, and they want viewpoints expressed. I think \nthat is fully appropriate. I think the President invites us to, in \nresponsible ways, bring these ideas and viewpoints forward. But you \ndon't do that with having just one viewpoint and that is it; one vote \nand you can't have an option; one proposal without amendments, when \nthere is a full debate and discussion that is needed on this topic.\n  So I want to voice my opinion on this issue; that is, I think the way \nforward is for us to engage in the full process that the Senate is \nfully capable of doing and desirous of doing. I think it would be \nimportant as well to our troops in the field to have a full debate on \nthis topic. I hope that we do that, and we could start engaging in it \nnow rather than putting it off and delaying it further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2002-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2002-S2003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE NORWOOD\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on one other \nissue aside from the war effort, as that is the one that really needs \nto, and does, occupy our time. But a good friend of mine has just \nrecently passed away, Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie and I came \nin together in the House of Representatives in the 1994 election cycle. \nHe recently passed away due to complications in his liver from a long \nbattle that he had with pulmonary fibrosis and the difficulties that he \nhad.\n  His legislative accomplishments are significant, and those are in the \nRecord and well known. What I want to talk about is the person because \nhe was a beautiful man. He served in Vietnam as a dentist. He had this \nbeautiful, folksy way of presenting a tough topic. He would boil down \nthe essence of a difficult topic in a folksy sentence or two, and you \nwould listen to it and you would say: You know, I think that is about \naccurate.\n  He could take difficult things and boil them down. He cared a lot \nabout health care issues, and he worked a lot\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\non health care issues. What I remember is a kindly gentleman who was \nvery active and involved in the issues of the day and who cared about \nother people. He taught adult Sunday school classes. He worked as a \nsmall businessman. He was a dedicated public servant, even as he felt \nthat the Government had grown too big and was taking over too much \nauthority.\n  It reminds me that, as we leave these places--and we all will--when \nyou look back on it, there is a legislative career, and there are a \nnumber of legislative items that each of us are associated with, and \nthe cares and concerns and the passions that we have of the day, but \nthere is also a person who is there, and the soul and the character of \nthat individual. In this case, Dr. Charlie Norwood had a beautiful \nsoul. He was someone who touched people in a positive way. I am not \nsure you can say a lot more at the end of our days than that.\n  Congressman Norwood is survived by his wife Gloria, sons Charles and \nCarlton Norwood, and grandchildren, all of Augusta.\n  During his life, Norwood has served as a Member of Congress, longtime \npatients' and individual rights champion, dentist, Vietnam veteran, and \nsmall businessman.\n  Norwood, a seven-term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives \nfrom 1995 to 2007, served most of east Georgia at some point during his \ncongressional career due to redistricting in 1996, 2002, and 2006. He \nwon re-election every year since 1998 by landslide margins, and was \nelected to the 110th Congress in November by a 68 percent margin. His \n10th District seat will be filled in a special election to be scheduled \nby Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue.\n  Norwood achieved national recognition after introducing the first \ncomprehensive managed health care reform legislation to Congress in \n1995, which subsequently passed the House of Representatives in both \n1999 and 2001. Norwood's Patient's Bill of Rights legislation became a \nkey issue in the 2000 presidential election, and will likely be revived \nin the 110th Congress.\n  Norwood was instrumental in health care reform for military retirees \nand veterans as well as patients-at-large. The former Army dentist was \nco-author of the Keep Our Promises to Military Retirees Act in 1999, \nwhich provided fully funded health care for life for the Nation's \nmilitary retirees. The majority of the bill was enacted as part of the \nDefense Authorization Act of 2000.\n  In addition to his longtime national advocacy for patients, Norwood \nsucceeded in passing reforms across a broad range of public policy \nareas, spanning education, private property rights, telecommunications, \nand environmental regulations.\n  Norwood is further recognized as the father of the Nation's current \nClass A broadcast television service, by authoring and passing into law \nthe Community Broadcasting Protection Act in 1998.\n  In congressional oversight action, Norwood played a key role in the \n1996-1998 Teamster's investigation, the 1998-2002 investigations of \ntheft and fraud at the U.S. Department of Education, and the \nimpeachment of former President Bill Clinton in 1998.\n  Norwood received a bachelor's degree from Georgia Southern University \nin Statesboro in 1964, and a doctorate in dental surgery from \nGeorgetown University Dental School in Washington, DC, in 1967, where \nhe was elected president of the Dental School Student Body in his \nsenior year. He married the former Gloria Wilkinson of Valdosta in 1962 \nwhile attending Georgia Southern.\n  After dental school, he volunteered for the U. S. Army and served as \na captain in the Dental Corps from 1967 to 1969, beginning with an \nassignment to the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in \nAlbuquerque, NM. In 1968 he was transferred to the Medical Battalion of \nthe 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam, and served a combat tour at Quin \nYon, An Khe, and LZ English at Bon Son. In recognition of his service \nunder combat conditions, he was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and \ntwo Bronze Stars.\n  After Vietnam, he was assigned to the Dental Corps at Fort Gordon, \nGA, where he served until his discharge in 1969. Norwood was awarded \nthe Association of the United States Army Cocklin Award in 1998, and \nwas inducted into the Association's Audie Murphy Society in 1999. He \nremained a lifelong member of the American Legion, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and the Military Order of the World Wars.\n  Dr. Norwood began private practice dentistry in Augusta immediately \nafter his discharge. During his dental career, he served as president \nof the Georgia Dental Association and was a delegate to the American \nDental Association.\n  In addition to his dental practice, Norwood also founded Northwoods \nNursery in Evans, providing trees and shrubs to wholesale outlets \nthroughout the Central Savannah River Area, and Augusta Dental \nLaboratory, which manufactured dental devices for patients.\n  He became a stalwart supporter of small business and property rights \ninterests in Congress, receiving the 1995 Fighting Frosh award of the \nUnited States Business and Industrial Council, the Guardian of Senior's \nRights Award of the 60 Plus Association, the Friend of the Family Award \nof the Christian Coalition, the Friend of the Taxpayer Award of \nAmericans for Tax Reform, the Guardian of Small Business Award of the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Spirit of Enterprise \nAward of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Thomas Jefferson Award of \nthe U.S. Food Service Council, the Champion of Property Rights Award of \nthe League of Private Property Owners, the Taxpayer's Hero Award of the \nCouncil for Citizens Against Government Waste, and the Taxpayer's \nFriend Award of National Taxpayers Union.\n  Dr. Norwood and his wife Gloria were longtime members of and taught \nadult Sunday school at Trinity-on-the-Hill United Methodist Church in \nAugusta. He was also a past board member of the Augusta Opera Society \nand a member of the Augusta Symphony Guild.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if the Chair would please let me know \nwhen I have a minute left.\n  Mr. President, when we come back from the recess we are going to turn \nour attention to the 9/11 Commission recommendations which have been \nenacted by the House. I want to discuss an issue I hope will come up \nwhen we discuss the 9/11 Commission recommendations and that has to do \nwith the so-called REAL ID card, the de facto national ID card.\n  This is a law that was enacted in early 2005. It was House-passed \nlegislation that would require States to turn more than 190 million \ndriver's licenses into de facto national identification cards, with \nState taxpayers paying most of the costs. I am not very much of a \nprognosticator. My predictions have never been all that accurate, but \nat the time of that passage, I objected to it.\n  The first thing wrong with the REAL ID law was that the House stuck \nthe law into an appropriations bill that supported our troops in Iraq \nand sent it over to the Senate. None of us wanted to slow down support \nfor our troops in Iraq while we debated ID cards, so it was stuck in \nthere and we passed it. But the second and larger problem with what the \nHouse did 2 years ago, and which we agreed to and it became law, is \nthat States not only got to create the ID cards, but they will likely \nend up paying the bill. I said to my colleagues, and at that time we \nhad a Republican Congress: This is one more of the unfunded Federal \nmandates we Republicans promised to end.\n  Well, now we have moved ahead about 2 years, and I believe I have\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nturned out to be right about that. Just last month, the Maine \nLegislature became the first State to approve a resolution urging \nCongress to overturn the Real ID Act before it takes effect on the \nStates in May of 2008. Only 4 of the 186 Maine lawmakers voted no. In \nthe following other States there are bills, according to USA Today, \nthat are considering asking us to overturn the law: Hawaii, Georgia, \nMassachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Vermont, and Washington.\n  One reason they are asking us to overturn it is that according to the \nNational Governors Association, implementing the law will cost more \nthan $11 billion over 5 years. We have provided $40 million of the $11 \nbillion. That is an enormous unfunded Federal mandate.\n  The Presiding Officer is a former State official. I don't know if he \nhad these same feelings when he was in his State of Colorado, but \nnothing used to make me madder when I was Governor of Tennessee than \nfor some group of Congressmen to come up with a big idea, turn it into \nlaw, hold a big press conference, take credit for it, and send the bill \nto the States to pay for it. Then that same Congressman would usually \nbe back home making a Lincoln Day speech, bragging about local control.\n  I am afraid that is what we have with REAL ID. It sounds pretty good \nmaybe to say: Oh, we have a war against terrorism, and we have illegal \nimmigration and other immigration issues. We need some sort of \nidentification card that will make it possible to do a better job of \nfighting terrorists and impose the rule of law on our border. That \nsounds good, but there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do \nit.\n\n  Here is what we should have done and what I hope we will do. I hope \nthe week after next, when Senator Collins of Maine comes to the Senate, \nwhich I hope she will, and offers an amendment that will, in effect, \nset up a thoughtful process for, first, delaying the implementation of \nthis bill and, second, give us a chance to consider all of its \nramifications, I hope we will adopt that as part of the 9/11 Commission \nReport. In other words, give the idea of a national identification card \nthe kind of thoughtful attention it deserves in the Senate.\n  No. 1, we should do it because it is a huge break with our tradition \nof liberty in this country. We do not have to look very far around the \nworld--South Africa is the first place to look--to see the abuse a \nnational identification card can cause. In South Africa, it was used to \nclassify people according to race. Everybody had to have one. Everybody \nhad to carry it around.\n  In this age of technology in a country that values liberty above \neverything else, there are a lot of questions about whether we should \nhave a national ID card. Those ought to be explored in the Senate. We \nought not push one through in a bill no one wants to vote against \nbecause it is primarily about supporting troops.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, I twice vetoed the photo driver's \nlicense which we all now carry around in our pockets. I did that, \nfirst, because I thought it was an infringement upon civil liberties; \nand, second, I did it because I thought what would happen was we would \nhave lines around the block of people waiting to get their photo ID \ncard--and that still happens sometimes--but I was gradually overruled \nby the State legislature and we got an ID card.\n  What helped getting overruled was when I showed up at the White House \nonce to see the President at the National Governor's Conference and \nthey asked to see my photo ID. I said: I don't have one. They asked: \nWhy not? I said: Because I vetoed it. And I had to be vouched for by \nthe Governor of Georgia. The push for this was law enforcement saying \nit would help with check cashing and other identification.\n\n       While as a liberty-loving country, we say we do not want a \n     national ID card, at the same time, we have allowed a de \n     facto national ID card. That is a State driver's license. We \n     have over 190 million of these. We all know the de facto \n     driver's license ID cards are very ineffective. They are \n     easily duplicated, they are often stolen, and we go around \n     not just using them to prove we can drive, but we use them to \n     get on airplanes, we use them to cash checks, and we use them \n     to get a passport. They are not an effective ID card.\n\n  I have reluctantly come to my conclusion. Despite the fact I vetoed \nthose early ID cards, on September 11, one way our world has changed is \nwe do need a national ID card. Maybe our discussion in committees would \nshow we do not want one but that we want authorized two or three forms \nof identification cards which meet certain standards which can be used \nfor different ways.\n  For example, there could be a travel card that one could use to get \non an airplane. If you had that travel card that allowed you to get on \nthe airplane, you might use it for other purposes, as we have come to \nuse the driver's licenses in that way or we might use the passport. \nAbout a quarter of Americans have passports, 68 million Americans. That \nis one form of an ID card though not as common as 196 million driver's \nlicenses. There is also the Social Security card. My initial instinct \nis that a Social Security card that had the proper technology attached \nto it would be the wisest, the most effective, and most useful ID card \nbecause most of the immigration problems we have are related to work, \neither as a student or as a worker. It would be natural to have an ID \ncard, to have a Social Security card such as the card we carry around \nin our pockets that also serves as a de facto national ID card.\n  There was a case of the Swift Company, which was using, under our \nantiquated immigration laws, the basic pilot program, which is what we \nsay to businesses to use if we want them to do everything they can to \nmake sure they are only hiring people legally in the United States. \nSwift and other companies do that. Even if they do that, they cannot be \nassured that the people they are hiring are legally here because many \nof the Social Security numbers have been stolen, as it turns out, and \nit is against our laws to inquire too far into someone who applies for \na job and presents evidence they are a citizen. Our laws say you cannot \nask more questions to second-guess that.\n  We have some work to do. All of us who think about the immigration \nissue--which is what brought all this up, along with the September 11 \ndisaster--we think of the immigration issue and we think of the need \nfor employer verification. For employers in this country to verify that \npeople they hire are legally here, we are going to have to supply those \nemployers, in some way, with the ability to ask for a good \nidentification card. Perhaps it is the Social Security card, perhaps it \nis a travel card, perhaps it is a passport, perhaps it is a bank card, \nmaybe there are two or three of those. That might be a way to avoid \nhaving a single card and could diminish the concern about civil \nliberties. Or maybe the needed ID is the driver's license, but I doubt \nit is the driver's license.\n  Certainly, we should not expect the men and women in the Tennessee \nDepartment of Public Safety who are in charge of issuing a few million \ndriver's licenses, to be turned into CIA agents whose job it is to \ncatch terrorists. I don't think they are expected to do that. They are \nnot prepared to do that.\n\n  What we will be requiring is the citizens of the various States to \nshow up to get their driver's license or a renewal with different forms \nof identification, some of which they may not have. It will be a very \nexpensive process and a big mess. My first impression is that the State \ndriver's license system is not the best place to look if we want to \ncreate an identification card.\n  Here is my suggestion. My suggestion is we pay close attention to the \nSenator from Maine, Susan Collins, when we come back after the recess. \nShe has a thoughtful recommendation to the Senate which suggests, over \nthe next couple of years, we have time to look at this issue of whether \nwe need a national identification card and what kind of identification \ncard we might need. I hope the hearings would be held this year in the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee or whatever the appropriate committees might be, and then we \nmight deal with this issue in the immigration bill which I hope we pass \nthis year.\n  We need a comprehensive immigration bill. That bill needs to have an \nemployer verification system. I don't see how we can have an employer \nverification system without a good form of identification card. I hope \nwe will deal with this in the way the Senate normally deals with \nissues; that is, through its committees, considering all\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\nof the options. In the meantime, we have the Real ID law in place with \nthe estimate that it may cost up to $11 billion, a huge unfunded \nmandate. We have States saying we are going to opt out of that program. \nIf they do, that means the citizens of Maine or Montana or some other \nState will not be allowed to fly on airplanes, for example, because \nthey will not be from a State that has an approved ID card. That will \ncreate a lot more confusion and a lot more angry constituents.\n  I am here today to wave a yellow flag, to remind Members of the Real \nID issue. It may not be part of the 9/11 Commission recommendation when \nthey come to the floor, but it is relevant and certainly germane. I \nhope the Senator from Maine will provoke a discussion of it, and we \nwill move to delay its implementation until we can think this through \nand do it right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article I \nwrote for the Washington Post on Wednesday, March 30, 2005, about the \nReal ID and my views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 30, 2005]\n\n                Much as I Hate It, We Need a National ID\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       The House recently passed legislation requiring states to \n     turn 190 million driver's licenses into national ID cards, \n     with state taxpayers paying most of the cost.\n       The first thing wrong here is that the House stuck the ID \n     card proposal on the appropriations bill that supports troops \n     in Iraq and sent it over to the Senate. We should not slow \n     down money for our troops while we debate ID cards.\n       The second problem is that states not only get to create \n     these ID cards, they'll likely end up paying the bill. This \n     is one more of the unfunded federal mandates that we \n     Republicans promised to stop.\n       Supporters argue that this is no mandate because states \n     have a choice. True, states may refuse to conform to the \n     proposed federal standards and issue licenses to whomever \n     they choose, including illegal immigrants--but if they do, \n     that state's licenses will not be accepted for ``federal \n     purposes,'' such as boarding an airplane. Some choice. What \n     governor will deny his or her citizens the identification \n     they need to travel by air and cash Social Security checks, \n     or for ``other federal purposes?''\n       Of course, the ID card may still backfire on Congress. Some \n     feisty governor may say, ``Who are these people in Washington \n     telling us what to do with our drivers' licenses and making \n     us pay for them, too? California will use its licenses for \n     certifying drivers, and Congress can create its own ID card \n     for people who want to fly and do other federally regulated \n     things--and if they do not, I will put on the Internet the \n     home telephone numbers of all the congressmen.''\n       If just one state refused to do the federal government's ID \n     work, Congress would be forced to create what it claims to \n     oppose--a federal ID card for citizens of that state.\n       Finally, if we must have a better ID card for some federal \n     purposes, then there are better ideas than turning state \n     driver's license examiners into CIA agents. Congress might \n     create an airline traveler's card. Or there could be an \n     expanded use of U.S. passports. Since a motive here is to \n     discourage illegal immigration, probably the most logical \n     idea is to upgrade the Social Security card, which directly \n     relates to the reason most immigrants come to the United \n     States: to work.\n       I have fought government ID cards as long and as hard as \n     anyone. In 1983, when I was governor of Tennessee, our \n     legislature voted to put photographs on driver's licenses. \n     Merchants and policemen wanted a state ID card to discourage \n     check fraud and teenage drinking. I vetoed this photo \n     driver's license bill twice because I believed driver's \n     licenses should be about driving and that state ID cards \n     infringed on civil liberties.\n       That same year, on a visit to the White House, when a guard \n     asked for my photo ID, I said, ``We don't have them in \n     Tennessee. I vetoed them.'' The guard said, ``You can't get \n     in without one.'' The governor of Georgia, who had his photo \n     ID driver's license, vouched for me. I was admitted to the \n     White House, the legislature at home overrode my veto and I \n     gave up my fight against a state ID card.\n       For years state driver's licenses have served as de facto \n     national ID cards. They have been unreliable. All but one of \n     the Sept. 11 terrorists had a valid driver's license. Even \n     today, when I board an airplane, security officials look at \n     the front of my driver's license, which expired in 2000, and \n     rarely turn it over to verify that it has been extended until \n     2005.\n       I still detest the idea of a government ID card. South \n     Africa's experience is a grim reminder of how such documents \n     can be abused. But I'm afraid this is one of the ways Sept. \n     11 has changed our lives. Instead of pretending we are not \n     creating national ID cards when we obviously are, Congress \n     should carefully create an effective federal document that \n     helps prevent terrorism--with as much respect for privacy as \n     possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2005-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2005-S2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SENATOR KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, President John F. Kennedy was fond of \nquoting the Biblical passage of the New Testament:\n\n       For unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much \n     required.\n\n  That was quoted from the 12th chapter of the Gospel of St. Luke, \nverse 48, the King James version.\n  When I think of that passage, I think of the life, the career, and \nthe accomplishments thus far of my dear friend, my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, who will turn 75 years old--Oh, to be \n75 again--he will turn 75 years old, on February 22. The Senate will be \nout of session on February 22.\n  When Ted Kennedy came to the Senate in 1962, I would already have \nbeen here 4 years. So when he, Ted Kennedy, came to the Senate in 1962, \nmuch had already been given to Senator Ted Kennedy. He had been born \ninto a wealthy and remarkably, remarkably talented family. His father, \na financial genius, had been an Ambassador to England--think of that, \nAmbassador to England--and the very first Commissioner of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n\n  One of his brothers, one of Ted Kennedy's brothers, had been a \nSenator--I can see him now, as it were--and was then President of the \nUnited States, but had been a Senator. Another brother was the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, and would eventually join Ted in the \nSenate in 1965.\n  As for Senator Edward ``Ted'' Kennedy, himself, he had attended two \nof our country's premier educational institutions, Harvard College, \nand, yes, the University of Virginia. And he, Ted Kennedy, had already \naccumulated a lifetime of political experience by the tender age of 30 \nwhen he came to this Senate. How remarkable--just burst upon the \nlandscape. I remember. Therefore, as the Scripture tells us, we had a \nright to expect much from Ted Kennedy when he came to the Senate. We \nhad a right to expect much. What about our expectations? He delivered. \nHe delivered.\n  In the Senate, Ted Kennedy became the heart and the conscience, yes, \nof American liberalism. And he has been one of the most effective--I \nknow. I have been here. I have watched him. I did not particularly like \nhim at the beginning. He did not like me. Each of us knew that. We did \nnot care who else knew it. It did not matter.\n  In the Senate, Senator Kennedy became the heart and the conscience of \nAmerican liberalism. He has been one of the most effective national \nlegislators--read the Record; read the history of the Senate--he has \nbeen one of the most effective national legislators of the 20th \ncentury. And as one who knows something about American history and the \nhistory of the Senate, he has been one of the most effective national \nlegislators of all time in the Senate. I have not lived all time, but I \nknow something about all time. I know something about the Senate and \nknow something about the history of the Senate.\n  Ted Kennedy has been one of the most effective national legislators \nof the 20th century or of all time as far as this Republic stands. His \nimprint is on nearly every piece of progressive legislation crafted \nduring the past 45 years. I will read that again. I want to make sure I \nbelieve that myself. His imprint is on nearly every piece of \nprogressive legislation crafted during the past 45 years: the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA; the Voting Rights Act; the \nAge Discrimination Act; the Freedom of Information Act; the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act; health care reform; increases in the Federal \nminimum wage. These are but a few of his, Ted Kennedy's, legislative \nmonuments. Additionally, he has been among those few at the very \nforefront of promoting women's rights and women's equality.\n  He, Edward M. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, is the Senate's Mr. Health Care. \nHe is the Senate's Mr. Civil Rights, to a great extent. He is the \nSenate's Mr. Human Rights. As his Senate record reveals, Senator \nKennedy is a man--a Senator--of remarkable compassion, who has labored \nmightily on behalf of his fellow citizens.\n  Although born to a life of privilege, Ted Kennedy has dedicated his \nlife--if\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nI ever saw a dedication to public service--dedicated his life to public \nservice.\n  Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, has spent more than half of \nhis life in the Senate. I have done that, too. I was just contemplating \nand figuring in my head. Yes, that is a long time. He has spent more \nthan half of his life in the Senate, yes. Yes, I have spent more than \nhalf of mine, but I am not the subject of this.\n  He, Ted Kennedy, is now second in seniority in the Senate. He, Ted \nKennedy, is the third longest serving Senator in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n  As I wish my dear friend Ted Kennedy the happiest of birthdays, \nperhaps I should point out that our relationship--his and mine--did not \nbegin--I think I have already hinted at that--on the friendliest of \nterms. I first encountered Ted Kennedy during the bitter and famous \n1960 West Virginia Democratic primary. Ted Kennedy was in the State \nhelping his brother John F. Kennedy, who was running for President. I, \nRobert C. Byrd, was supporting the other guy.\n  In 1971, he, Ted Kennedy, was running for reelection to his position \nas the Senate Democratic whip. Again, I supported the other guy--me.\n  In 1976, I was running for the position of Senate majority leader. \nThis time, he, Ted Kennedy, was supporting the other guy.\n  This hardly seemed the beginning of a beautiful relationship, but it \nwas.\n  During our service together in the Senate, I came to admire Ted \nKennedy--yes, I came to admire him--as a dedicated Senator of \nincredible tenacity and admirable legislative skills. I found him to be \nan indefatigable worker who could accomplish, yes, what seemed to be \nlegislative miracles. Sometimes they were.\n  I, personally, will always be grateful for the support, the \nunstinting support, that Senator Ted Kennedy gave to me during the \nyears that it was my privilege to serve, yes, serve as the Senate \nDemocratic leader. And I was. I was the leader, the Senate Democratic \nleader. When times got tough, as they sometimes do for a Senate leader, \nI knew that I could always count--I could always count; yes, even \nwithout asking him, I knew where he stood--I could always count on him. \nIt may have been a needed vote. It may have been his assistance in \nbuilding support for a legislative proposal. Whatever was needed, he, \nEdward M. Kennedy, Ted, was there. He was there, he was always there \nfor me, and I am grateful. As a result, our friendship has developed \nand strengthened.\n\n  Today I am proud to call Ted Kennedy one of my best and dearest \nfriends. I have to say he is my best and dearest friend. I will always \nvalue his friendship. I especially appreciate the way he has extended \nthat friendship not only to me but also to all the people of West \nVirginia. And he did much of that before he became a friend of mine.\n  I close this brief statement about admiration for Ted Kennedy with \nthese words:\n\n     ``How far away is the temple of fame?''\n     Said a youth at the dawn of the day.\n     He toiled and strove for a deathless name;\n     The hours went by and the evening came,\n     Leaving him old and feeble and lame,\n     To plod on his cheerless way.\n\n     ``How far away is the temple of good?''\n     Said another youth at the dawn of the day.\n     He toiled in the spirit of brotherhood,\n     To help and succor as best he could\n     The poor and unfortunate multitude,\n     In its hard and cheerless way.\n\n     He was careless alike of praise or blame,\n     But after his work was done,\n     An angel of glory from heaven came\n     To write on high his immortal name,\n     And to proclaim the truth that the temple of fame\n     And the temple of good are one.\n\n     For this is the lesson that history\n     Has taught since the world began;\n     That those whose memories never die,\n     But shine like stars in the human sky,\n     And brighter glow as the years go by,\n     Are the men who live for man.\n\n  Senator Ted Kennedy is a public servant. He is a dedicated \nlegislator. He is a great Senator of our times who endeavors to live \nfor his fellow man.\n  Happy birthday, Ted Kennedy. God bless you. Because of you, we are a \nbetter country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of three Montanans, \nthree true public servants and American heroes who passed away last \nweek in my home State of Montana.\n  Today, Senator Baucus and I grieve with the city of Great Falls and \nthe State of Montana. I ask that we keep the families of the three \nvictims of a Mercy Flight air ambulance crash in our thoughts and \nprayers. Their colleagues at Benefis Hospital in Great Falls and across \nmy State are mourning, remembering, and honoring the lives of Vince \nKirol, Darcy Dengel, and Paul Erickson.\n  Vince, Darcy, and Paul died when their plane went down on a routine \nflight from Great Falls to Bozeman Tuesday night to pick up a patient. \nI ask that we in this body hold these three in highest esteem as public \nservants who selflessly risked their own lives to help others.\n  Vince Kirol was a pilot for 40 years. He flew for Mercy Flight the \nlast 12 of those years. Vince has left an everlasting footprint on \nMontana.\n  Darcy Dengel, a registered flight nurse, was only 27 years of age. \nShe was engaged to be married to a Great Falls police officer. Darcy \nwill not be forgotten.\n  Paul Erickson was a Great Falls firefighter and paramedic. We will \nnever forget the service Paul left behind. It has changed lives \nforever.\n  In this body, we speak often of the value of public service. These \nthree Montanans lived it every day. Too often, we are reminded of the \nsacrifices of our first responders, firefighters, police officers, \nnurses, and doctors. I ask my colleagues and all Americans to take a \nmoment, when we can, to thank those who put their lives on the line \nserving this country at home. We owe them so much.\n  With great respect for these fine three Montanans, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Four years ago, as we all know too well, we sent our young \nmen and women to Iraq for a war that many of us now believe was a grave \nand tragic mistake. Day after day, month after month, the \nadministration has repeatedly exacerbated that mistake by leaving our \nsoldiers in the field without the equipment and without the protection \nthey need and deserve, knowing full well what the lethal consequences \nwould be.\n  There will be and there is disagreement in this body over the next \ndifficult steps to take in Iraq. We can disagree on troop numbers. We \ncan disagree on a timetable. We can disagree on the shape of a future \npolitical settlement in Iraq. Surely, we can all recognize those are \nhonest differences of opinion. But there is no difference of opinion \nand there is no disagreement here that we ought to be giving our troops \nabsolutely everything they need in order to accomplish this mission. \nThere is no disagreement that those troops deserve everything they need \nto be as safe as possible, and there should be no disagreement that \nwhen we ask young men and women to leave their families to fight deadly \nforeign enemies halfway across the globe, when we ask them to put their \nlives on the line, the least we owe them is the equipment they need to \nprotect themselves and get the job done. One soldier dying from a \nroadside bomb because he or she does not have the body armor is one too \nmany.\n  The fact is, when it comes to body armor, when it comes to armored \nvehicles in Iraq, our troops do not have\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nwhat they need. According to the Washington Post this week, our \nsoldiers are short more than 4,000 of the latest humvee armor kit, the \nFRAG Kit 5. Fewer than half of the Army's 14,500 up-armored HMMWVs in \nIraq and Afghanistan have the latest equipment. As Lieutenant General \nStevens, the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Force Development, said:\n\n       We don't have the kits and we don't have the trucks.\n\n  It is not just armored vehicles that would keep our troops safer. \nThey need better body armor, too. People are actually holding bake \nsales in our States in order to raise the money to privately purchase \nand send to their loved ones the armor or the helmets they want.\n  Over a year ago, the Pentagon issued a report that many of the deaths \nin Iraq caused by upper-body injuries could be prevented if all the \nbody armor issued to our troops included side armor plates. Some of my \ncolleagues raised this issue with Secretary Rumsfeld, and he assured \nthem that the Pentagon was going to begin the procurement and delivery \nof an additional 230,000 sets of side armor plates.\n  Last month, another Pentagon report found continued shortages in \nforce protection equipment for our soldiers, a shortage of body armor, \na shortage of up-armored vehicles, a shortage of communications \nequipment, and a shortage of electronic countermeasure devices.\n\n  We have also heard firsthand from troops that many are still being \nissued body armor without the side armor plates. How can someone be \ncontent to send our soldiers on the most dangerous patrols in the \nroughest neighborhoods of Baghdad without the best possible protection \nbeing afforded them?\n  In the last 4 years, over 1,100 Americans have died from roadside \nbombs, and thousands of our best troops have suffered debilitating \ninjuries or had their lives permanently altered by these terrible \nweapons.\n  Knowing full well you don't have enough armor for the troops already \nin the field, how do you responsibly turn around and say: That is OK. \nWe will just go ahead and put another 21,500 or more right there \nalongside them, particularly when it is a job that Iraqis themselves \nought to be doing? By themselves, these shortages are trouble. But the \nPresident's plan to send over this additional force makes them even \nmore questionable.\n  Now we hear that the troops pouring into Iraq will not even have \nenough up-armored HMMWVs or other armored vehicles until July. So what \nis the rationale for putting in the over 20,000 now, when the armor \ntheir lives depend on is not going to arrive until July? How do you \nturn around and say to a parent or to one of those young people \nthemselves that they are the next people to be over in Bethesda or in \nWalter Reed minus their limbs? Oh, sorry, we just didn't get them over \nthere in time, even though we had a couple of years to make the plans \nand respond, the most powerful, richest Nation on the face of the \nplanet, one that prides itself on its technology and on its support for \nthe troops. How do you explain that to one of those soldiers?\n  Eighteen months into the war, Donald Rumsfeld told troops in Kuwait a \nnow famous line:\n\n       As you know, you go to war with the Army that you have.\n\n  Well, in addition to being a pretty smug and even cavalier thing to \nsay at that point in time, you ought to measure it by where we are \ntoday. That was about a year and a half ago. You may go into war with \nthe Army you have, but smart people adapt to their enemy's tactics. You \nexploit their weaknesses, and you certainly work to minimize your own. \nWe ended World War II in less time than it has taken to prosecute the \ncurrent war in Iraq. We ended it with a weapon that didn't even exist \nwhen World War II began, when Pearl Harbor took place.\n  We have known for years now that the technologies our enemies are \nusing to kill our troops are outpacing the equipment we use to protect \nthem. And the gap between their offensive weapons and our defensive \narmor is only growing, thanks in part to a major increase in an \nespecially lethal kind of roadside bomb, the so-called EFP or \nexplosively formed penetrator. This is a diabolical contraption which \nhas been described as a ``spear that rips right through the vehicle.'' \nIt can shoot a metal projectile through the side of even an up-armored \nHMMWV and turn pieces of the vehicle itself into shrapnel that kills or \nmaims the soldiers inside.\n  Ninety percent of American fatalities from these terrible weapons \nhave come in Baghdad. Against the warnings of former Secretary of State \nColin Powell, against the warnings of GEN John Abizaid, against the \nwarnings of the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff last year, who said we \ndon't need more troops and don't want them, the President is now \nsending five brigades to referee a Sunni/Shia civil war. We are sending \nthem without the protection they need to survive EFP attacks.\n  Unfortunately, even with the latest armor, soldiers will still die \nfrom roadside bombs. But the new armor reinforces the doors, slows down \nthe projectile, will keep soldiers safer, and it will save many lives. \nWhen GEN James Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, talked about the \narmor kits, he said the following:\n\n       They are expensive, but they are going to save lives.\n\n  The technology exists right now to keep our troops safer. So why, 4 \nyears later, do our troops not have it? Partly, it is due to the gross \nincompetence at the highest levels of this Administration in their \ncommitment to the procurement process itself. Mostly, it is the fact \nthat we have never been mobilized to actually do what you do in war. We \ntalk about war; the rhetoric is all about war; but there is no request \nof Americans to behave as if we are at war. Certainly, for the people \nwaiting for that equipment, there is no showing that we are serious \nabout it.\n  From the time we invaded, the need for a fleet of vehicles that could \nkeep our troops safe has been unmistakable. From the time we first got \nthere, people knew you would drive down the streets and be exposed to \nthese kinds of risks. Yet we kept relying on one single provider of \nuparmored HMMWVs, and given the chronic shortfalls we have seen, that \nis a pretty amazing reliance. Still, the Administration doesn't seem to \nrespond.\n  The President's defense budget for next year does not include enough \nfunds for armored vehicles, so the Marine Corps had to ask Congress for \nan additional $2.8 billion to buy more mine-resistant, ambush-protected \nvehicles. Going back to 2002, the Administration terminated funding for \none alternative vehicle that was more suited to the battlefield in \nIraq--because of what they called ``budget priorities.'' I want to know \nwhat the budget priority was that came ahead of providing a vehicle to \nour troops that would have been more suited to the battlefield. Was it \nthe tax cuts? What was the priority?\n  While this is an urgent short-term concern, we also need to think \nabout what our soldiers will need in the long term for 21st century \nwarfare. Enemies are taking book on the weaknesses that we are showing \nthem on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this will not be the last war in \nwhich our troops are targeted in the vehicles they ride.\n  Since Somalia, in 1993, we have known that humvees, with their thin \nskin and square-bottom chassis, are ill-suited for counterinsurgency \nand the modern battlefield. We need to bridge this short-term gap and \nwe need to invest in the armored vehicles to keep our soldiers safe in \nthe future. This is serious business, and we cannot afford to be \nvulnerable or reluctant to engage with the urgency it requires.\n  No Commander in Chief and no Congress should knowingly put the lives \nof our soldiers at risk unnecessarily. But that is exactly what is \nhappening as we escalate this war. It is long past time that we had an \nhonest conversation about what protecting our troops means. Some of our \ncolleagues have come to the floor, even after blocking a vote on what \nwe might or might not do with respect to Iraq and the President's \nescalation plan, and they say they want an amendment saying that if \nCongress were to use the power of the purse to force this \nAdministration to change its failed policy, that that somehow would be \nputting our troops at risk.\n  Let me tell you what puts our troops at risk. It is sending them on a \nmission without the equipment, without the\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\narmor, without the vehicles that we know how to produce and are not \nbeing produced, and which they don't have. That is what puts our troops \nat risk. It seems to me it is unfair, if not negligent, to put our \ntroops at risk in the crossfire of a civil war without the equipment \nthey need.\n  So we ought to make certain we give our soldiers the extra body armor \nand the latest uparmored HMMWVs in order to do their job. That is why I \nwill again introduce a resolution in the Senate that offers us the best \nchance to salvage some measure of success in Iraq. I am convinced the \nreal way you protect the troops is to give them a mission that indeed \ninvites success. And absent the kind of summit and diplomacy necessary \nto resolve the fundamental political differences between Shia and \nSunni, between the fundamental stakeholders in Iraq, our soldiers, no \nmatter how brave or courageous--and they are both--cannot do the job. \nThe job has to be done at a table negotiating out those differences.\n  It is long since time we had a policy that sought to get Iraqis to \ntake responsibility for Iraq. The Iraqis have shown again and again \nthat they only respond to a deadline. About 6 months ago, General Casey \nand Ambassador Khalilzaid said publicly that the Iraqis had about 5 \nmonths to make a series of decisions in order to resolve their \ndifferences, or it may become almost impossible to make it happen. \nThose 5 months came and went. Nothing happened. Nothing was required of \nthe Iraqis that was firm. Nothing happened to change the equation on \nthe ground in Iraq. I believe it is only with a deadline that urges \nthem to take those steps that we will ultimately be successful. That is \nwhat I believe we owe our soldiers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, you and other Senators have seen me on \nthe floor in the last few days in order to bring some clarity to our \ndiscussion we have every year about what to do with the alternative \nminimum tax. When I say ``every year,'' for at least the last 3 years \nwe have had some discussion about the alternative minimum tax. I would \nremind people that in 1999 we passed a repeal of the alternative \nminimum tax, but President Clinton vetoed it and we haven't been able \nto repeal it since.\n  Now, this alternative minimum tax was originally created in 1969 \ntargeting wealthy taxpayers who were able to legally eliminate their \nentire income tax liabilities. The AMT has turned into a monster that \nhas threatened to hurt the middle class and maybe eventually touch \nlower income taxpayers if we don't do something about it. Obviously, if \nit is a monster, that ought to indicate to my colleagues that I think \nit ought to be repealed.\n  The reason for this, as I have explained, is the failure a long time \nago to index the alternative minimum tax for inflation. Thirty-eight \nyears of inflation has allowed the alternative minimum tax to spread to \nliterally millions of taxpayers who were never intended to pay it in \nthe first place. Although more middle and lower income taxpayers will \nbe hit by the alternative minimum tax, it has not decreased the \npercentage of high-income taxpayers who have no tax liability. So here \nwe have the anomaly of a tax that was supposed to hit just the very \nwealthy.\n  In the year 1969, we were talking about a study which showed 155 \npeople. Now it is hitting millions of people. This year, if we don't \nact, it is going to hit another 9 million or 10 million. And the \nanomaly is, there are people who have figured a way to even not pay the \nalternative minimum tax, and those people obviously are the wealthy \nwhom it was supposed to hit in the first place.\n  The alternative minimum tax also takes more than the taxpayers' \nmoney; it takes an awful lot of time to figure through this when you \nare doing your taxes. I think it was on Tuesday of this week or Monday \nof this week when I said the IRS estimates that the taxpayers spend an \naverage of 63 hours computing the alternative minimum tax liability. \nThe alternative minimum tax is truly a very cruel way of raising \nrevenue. While there seems to be general agreement that the AMT is a \nproblem, there has been less agreement on the solution for that \nproblem. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that there are more problems \nthan there are solutions, but I am surprised by some of the obstacles \npreventing a solution to the alternative minimum tax.\n  There are some who make the argument that any revenue not collected \nin the future as a result of the alternative minimum tax repeal, or \nreform, ought to be offset. I explained this before, but you can't say \nit too many times around here: The alternative minimum tax is a phony \nrevenue source and should not be offset. Since the alternative minimum \ntax collects revenues, it was never intended to collect from people who \nwere never intended to pay it in the first place.\n  Although the alternative minimum tax is still with us, it is not \nbecause solutions have not been considered and proposed. Right now I \nwill walk through some of those solutions that have been suggested. \nBefore I begin, I wish to emphasize a point I made a couple days ago. \nWith surprising regularity over the past 38 years, Congress has been \nmeddling with the AMT, including the year I said we passed legislation \nto repeal it and President Clinton vetoed it. Since 1969, more than 20 \nbills have made changes to the alternative minimum tax. Sometimes the \nrate was adjusted. Sometimes the exemption amounts were modified. More \nthan once, graduated rates were introduced. My point is that for 38 \nyears, Congress has hoped to tinker with the alternative minimum tax in \njust the right, very right way, very perfect way, to finally get it \nright but not succeeded. Unless we truly believe we are the smartest \nCongress in 38 years, anything short of complete repeal of the AMT will \nprobably require yet further action down the road in a few years.\n  I would also like to draw attention to the revenue estimates done by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation in 2005 that is reproduced on this \nchart, and these numbers are so small I am only going to talk around \nthem and not specifically to those numbers. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this estimate be printed in the Record.\n\n                                            COMMITTEE ON FINANCE--ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL AMT OPTIONS--FISCAL YEARS 2006-2015\n                                                                                      [Billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Provision                      Effective           2006       2007       2008       2OO9       2010       2011       2012       2013       2014       2015     2006-10    2006-15\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Legend for ``Effective'' column: tyba = taxable years beginning after.\nSource: Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is an estimate of how various proposed fixes to \nthe alternative minimum tax will impact revenues expected to be \ncollected under the current law. What you should note is that full \nrepeal aside--which I suggest is about the only way to do it but not \nconsidering that--each of those proposals will still allow the \nalternative minimum tax to bring hundreds of billions of dollars into \nthe Treasury. If you consider any proposal aside from full repeal, you \nare saying that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in \nour country deserve to bear the burden of an alternative minimum tax \nthat is not even, in some instances today, taxing to people who are \nsupposed to pay the tax: the very wealthy.\n  One possible solution is to continue doing what we have been doing \nfor the past several years. Ever since 2001, the Finance Committee has \nproduced legislation that has kept additional taxpayers from falling \nprey to the alternative minimum tax because of inflation. In the tax \nincrease prevention and reconciliation bill of 2005, we were able to \nextend the hold-harmless clause through December 31, just ended. That \nhold harmless now has expired and action will need to be taken this \nvery year or the AMT will return to its pre-2001 exemption levels, and \ntens of millions of taxpayers will fall into the AMT and have to pay it \nthis year.\n  Suppose we are able to continue enacting 1- or 2-year temporary \npatches, as we did last year. First, this strategy assumes that \nCongress will have the time and the inclination to spend time dealing \nwith the alternative minimum tax every year or two. This means that \nwhatever the issues of the day may be--Iraq, unemployment, natural \ndisasters such as Katrina--Congress will have to stop dealing with \nthose other problems and periodically return to holding harmless people \nwho would be otherwise hit by the alternative minimum tax.\n  Is the alternative minimum tax an issue that we, as a legislative \nbody, should revisit every year or wouldn't it be better to do away \nwith a piece of legislation that was never intended to kill the middle \nclass but will? Today I can show you some taxpayers who ought to be \npaying it who have found ways of getting around a provision that no \nwealthy taxpayer was supposed to get around. I hope this body would be \nashamed to say that to anyone, that we would consider going down that \nroad, but there we are.\n  The second point I wish to make is Congress attempts to enact or do \nthis every year. Every time a patch is considered, there is another \nchance for taxpayers to be subject to a stealth tax increase. Finally, \nwe have to remember that more than 3 million taxpayers are currently \ncaught by the AMT, and we are putting a chart up here now that will \nshow more than 3 million families and individuals paid this tax in \n2004. This is the way it hits every State. In case the Senator who is \npresiding can't see this, in the case of Minnesota, there are 69,000 \npeople in that State who paid this for the last year we know about, \n2004. In my State of Iowa, if I can find Iowa on here, 17,000, and I \nwill bet most of these people in Minnesota or Iowa who are paying it--\nyou know, in 1969, it was never anticipated that they pay it. But they \nare paying it because that is the way our tax laws work, until you make \nsome change in them, and because this wasn't indexed.\n  In dealing with the alternative minimum tax, are we going to tell \nthese people we know that isn't fair and we would like to help you, but \nin fact you are out there on your own? Well, no taxpayer hearing me say \nthat wants to hear that. I hope this body would be ashamed to say to \nanyone, much less more than 3 million families and individuals, that \nany extension of a patch or hold harmless will be fundamentally flawed \nin that it doesn't take people already hit by the AMT into account. If \nwe are going to decide to protect people from falling into the clutches \nof the AMT, it would be immoral to forget about those already subject \nto it.\n  I wish to add, as someone involved in enacting the recent hold-\nharmless provisions, so people preparing their income tax right now, \nthere aren't any more of them hit by the alternative minimum tax than \nwere hit the previous year, but that is ended December 31. But as one \nwho was involved in that, they were never intended to be a permanent \nsolution. The patches were always ``kicking the can down the road'' and \nletting somebody else worry about them. Well, I am still here, and I \nhave to worry about it, so I am creating problems for myself. But I \ndon't know how you can get people tuned in to doing away with a tax, \nand you can't do away with it because you have to offset it, but you \nare offsetting it with a bunch of phantom income that was never \nsupposed to be paid by these people in the first place. The public \nlistening to this are going to say: Well, what planet did these \nCongressmen come from?\n  Well, let's go on to another idea, to limit the reach of the \nalternative minimum tax based on income. We might decide, for instance, \nthat anyone who makes less than $125,000 a year will not be subject to \nthe alternative minimum tax or maybe we could set it at the amount of \n$200,000 or you could say $400,000. Now, in a nutshell, I have laid out \na principal difficulty with setting a minimum threshold based on \nincome. How do we set a number that would be equitable throughout the \ncountry? I am not thinking of myself so much as those who come from the \nso-called blue States, their taxpayers. Any Iowan who has spent any \ntime in Washington, DC, knows right away that it generally costs more \nto live in those States than in other States, more rural States. It \ncosts more to buy a house, to buy food at the grocery store. What I am \ntrying to get at is that prices and incomes are relative. Taxpayers \nliving in areas such as Manhattan or San Francisco could be especially \nhard hit by the alternative minimum tax by income. In fixing the AMT, I \ndon't want to move problems around or reassign hardships. That is akin \nto reassigning the tables and chairs on the deck of the Titanic.\n  Another proposal which has been suggested is to allow certain \npreference items in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax. \nThis would allow taxpayers to count items, such as a personal \nexemption, the standard deduction, the State and local taxes, against \ntheir income for the purposes\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nof calculating AMT liability. This approach is also fraught with \ndifficulty and unnecessary decisions. To implement this proposal, we \nwould have to arbitrarily give some taxpayers an escape hatch, while \nothers would not be able to escape the AMT.\n\n  If we allow State and local taxes to be a preferenced item, for \nexample, we are giving an advantage to people who choose to live in \nhigh-tax jurisdictions over those who choose to live in low-tax \njurisdictions. In my way of thinking, it is not fair for the Federal \nGovernment to give more favorable tax treatment to some taxpayers \nbecause of where they live. Also, it seems likely that taxpayers who \npay the most in State and local taxes are going to be wealthy taxpayers \nwhom the AMT was supposed to tax in the very first place.\n  If we were to give the standard deduction preferential status in \ncalculating AMT liability, then I have concerns about the impact this \nmight have, for instance, on charitable giving. If we only allow the \nstandard deduction to be taken against the AMT, people may decide not \nto make charitable donations they might otherwise consider. On the \nother hand, we could allow individuals to count their total charitable \ncontributions when calculating AMT. This approach favors those wealthy \nenough to make large charitable contributions.\n  The point I make is allowing taxpayers to consider certain \npreferenced items when calculating their AMT liabilities will make it \nnecessary to favor some taxpayers and will lead to more bills making \nmore changes in the future to the AMT as various groups or interests \nfight to allow a given exemption or deductibility they favor to be \ntaken against the AMT liability.\n  These are all items which have been floating around as suggestions to \nfix this problem we have. I don't think any of them are very sound tax \npolicy. They might help some people, but they are going to hurt others.\n  Before I explain how we can deal with the AMT once and for all--and I \nhave already pointed out what I think that is, and that is repeal--I \nwish to explain how various proposals impact the number of taxpayers \nalready hit by the AMT as calculated by the nonpartisan Joint Committee \non Taxation.\n  This chart shows numbers from last year. As the blue line on this \nchart shows, under current law, the number of AMT filers will jump by \nover 20 million this year if Congress does nothing.\n  The red line shows what would happen if the exception applicable in \n2005 was made permanent and indexed for inflation still at a higher \nlevel, hitting people who were never intended to be hit, but it would \nstill moderate the impact for tens of millions of people. Clearly, the \nnumber of taxpayers affected is less, but still a very large number \nthat, after dropping to a low of 1.7 million people in 2011, begins to \nincrease again, to 2.1 million people by the year 2016.\n  The orange line represents the establishment of a 24-percent rate \nalong with the 2005 exemptions made permanent and indexed for \ninflation. This plan just described--the orange line--follows the trend \nof the red line as it incurs a drop before creeping back up.\n  Finally, the green line on the chart shows what would happen if we \ntook the 1985 exemption amount, which was $30,000 for individuals and \n$40,000 for joint returns, and indexed it for inflation. As with the \nother three lines, the number of taxpayers affected drops more before \ncreeping back up once again.\n  Although some of these options seem to assist most taxpayers, do not \nbe fooled by the large scale of this chart. Even the option to index by \n1985 exemption leaves at least several hundred thousand taxpayers \nexposed to the AMT. It would be difficult to explain to these people \nwhy others deserve fair treatment and they do not.\n  Clearly, there is only one way, then, to fix the alternative minimum \ntax so that no taxpayer is subject to what has become a complete policy \nfailure, because even some wealthy people who were supposed to pay a \nminimum tax for the privilege of living in America are able to get \naround it as well. We must completely repeal the individual alternative \nminimum tax. There is a bipartisan consensus that only complete repeal \nis an adequate solution to this problem. Chairman Baucus, with me and \nwith Senator Crapo, Senator Kyl, Senator Roberts, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Smith, last month introduced the Individual Alternative Minimum \nTax Repeal Act of 2007. By the way, that is a bipartisan group of \npeople.\n  The alternative minimum tax was originally conceived as a means to \nensure that the Tax Code was equitable and more progressive. \nIronically, the only equitable thing to do is to completely banish the \nindividual AMT from the Tax Code. Any other solution will entail we \ntreat taxpayers in similar situations differently or that we \narbitrarily choose winners and losers.\n  As I have said many times, the alternative minimum tax has been a \ncomplete and absolute failure. The alternative minimum tax was only \nsupposed to hit a very small number of wealthy taxpayers who were able \nto legally eliminate their entire income tax liability. In reality, the \nAMT is gradually consuming our middle class and is projected to absorb \nmore revenue coming in from the alternative minimum tax than the \nregular income tax in just a little while. Furthermore, the alternative \nminimum tax does not even prevent wealthy taxpayers from eliminating \ntheir tax liabilities. If Members have heard me say that four times, I \nsay it to impress that the original intent of the alternative minimum \ntax is not even being met.\n\n  For the tax years 2003, the IRS calculated that there are 2,366 \ntaxpayers with incomes of over $200,000 a year or more who did not pay \nany income tax. These 2,366 taxpayers did not use medical or dental \nexpense deductions to limit their tax liability.\n  We must repeal the AMT. We must do it without offsetting any revenue \nthe AMT is expected to collect in the next few years because it was \nnever intended in 1969 that these people pay the alternative minimum \ntax. I have made this point before but cannot make it too many times: \nThe AMT was never intended to be a significant source of revenue. It \nwas supposed to be making a point that when some of the very wealthiest \nuse every legal means they can--and I stress ``legal'' because these \nare not criminals--every legal means to avoid paying income tax, they \nought to pay a little bit for the privilege of being in America. Not \nthat they don't pay in other ways--it is a matter of progressivity as \nmuch as it is the privilege of living in America, to be a matter of \nprinciple. It was never meant to be a significant source of income.\n  Despite this, we will see the alternative minimum tax ballooning \nFederal revenues to historically high levels if something is not done. \nThis chart which I used a couple of days ago shows how revenues are \nprojected to exceed the 30-year historical average. This historical \naverage is actually about a 50-year historical average, somewhere \nbetween 17 percent and 19 percent. We are at the historical average \nright now. Even though we were a little bit below after the income tax \ncut of 2001, we are back up to 18.4 or 18.6 of GNP. If we do not do \nsomething about this alternative tax and we also continue to collect it \nfrom people who were never intended to pay it, this is where we end \nup--with income coming into the Federal Treasury way above the \nhistorical average.\n  I emphasize historical average, not that it is sacrosanct, but I come \nto the conclusion that over a period of 50 years, if we have a tax \npolicy falling between 17 percent and 19 percent--and this is whether \nthere were 93 percent marginal tax rates that President Kennedy did \naway with or as low as 28 percent marginal tax rates that we had in the \ntax year of 1986 under Reagan--if we overlap all of the marginal tax \nrates on top of the GNP portion the Federal Government takes, we still \naverage 17 percent to 19 percent, which shows that it does not matter \nhow wealthy you are, some people come to the conclusion that they will \nonly work so hard and pay so much tax regardless of how high the \nmarginal tax rate is, and you get the same amount of money coming in.\n  So try to tax the wealthy, raise the marginal tax rate, you get less \nrevenue. If you want to soak the rich, lower the marginal tax rate \nbecause they are people who will take their money out of leisure, they \nwill take it out of nonproductive investments such as antique and gold \nand put it into productive investments because probably they are greedy \nand they want to make\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nmore if it is worth working to make more.\n  Regardless of where we set it, 17 percent to 19 percent seems to work \nbecause, at least in my judgment, a very commonsense judgment, it is a \nlevel of taxation that there has not been a revolt against. It is a \nlevel of taxation that 50 years of our country shows has increased the \nstandard of living for the American people very dramatically.\n  If we consider the AMT to be fundamentally an unfair tax, any tax \nthat would replace it would be equally unfair. Anyone who wants equity \nto be a fundamental value represented by our Tax Code or who wants fair \ntreatment for this country's taxpayers must support complete repeal of \nthe alternative minimum tax and should support the Baucus-Grassley \nbill, which is the Individual Alternative Minimum Tax Repeal Act of \n2007, a bipartisan bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. STABENOW).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ncontinued obstructionism in the Senate, led by our Republican \ncolleagues, concerning the vote on supporting or opposing the \nPresident's escalation of the war in Iraq.\n  For 2 weeks our distinguished majority leader has been trying to get \nan agreement to just proceed to a fair debate, to just have the \nopportunity on the floor of the Senate to have a debate on whether we \nsupport the President's escalation of the war in Iraq. He has offered \nan up-or-down vote on two different proposals--one opposing the \nescalation, the second supporting it. At every turn he has been \nstymied.\n  Our Republican minority claims they want to debate the war in Iraq, \nbut they have done everything they can to obstruct the debate. I would \nlike to go through some of the history of this obstructionism. Since \nthe first of the year, Republicans have rejected at least three \ndifferent compromises that would have allowed the Senate to move \nforward with a vote on the escalation of the war in Iraq. In an effort \nto obtain an up-or-down vote on the bipartisan resolution disapproving \nthe President's plan, Senate Democrats offered to schedule an up-or-\ndown vote on the McCain-Graham resolution supporting the President's \nplan. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership rejected this offer on \nwhat they claimed to support.\n  Then we, as Senate Democrats, offered the Republican leadership up-\nor-down votes on two other resolutions--the Gregg resolution and a \nresolution stating simply that the Senate does not support the surge \nand demands that the troops deploying to Iraq receive the body armor \nand other equipment they need. The Republican leadership again rejected \nthe offer.\n  Finally, Senate Democrats offered to allow votes on the bipartisan \nresolution and the McCain-Gramm resolution that would each have \nrequired a supermajority of 60 votes. The Republican leadership again \nsaid no.\n  The pattern of obstruction has, unfortunately, continued. On February \n5, all but two Republican Senators opted to block a debate, including \nthe distinguished author of the resolution--chose to block debate on \nwhether we support the President's escalation plan. The reaction across \nthe country was echoed in numerous newspaper headlines.\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       GOP Stalls Debate On Troops Increase.\n\n  The Washington Times:\n\n       Senate GOP Blocked Iraq Resolution.\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       GOP Senators Block Debate On Iraq Policy.\n\n  USA Today:\n\n       Vote On Iraq Is Blocked By The GOP.\n\n  Denver Post:\n\n       GOP Blocks Iraq Debate.\n\n  A.P.:\n\n       Republicans Block Senate Debate On Iraq.\n\n  Reuters:\n\n       Republicans Block Senate Debate On Iraq.\n\n  CNN:\n\n       GOP Blocks Senate Debate On Iraq Resolution.\n\n  Los Angeles Times:\n\n       GOP Bats Down Resolution Debate.\n\n  After almost 2 weeks of more stalling by the Republican leadership, \nSenate majority leader Harry Reid today, again, offered a compromise \nthat would have allowed all of us the opportunity to stand up and take \na position and vote our conscience. Simply put, every Member of the \nSenate would be given the opportunity to vote on a bill equal to the \nHouse resolution opposing the President's escalation of the war in Iraq \nand also a resolution supporting the President's plan to send even more \ntroops into combat operations in Iraq.\n  What could be simpler? What could be more fair? The reaction by the \nRepublican leadership, sadly, was not surprising. They again said no. \nThey don't want to vote. I find it interesting that earlier today \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted to stop us from \ngoing ahead to a vote are now saying we should not adjourn until we \nvote. Well, in fact, our distinguished majority leader and the majority \nagree. Therefore, we will have that vote after the House votes \ntomorrow. We will have that vote on Saturday.\n  Supporters of the war in Iraq have claimed that one of their goals is \nto spread democracy throughout the Middle East, throughout the region. \nThat is an ironic statement, considering that they are stifling the \ndemocratic process on the floor of the Senate. Recent public opinion \nsurveys have shown that a clear majority of Americans--in some cases as \nmany as 70 percent of American citizens--when asked, say they oppose \nthe President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. From our biggest \ncities to our smallest towns, the American people are demanding \naccountability on the war in Iraq. They have questions and they are \nlooking to their leaders for answers. They are looking to their \nleaders--to us--for focus and debate and a willingness to take a \nposition and speak out and make change happen.\n\n  The Traverse City Record Eagle, in Michigan, in their editorial page, \nsummed it up, I believe, on January 25. They said:\n\n       Someone frozen in time for the past 2 years could have \n     listened to President Bush outline his new Iraq policy in his \n     State of the Union Address Tuesday and wondered what the fuss \n     was about. That is because there is no ``new'' policy.\n       Today, the road ahead looks just like the road behind--stay \n     the course. Only this time there will be about 20,000 more \n     American troops in harm's way [not counting support troops]. \n     Before we know it, we'll be at 4,000 Americans dead and \n     30,000 wounded and nothing will have changed.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       The awful reality, as many who watched Tuesday surely \n     realized, is that the President has no exit strategy. He has \n     no clue how to get Sunnis and Shiites to stop killing each \n     other, let alone form a stable government. He has no evidence \n     they even have any desire to do so. There is only his war, \n     and it goes on and on.\n\n  Mr. President, our troops and their families, more than anybody else, \ndeserve better. They deserve better than this strategy, and they \ndeserve better than tactics designed to stop us from a full and open \ndebate about the President's strategy. They deserve better than people \navoiding taking a stand, taking a vote on this President's escalation \nin Iraq.\n  This debate is already taking place all across America, all across \nMichigan--in coffee shops, diners, union halls, office parks, at church \ndinners, and at VFW halls. Americans are speaking out and asking tough \nquestions about this administration's misguided escalation of the war. \nAnd in the Senate, in a move that clearly disregards the opinions of \nthe majority of Americans, the Republican leadership has refused to \nallow a real debate and a vote on the President's escalation.\n  Four years ago, I stood in this Chamber alongside 22 colleagues and \nvoted no on giving the President the authority to go to war. It was a \nhard vote. It was a lonely vote. But I was proud to do my duty, along \nwith all of my colleagues, and stand publicly and take a position and \nhave our votes counted. It strikes me as sad that the Senators who \nsupport the President's escalation of the war have decided to hide from \nthis opportunity to do the same--to\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nvote their conscience and to tell the American people where they stand, \nwin or lose.\n  This should not be a discussion of politics. This is a discussion of \nthe most serious policy. Any soldier will tell you that there are no \npolitics in a foxhole. The American people--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--are asking us to take a look, long and hard, at what we \nare doing in Iraq. We were not elected to stand silently by while our \nfellow citizens demand answers. American men and women are in harm's \nway. Unfortunately, it seems that the Republican leadership doesn't see \nit that way.\n  Let me again say, as clearly as possible, that I believe the \nescalation of this war is not the answer. Putting more Americans in \nharm's way will not bring our men and women home any sooner. Why would \nwe go further down a path that has led us to this point? Why would we \nrepeat our previous mistakes and call it a ``new strategy''?\n  A free and stable Iraq can only be secured by the Iraqis. They must \nembrace responsibility for their collective future and decide that \nliving and dying at the hands of sectarian violence is not the future \nthey want for their children and grandchildren.\n  We must support their efforts, but we cannot substitute American \ntroops for Iraqi resolve. With the freedom of self-determination comes \na responsibility of collective security. I believe we must continue to \ntrain the Iraqis and equip them and provide sensible military support, \nbased on the advice of our generals and military experts. And we must \nlead them by example--by embracing, not turning our backs on, our own \ndemocratic process.\n  The Detroit Free Press, in response to the President's announcement \nof the escalation, echoed the concerns of people all across Michigan \nand from around the country, I believe, as well, on January 11, when \nthey wrote:\n\n       President George W. Bush at least acknowledged past \n     failings and did not promise roaring success in outlining his \n     new strategy for Iraq in a grim-faced address to the Nation \n     Wednesday night. In fact, he braced the American and Iraqi \n     people for at least another year of bloodshed--maybe the \n     worst yet.\n       But that does not make this escalation of the war--the \n     President didn't use the word, but that's what he intends to \n     do--the best course of action. It is based on hope without \n     demonstrable evidence that the Iraqi Government and its \n     military are truly ready to take control of their country \n     instead of taking sides in an internal combat. It is based \n     on the belief that an American force of 157,500 can \n     achieve what a force of 135,000 could not, given a little \n     more leeway to act. And it is based on the President's \n     conviction that a decisive military victory in Iraq can \n     somehow break the back of global terrorism.\n       It won't, any more than the escalation of the war in \n     Vietnam stopped the advance of global communism. Economic and \n     political forces played the larger roles in that. Granted, \n     there are elements of each in the President's new strategy, \n     but where is the functioning government to implement them? \n     Demanding accomplishment does not make it so, and the new \n     leaders of Iraq have accomplished precious little to date.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       This is certainly not the strategy the American people had \n     in mind last November when they repudiated the President by \n     stripping his Republican Party of control of Congress. It \n     runs counter to much of what the Iraq Study Group and past \n     military commanders have recommended. It further strains a \n     U.S. military already hard pressed to meet its obligations.\n\n  I believe the American people want a new direction in Iraq. What they \ndon't want is more legislative games designed to stop debate or hide \nfrom the realities of the situation on the ground which our men and \nwomen are facing. Wishful thinking and best-case scenario planning will \nnot make the situation in Iraq any better. Our troops in the field and \nour fellow citizens here at home demand leadership, critical analysis, \na willingness to change course when the evidence shows that we must, \nand they deserve action.\n  The Republican leadership can stonewall a vote on this resolution, \nbut they cannot silence the debate. They cannot avoid reality. They \ncannot avoid the truth.\n  To every American around the country asking questions, I say thank \nyou--thank you for asking questions, thank you for speaking up, thank \nyou for being a part of the democratic process we hold so dear, and \nthank you for following your conscience.\n  There is nothing simple about the situation in Iraq. We all know \nthat. But there is nothing complicated about what America is asking us \nto do. It is time for all of us--those who oppose the escalation of the \nwar and those who support it--to stand up and have our votes counted.\n  This is not the time for legislative games. This is too serious a \ntime and too serious a topic. The President has presented a plan. It is \ntime for us to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time, first, to commend the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for doing everything in his power to \nbring up the most important issue we face as a nation, and that is the \nfuture of Iraq.\n  I must tell you, as I travel through the State of Maryland, the \ncitizens of my State ask: What are we doing to change the course in \nIraq? What are we doing?\n  Senator Reid has proposed a way that we can have an up-or-down vote \non the most pressing issue of our time, and that is whether we are \ngoing to introduce more American troops, escalate our presence in \nIraq--an up-or-down vote. The other body will be holding that vote some \ntime tomorrow. Every Member of that body will go on record either for \nor against the President's proposal to escalate our presence in Iraq \nwith additional American troops.\n  We need to have that same vote in this body, and we should not be \nlooking at procedural obstacles that prevent us from going on record \nwhether we favor or oppose the President's proposals.\n  I look at what the President is suggesting, putting additional troops \nin Iraq, as more of the same, not a new plan. If we learned anything at \nall from the elections last November, it was that the people of this \nNation want to see a change in direction in Iraq. They understand our \nplans have not worked, that we need to look for a new direction. And \nyet the President is giving us more of the same.\n  What we need to do is start by saying no to the escalation of \nadditional troops, and then we need to look at what are the right \npolicies in Iraq. Quite frankly, to me, we need to have the Iraqis \nstand up and defend their own country, with Iraqis assuming principal \nresponsibility and American troops starting to come home. We need to \nengage diplomacy. We are in the middle of a civil war.\n  We need to engage the international community to look for a political \nsolution so that Iraqis have confidence in their own Government and \nSunnis and Shiites can live together in one country. We need to engage \nthe international community to help rebuild Iraq. They need help in the \nrebuilding of their country, and they certainly need the help of the \ninternational community in training Iraqis to take care of their own \nneeds.\n  Americans have made a significant investment in this country. We have \ngiven so much. Four years ago, I opposed the military presence of \nAmerica in Iraq. I voted against it in the other body. I said at that \ntime:\n\n       I have grave concerns about the consequences of a \n     unilateral preemptive military attack by the United States. \n     Such a course of action could endanger our global coalition \n     against terrorism, particularly from our moderate Arab \n     allies. It also may increase terrorism activities around the \n     world.\n\n  Unfortunately, I was right. I remember the predictions that were made \n4 years ago that this would be a relatively brief military operation, \nthat we would be welcomed by the Iraqis, that the Iraqis would be able \nto take care of the security of their own country, that the standard of \nliving for the average Iraqi would increase dramatically.\n  Unfortunately, that has not come true. The reality of the situation \nis that over 3,100 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq. \nOver 20,000 American soldiers have had life-changing injuries as a \nresult of their service in Iraq. Hundreds of billions of dollars of \nU.S. taxpayer money has been spent in Iraq, and terrorism is on the \nincrease in that region, not diminished. And we are in the middle of a \ncivil war, with sectarian violence increasing.\n\n  The Iraqis, having passed their constitution, have elected their \nGovernment, and it is time for the Iraqis to take responsibility for \ncontrolling the sectarian violence in their own country. More troops \nwill not solve the\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nproblem. More American troops will not solve the problem in Iraq.\n  I am a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. We completed over 3 \nweeks of hearings concerning the current status in Iraq. We heard from \nmilitary experts and foreign policy experts, generals and policy \npeople. I must tell you, they raise serious questions as to whether we \ncan win the war in Iraq on the battlefield. They are telling us over \nand over again that what we need is a surge in diplomacy, not \nadditional American troops. We need to signal the Iraqi Government, the \ninternational community, and, most importantly, the American people \nthat our presence in Iraq is not indefinite. More American troops will \nnot bring about victory in Iraq. More diplomacy might. More engagement \nof the international community might. But more American troops will \nnot.\n  It is time for this body to act. It is time for us to debate the \ncurrent circumstances in Iraq and the President's policy, and it is \ntime for us to take action on the President's plan to escalate. That \nshould be our first vote, and that is what Majority Leader Reid is \nattempting to do. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ntrying to use procedural roadblocks so we cannot have an up-or-down \nvote on the President's plan. We should never play politics with our \nAmerican troops who are in harm's way. We shouldn't be doing that. But \nlet us have a vote up or down on the President's policy, and then we \nneed to look at other options.\n  The majority leader indicates that we will certainly be taking up the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, to implement their \nrecommendations, and we will have an open debate and the opportunity to \noffer amendments as to how we can bring our troops home with honor, how \nwe can engage the international community, how we can move forward in \nthe Middle East. That we need to do. But we first must stop the \nescalation of American troops, and that is the vote the other body will \nbe having as early as tomorrow, and I hope, with the support of my \ncolleagues, we can have that vote by Saturday. That is what we should \ndo.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to have the debate on this floor and \nan up-or-down vote on the President's plan to add additional American \ntroops. Then I hope we will find some way to listen to what the experts \nare telling us, to listen to what the American people are telling us, \nthat they want to see from our country a changed policy in Iraq. They \nwant America to exercise its international leadership that only we can \ndo. They want us to find a way to honorably bring our troops home, to \nenergize the international community on diplomacy and on rebuilding \nIraq. And they want the Iraqis to stand up and defend their own country \nin the midst of a civil war, and we will help end that civil war by \nallowing the Iraqis to take control of their own country and by \nenergizing a diplomatic solution so that all the people in Iraq have \nconfidence that their Government will protect their rights, and then \nworking with the international community, helping build a type of \ncountry where the people can live in peace and prosperity. That should \nbe our mission.\n  But let us start by removing the procedural roadblocks. Let us start \nby having an up-or-down vote, as the other body will have, on whether \nwe support or oppose the President's plans to escalate American troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2013-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2013-S2015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue of American presence in the \nMiddle East is of great importance. We are currently engaged in a war \nin Iraq from which, according to poll after poll, a majority of the \nAmerican people believe we should withdraw.\n  In the face of the momentous elections of this past November, in \nwhich the American electorate indicated their dissatisfaction with the \nPresident's policies in Iraq, President Bush has responded with a call \nfor more troops, not less. At this moment, he is escalating the war, \nnot redeploying our brave men and women out of harm's way. He is \nsending these troops into the middle of a civil war.\n  Now there are reports that the President may be considering expanding \nthis tragic war into Iran. The President has no constitutional \nauthority to make war on Iran without congressional approval, nor has \nhe historical precedent. I offer today a resolution ``expressing the \nsense of Congress that the President should not initiate military \naction against Iran without first obtaining authorization from \nCongress.'' The resolution sets forth the constitutional grant of \nauthority to Congress for declaring war and funding any war, it cites \nFederalist Paper No. 69 on the intention of the drafters of the \nConstitution, and it cites Presidents Washington and Jefferson on the \npower reserved to Congress to authorize war.\n  The resolution strongly and unequivocally affirms that the President \ndoes not have the power to initiate military action against Iran \nwithout first obtaining authorization from Congress, that neither of \nthe existing authorizations to use military force in Iraq gives him \nsuch authority, and that the President must seek congressional \nauthority prior to taking any military action against Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment across the Rotunda, not far \nfrom here, in the House of Representatives, there is an ongoing debate \nabout the war in Iraq. It has been 2 or 3 days of debate with Members \neach allowed 5 minutes to express their feelings about this war. It is \nhistoric. It happens rarely that that procedure is used, almost always \nin cases involving war. I have been through it as a Member of the House \nof Representatives and can recall the sleepless nights that led to \nvotes on questions of war. You know that at the end of the day, if the \ndecision to go forward on a war is made, people will die.\n  Many decisions we make on the floor of the House and Senate have \nlittle consequence, some are purely ceremonial, and some just deal with \nmoney. But when it comes to war, it is a matter of life and death. So I \nam sure every Member of the House of Representatives, regardless of \ntheir feelings about this war, has thought long and hard about what \nthey are saying. They have taken this matter very seriously because \nthey understand that America is taking this very seriously.\n  We have lost over 3,100 of our best and bravest soldiers, men and \nwomen who have gone off to war with parents behind and families crying, \nwondering if they will return safely. Unfortunately, they did not, some \nof them. There are some 23,000 or 24,000 who have returned with serious \ninjuries. Some are minor, but some are very serious, such as \namputations and blindness, traumatic brain injuries and many other \ninjuries that will haunt these soldiers for a lifetime as they try to \nreturn to normal life.\n  We have spent a lot of money on this war, over $400 billion. As we \nlabor with this new budget, we see the result of the decision to go to \nwar. From the monetary side, it shortchanges America in terms of what \nwe desperately need. Whether we are talking about additional medical \nresearch, help for education, money to schools that need a helping hand \nto make No Child Left Behind work, assistance for families to have \nhealth insurance and health protection, this war has been costly to \nAmerica. For those who believe the money would have been better spent \nright here at home, that a strong America begins at home, there is a \nserious concern about when this war will end and what the ultimate cost \nwill be.\n  We know our military is much different today than when we invaded \nIraq. It was an invasion this President decided to make without \nprovocation and, frankly, without evidence that there was any serious \nthreat against our country. Having made that decision, having gone \noverseas and lost these lives and brought back so many injured \nsoldiers, we understand now we live in a different Nation. We live in a \nNation where we watch, sadly every day, evidence of violence in Iraq, \nevidence of innocent people being killed on their streets, and \nunfortunately our own soldiers are caught in the crossfire of their \ncivil war.\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n  In the last election, the American people were finally given a chance \nto speak about this war, and they said: We want a change. We don't want \nthis to continue. We don't want to continue to lose these brave \nsoldiers or continue to spend this money. They elected a Congress which \nwas given the charge of moving us in that new direction. For the first \ntime in a long time, Democrats control both the House and the Senate. \nIn the Senate, it is a very scant margin. On a good day, it is 51 to \n49.\n  Those who know the Senate, know that important measures take 60 \nvotes. In order to achieve passage, we need bipartisan cooperation. We \nneed to reach across the aisle and find common ground. We have tried to \ndo that. In some respects, we have been successful. We have passed \nbipartisan ethics reform to deal with some of the issues of integrity \nthat have haunted this Chamber and the House of Representatives over \nthe last several years. We have passed a minimum wage increase at the \nFederal level for the first time in 10 years--something long overdue. \nWe even passed a spending bill to finish this fiscal year, to try to \nmop up some of the unfinished business from last year's Congress, which \nleft town with many appropriations bills unresolved.\n  The one issue we have not addressed in the Senate, the issue now \nbeing debated in the House of Representatives, is the war in Iraq. We \nfeel--many of us on the Democratic side and some on the Republican \nside--that we should have this debate. We owe it to the American \npeople. Members should stand up and state where they are, what their \nposition is, and what they think we should do as a Nation. I know if \nthis debate took place, it would be important not just for this \ninstitution but for the country to know we came here understanding our \nresponsibility.\n  Two weeks ago, we offered to the Republican side of the aisle an \nopportunity to debate the very fundamental question raised by the \nPresident's new plan for Iraq. The President has proposed another \n21,000 American soldiers in combat mode going into Iraq to join the \n130,000 already there. We know that 21,000 combat soldiers would \nrequire at least the like number of support troops, so it is a \nsubstantial escalation of the war to add 42,000 or 44,000 American \nsoldiers to the 130,000 already there. Many of us think it would be a \nserious mistake. We question whether escalating this war, sending more \ntroops into harm's way, is any way to bring it to an end.\n\n  We have tried it before unsuccessfully. Additional troops, as good as \nthey are, cannot overcome the ravage of a civil war. Unfortunately, we \nhave learned that we suffer more casualties every time we send our \nbrave soldiers and marines and airmen and sailors into this conflict. \nSo we tried 2 weeks ago to start the debate, to let Members stand and \nsay whether they support the President's escalation of the war or \nwhether they oppose it.\n  Most Americans have an opinion. In fact, overwhelmingly they say it \nis a bad idea. When asked, they can give a yes or no as to whether they \nsupport the President's escalation. We offered to the Republican side \nof the aisle not just a yes or no but their answer to our criticism of \nthe President's escalation. We said we would stand by two separate \nRepublican resolutions to be offered on the floor. One Republican \nresolution, sponsored by John Warner, Republican of Virginia, critical \nof the escalation of the war, was supported by most Democrats, \nincluding myself. The other, offered by Senator John McCain, a \nRepublican of Arizona, supports the President's position on the war.\n  I think it would have been a spirited debate, an important and \nhistoric debate, but the Republicans rejected that. They wanted more. \nThey wanted more resolutions brought to the floor. They didn't want us \nto focus on the very fundamental issue at hand. They wanted to bring in \nother issues, such as funding for the war, support for the troops, and \nso many things that were not at issue, were not what we were \ndiscussing. So we tried to keep the focus on the basic issue: Should we \nescalate the number of troops committed to this war?\n  We had what we call a cloture motion, which means closing down debate \non a certain issue. A cloture motion would say we are going to move to \nthe debate on the war in Iraq. We called that cloture motion, and it \nfailed. As I said, we don't have 60 votes on this side of the aisle. We \nneed help on the other side of the aisle. Only two Republican Senators \nsaid we will join you in calling for a debate on the Warner resolution \nand a debate on the McCain resolution. Two Republicans stepped forward. \nThe rest said: No, we don't want that debate.\n  Well, an odd thing happened. After that vote, many of the Senators \nhad Senator's remorse, I call it. It is a version of buyer's remorse. \nThey wished they had cast another vote. Within days, they started \ncoming to the floor and saying, that isn't what we meant to say. We \ndidn't want to say stop the debate on Iraq. We believe there should be \ndebate on Iraq. Yes, they said, we voted to stop the debate on Iraq, \nbut we didn't mean to stop the debate on Iraq.\n  They were so transparent. They were twisted in knots. They came to \nthe floor repeatedly, seven or eight of them. They sent letters to the \nleadership. They had press conferences, and they talked to anyone in \nthe hallway, saying they had made a mistake and they wanted to return \nto the issue. So we gave them that chance today. We gave them that \nchance. We said: Let us return to the issue, let us debate the issue on \nthe floor of the Senate as they have done it in the House, and let us \nalso add to that another Republican opportunity for the McCain \namendment, which supports the President's position. We would have, \nagain, a basic vote on a fundamental issue, fair and square. What did \nthe minority leader from Kentucky do? He objected. He didn't want to \nengage in that debate. That is truly unfortunate. While the House of \nRepresentatives is deeply engaged in a debate of historic moment, \nimportant to everyone across this country and particularly to our men \nand women in uniform, unfortunately, the minority objected. They don't \nwant to engage in a straight up-or-down debate on the fundamental \nissue.\n  The argument they make is, we have many other things we want to talk \nabout when it concerns Iraq. We may want to talk about funding for \nIraq. We may want to talk about the ability of Congress to cut off \nfunding--all of these issues. And we have said to them, that is all \nwell and good, we will give you the chance to do it. As soon as this \ndebate is finished on the escalation of troops, the President's \nproposal, we will immediately, within hours, move to the next issue, \nthe 9/11 Commission recommendations, open to amendment, and then you \ncan offer whatever amendment you care to on the issue of Iraq.\n  So it wasn't a matter of foreclosing the debate, it was a matter of \nsaying: Let us focus the first part of this debate on an up-or-down \nquestion on the President's escalation of the war. You can vote, as the \nHouse is about to, saying this is a bad policy or you can support \nSenator McCain, who believes that sending more troops is the right \npolicy. They rejected it.\n  So now we have been forced to a position, which I am not happy with, \nbut which we have to accept, and that is we have to call another \ncloture vote, another procedural vote, another attempt to move us to a \ndebate stage. That vote is going to occur, as presently scheduled, on \nSaturday afternoon. It will be a historic vote as well because, once \nagain, the Republican minority will have a chance to join us in \nstarting the national debate on Iraq in the Senate.\n  The question is: Will they support this effort this time? I hope they \nwill. I hope they will come on Saturday, as inconvenient as it may be \nin their personal schedules, and join us in voting for cloture. If they \nwill, if we can bring 60 votes forward to close down debate on the \nprocedural aspects and move forward on the real debate about Iraq, it \nis a good thing for America. If they continue to hold to this position \nthat they are going to protect this White House from any possibility of \nembarrassment, that they are going to somehow stop the Senate, which \nhas a reputation as the great deliberative body on Capitol Hill, if \nthey are going to stop the Senate from the debate on Iraq, it will be \nat the expense of this institution and, more importantly, at their own \nexpense.\n  The American people, whatever their position on this issue, expect us \nto stand up and debate it and to say where we stand. We will find on \nSaturday how\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nmany of the Republican Senators answer the rollcall; how many come and \nhow they vote.\n  We know that as inconvenient as it may be for these Senators to \nreturn on Saturday, as tough as it may be for many of them to get back, \nit can't be any tougher than the assignments we give to our soldiers \nand sailors and marines and airmen to put on the uniform of our United \nStates of America and to defend our country and to risk their lives \nevery day.\n  So I hope our colleagues will be with us on Saturday. I hope they \nwill join us in moving forward on this debate.\n  I can recall the vote that led us into the war in Iraq as if it were \nyesterday. It was a time just weeks before an election. There was \nalmost a feeling of hysteria across this country about the possibility \nof weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Condoleezza Rice, who was then \nSecurity Adviser to the President, suggested the possibility of \nmushroom-shaped clouds. All sorts of fears were engendered in a \npopulation still very wary after 9/11. It was not an easy vote because \nthere had been a buildup, this drumbeat of support for invasion. And \nthe day came in October when it occurred. There were 23 of us who voted \nno, one from the State of Rhode Island on the Republican side and 22 \nDemocrats voting no. At the time, it was not an easy vote. I look back \non it now as one of the most important votes I ever cast.\n  There comes a time when Members of the Senate have to face \nresponsibility and face a vote. There will come a time when the \nRepublicans have to face a vote on Iraq. They cannot protect the \nPresident and the White House indefinitely and forever.\n  I had a great friend from the State of Oklahoma, a Congressman by the \nname of Mike Synar. I have told this story many times, and I mention \nhis name because I don't want him to be forgotten. He passed away in \n1996 from a brain tumor. But Mike was one of a kind. He just could not \nstand Members of the House of Representatives who were unwilling to \nface tough votes. He used to get up in our caucus over there and get \nthe floor, and we knew what was coming when people were whining and \ncomplaining about facing a controversial vote or controversial debate. \nAnd he said:\n\n       If you don't want to fight fires don't be a fireman, and if \n     you don't want to cast tough votes don't run for Congress.\n\n  He was right. Whether you are on this side of the aisle or that side \nof the aisle, you better be prepared to face a tough vote and an \nimportant vote, and nothing is more important than a war, a war which \nhas so many of our great soldiers with their lives on the line as we \nstand in the safety of this Capitol Building.\n  I hope my colleagues on the Republican side will reconsider their \nposition. They cannot stop this debate. It is going to occur. It is \noccurring across America in family rooms, in offices, in schools, in \nrestaurants. Everywhere you turn, in the streets, in the shopping \ncenters, it is occurring. It is going to occur right here on the Senate \nfloor. They cannot hold back the tide. It is building against them. \nThat tide is going to push them over, and we are going to bring this \nissue to a debate on the floor. We owe it not only to the men and women \nin uniform, we owe it to the people who were kind enough to give us a \nchance to serve in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

FORD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, like his hero, Abraham Lincoln, Gerald \nFord helped heal our Nation. His calm leadership and fundamental \ndecency helped hold our Nation together at a time when the forces of \nwar and scandal threatened to tear it apart.\n  When he took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, President Ford \ndeclared, ``This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and \nhurts our hearts.'' During his Presidency, he worked to ease our minds, \ncomfort our hearts, and restore our faith in our government.\n  In his first official remarks as President, Gerald Ford promised \nAmerica:\n\n       In all my public and private acts as your president, I \n     expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with \n     full confidence that honesty is always the best policy at \n     hand.\n\n  Those were not just words to Gerald Ford, as he proved on October 17, \n1974, when he appeared voluntarily before Congress to give sworn \ntestimony--the only time a sitting President has done so about his \npardon of Richard Nixon.\n  Gerald Ford believed that pardoning Richard Nixon was the only way to \nend the long national nightmare of Watergate. He also believed that it \nmight end his political career. And he did pay a high price at the time \nin lost public approval and public trust.\n  Over time, however, many people came to see the Nixon pardon not as \nan act of collusion, but of courage and conciliation. In 2001, the \nKennedy Library Foundation awarded President Ford its John F. Kennedy \nProfile in Courage Award.\n  Gerald Ford believed in hard work and duty to one's country. At the \nUniversity of Michigan, he washed dishes at his fraternity house to \nearn money for college expenses. After graduating in the top quarter of \nhis class from Yale Law School, he returned home to Grand Rapids, MI, \nto practice law--but Pearl Harbor was attacked. Like so many young men \nof his generation, Gerald Ford put his life on hold. He enlisted in the \nNavy and spent the next 4 years in the service.\n  After the war, Gerald Ford decided to run for Congress and was \nsupported by Michigan's legendary Senator Arthur Vandenburg, one of the \narchitect's of American internationalism. His experience in World War \nII and his friendship with Senator Vandenberg helped turn him away from \nisolationism.\n  As President, he described himself as ``a moderate in domestic \naffairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool \ninternationalist in foreign affairs.'' In the 2\\1/2\\ years of his \nPresidency, he ended America's involvement in the war in Vietnam. He \nhelped mediate a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Egypt, signed \nthe Helsinki human rights convention with the Soviet Union and traveled \nto Vladivostok to sign an arms limitation agreement with Leonid \nBrezhnev, the Soviet President.\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\n  But what earned Gerald Ford the respect and gratitude of our Nation \nwas not only what he accomplished but how he accomplished those things. \nHe was a master of consensus-building, cooperation, and honorable \ncompromise.\n  It is notable that one of the first calls he made after becoming Vice \nPresident was to his old golfing buddy, Tip O'Neill. He set a standard \nfor bipartisanship that we would all do well to follow.\n  He was a good and honorable man who served this Nation well. He will \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2016-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of SGT \nRandy J. Matheny, 20, of McCook, NE.\n  Sergeant Matheny followed in the footsteps of his older siblings when \nhe joined the Nebraska Army National Guard on March 28, 2005, as a \nheavy vehicle driver in Detachment 1, 1057th Transportation Company in \nScottsbluff. His older sister, SSG Karen Matheny, is a full-time member \nof the Nebraska Army National Guard's HHD, 734th Transportation \nBattalion in Kearney. PFC Pat Matheny, his older brother, is an active-\nduty soldier with the U.S. Army. Both of Sergeant Matheny's siblings \nare serving in Iraq; his sister is currently serving her second tour, \nand his brother is preparing to deploy for his first.\n  Sergeant Matheny graduated from my alma mater, McCook Senior High \nSchool, in 2004. His teachers and friends knew him as a well-known, \nsoft-spoken student. In his free time, he enjoyed riding his motorcycle \nand spending time with his friends. After joining the Nebraska Army \nNational Guard in 2005, he attended basic training at Fort Jackson, SC, \nand then advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, in \n2006.\n  In June 2006, he transferred as a heavy vehicle driver to the \nNebraska Army National Guard Detachment 3, 1074th Transportation \nCompany based in Sidney. Sergeant Matheny was mobilized for duty in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom on July 15, 2006. The 1074th \nTransportation Company is responsible for providing security for \ntransportation missions throughout Iraq. On February 4, 2007, Sergeant \nMatheny passed away when an improvised explosive device detonated next \nto the armored security vehicle in which he was serving as a gunner. He \nwas 20 years old. Then-Specialist Matheny was posthumously promoted to \nsergeant.\n  The Matheny family from my hometown of McCook, NE, are the paradigm \nof courage and selflessness. In addition to his brother and sister, \nSergeant. Matheny is survived by his father Gary Matheny and mother Jan \nCollins. I offer my condolences to Sergeant Matheny's family and \nfriends who inspired and supported his career. He made the ultimate and \nmost valorous sacrifice so that future generations around the world \nwill live free, peaceful lives. Sergeant Matheny will be forever \nremembered as a hero.\n\n\n                         Colonel Brian Allgood\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to praise the memory of Army COL \nBrian Dwayne Allgood of the 30th Medical Brigade, European Regional \nMedical Command. Colonel Allgood was taken from his family late last \nmonth in Iraq. He was only 46 years old, and the highest ranking \nmedical officer in Iraq.\n  After graduating high school in Colorado Springs, Brian Allgood \nattended the U.S. Military Academy in West Point and medical school at \nthe University of Oklahoma. He completed his residency at Brooke Army \nMedical Center in San Antonio and continued with his military career, \nrising to become one of the Army's top surgeons. Most recently, before \nbeing sent to Iraq, Colonel Allgood spent 2 years as the commanding \nofficer of medical facilities in Korea.\n  It is no surprise that Brian Allgood rose to such great heights. \nBrian came from a medical family and a military family--Brian's father \nJerry was an Army hospital administrator like his son, and Brian's \nmother Cleo was a nurse. One might say that service, both to his \ncountry and to those in need, was in his blood.\n  Brian Allgood was a healer, a quiet and humble man who knew the best \nway to lead was not through anger or boastfulness. Instead, he simply \ndid what needed to be done, helping save and improve lives every day, \nand in doing so led by example.\n  Colonel Allgood acted not only with courage but with concern for the \ntroops he led. He was renowned for his willingness to stick his neck \nout for his troops and for his unique bond with them. To better \nunderstand the risks posed to paratroopers, Colonel Allgood completed \nthe grueling Ranger school and parachuted into Panama in 1989. He \nserved as the commanding officer of the hospital at West Point. As a \nsurgeon and later a commanding medical officer, he played a role in the \nsaving of hundreds, if not thousands, of American lives.\n  And as the top Army surgeon in Iraq, Colonel Allgood also oversaw the \nsystem that tended Iraqis in need of urgent care. Every day we hear \nstories from Iraq of innocent bystanders facing brutality in their own \nstreets. Who knows how many Iraqis are alive today because of the \ntalent and wisdom of Colonel Allgood and those he led?\n  Colonel Allgood's parents, Jerry and Cleo, have been supportive of \nnot only their son but all Colorado veterans, and I am privileged to \nhave worked with them on veterans concerns in my State. Jerry and Cleo \nare good people and should take great pride in having raised their son \nfrom a young boy into an exemplary man: a fine doctor, a thoughtful son \nand brother, a loving husband, and a caring father.\n  To Brian's wife Jane and his son Wyatt, I cannot imagine the sorrow \nand loss you are feeling, and I hope that in time your grief can be \nsalved by your pride in the way Brian lived his life. Brian served his \nNation with honor and distinction and improved the lives of countless \nsoldiers, families and those with whom he interacted every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2016-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2016-S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n\n                         Dr. William Neal Brown\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator \nRobert Menendez and our House colleague Congressman Donald Payne in \nhonoring Dr. William Neal Brown, a distinguished and inspiring figure \nin African-American history. In recognition of Black History Month, we \ngathered with residents of New Jersey to pay tribute to Dr. Brown on \nSaturday, February 10, 2007 at the Newark Museum in Newark, NJ, during \n``A Salute to Heroes.''\n  Dr. Brown was born in Warrenton, GA, on February 24, 1919. His father \nwas an ex-slave and his mother was Native American. He grew up in \nAliquippa, PA, where his father labored as a farmer and steel mill \nworker. His love of learning and inspiration to educate others began at \nan early age, when he and six of his classmates dreamed of becoming \nteachers.\n  After graduating with honors from high school, Dr. Brown went to work \nin the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt's public works program that put over 3 million young men and \nadults to work during the Great Depression. It was here that he was \nintroduced to the Hampton Institute, where he would enroll as a work-\nstudy student and proceed to graduate with a bachelor of science in \n1941.\n  Dr. Brown heeded the call to serve his country and enrolled in the \nArmy Air Force, where he served in special services as an information \neducation officer, and trained at various bases including with the \nTuskegee Airmen in Tuskegee, AL. After the war, on the GI bill, Dr. \nBrown began his graduate studies, first at Columbia University and then \nat City College.\n  After 3 years of social work at the Veterans' Administration in \nNewark, NJ, Dr. Brown became the first African-American professor at \nRutgers, the State University of New Jersey.\n  During his 41 years as a professor at Rutgers, Dr. Brown mentored and \ninspired countless students and future social workers. He has lived his \nlife by a verse he often quotes from Thanatopsis by William Cullen \nBryant: ``So live, that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable \ncaravan that went to sway to the silent halls of death, thou go not \nlike a quarry-slave at night, scourged to his dungeon, but sustained \nand soothed by an unfaltering trust. Approach thy grave as one who lies \ndown to pleasant dreams.''\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that Dr. William Neal Brown is an \nexemplary and committed leader and a true role model for our State and \nthe entire country. I am pleased to pay tribute to him today, and I \nknow my colleagues will join me in wishing him continued success.\n\n\n                            DeNorval Unthank\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, each Congress I rise to honor February as \nBlack History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has \nrecognized the contributions of Black Americans to the history of our \nNation.\n  This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black \nAmerican history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham \nLincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in \nthe month of February. The 15th amendment to the Constitution was \nratified 136 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in \nthe right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People was founded in February in New York City. And on \nFebruary 25, 1870, this body welcomed its first Black Senator, Hiram R. \nRevels of Mississippi.\n  In this important month I want to celebrate some of the contributions \nmade by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since Marcus Lopez, \nwho sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the first person of \nAfrican descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great many Black \nAmericans have helped shape the history of my State. This is the second \ntime this month I have come to the floor to highlight some of their \nstories.\n  Dr. DeNorval Unthank arrived in the Portland, OR, after completing \nmedical school at Howard University in Washington, DC. Dr. Unthank was \nrecruited to Portland in 1929 because the city needed a Black doctor. \nHe was quickly tested as his White neighbors greeted his first attempt \nto move into a previously all White residential area with broken \nwindows, threatening phone calls, and general harassment. Dr. Unthank \nhad to move his family four times before finding a peaceful place to \nsettle down.\n  Throughout the 1930s, Dr. Unthank was Portland's only Black medical \npractitioner. He was a dedicated doctor and a friend to any minority \ngroup in the city. Black families could not receive treatment in \nhospitals at that time and house calls were necessary. Dr. Unthank made \nhimself available day and night and served African Americans, Asians, \nas well as many Whites.\n  Dr. Unthank was politically active and was outspoken in his support \nof civil rights and equal opportunity. In 1940, Dr. Unthank was elected \nhead of the Advisory Council, an organization that hoped to pressure \nlocal leaders into providing equal access to economic opportunities \nrelated to WWII jobs. The Council documented incidents of \ndiscrimination in the workplace around Portland.\n  During and after World War II, Dr. Unthank worked tirelessly to build \nhis medical practice and promote civil rights. He became the first \nBlack member of Portland's City Club in 1943. He encouraged the club to \npublish a significant 1945 study called ``The Negro in Portland,'' \nwhich opened the eyes of many citizens to ongoing discriminatory \npractices. Dr. Unthank also served as president of the local chapter of \nthe NAACP and was a cofounder of the Portland Urban League. He played a \nstrong role in the passing of Oregon's 1953 civil rights bill, which \namong many issues, overturned a law banning interracial marriages in \nthe State.\n  In 1958, the Oregon Medical Society named him Doctor of the Year. In \nrecognition of his service to civil rights, grateful citizens pressed \nthe city to dedicate DeNorval Unthank Park in North Portland in his \nhonor in 1969. Dr. Unthank once said, ``A Negro may have a few more \ndoors closed to him and he may find them a little harder to open, but \nhe can open them. He must keep trying.''\n  Dr. Unthank is only one example of the Black men and women who \nchanged the course of history in Oregon and in the United States. \nDuring the remainder of Black History Month, I will return to the floor \nto celebrate more Oregonians like Dr. DeNorval Unthank, whose \ncontributions, while great, have not yet received the attention they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                          black history month\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise, as many do this month, to \njoin in the nationwide recognition of African- American history. Every \nFebruary, the Nation joins in the celebration of the sacrifice, \nperseverance, and advancement of African Americans. The idea of an \nAfrican-American history month was proposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a \nson of former slaves. Dr. Woodson, who became a prominent scholar in \nAfrican-American studies, worked tirelessly to ensure that the \ncontribution of African Americans would not be forgotten.\n  In an article written for Johnson's Publications, Lerone Bennett \ntells us that one of the most inspiring and instructive stories in \nAfrican-American history is the story of Woodson's struggle and rise \nfrom the coal mines of West Virginia to the summit of academic \nachievement: ``At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \nBlack history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching \nhimself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, he entered high \nschool and mastered the four-year curriculum in less than two years. At \n22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he \nreturned to the coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to \nthe mine shafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \nreceived bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where \nhe became the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest \nis history--Black history.''\n  It is important to honor the legacy of Dr. Woodson and other African-\nAmerican pioneers who led the advancement of African Americans in a \nnation once lacking in humanity towards them. In the spirit of honoring \nthose legacies, I pay homage to two women, claimed by my home State of \nMichigan, who played pivotal roles in the struggle for civil rights and \nhuman rights. Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks were women of different \ntimes, yet similar courage, and effectively raised awareness for the \ninequality and injustice of their eras. Both have been recently honored \nby Congress. It was my privilege to cosponsor legislation, enacted on \nDecember 20, 2006, authorizing a bust of Sojourner Truth to be \nprominently displayed in the United States Capitol, and it was also my \nprivilege to cosponsor legislation, signed into law on December 1, \n2005, which directs the Architect of the Capitol to place a statue of \nRosa Parks in National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol. Sojourner \nTruth and Rosa Parks will become the first African-American women to be \nrepresented in this place of honor of notable people of History.\n  These are truly two phenomenal women, not just in African-American \nhistory, but in American History. Sojourner Truth, although unable to \nread and write, was widely accepted as one of the most effective \nspokespersons of her time. She spoke eloquently and energetically about \nthe inhumanity and immorality of slavery. Truth also worked toward \nother social goals, especially women's rights. In 1851, she delivered \nher famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' speech at the historic Women's \nConvention in Akron, OH. Sojourner Truth attacked both racist and \nsexist notions during her speech when she said, ``Then that little man \nin back there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause \nChrist wasn't a woman? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a \nwoman! Man had nothing to do with Him.''\n  Sojourner Truth settled in Battle Creek, MI, during the mid-1850s. \nShe traveled throughout the State during the Civil War to collect food \nand clothing for African-American volunteer units. Truth also traveled \nto Washington, DC, in 1864 to meet with President Abraham Lincoln. \nTruth became a close advisor to the President on assisting freed \nslaves. While in Washington, Truth also appeared at women's suffrage \ngatherings. As a result of illness, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle \nCreek in 1875.\n  Born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, she died Sojourner Truth in 1883. \nAlthough she was born in chains, her legacy lives in fame. Michigan \nhonored Sojourner Truth and her extraordinary legacy with the \ndedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument. Located in Battle \nCreek, MI, this monument was unveiled on September 25, 1999.\n  On November 2, 2005, I joined over 4,000 mourners at Greater Grace \nTemple to celebrate the life of Rosa Parks\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nat her funeral in Detroit, MI. Just a few days earlier, Rosa Parks \nbecame the first woman in the history of the United States to lie in \nhonor in the Capitol Rotunda. And, a few years earlier on June 15, \n1999, Rosa Parks was presented with the highest honor of Congress, the \nCongressional Gold Medal. The actions of Rosa Parks merit such honor, \nas her silent resistance to the humiliation and demoralization of \nracial segregation sparked the civil rights movement. Over 51 years ago \nin Montgomery, AL, she refused to give up her seat and move to the back \nof the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman and her \nact of peaceful rebellion captured the conscience of the American \npeople and the world. For Rosa Parks, this was but a small part of a \nlifetime of struggle for equality and justice. In fact, 12 years \nearlier, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another segregation \nlaw, which required African Americans to pay their fares at the front \nof the bus, then exit and reenter at the rear door. The driver of that \nbus was the same driver that would order Rosa Parks to the back of the \nbus in December of 1955.\n  The boycott of the bus system in Montgomery was a direct result of \nRosa Parks' actions, which sparked a movement that called attention to \nthe plight of African Americans nationwide and introduced the world to \nthe civil rights movement and its young leader, who would one day have \na national holiday declared in his honor, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and \nequality for all. But we still have work to do. We must rededicate \nourselves to continuing the struggle for civil rights and human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2018-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEALERS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the demand for firearms by criminals and \nother prohibited purchasers is high. Unfortunately, there are also some \ndealers willing to supply those firearms. The simple fact is that \ncriminals would not be able to so readily acquire weapons without gun \ndealers who are willing to bypass gun sales laws. This willingness by \nsome licensed gun dealers to supply gun traffickers with firearms \nprovides a steady flow of guns into the illegal market.\n  Multiple sales of the same model of gun to an individual are \nconsidered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, \nATF, to be among the prime indicators that gun trafficking is occurring \nfrom a gun shop. Gun collectors generally do not collect duplicates of \nthe same firearm. The attempt to make multiple purchases of the same \nweapon should raise a red flag for the dealer to the possibility of \ntrafficking, and reports of multiple sales to the ATF by responsible \ngun dealers provide a significant percentage of leads for gun \ntrafficking investigations. According to ATF reports, handguns sold as \npart of multiple sales comprised nearly a quarter of all guns sold in \n1999 that were traced to crime that same year. Moreover, guns with \nobliterated serial numbers, a clear sign of trafficking, are \nsubstantially more likely to have been part of a multiple sale. Dealers \nare responsible for the products they sell, and they must be held \naccountable to inquire about the purpose the buyer declares for \npurchasing multiple handguns at one time and report such suspicious \nbehavior to the ATF. One step several States have taken in order to \naddress the issue of multiple purchases is instituting a one-handgun-\nper-month purchasing restriction.\n  Another common tool traffickers use to acquire firearms from licensed \ndealers is to avoid multiple sale reporting requirements by waiting \nshort periods of time between handgun purchases. During a police \noperation in Chicago, some dealers suggested to undercover officers \nthat they space out their purchases in order to avoid detection by law \nenforcement. Under Federal law, dealers are required to report only \nsales of two or more handguns within a 5 day period to the ATF. By \nencouraging purchasers to stagger their purchases every 6 days, a \ndealer would be able to circumvent reporting potential trafficking to \nlaw enforcement.\n  Using in-store accomplices to fill out the required Federal paperwork \nis also a common method gun traffickers employ. The most obvious sign \nof this occurs when the person who fills out the Federal purchasing \nforms is not the person looking at, handling, or selecting the gun to \nbe purchased or paying for the weapon. Even if the purchaser is buying \nonly a single handgun, this type of sale should not be permitted by a \nlicensed gun dealer.\n  These types of illegal transactions likely occur every day in some \nlicensed gun dealerships across the country.

This \nwonderful outpouring of gratitude has reached across the VA health care \nsystem's 155 hospitals, their 130-plus nursing homes, and 45 \ndomiciliaries--which comprise the Nation's largest integrated health \ncare system.\n  I commend each and every person who has or will use this week as an \nopportunity to show their gratitude and respect to hospitalized \nveterans. Yet I do not feel that we should stop when this week ends. \nHospitalized veterans, and all veterans, should remain in our hearts \nand minds throughout the year. With them in mind, I want to discuss, at \nthis fitting moment, the President's budget proposal for VA.\n  I am concerned that President Bush's budget for VA medical care is \nout of touch with the demands being placed on the VA health care \nsystem. After accounting for inflation and increased utilization costs, \nPresident Bush's budget for VA health care translates to a mere \nfourteen-hundredth of a 1-percent increase in VA's health care budget. \nThe President proposes that the VA health system's budget stays \nvirtually the same, while veterans' needs are changing and increasing.\n  Nearly 3,500 men and women in uniform have lost their lives in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and nearly 25,000 have been wounded in action. \nVeterans of previous wars are increasingly facing age-related health \nconcerns. This is a critical time of critical need. At this time, is a \nbudget increase translating to less than one-seventh of one percent \nresponsible? Is it really enough?\n  We should salute our hospitalized veterans by providing the funds for \nthe health care they need and have earned. After all, who can accept \nthe alternative? Should we turn away aging veterans? Deny proper \nmedical care to the physically wounded and mentally scarred? Is it any \ngood to have a week honoring hospitalized veterans if we do not tend to \ntheir wounds in the coming year?\n  I believe serving veterans is a priority, especially those with \nurgent, pressing medical needs. On this week as much as any other, we \nmust make attending to those needs a budget priority as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2018-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2018-S2019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE TRAGEDY AT TROLLEY SQUARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to \nthe many heroes who have emerged out of a horrific tragedy that took \nplace in my home State this week.\n  On Monday evening, February 12th, a lone gunman entered Trolley \nSquare, a bustling shopping, dining, and entertainment plaza located in \nSalt Lake City. For the next several minutes he randomly shot and \nkilled five people and wounded four others--leaving a path of \ndestruction and a community in utter shock and grief.\n  Those who lost their lives that evening included: Teresa Ellis and \nher friend Brad Frantz; Kirsten Hinckley, a 15-year-old sophomore at \nBrighton High School; Vanessa Quinn who was meeting her husband at \nTrolley Square to shop for a long-awaited wedding ring; and Jeffery \nWalker, a Utah marketing director.\n  In the ensuing minutes, shoppers scrambled for cover and feared for \ntheir lives. Shop owners corralled customers\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nand helped them take refuge in closets, backrooms, and hidden cubby \nholes. Frantic 9-1-1 calls were placed by many and within minutes \ncourageous police officers had contained the suspect.\n  As the story unfolded, one hero stood out in the chaotic terror. Off-\nduty Ogden police officer Kenneth Hammond was at Trolley Square having \na pre-Valentines Day dinner with his pregnant wife, Sarita. As they \nwere finishing their meal, the Hammonds heard popping noises and looked \nover the mall balcony to see bodies laying below.\n  Officer Hammond sent his wife back to call the police and lockdown \nthe restaurant. Shouting his name to let customers know he was an off-\nduty police officer, and not a second gunman, he made his way to the \nbottom level. He engaged the shooter in a gun battle hoping to distract \nhim from killing any other innocent people. Running out of ammunition, \nhe was soon joined by a Salt Lake City officer and members of the SWAT \nteam. Within about 9 minutes, the battle was over--the suspect lay dead \nalong with five beloved members of our community.\n  We can only imagine the terror that the brave Hammonds felt. Mrs. \nHammond, fearing for her husband's safety, bravely went to protect \nother shoppers and alert authorities. Officer Hammond, fearing he would \nnot be recognized as a law enforcement official since he was off duty \nand in another jurisdiction, still selflessly reacted to save lives.\n  Without a moment's hesitation, Officer Hammond put the needs of our \ncommunity first before any thought for his own safety or well-being.\n  There is no question his heroic acts saved countless other lives that \ncould have been lost on that tragic evening.\n  Words cannot express the vital role his selfless service and \ncourageous action played in ending the massacre.\n  Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank described Officer Hammond's \nquick action and courage this way: ``Going in and engaging a subject \nwho was well armed and prepared to engage him, without having the \nbenefits of a uniform, extra equipment or magazines for his firearms, \nis truly heroic.''\n  In addition to Officer Hammond, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the many, many other police officers from various law \nenforcement agencies who responded to the calls for help. Precisely and \ncourageously these officers went about their duties evacuating the \npremises, getting immediate help for hurt victims, comforting the \ngrief-stricken shoppers, and containing the crime scene. I want to \ncommend the rapid response of law enforcement agencies who worked \ntogether on a crime scene of this magnitude. I am proud of all of the \nofficers who rendered such important service.\n  It is hard to understand why something this horrific happens in life. \nBut in this time of our deepest sorrow, it has been comforting to \nwitness so many wonderful Utahns who have stepped up to lighten the \nburdens of those involved.\n  Neighbors in the vicinity of Trolley Square opened their homes to \nshell-shocked shoppers that night as a refuge to wait for further \ninstructions. Total strangers hugged and comforted those leaving the \nmall who desperately needed a strong shoulder to lean on, and grief \ncounseling services are being made available to those impacted by this \ntragedy. As neighbors and fellow Utahns, we are united in our grief and \ndesire to comfort those suffering.\n  My home State has suffered a tragedy of incomprehensible magnitude. \nThe actions of one determined to kill will have an impact on many of \nour wonderful citizens for years to come. As difficult as this has been \nand will continue to be, the examples of selfless service and heroic \nacts will never be forgotten.\n  I have been deeply touched by so many who truly made a difference in \nthe aftermath of this tragedy. Elaine and I pray that our Heavenly \nFather's peace will comfort the family members and friends of the \nvictims, as well as all who have been forever touched by this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2019-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING JUDGE THOMAS E. FAIRCHILD\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of one of the \ngreat jurists in the history of my State and someone I was honored to \ncall a friend and mentor: Judge Thomas Fairchild.\n  Judge Fairchild earned the respect of all who knew him for his keen \nmind, his kind manner, and his humility. His long and distinguished \ncareer in public service included serving as Wisconsin's attorney \ngeneral, as a State supreme court justice, and as Federal appeals court \njudge on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he rose to \nbecome chief judge. He held that position from 1975 to 1981 when he \nbecame a senior judge on the appeals court.\n  Judge Fairchild stood for justice and equality in his work on the \nbench, and his work in politics as he made a courageous run for Senate \nagainst Joe McCarthy in 1952. Through that and other efforts, he played \na critical role in efforts to revitalize the State's Democratic Party.\n  Judge Fairchild was a brilliant legal mind and a man of exceptional \ncharacter. He was also an extremely special person in my family and a \ngreat friend of my father's. As is the case with anyone who has known \nme for more than 40 years, he called me Rusty.\n  Whenever my father, Leon Feingold, or my mother, Sylvia Feingold, \nreferred to Judge Fairchild, it was always with reverence. Some of the \nbiggest decisions of his career were made, at least in part, in our \nliving room. I have always been deeply proud of that fact.\n  The Thomas E. Fairchild lecture at University of Wisconsin Law \nSchool, established in 1988 as a tribute to Judge Fairchild, is just \none reflection of his tremendous stature in Wisconsin. When I delivered \nthe Fairchild lecture in 2005, with Judge Fairchild listening in the \naudience, it was a great honor for me, and a wonderful experience.\n  I am deeply saddened by the passing of Judge Fairchild, for the loss \nthis means for his family, and for all those who knew him. He was one \nof our State's great legal minds, and one of our most dedicated public \nservants. I feel so fortunate to have known him, and so grateful for \nthe many things he taught me and the many kindnesses he showed me over \nthe years. The work he did, and the life he lived, will continue to \nenrich Wisconsin and the Nation for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2019-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2019-S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             SPAY DAY 2007\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

KDMC was recently \nselected as an award winner in the 2006 Solucient 100 Top Hospitals: \nCardiovascular Benchmarks for Success Study, 8th Edition.\n  Solucient developed the 100 Top Cardiovascular Hospitals study to \nidentify hospitals that are the highest performers in the Nation in \ncardiovascular service, and to set performance targets for improving \nclinical outcomes and management practices. To qualify, hospitals must \nachieve high scores across eight equally weighted performance criteria \nthat reflect clinical processes and outcomes, volume, efficiency and \ncost for four treatment areas: acute myocardial infarction, congestive \nheart failure, coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary \nintervention.\n  In addition to this prestigious award, KDMC also received a five-star \nrating for cardiothoracic surgery. This placed KDMC in the top 5 \npercent in the Nation and No. 1 in Kentucky for cardiac surgery.\n  I congratulate KDMC on this outstanding achievement. Their service to \nthe citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is an inspiration to all. \nI look forward to all that KDMC accomplishes in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2020-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING SAVE THE CHILDREN USA\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I recognize Save the \nChildren USA's 75th anniversary. I am proud to say that Save the \nChildren work began in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Today, Save the \nChildren continues to work in 33 different sites in Kentucky rural \ncommunities, serving approximately 3,000 children in need.\n  This program was founded on January 7, 1932, in response to the needs \nof children and families struggling to survive the Great Depression in \nthe Appalachian mountain region of Harlan County, KY. In 1938 Save the \nChildren launched a Hot School Lunch program for undernourished \nchildren in nine States. Later it became one of the models for the \nnational school lunch program.\n  Today, the organization's U.S. programs concentrate on literacy and \nnutrition programs benefiting over 20,000 children in areas of constant \nrural poverty in 12 States. Internationally, Save the Children works in \nmore than 50 developing countries helping children by providing food, \nmedical services and shelter to those in need.\n  Once again I congratulate Save the Children USA on their 75th \nanniversary. I appreciate the dedication of Save the Children to this \nworthy cause and their hard work is greatly affecting the lives of many \npeople. Everyone involved in this organization is truly an inspiration \nto all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2020-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN EDUARDO REYES\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor CPT Eduardo \nReyes, a retired pilot who flew for Philippine Airlines.\n  On December 11, 1994, Captain Reyes was piloting Philippine Airlines \nflight 434, from Manila to Tokyo, when a bomb planted by now-convicted \nterrorist Ramzi Yousef was detonated on board the aircraft. The blast \nimmediately killed 1 Japanese businessman and injured 10 others. It \nalso caused the plane's controls to stop functioning normally, putting \nthe lives of everybody aboard the plane at risk.\n  In this most trying of situations, Captain Reyes and his crew rose to \nthe challenge. Controlling the altitude of the plane via the throttle--\nwhich I understand is an extremely difficult thing to do--Captain Reyes \nkept the plane in the air for nearly an hour before making an emergency \nlanding in Okinawa. His courageous actions and outstanding skill as a \npilot helped avert a great disaster and save the lives of 272 \npassengers and 20 crew members.\n  Captain Reyes later had the courage to testify on behalf of the \nUnited States against al-Qaida master bomber Ramzi Yousef. In 1994, \nYousef was working on a master plan, often called the Bojinka Plot, to \nbomb 12 U.S. passenger jets over the Pacific Ocean in a 2-day period, \nkilling over 4000 civilians. The bombing of Captain Reyes' plane was a \ntest run for that plan. And, as many here remember, Yousef was also \nresponsible for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. Captain \nReyes' testimony at Ramzi Yousef's 1996 trial helped to put one of the \nworld's most dangerous terrorists in prison for life.\n  For his valor and clear thinking on December 11, 1994, and for his \ncontribution to the fight against terrorism by testifying against Ramzi \nYousef, I would like to commend Captain Reyes. The United States and \ncountries throughout the world are indebted to him for these brave \nactions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2020-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ANTONIO PIERRO\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last week our country and the State \nof Massachusetts lost a favorite son. Antonio Pierro passed away last \nweek at the age of 110. Today would have been his 111th birthday.\n  The Guinness World Records has said that Pierro was America's oldest \nwar veteran, having served in World War I, and the oldest American man \nin its records. Only seven veterans of WWI are still known to be alive.\n  Pierro was born in Italy in 1896 and lived there before he immigrated \nto the United States in 1914. Only 3 short years later, he was drafted \ninto the Army and sent to France to fight in WWI. Pierro was given the \nopportunity to fight for the Italians, an ally of the United States, \nbut instead chose to fight for his new homeland.\n  Once his service was completed he followed his father and brothers \nback to Swampscott, MA and spent the rest of his life as a resident of \nthe Bay State. His love for America was evident to all of those he met. \nHis nephew, Richard Pierro said, ``When he left Italy, he left for \ngood. This was the promised land. He didn't want to go back, even if \nyou offered him free passage.''\n  Pierro worked at a shoe plant, managed a body shop and eventually \nspent 17 years at General Electric in Lynn until his retirement, 46 \nyears ago, in 1961. His family attributes his longevity to his strict \nadherence to three square meals a day and lots of sleep. Pierro lived \nby simple rules of life and remained dedicated to leading a simple, \ngood life until the day he passed. His is remembered as having a \n``twinkle in his eye'' and a gratitude for all that life had offered \nhim. He lived in three different centuries, and he lived well.\n  I ask that we remember him today as a veteran, a true American, and a \ntestament to life's many gifts and surprises. Our country is honored by \nhis service but also thankful for the lessons his life offers about \npatriotism, family, and the simple pleasures of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2020-5", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2020-S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING THE MISS SELMA'S SHOOTERS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I honor the sixth grade girls' basketball team of Miss \nSelma's school in Little Rock, AR, for finishing in first place of the \nregular basketball season.\n  This is a team that is comprised of eight basketball players who have \nplayed together since the third grade. The talented members of the team \nare: Sam Anderson, Elizabeth Campbell, Cassidy Johnson, Paige Logsdon, \nAudrey Peters, Laura Russell, Gracie Sloan, and Peyton Watts.\n  While all the teams in the league are worthy of mention, the regular \nseason came down to one game, a match-up with the Little Rock Christian \nteam. Little Rock Christian has a great team. In fact, the Little Rock \nChristian team has a dynasty and they had never been beaten in 4 years \nof play and had won all 70 games they had ever played. The game \nshowcased great athleticism displayed by both teams. The battle was \nintense for the duration of the contest. The difference in the game was \ndecided by a free throw made in the last few seconds, which gave a 16 \nto 15 victory to the Miss Selma's Shooters. It was a classic and will \nbe remembered for many years by all that witnessed it and both teams \ndeserve credit for the manner and intensity for which they competed.\n  I would like my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Miss \nSelma's\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nShooters sixth grade girls' basketball team for winning the regular \nseason. But most of all please join me in thanking them for the way in \nwhich they show appreciation to the game and to all teams that they \nplay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE FORT\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

MARTIN PARISH\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nbicentennial of St. Martin Parish. As one of the original 19 parishes \ncreated from the Territory of Orleans, St. Martin will celebrate its \n200th anniversary in 2007.\n  St. Martin Parish was initially established in 1756 by the French \nGovernment as the ``Postes des Attakapas.'' It was originally the site \nof an Indian trading post and was later turned into a Spanish military-\nadministrative center. In 1807, when the Territory of Orleans was \ndivided into the original 19 parishes, St. Martin Parish was the last \nto be created. The parish at that time included the present parishes of \nSt. Martin, St. Mary, Lafayette, Vermillion, and Iberia.\n  The structure of St. Martin Parish has remained virtually unchanged \nsince 1868. It is divided by an arm of Iberia Parish into the upper and \nlower portions of the parish. The upper portion consists of the \ncommunities of St. Martinville, Breaux Bridge, Parks, Henderson, and a \nportion of Arnaudville. The lower portion borders the East Atchafalaya \nBasin Levee and consists of the unincorporated areas of Stephensville \nand Belle River.\n  A population rich in diversity and cultural theory calls St. Martin \nParish home. In the late 1700s, 3,000 French Canadians fled British \npersecution, finding refuge in south Louisiana. The birth of Acadiana \ncan be attributed to the settling of 200 of these refugees in present \nday St. Martinville in 1765. There, the Acadians were introduced to \nenslaved Africans tending cattle for French landowners.\n  Refugees fleeing the French Revolution as well as Spanish-speaking \nMalagans also arrived in the settlement. Creole families from New \nOrleans and Mobile along with Anglo-Americans soon followed. German \nwheat farmers trying to find a place in the rice industry, along with \nItalian merchants and Irish workers building the railroads began to \ncall St. Martin Parish home in the 1880s. These founding cultures, \nFrench, Acadian, African, Italian, and Spanish, have maintained their \ncultural identities while simultaneously blending together to form one \nculture that is uniquely St. Martin Parish.\n  St. Martin Parish encompasses the copious and picturesque regions \nthat extend from the Bayou Teche to the Atchafalaya Basin. An \nagriculturally prosperous area, St. Martin Parish is comprised of sugar \ncane fields, low-lying swamps, and majestic waterways. Regal oak trees \ndraped with moss frame passageways throughout the parish. With its \ndistinctive cultures and striking scenery, St. Martin Parish has come \nto embody the definition of the Louisiana way of life.\n  Today, I would like to applaud the good people of St. Martin Parish \non the bicentennial and wish them continued prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2021-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2021-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2021-5", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 602. A bill to develop the next generation of parental control \ntechnology; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to introduce two communications \nbills. First, I am introducing the Child Safe Viewing Act, a bill to \ndevelop the next generation of parental control technology. Last year, \nfollowing several hearings and forums on decency, I concluded that the \nV-Chip is not an adequate solution for parents to prevent their \nchildren from viewing adult content, especially in a world of 500 \nchannels and video streaming.\n  During the 1996 Telecommunications Act debate, President Clinton \nurged inclusion of a mandatory V-Chip device, and in collaboration with \nCongress, the FCC, and the entertainment industry, the V-Chip was born. \nThe V-Chip was an important beginning to control child access to adult \nmaterial. Over a decade has passed since the 1996 act, and the world of \ncommunications has changed. However, the issues that inspired the V-\nChip continue to exist today for not only television but for the \nInternet and other video streaming devices.\n  The Child Safe Viewing Act is a pragmatic approach to addressing the \npitfalls of video content not intended for kids, and it acts on current \nlaw. It simply directs the Federal Communications Commission to begin a \nproceeding on the requirements in section 551 of the V-Chip law. \nSection 551 states that the Commission shall take action on alternative \nblocking technology as it is developed. This mandate is clear and the \ntime has come. We must engage in this issue now to ensure that families \nhave the tools to keep inappropriate and sometimes dangerous material \nout of their children's view.\n  I am also introducing ED 1.0, a bill to advance online higher \neducation opportunities for minorities. Last Congress, Senator Allen \nand I introduced a bill that would establish a digital and wireless \nnetwork technology program for minority-serving institutions, and it \nwas reported favorably by the Commerce Committee. Regrettably, I am \nconcerned that the cost of the bill will prohibit it from moving in \nthis Congress. But the needs to this Nation's minorities are not \nstanding still.\n  ED 1.0 would allow some of our goals to move forward now by creating \na pilot online degree program at four minority-serving institutions. \nAfrican-American, Hispanic, and tribal serving colleges and \nuniversities in socially and economically disadvantaged areas would be \neligible to participate in this program to help define what works in \nensuring that minorities are obtaining higher education degrees.\n  With the high costs of networks and limited availability of \nresources, the program would provide a national ``lessons learned'' \nabout how to develop and implement flexible degree programs in fields \nsuch as health or education, which are currently underserved in the \ndisadvantaged community. The goals of ED 1.0 will make education a \nreality for thousands of Americans, and I hope this bill will have the \nsupport of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln):\n  S. 604. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to limit \nincreases in the certain costs of health care services under the \nheaalth care programs of the Department of Defense, and for the \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Military \nHealth\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\nCare Protection Act along with my colleagues, Senators Hagel, Kerry, \nand Lincoln.\n  This important legislation will keep the Pentagon from dramatically \nraising health care fees on active duty military personnel, National \nGuard, Reserves, retirees and their families.\n  Our bill will limit increases to TRICARE military health insurance \nenrollment fees, deductibles, and pharmacy co-payments for those \nmilitary retirees who are enrolled in TRICARE. Under this legislation, \nincreases in these health care fees cannot exceed the rate of growth in \nuniformed services beneficiaries' military compensation, thereby \nprotecting beneficiaries from an undue financial burden.\n  Our bill will also cap increases to TRICARE military health insurance \npharmacy co-payments at current levels for those active duty military \npersonnel, National Guard, Reserves members, and their families. Under \nthis legislation, increases in such fees also cannot exceed the rate of \ngrowth in uniformed services beneficiaries' military compensation.\n  Just last week, the Department of Defense (DOD) submitted its Fiscal \nYear 2008 budget to Congress. Within that budget, a cut of $1.86 \nbillion was made to TRICARE out of the Defense Health Program budget. \nSuch a cut would require a doubling of fees on senior enlisted retirees \nand a tripling of such fees for officer retirees. This would mean \nincreases of up to $1,000 annually for some military retirees. While \nthe Department of Defense temporarily halted plans to raise fees last \nyear at the direction of Congress, we are again faced with this \nchallenge. We must pass legislation now that limits the amount of any \nhealth care increase and protects beneficiaries from extreme health \ncare fee increases in the future.\n  With this bill, Senator Hagel and I reiterate our commitment to our \ntroops and future veterans by assuring them that just as they protected \nus, we will take care of them when their service ends.\n  Last year, Congress rejected the same increases that the Pentagon is \nproposing again for this year. I ask the support of my colleagues to \npass this legislation this year to prevent these significant increases \npermanently.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Health Care \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the uniformed services and their \n     families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of \n     the last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n     are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n       (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n       (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n     benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n     employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n     members of the uniformed services are turning for health care \n     services to the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE \n     program, for the health care benefits in retirement that they \n     earned by their service in uniform.\n       (6) In some cases, civilian employers establish financial \n     incentives for employees who are also eligible for \n     participation in the TRICARE program to receive health care \n     benefits under that program rather than under the health care \n     benefits programs of such employers.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n     large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n     larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n     retired members of the uniformed services.\n       (8) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program \n     far exceeds the 33-percent increase in military retired pay \n     since such fees, deductibles, and copayments were first \n     required on the part of retired members of the uniformed \n     services 11 years ago.\n       (9) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n     the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n     members of the uniformed services who are participants in the \n     TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such \n     members paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for \n     health care in retirement through their extended sacrifices \n     by service in uniform.\n       (10) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n     accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs, and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements, for health care services.\n       (11) The Department of Defense has chosen to count the \n     accrual deposit to the Department of Defense Military Retiree \n     Health Care Fund against the budget of the Department of \n     Defense, contrary to the requirements of section 1116 of \n     title 10, United States Code.\n       (12) Senior officials of the Department of Defense leaders \n     have reported to Congress that counting such deposits against \n     the budget of the Department of Defense is impinging on other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces, including weapons \n     programs, an inappropriate situation which section 1116 of \n     title 10, United States Code, was intended expressly to \n     prevent.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the uniformed services that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the uniformed services \n     who participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE \n     program, and should pursue any and all such options rather \n     than seeking large increases for enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments for such retirees, and their \n     families or survivors, who do participate in that program;\n       (3) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program \n     for retired members of the uniformed services and their \n     families or survivors should not in any case exceed the \n     percentage increase in military retired pay; and\n       (4) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments under the TRICARE program that may be considered \n     for members of the uniformed services who are currently \n     serving on active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and for \n     the families of such members, should not exceed the \n     percentage increase in basic pay for such members.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS \n                   FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Pharmacy Benefits Program.--Section 1074g(a)(6) of \n     title 10, United Stated Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) The amount of any cost sharing requirements under \n     this paragraph may not be increased in any year by a \n     percentage that exceeds the percentage increase of the most \n     recent increase in retired pay for members of the armed \n     forces under section 1401a(b)(2) of this title. To the extent \n     that such increase for any year is less than one dollar, the \n     accumulated increase may be carried over from year to year, \n     rounded to the nearest dollar.''.\n       (b) Premiums for TRICARE Standard for Reserve Component \n     Members Who Commit to Service in the Selected Reserve.--\n     Section 1076d(d)(3) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The monthly amount'' and inserting ``(A) \n     Subject to subparagraph (B), the monthly amount''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of the premium in effect for a month \n     for TRICARE Standard coverage under this section may not \n     exceed a percentage equal to the percentage of the most \n     recent increase in the rate of basic pay authorized for \n     members of the uniformed services for a year.''.\n       (c) Copayments Under CHAMPUS.--Paragraph (3) of section \n     1086(b) of such title is amended in the first sentence by \n     striking ``during the period beginning on April 1, 2006, and \n     ending on September 30, 2007.'' and inserting ``after March \n     31, 2006''.\n       (d) Prohibition on Enrollment Fees for Certain Persons \n     Under CHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) A person covered by subsection (c) may not be charged \n     an enrollment fee for coverage under this section.''.\n       (e) Automatic Enrollment for Certain Persons Under \n     CHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) A person covered by subsection (c) shall not be \n     subject to denial of claims for\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n     coverage under this section for failure to enroll for such \n     coverage. To the extent enrollment may be required, \n     enrollment shall be automatic for any such person filing a \n     claim under this section.''.\n       (f) Premiums and Other Charges Under TRICARE.--Section \n     1097(e) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary of \n     Defense''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of any premium, deductible, copayment \n     or other charge prescribed by the Secretary under this \n     subsection may not exceed the percentage increase of the most \n     recent increase in retired pay for members and former members \n     of the armed forces under section 1041a(b)(2) of this \n     title.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 605. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote and \nimprove the allied health professions; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, early in the 109th Congress I introduced \na bill to address the troubling shortage of allied health professionals \nin our country. Sadly, we were unable to act on this bill despite \ncontinuing deficiencies in the health care workforce. That is why, \ntoday, I am reintroducing the Allied Health Reinvestment Act, along \nwith my good colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Kennedy, Landrieu, \nLieberman, Lincoln, Mikulski, and Murray.\n  Allied health professionals constitute roughly one third of the \nAmerican healthcare workforce. These individuals take x-rays, perform \nlab tests, and provide emergency services. They help rehabilitate the \ninjured, manage health records, and ensure patients are eating right. \nAllied health professionals are responsible for a critical and diverse \narray of functions, working with doctors and nurses to keep patients \nhealthy.\n  The allied health professions recognized in this bill include \nprofessionals in the areas of: dental hygiene, dietetics/nutrition, \nemergency medical services, health information management, clinical \nlaboratory sciences/medical technology, cytotechnology, occupational \ntherapy, physical therapy, radiologic technology, nuclear medical \ntechnology, rehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and speech \nlanguage-pathology/audiology. This is by no means a complete list of \nallied health professions, which is why the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services will have the authority to determine additional \nprofessions that can benefit.\n  Today, many allied health professions suffer from existing workforce \nshortages. The American Hospital Association (AHA) reports vacancy \nrates of 18 percent for radiology technicians, 15.3 percent for imaging \ntechnicians, and 12.7 percent for pharmacy technicians. In my State \nalone, the Washington State Hospital Association reports vacancy rates \nof 14.3 percent for ultrasound technologists, 11.3 percent for \nradiology technicians, and 10.9 percent for nuclear medicine \ntechnologists.\n  These shortages have real consequences for patients, often extending \nwait times for important test results or routine examinations. Every \ntime I meet with hospital officials in my State, I always learn how \npatient care is hurt by the lack of available healthcare workers.\n  Enrollment figures in allied health education programs suggest we \nwill not have the individuals available to meet the challenges created \nby existing shortages. The Association of Schools of Allied Health \nProfessionals (ASAHP) reports in a 2006 survey of 87 member \ninstitutions that enrollment for a number of allied health programs \nhave not reached capacity for the seventh straight year. The \nInstitutional Profile Survey, which the ASAHP conducts every year, \nshows under-enrollment by 55 percent in dietetics, 54 percent in health \nadministration, 49 percent in rehabilitation counseling, 43 percent in \nhealth information management, 38 percent in speech language pathology/\naudiology, 33 percent in emergency medical sciences, 26 percent in \nnuclear medicine technology, 25 percent in clinical laboratory \nsciences/medical technology, and 20 percent in cytotechnology.\n  These rates cannot continue. On top of existing workforce shortages, \nour health system faces a growing senior population, a group that \ntypically requires more care. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the \nsection of our population age 65 and over will begin to rapidly \nincrease in 2011 when the first of the baby boom generation reaches age \n65. This increase will create greater demand on all sectors of the \nhealthcare workforce.\n  The bill my colleagues and I introduce today, like the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the 107th Congress, intends to provide incentives \nfor individuals to seek and complete high-quality allied health \neducation and training.\n  The bill offers allied health education, practice, and retention \ngrants. Education grants will be used to expand enrollment in allied \nhealth education programs, especially by underrepresented racial and \nethnic minority students, and provide educational opportunities through \nnew technologies and methods, including distance-learning. Practice \ngrants will establish or expand allied health practice arrangements in \nnon-institutional settings to demonstrate methods that will improve \naccess to primary health care in rural areas and other medically \nunderserved communities. Retention grants will promote career \nadvancement for allied health personnel.\n  Grants will also be made available for health care facilities to \nenable them to carry out demonstrations of models and best practices in \nallied health for the purpose of developing innovative strategies or \napproaches for retention of allied health professionals. These grants \nwill be awarded in a variety of geographic regions to a range of \ndifferent types of facilities, including those in rural, urban, and \nsuburban areas.\n  Furthermore, this bill will give the Secretary of HHS, acting through \nthe Administrator of HRSA, the authority to enter into an agreement \nwith any institution that offers an eligible allied health education \nprogram to establish and operate a faculty loan fund to increase the \nnumber of qualified allied health faculty. Loans may be granted to \nfaculty pursuing a full-time course of study or, at the discretion of \nthe Secretary, a part-time course of study in an advanced degree \nprogram.\n  Finally, the Allied Health Reinvestment Act will establish a \nscholarship program modeled after the National Health Service Corps \nthat provides scholarships to individuals seeking allied health \neducation in exchange for service by those individuals in rural and \nother medically underserved areas.\n  The Allied Health Reinvestment Act represents a serious commitment on \nour part to confront a problem that will only grow more serious in the \nfuture. Our system of care cannot operate without the dedicated allied \nhealth professionals working today, and we must take the actions \nnecessary to ensure that there is a strong workforce that can serve in \nthe future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Allied Health Reinvestment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Census Bureau and other reports \n     highlight the increased demand for acute and chronic health \n     care services among both the general population and a rapidly \n     growing aging portion of the population.\n       (2) The calls for reduction in medical errors, increased \n     patient safety, and quality of care have resulted in an \n     amplified call for allied health professionals to provide \n     health care services.\n       (3) Several allied health professions are characterized by \n     workforce shortages, declining enrollments in allied health \n     education programs, or a combination of both factors, and \n     hospital officials have reported vacancy rates in positions \n     occupied by allied health professionals.\n       (4) Many allied health education programs are facing \n     significant economic pressure that could force their closure \n     due to an insufficient number of students.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     incentives for individuals to seek\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\n     and complete high quality allied health education and \n     training and provide additional funding to ensure that such \n     education and training can be provided to allied health \n     students so that the United States health care industry with \n     have a supply of allied health professionals needed to \n     support the health care system of the United States in this \n     decade and beyond.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                 ``PART G--ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\n\n     ``SEC. 799C.

It saps critical resources \nneeded by our troops, and it plays the taxpayers for fools, all the \nwhile hiding under the cover of national defense.\n  Within the last few weeks, the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction has reported that the problems of waste, fraud, and \nabuse continue to plague our reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and \nbillions of dollars are unaccounted for, and possibly lost, to fraud \nand waste. So far, the Inspector General has initiated more than 100 \ninvestigations into this fraud and abuse, but to date the Department of \nJustice has prosecuted just a few individuals for wrongdoing. The \nDepartment has yet to prosecute any of the contracting companies or \ntheir senior officials for fraud.\n  This legislative reform package establishes new criminal penalties \nfor war profiteers and cheats who, for ill-gotten gain, would exploit \nthe chaos of war. I recently introduced the War Profiteering Prevention \nAct of 2007, and I am pleased that Senator Dorgan has included this \nlegislation in the Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting \nAct.\n  This legislation also promotes openness and fairness in contracting, \nand it includes safeguards to end cronyism and eliminate conflicts of \ninterest in contracting decisions. It also strengthens the Federal \nprotections afforded to whistleblowers who alert the public to contract \nfraud and misconduct.\n  We have introduced antiwar profiteering legislation in the past, but \nthe Republican-led Congress has repeatedly refused to pass it. While \nCongress has waited to act, we have learned that private contractors \nhave stolen and defrauded, by some estimates, hundreds of millions of \ndollars from money that should have supported our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The time to stop these shameful acts is now, and Congress \nshould act swiftly to enact this vital legislation.\n  I will continue my efforts on this issue as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. In particular, I plan to hold a hearing next month on the \nwar profiteering bill.\n  Every penny of our taxpayers' money must be protected from waste, and \nFederal contracts--which are paid for with taxpayer funds--should be \nopen and transparent. This is an accountability bill, and taxpayers \ndeserve this to be one of our highest priorities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Menendez, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 608. A bill to improve the allocation of grants through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat ensures our Nation's homeland security grant resources are \nallocated in the most effective manner possible. I am pleased to be \njoined by my colleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, as well as \nSenators Boxer, Hutchison, Lautenberg, Schumer, Clinton, Menendez, and \nObama.\n  Simply put, the current system for allocating homeland security \ngrants to States is fundamentally flawed. Proportionate funding is not \nallotted to regions which face the highest risk of a terrorist attack, \nand adequate assessment of threats is not calculated.\n  The ``Risk-Based Homeland Security Grants Act of 2007'' addresses \nthese\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nconcerns with a common-sense approach that responsibly directs taxpayer \ndollars to protect our Nation's vital interests.\n  The methodology is straightforward and spelled out in the language at \nthe beginning of the bill:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that \n     homeland security grants are allocated based on an assessment \n     of threat, vulnerability, and consequence to the maximum \n     extent practicable.\n\n  This direction would apply to the four major first-responder grant \nprograms administered by the Department of Homeland Security: the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program; the Urban Area Security Initiative; \nthe Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program; and the Citizens \nCorps Program.\n  The primary objective of the legislation is accomplished by reducing \nthe amount of funding that each State is guaranteed. Current practice \nrequires a ``small state minimum,'' giving each State at least 0.75 \npercent of much of the grant funding.\n  The result is that roughly 38 percent of the funds are marked for \ndistribution before any substantive risk analysis has been performed. \nThat sends disproportionate money to low-risk, rural areas and \nterritories.\n  For most, this outcome is not acceptable. Funding to bolster the \nsecurity of our country should go to where the threat is greatest--such \nas seaports, airports, and national landmarks.\n  This bill lowers the ``small state minimum'' to 0.25 percent per \nState. A Homeland Security Grants Board, comprised of seven top \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials, including the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and the Undersecretary of Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection, is established to rank grant applications \nbased upon risk. Three factors guide this evaluation: threat, \nvulnerability, and consequence.\n  The current system, by contrast, allocates a significant amount of \nfunding to states based upon their population.\n  To ensure that grant funds are properly accounted for, and utilized \nwithin an integrated framework to enhance domestic security, grants \nmust be designed to meet ``essential'' capabilities.\n  ``Essential capabilities'' refers to the ability of regions to \naddress risks by reducing vulnerability to attacks and diminishing the \nconsequences of such attacks by effective response.\n  This legislation assures that States must demonstrate that they have \na detailed, prioritized plan for emergency preparedness and resource \nallocation, so that Federal funds are assigned to the most effective \nuses.\n  States must then quickly distribute the Federal funds to regions and \nlocalities.\n  The notion of risk-based allocation of homeland security grants is \nnot novel. This is a bipartisan approach advocated by both the Bush \nAdministration and the 9/11 Commission.\n  The 9/11 Commission report said: ``Homeland security assistance \nshould be based strictly on an assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities.''\n  Four years ago, President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective 8, which required the Department of Homeland Security to \nallocate grant funding ``based on national priorities.''\n  In April 2005, Representatives Cox and Turner, the Chair and Ranking \nMember of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time, offered \nsimilar legislation to reform the grant process by reducing State \nminimums and allocating funds based upon risk assessments.\n  That effort, the ``Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders \nAct of 2005,'' passed the House of Representatives as part of the \nIntelligence Reform bill, but was dropped in conference. This bill is \nbased on the House efforts, and closely tracks the previous bill.\n  Again, the House has acted, passing legislation last month, by an \noverwhelming vote of 299-128, to implement the recommendations of the \n9/11 Committee. A key component is the risk-based allocation of \nhomeland security resources.\n  This bill, though updated to reflect recent changes at the Department \nof Homeland Security, marks the continuation of a legislation effort we \nbegan last session, with the FORWARD Funding Act. That bill was \nunsuccessful. Hopefully, this time will be different.\n  In the post-Cold War world, America needs the flexibility to defend \nagainst a different type of enemy. The amorphous nature of the threat \nand likelihood of asymmetric attacks demands a robust approach.\n  But our resources are limited, and difficult choices must be made.\n  We will never know exactly how, when or where the next major attack \nmay occur. But we can refine our risk-assessment capabilities, and make \nobjective analyses and predictions. It follows that our resources \nshould be directed based upon our best estimate of where the next \nstrike might take place.\n  Two guiding principles--the ability to predict future attacks, \ncoupled with the necessity of utilizing finite resources effectively--\nform the backbone of a comprehensive strategy to make our Nation more \nsecure.\n  The approach is three-pronged: risks of potential terrorist attacks \nmust be accurately assessed; the vulnerability of critical \ninfrastructure and potential targets must be measured; and, resources \nshould be dispersed based upon these assessments.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was created to accomplish these \ngoals. Yet we find again and again that scarce resources are allocated \nbased on factors unrelated to real security.\n  For example, last year California's Urban Area Security Initiative \ngrants totaled only $6.81 per capita. Hawaii received $11.55 per \ncapita, and Wyoming, $18.06 per capita.\n  I recognize the environment in which we are operating, and understand \nthis bill is not a panacea. This bill is a first step towards reducing \nthe threat of terrorist attacks.\n  Congress should not act alone. The Department of Homeland Security \nmust embrace the concept of risk-based allocation of resources. And it \nmust act on these principles. Slow progress has been made, but the \nDepartment's intelligence analysis and vulnerability assessment \ncapabilities must be improved.\n  We can do better. We must put aside pork-barrel politics and take \naction to protect all Americans. The security of our Nation hangs in \nthe balance and we cannot afford to wait until it is too late.\n  This bill was conceived and put forth in the spirit of \nbipartisanship. I hope that Senators Lieberman and Collins will accept \nthis legislation, which is a reasoned alternative to their approach and \na starting point for continued discussion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this simple, \nstraightforward approach to effectively distribute our Nation's \nresources and make America secure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Dianne Feinstein of California, and several of our distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing The Risk-Based Homeland Security Grants Act \nof 2007.\n  Senator Feinstein, myself, and other Senators have been working now \nfor several years on changing how our homeland security dollars are \ndistributed throughout the country. Some have been talking about the \nneed for a risk-based allocation of assistance as long as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has been in existence. Throughout these \ndebates, Senator Feinstein has been a tireless advocate in this effort, \nand I would like to thank her for her fine leadership and collaboration \nin crafting this legislation.\n  The attacks on our country on September 11, 2001 were unprecedented \nin our history, and they brought with them the need for similarly \nunprecedented security measures. Our Nation needed to respond quickly \nto the devastation that day delivered to our country, so the Federal \nGovernment created a system that worked to raise overall national \nemergency preparedness to ensure we could better guard against another \nsuch terrorist attack.\n  And so, we embarked on the task of shoring up our airline, \ntransportation, border, and port security. We worked to protect our \ncritical infrastructure, to protect our cyber security, our agriculture \nand food-supply systems.\n  But taxpayer dollars are not limitless, and Congress must work to \nensure every penny be directed where it will do the most good. It is \nimperative that we guard the places across our Nation where terrorists \nare most likely to strike, and where such strikes could do the most \ndamage to our people, our government, and our national economy. We \nbelieve this is the most responsible way to prepare for any future \nattack.\n  We need to have a system that will protect our most vulnerable assets \nand populations--one that recognizes the need to protect the critical \ninfrastructure and vital components of our national economy. I am \nreminded of this often when I travel around my home State of Texas. \nRecently, I met with officials and business leaders from Houston and \nSoutheast Texas and discussed their homeland security needs. Their \nneeds are enormous considering the vast amount of critical \ninfrastructure and energy facilities in and among large population \ncenters. The potential consequences of a terrorist attack on any of \nthese facilities would be devastating, not only to the local \ncommunities, but to the economic engine of the whole country. \nUnfortunately, we got a small taste of effects of a disaster along \nAmerica's energy coast during the storms of 2005--hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita.\n  The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I are proposing would \nrequire that Federal Homeland Security funds be allocated to States \naccording to a risk-based assessment. It is vital that we better \nallocate our limited resources to the vulnerable places in the country \nwe most need to protect, and that that these funds are distributed in \nan efficient and timely manner.\n  Since we began this effort, I am pleased that there has been progress \nmade. The considerations of threat, vulnerability, and consequence have \nbeen incorporated into more homeland security programs. But I'm \nconcerned that we haven't done enough. And I'm concerned that our \nhomeland security dollars are being treated as a pie in which all \nStates get to claim a piece, regardless of risk.\n  This approach is inconsistent if we truly evaluate the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. They clearly call for allocation of money \nbased on an assessment of risks.\n  Our legislation provides for a distribution formula for homeland \nsecurity grants based on risk, which considers three main criteria: \nthreat, vulnerability, and consequence. It requires States to quickly \npass on Federal funds to areas where they are most needed. It provides \ngreater flexibility in using the funds, allowing a State to use them \nfor other hazards consistent with federally established capability \nstandards. And it allows States to retain authority to administer grant \nprograms, but there are penalties for states that do not pass funds to \nlocal governments within 45 days, and if a State fails to pass the \nfunds through, local governments may petition the Department of \nHomeland Security to receive the funds directly.\n  It is our hope and intent that, by introducing this bill, we can \npositively contribute and enrich the public discourse on this critical \nissue, and help move the Nation toward a more rational and effective \ndistribution of our homeland security resources.\n  Continuing to spread Homeland Security funds throughout the Nation--\nirrespective of the actual risk to particular states and communities--\nwould be to ignore much of what we have learned as part of our effort \nto assess our vulnerabilities since the attacks of September 11. So I \nwould urge that we swiftly work to pass this legislation, to better \nensure the safety of our citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 609. A bill to amend section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nto provide that funds received as universal service contributions and \nthe universal service support programs established pursuant to that \nsection are not subject to certain provisions of title 31, United \nStates Code, commonly known as the Antideficiency Act; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, \nSenator Olympia Snowe and Vice-Chairman Ted Stevens, to re-introduce \nthe Antideficiency Act to protect the Universal Service Program.\n  This is a bipartisan effort to ensure that all of the fundamental \nuniversal service program can continue to operate smoothly and \neffectively. Last year, this legislation garnered the support of 55 \nmembers, and I hope that it will gain additional support in the 110th \nCongress. It is also important to note that the House also has a \nsimilar bipartisan legislation.\n  For many years, I have fought hard for universal service, including \nthe E-Rate. It is essential for all of the universal service programs \nto operate in a timely manner.\n  The Universal Service Fund is accomplishing its mission. Our country \nhas a strong telecommunications network, and rural customers are \ngetting service at affordable rates. Lifeline and Linkup programs help \nthe poorest of customers keep basic telephone access which is essential \nin our modern world. Rural health care is helping connect our rural \nclinics to modern medicine and specialists.\n  Over the past decade, the E-Rate discounts have helped to connect our \nclassrooms and our libraries to the Internet and modern technology. In \n1996, when the Telecommunications Act passed, only 14 percent of \nclassrooms were connected, and just 5 percent of the poorest classrooms \nwere connected. The latest data is encouraging with 93 percent of all \nclassrooms connected and 89 percent of the poorest classrooms \nconnected. Since 1998, West Virginia schools and libraries have \nreceived over $70 million in E-Rate discounts. While this is \nextraordinary success, the need for E-Rate discounts remains because \nschools and libraries\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nface monthly telecommunication costs and Internet access fees. Every \nschool and library will periodically need to upgrade its internal \nconnections.\n  This legislation gives the Universal Service Fund a permanent \nexemption from the Antideficiency Act. Over the last few years, we have \ndone one year exemptions. It makes good sense to enact a long term \nsolution for the Universal Service Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 610. A bill to clarify the effective date of the modification of \ntreatment for retirement annuity purposes of part-time service before \nApril 7, 1986, of certain Department of Veterans Affairs health-care \nprofessionals; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to \nchange an unfair administrative decision that hurts aging, retired VA \nnurses. This bill is designed to correct a problem from legislation \nenacted in 2001, to help VA nurses' retirement. That legislation \nimproved nurses' pensions, and Congress intended it to be retroactive. \nUnfortunately, administrative officials took a very narrow view of that \nlaw. Currently VA nurses, who retired between 1986 and 2002, do not get \nthe full pension benefits as current retirees do.\n  In the 1980s, VA aggressively recruited nurses to fill a huge need at \nVA medical centers by promising full retirement for part-time work. At \nthe time, nurses joined the VA, and they believed in the promise.\n  Sadly, the VA and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will not \nfulfill that promise. This legislation would explicitly require the \nFederal Government to honor its commitment to our retired VA nurses. \nPension benefits are a vital promise. It is disturbing when we do not \nfulfill our obligations, and we simply must correct this error.\n  Nurses play a critical role in our health care system, including the \nVA. Recruiting and retaining nurses is important, and this pension \nshortfall does not help. It is time to deliver full pension benefits to \nthe retired nurses who cared for our veterans, but sadly retired in the \nwrong years, between 1986 and 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 613. A bill to enhance the overseas stabilization and \nreconstruction capabilities of the United States Government, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this legislation authorizes the creation of \na civilian readiness corps to address post-conflict situations and \nother emergencies overseas. The Senate already embraced the creation of \nsuch a corps when it unanimously passed S. 3322 last June. \nUnfortunately, that bill, introduced by Senator Biden and me and co-\nsponsored by Senators Hagel, Alexander and Warner languished in the \nHouse of Representatives. We have hopes that the 110th Congress will \nnow bring this idea to fruition.\n  In his State of the Union address last month, the President endorsed \nthe need for such a corps:\n  ``A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a \nvolunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like \nour military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by \nallowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions \nabroad when American needs them. It would give people across America \nwho do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle \nof our time.'' President Bush, January 23, 2007, State of the Union \nspeech, Washington, DC.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an updated version of S. \n3322. It is the result of a conversation begun in 2003 between Members \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the leadership of the \nState Department. The concept has gone through a number of evolutions \nand has passed the Committee unanimously both as a free-standing bill \nand as part of the State Department authorization bill. I am asking the \nSenate to pass it now again as a free-standing bill and send it to the \nHouse with our unanimous approval.\n  International crises are inevitable, and in most cases, U.S. national \nsecurity interests will be threatened by sustained instability. The war \non terrorism necessitates that we not leave nations crumbling and \nungoverned. We have already seen how terrorists can exploit nations \nafflicted by lawlessness and desperate circumstances. They seek out \nsuch places to establish training camps, recruit new members, and tap \ninto a global black market in weapons.\n  In this international atmosphere, the United States must have the \nright structures, personnel, and resources in place when an emergency \noccurs. A delay in our response of a few weeks, or even days, can mean \nthe difference between success and failure. Clearly we need a full \nrange of tools to prevail. Our Committee's focus has been on boosting \nthe civilian side of our stabilization and reconstruction capabilities, \nwhile encouraging improved mechanisms for civilian and military \nagencies to work together on these missions.\n  Those who were once unconvinced of the need for such a corps have \nonly to look at our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan to understand \nits value.\n  This legislation continues to build on the original legislation, S. \n2127, that Senators Biden and Hagel and I introduced in early 2004 to \nencourage and support a well-organized, sufficiently resourced and \nstrongly led civilian counterpart to the military in post-conflict \nzones. It is our view that the civilian side needs both operational \ncapability and a significant surge capacity. This legislation gives \nstatutory status to the State Department's Office of the Coordinator of \nReconstruction and Stabilization and makes the position of Coordinator \nsubject to the advice and consent of the Senate. The legislation \nauthorizes the establishment of a federal response capability with both \nactive and standby components, as well as a civilian reserve that draws \nupon the talent and willingness to serve that resides among our people. \nIt provides flexibility in personnel management, pay, and benefits to \nbuild the corps and create surge capacity in an emergency. Finally, it \nauthorizes expenditures for a crisis response fund, for the civilian \nresponse corps, and for a substantial training, planning and \noperational capacity for the office.\n  The State Department has made progress through the Office of the \nCoordinator of Reconstruction and Stabilization that was established in \nJuly of 2004. The Office has already done a great deal of the \npreliminary work needed to build an effective corps. But now it is time \nfor the Office to recruit, train, and organize the corps so that we \nhave deployable units.\n  We need to have a 250-person active duty component made up of State \nDepartment and USAID employees. We need a 2,000 person standby \ncomponent drawn from both State and USAID, but also from other Federal \nagencies that have employees who are willing to volunteer and have the \nnecessary skill sets. And we need to begin building a civilian reserve, \nrecruiting at least 500 highly skilled persons and eventually many \nmore.\n  The 250-person active duty personnel should include people with \nskills that are more technical than the broader diplomatic \nrequirements--civil engineering, police expertise, agricultural \nknowledge, health, education, and political organization. They should \nhave experience in difficult situations overseas and be trained and \navailable for rapid deployment with the military for both initial \nassessments and programming purposes. They would be the first civilian \nteam on the ground in post-conflict situations, probably well in \nadvance of the establishment of an embassy.\n  Such a 250-person corps would be no larger than a typical army \ncompany. But it would be a force multiplier. It would be equipped with \nthe authority and training to take broad operational responsibility for \nstabilization missions. Establishment of such a corps is a modest \ninvestment when seen as part of the overall national security budget. \nEven in peace time, we maintain active duty military forces of almost \n1.4 million men and women who train and plan for the possibility of \nwar. Given how critical post conflict situations have been to American \nnational security in the last decade, I believe it is reasonable to \nhave a mere 250 civilians who are training for these situations and are \ncapable of being deployed anywhere in the world, at any time they may \nbe needed.\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n  Congress must now be willing to provide the funding to make this \ncorps a reality. This legislation authorizes a $75 million crisis \nresponse fund to be made available as a contingency for stabilization \nand reconstruction crises. Of this amount, the administration is \nauthorized to spend $25 million for the organization, training, and \nemergency deployment of the response corps. This legislation authorizes \nthe crisis response fund and $80 million for the operations of the new \nState Department office and the active duty component, including \ntraining, equipment, and travel.\n  We have a long way to go in creating the kind of robust civilian \ncapacity that we need. Both the State Department and the Defense \nDepartment are keenly aware of the importance of this legislation. If \nwe cannot plan better as a government, the United States may come to \ndepend even more on our military for tasks and functions far beyond its \ncurrent role. But I remain optimistic that we can build on the progress \nalready made to create a strong and reliable civilian component that \nboosts our stabilization and reconstruction capabilities. Passing this \nlegislation once again will demonstrate that there is a keen \nunderstanding in the Senate that we need to move forward. It will \nsupport executive branch actions already taken and encourage further \nprogress. We hope that our friends in the House of Representatives, \nseveral of whom are considering introducing their own legislation, will \nmove forward with the Senate in this endeavor. I urge adoption of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reconstruction and \n     Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the resources of the \n     United States Armed Forces have been burdened by having to \n     undertake stabilization and reconstruction tasks in the \n     Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries of the world \n     that could have been performed by civilians, which has \n     resulted in lengthy deployments for Armed Forces personnel.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     continued development, as a core mission of the Department of \n     State and the United States Agency for International \n     Development, of an effective expert civilian response \n     capability to carry out reconstruction and stabilization \n     activities in a country or region that is at risk of, in, or \n     is in transition from, conflict or civil strife.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote health care coverage parity for individuals \nparticipating in legal recreational activities or legal transportation \nactivities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing legislation to \nprohibit health insurers from denying benefits to plan participants if \nthey are injured while engaging in legal recreational activities like \nskiing, snowmobiling, or horseback riding.\n  Among the many rules that were issued at the end of the Clinton \nadministration was one that was intended to\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\nensure non-discrimination in health coverage in the group market. This \nrule was issued jointly on January 8, 2001, by the Department of Labor, \nthe Internal Revenue Service and the Health Care Financing \nAdministration--now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--in \naccordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, HIPAA, of 1996.\n  While I was pleased that the rule prohibits health plans and issuers \nfrom denying coverage to individuals who engage in certain types of \nrecreational activities, such as skiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling \nor motorcycling, I am concerned that it would allow insurers to deny \nhealth benefits for an otherwise covered injury that results from \nparticipation in these activities.\n  The rule states that ``While a person cannot be excluded from a plan \nfor engaging in certain recreational activities, benefits for a \nparticular injury can, in some cases, be excluded based on the source \nof the injury.'' A plan could, for example, include a general exclusion \nfor injuries sustained while doing a specified list of recreational \nactivities, even though treatment for those injuries--a broken arm, for \ninstance--would have been covered under the plan if the individual had \ntripped and fallen.\n  Because of this loophole, an individual who was injured while skiing \nor running could be denied health care coverage, while someone who is \ninjured while drinking and driving a car would be protected.\n\n  This clearly is contrary to Congressional intent. One of the purposes \nof HIPAA was to prohibit plans and issuers from establishing \neligibility rules for health coverage based on certain health-related \nfactors, including evidence of insurability. To underscore that point, \nthe conference report language stated that ``the inclusion of evidence \nof insurability in the definition of health status is intended to \nensure, among other things, that individuals are not excluded from \nhealth care coverage due to their participation in activities such as \nmotorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback \nriding, skiing and other similar activities.'' The conference report \nalso states that ``this provision is meant to prohibit insurers or \nemployers from excluding employees in a group from coverage or charging \nthem higher premiums based on their health status and other related \nfactors that could lead to higher health costs.''\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, millions of Americans participate in these legal and \ncommon recreational activities which, if practiced with appropriate \nprecautions, do not significantly increase the likelihood of serious \ninjury. Moreover, in enacting HIPAA, Congress simply did not intend \nthat people would be allowed to purchase health insurance only to find \nout, after the fact, that they have no coverage for an injury resulting \nfrom a common recreational activity. If this rule is allowed to stand, \nmillions of Americans will be forced to forgo recreational activities \nthat they currently enjoy lest they have an accident and find out that \nthey are not covered for needed care resulting from that accident.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will clarify that \nindividuals participating in activities routinely enjoyed by millions \nof Americans cannot be denied access to health care coverage or health \nbenefits as a result of their activities. The bill should not be \ncontroversial. In fact, it passed the Senate by unanimous consent at \nthe end of the 108th Congress.\n  I am therefore hopeful that we will be able to move quickly on this \nlegislation this year, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 617. A bill to make the National Parks and Federal Recreational \nLands Pass available at a discount to certain veterans; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nEagle Parks Pass Act. This legislation would provide admission to any \nFederal park that charges an admissions fee by creating a ``Veterans \nEagle Pass'' for honorably discharged veterans. I am pleased to \ncontinue the efforts of my colleague Congressman Thomas Reynolds, who \nperformed yeoman's work to introduce and push forward this legislation \nin the House of Representatives.\n  Currently, an annual America the Beautiful lands pass is available to \nanyone for eighty dollars. My legislation would allow honorably \ndischarged veterans to buy an annual pass for only ten dollars. I feel \nvery strongly that those who fought so hard to protect our great nation \nshould have better and easier access to its public lands. It is only \nfitting to offer our veterans improved entrance to America's great \npublic lands like Yosemite National Park in California, Fort Sumter \nNational Monument in South Carolina, Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee \nNational Wildlife Refuge in Florida, and Crater Lake National Park in \nmy home State of Oregon.\n  America's terrain is diverse, from flat plains to high mountains, \nraging rivers to still lakes. Our country is truly bountiful. Many \nveterans are avid outdoorsmen and understand the value and quality of \nour land. In a time of such turmoil abroad, I see no more appropriate \nopportunity to reward our veterans for their commitment and service to \nour nation.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has received the support of the \nAmerican Legion, AMVETS, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. We owe it to our \nveterans to provide them with this service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Lott, Mr. Reid, and \n        Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 618. A bill to further competition in the insurance industry; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so people understand. I know the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has spoken briefly about this and had remarks on it \nprinted in the Record.\n  Our Nation's competition laws are powerful tools to ensure that \nconsumer welfare is the benchmark of fair and accountable industry \npractices. These competition laws are what make businesses work in \nAmerica. The vast majority of the companies doing business in the \nUnited States are subject to our antitrust laws. Consumers benefit from \nlower prices, more choices, better services.\n  There are only a few industries that operate outside the Federal \nantitrust laws. The bipartisan measure I have introduced would end the \ninsurance industry's exemption from the requirement of those laws. I am \njoined in this effort, as I said before, by the ranking member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Senator Specter has a strong record of \nsupporting effective competition in every industry through our \nantitrust laws. Of course, as I have also said, I am joined by the \nmajority leader and by Senator Lott, who is the deputy Republican \nleader.\n  Senator Lott probably wishes he was not in this position, but he \nrepresents many of the gulf coast residents who can speak personally \nand painfully to the abuses that insurers can wreak on their \npolicyholders. The insurance industry's practices affect us all. \nPerhaps nowhere has the industry and its practices come under as much \nscrutiny as along the gulf coast in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. Insurers have been too often denying claims and delaying payments \nto residents along the gulf coast instead of honoring their contractual \ncommitments. The behavior of insurers in Mississippi has been so \noutrageous that the State's attorney general recently convened a grand \njury to investigate some of the practices.\n  It seems to me, insurance companies are very eager to collect \npremiums when times are good but reluctant to compensate policyholders \nwhen tragedy strikes. Senator Lott knows all too well the difficulties \nhis constituents have had with insurers. His State was hit hard by \nHurricane Katrina. I commend the Senator from Mississippi for his \ntireless efforts in trying to ensure resources are in place to rebuild. \nI know he is joined in that effort by his colleague from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran.\n  I have worked with others to support efforts to rebuild the Gulf \nCoast. Most recently, I was pleased to assist Senator Landrieu in her \nsuccessful efforts to convince the Attorney General to dispatch \nadditional law enforcement to the New Orleans region. People in the \ngulf coast are Americans. They are our fellow citizens. They have been \nutterly failed by a woefully unprepared Government, and they should not \nalso be bullied and neglected by insurance companies in their time of \nneed.\n\n  The insurance industry has operated largely beyond the reach of \nFederal\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nantitrust laws for more than six decades. Assuming there ever was a \njustification to exempt insurers from Federal Government oversight, I \nfind it hard to believe there is still a reason to exempt them--not in \nthe age of instant communication, the age of the Internet, or the \nability to compare not only risks but payments. In fact, we need real \noversight, which can be brought about by removing them from the \nantitrust exemption. We deserve confidence that the industry is not \nengaging in the most egregious forms of anticompetitive conduct, such \nas price-fixing, agreements not to pay, or market allocation.\n  Antitrust laws are the beacon of good competition policy. Insurers \nmay object to being subject to the same antitrust laws as everyone \nelse, but why shouldn't they be subject to the same laws as every other \ncompany in this country? If they are operating in an honest and \nappropriate and open way, they have nothing to fear.\n  I have more on this, but I ask unanimous consent that my full \nstatement be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to reiterate, our Nation's \n     competition laws are powerful tools to ensure that consumer \n     welfare is the benchmark for fair and accountable industry \n     practices. The vast majority of the companies doing business \n     in the United States are subject to the strictures of the \n     antitrust laws, and consumers benefit through lower prices, \n     more choices, and better services. Only a few industries \n     operate outside the federal antitrust laws, and I am pleased \n     to introduce today a bipartisan measure that will end the \n     insurance industry's exemption from the requirements of those \n     laws.\n       I am joined in this effort by the ranking member of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee who has a strong record of \n     supporting effective competition in every industry through \n     our antitrust laws. I am joined as well by Senator Reid and \n     Senator Lott. Senator Lott represents many of the gulf coast \n     residents who can speak personally, and painfully, to the \n     abuses that insurers can wreak on their policy holders.\n       Insurance industry practices affect all of us. They affect \n     each of our constituents; they affect every business in every \n     state. But perhaps nowhere has the industry and its practices \n     come under as much scrutiny as along the gulf coast in the \n     wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Insurers have been too \n     often denying claims and delaying payouts to residents along \n     the gulf coast instead of honoring their contractual \n     commitments to their customers, and thereby contributing to \n     the rebuilding and rejuvenation of the area.\n       The behavior of insurers in Mississippi has been so \n     outrageous that the state's attorney general recently \n     convened a grand jury to investigate certain practices. \n     Hundreds of policyholders had to go to court to force the \n     insurance companies to fulfill their obligations.\n       It seems some insurance companies are eager to collect \n     premiums when times are good, but reluctant to aid \n     policyholders when tragedy strikes.\n       Senator Lott knows all too well the difficulties his \n     constituents have had with insurers. His state was hit hard \n     by Hurricane Katrina, and I commend him on his tireless \n     efforts to ensure that resources are in place to rebuild. I \n     have worked with them in other contexts to support efforts to \n     rebuild the gulf coast. Most recently, I was honored to have \n     assisted Senator Landrieu in her successful efforts to \n     convince the attorney general to dispatch additional law \n     enforcement to the New Orleans region.\n       Our fellow citizens on the gulf coast who have had to cope \n     with the devastation and destruction of the 2005 hurricanes, \n     and who were utterly failed by their woefully unprepared \n     government, should not also be bullied or neglected by \n     insurance companies in their time of need--insurance \n     companies whose business is based on compensating people \n     after a tragic loss.\n       Unfortunately, the insurance industry has operated largely \n     beyond the reach of federal antitrust laws for more than six \n     decades. If there ever was, there is no longer any \n     justification to exempt the insurance industry from federal \n     government oversight.\n       Such oversight could provide confidence that the industry \n     is not engaging in the most egregious forms of \n     anticompetitive conduct--price fixing, agreements not to pay, \n     and market allocations.\n       The Insurance Industry Competition Act we introduce today \n     will simply give the Department of Justice and the Federal \n     Trade Commission the authority to apply the antitrust laws to \n     anticompetitive behavior by insurance companies. Our \n     antitrust laws are the beacon of good competition policy. \n     Competition is good for consumers and good for our economy.\n       Insurers may object to being subject to the same antitrust \n     laws as everyone else, but if they are operating in an honest \n     and appropriate way, they should have nothing to fear. \n     American consumers and American businesses rely on \n     insurance--it is a vital part of our economy--and they have \n     the right to be confident that the cost of their insurance, \n     and the decisions by their insurance carriers about which \n     claims will be paid, reflect competitive market conditions, \n     not collusive behavior.\n       I thank Senator Reid and Senator Specter for joining me in \n     this important effort. And I thank Senator Lott for his \n     support, and for using the lessons of his constituents' \n     experiences to shed light on an industry that for too long, \n     in too many ways, has been out of the reach of federal \n     antitrust authorities.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Mississippi on the \nfloor and the Senator from Pennsylvania. If they are seeking time, I \nwould ask how much time they need.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to withhold until the Senator from \nPennsylvania makes his brief remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time does the Senator from Pennsylvania want? \nBecause this is coming out of time I had set aside for something else.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nVermont.\n  As noted earlier, legislation was introduced in the last Congress by \nSenator Leahy and myself and others to deal with the problem of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act. We held hearings on this matter in the Judiciary \nCommittee. On recent matters which have evolved from Hurricane Katrina, \nwhich will be amplified by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, \nMr. Lott, there is a more pressing need to enter into this arena.\n  There have been various attempts over the years to limit McCarran-\nFerguson, and they have not succeeded because, as amplified in a more \ndetailed statement which I will include for the Record, there were safe \nharbors proposed. They became very complicated. We have provided in \nthis legislation that the Commission decide what is to be violative of \nthe antitrust laws, a line which has been successful on the health \nindustry.\n  The economy of the United States functions much better when the \nantitrust laws are available and enforceable. We see a great many \nproblems at the present time with what is happening with the sports \nteams. The National Football League enjoys a limited antitrust \nexemption, and they are proposing the Sunday ticket to DIRECTV, which \nhas a monopoly. Cable companies can't get the Sunday ticket. They now \nhave the Thursday to Saturday ticket. It is only on the NFL channel. I \nhad a talk with the commissioner of the NFL recently, who was living in \nNew York City, and he couldn't get the Sunday ticket because his \nhighrise wouldn't allow him to put a dish on top of the building.\n  May I note for the record the distinguished junior Senator from \nMontana is nodding in the affirmative. He lives in an area--now he is \nsmiling. He lives in an area where you need a satellite, and his \nconstituents do, and some of mine in Pennsylvania do, and in my home \nState of Kansas. Now baseball is coming along with extra innings and \nexclusive to DIRECTV.\n  The impact of the antitrust exemption on the insurance industry has \nbeen even more profound. But it is noted when we have the Federal Trade \nCommission authorized to issue guidelines in identifying joint \npractices where the antitrust concerns ought to be addressed, that is \nthe way to approach it, as the Federal Trade Commission did in the \nhealth care industry.\n  I think this is a significant step forward, and I am glad to see that \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid, is behind this legislation. We can \npass it out of committee, we can take it up on the Senate floor, and I \nthink we can provide better protection for the American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2007\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Insurance Industry \n     Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2007 would subject the insurance \n     industry to the antitrust laws which apply to almost every \n     other industry in America. Congress enacted the McCarran-\n     Ferguson Act in 1945\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\n     in response to a controversial Supreme Court case in which \n     the Court held that the business of insurance constituted \n     interstate commerce. That ruling opened the door to federal \n     regulation of insurance, a business that had historically \n     been regulated and taxed by the states. McCarran-Ferguson \n     reaffirmed the power of the states to regulate and tax \n     insurance.\n       In doing so, Congress exempted the insurance industry \n     practices from antitrust scrutiny to the extent that such \n     practices are ``regulated by state law.'' Since then, the \n     courts have liberally interpreted the phrase ``regulated by \n     state law.'' They have held that insurance industry practices \n     are exempt from the antitrust laws so long as regulators have \n     been given jurisdiction over the challenged practices--\n     regardless of whether the regulators ever exercise that \n     jurisdiction.\n       Over the years, state regulators have either chosen not to \n     regulate, or failed to regulate, practices that would have \n     violated the antitrust laws absent McCarran-Ferguson. With \n     McCarran-Ferguson, such practices escape both regulatory and \n     federal antitrust oversight. The most notorious practices to \n     come to light involved bid-rigging and customer allocation by \n     insurance broker Marsh & McClennan and several of the \n     nation's largest insurers. Under the scheme, Marsh steered \n     unsuspecting clients to insurers with which it had lucrative \n     payoff agreements. To make the scheme work, Marsh solicited \n     fictitious bids from other complicit insurers to make the bid \n     submitted by the selected insurer--the one that offered Marsh \n     the highest payoff--seem competitive.\n       Even though the scheme eliminated competition among the \n     insurance companies that were involved, those companies could \n     not be prosecuted under federal antitrust law. Several states \n     prosecuted the insurance companies under a variety of state \n     laws, including antitrust laws, but federal prosecutors could \n     not bring their significant resources to bear. There simply \n     is no justification for that. Federal law enforcement should \n     have the power to prosecute such blatant violations of the \n     antitrust laws.\n       This is not the first attempt to subject the insurance \n     industry to federal antitrust law. In the wake of numerous \n     insolvencies, mismanagement and other misconduct by insurers \n     in the late 1980s, legislation was introduced repealing the \n     exemption. That legislation, introduced by Congressman \n     Brooks, faced opposition from insurers who claimed that many \n     industry practices engaged in jointly by insurance companies \n     were pro-competitive and necessary for smaller insurers. The \n     legislation provided a safe harbor, specifically listing the \n     practices of insurance companies that would be exempt from \n     the antitrust laws. However, it proved impossible to craft a \n     list of safe harbors for all the information that competing \n     insurers claimed they needed to share with one another. This \n     bill has avoided that problem.\n       More recently, some have argued that the answer to \n     insurance industry ills is full federal regulation. I do not \n     necessarily believe that stripping the states of their \n     authority to regulate the insurance industry is the answer. \n     This bill does not do that. It allows states to continue to \n     regulate their insurance industries. However, the existence \n     of state regulation is no reason to prevent federal \n     prosecutors from going after antitrust violators. And, there \n     is no reason to prevent federal prosecutors from going after \n     antitrust violators just because those violators happen to \n     work for insurance companies.\n       As I have said, allowing federal prosecutors to go after \n     those who violate the antitrust laws will not prevent states \n     from regulating the insurance industry. If a state is \n     actively supervising practices by its insurance industry that \n     might otherwise violate the antitrust laws, this legislation \n     would exempt that practice from the antitrust laws. Antitrust \n     law does not generally apply where a state is actively \n     regulating an industry. This is as it should be and the \n     legislation I introduce today, the Insurance Industry \n     Antitrust Act of 2007, incorporates that standard.\n       The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue in \n     May. During the hearing, Marc Racicot, the President of the \n     American Insurance Association, a trade association composed \n     of the nation's largest insurers, acknowledged that ``every \n     state provides some form of antitrust regulation of \n     insurers.'' In other words, many states already enforce their \n     state antitrust laws with respect to insurers. So, I have to \n     ask, why have we tied the hands of federal antitrust \n     enforcers?\n       The insurers will argue that repealing the antitrust \n     exemption for insurers will create uncertainty by throwing \n     into question the legality of every joint practice engaged \n     in by insurers. They will argue that the legality of each \n     joint practice will have to be litigated in court. \n     However, this bill has been drafted to avoid such \n     litigation. Rather than incorporating a laundry list of \n     safe harbors, an approach that was taken in the past, the \n     bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue \n     guidelines identifying joint practices that do not raise \n     antitrust concerns and would therefore not face scrutiny \n     from antitrust enforcers.\n       This is a job for which the Commission is well equipped. In \n     the past, the Commission along with the Justice Department \n     issued ``Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health \n     Care.'' The Health Care Statements identified joint conduct \n     by health care providers that did not raise antitrust \n     concerns and therefore would likely escape scrutiny by \n     antitrust enforcers. The Health Care Statements were designed \n     to give health care providers certainty about the legality of \n     their joint conduct under the antitrust laws. Similar \n     guidelines for the insurance industry would provide insurers \n     with certainty, but at the same time, would ensure that joint \n     practices that are anticompetitive receive scrutiny from the \n     antitrust enforcement agencies.\n       Although many insurers oppose repeal of their antitrust \n     exemption, others support a repeal. In particular, the \n     Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association has long \n     supported repeal. During the Judiciary Committee's hearing, \n     the current head of the Antitrust Section, Donald Klawiter \n     noted the Section's nearly 20-year history of supporting \n     repeal. Klawiter testified that ``the benefits of antitrust \n     exemptions almost never outweigh the potential harm imposed \n     on society by the loss of competition.'' At the same hearing, \n     Robert Hunter, testifying on behalf of the Consumer \n     Federation of America, concluded that ``application of the \n     antitrust laws to the insurance industry could result in \n     double-digit savings for America's insurance consumers.''\n       It is my hope that this legislation will bring the benefits \n     of competition to the insurance industry and to consumers. \n     Too many consumers are paying too much for insurance due to \n     the collusive atmosphere that exists in the insurance \n     industry. This has become a particular problem along the Gulf \n     Coast, where insurers have shared hurricane loss projections, \n     which may result in double-digit premium increases for Gulf \n     Coast homeowners.\n       I strongly urge Members who are concerned about industry \n     exemption from the antitrust laws and collusive insurance \n     industry practices to support this important piece of \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I get some time under the agreement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time would the distinguished Senator need?\n  Mr. LOTT. Probably 5 or 6 minutes. How much would you have left then? \nI don't want to eat up all your time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Again, we are using time that I--Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that my time be extended by 6 minutes, and that I be \nallowed to yield that 6 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say at the beginning, I appreciate \nthe courtesy of the Senator from Vermont and his comments on our effort \nhere; also, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, whom I \nhave discussed this issue with several times over the past year.\n  Let me begin at the beginning of this effort. I thank my colleagues \nfor this bipartisan effort. It shows what we can do when we work \ntogether. Now, we have a long road to go, but this is being introduced \nas a bipartisan measure with leaders from both sides and leaders of the \nJudiciary Committee joining in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  How did I get interested in this area? Well, it is like so many \nthings in my life that go back only until August 29, 2005, when \nHurricane Katrina devastated my hometown and the area of my State that \nI love so much, Mississippi and the gulf coast area. I had been active \nin years gone by actually in the insurance area. I had done some law \npractice in that area. I had done some defense work. But I never had \nbecome steeped in the laws that apply to the industry because most of \nthe time I was dealing with an automobile accident case or something of \nthat nature.\n  Well, after Hurricane Katrina we learned a lot of lessons, and we \nfound a lot of new concerns in areas where we had to take action. One \nof the commitments I have made to the people--and to the Senate because \nthe Senate has been so good in helping us in our recovery effort, in \nchanging the laws where applicable, the Stafford Act, in providing \nfunds. But one of the commitments I made as a result of that is to make \nsure we take a look at what happened to us. What did we learn from \nKatrina? What can we do to have more laws and the right things in place \nafter the next natural disaster--and there will be one--or any kind of \ncatastrophic disaster? We learned that the laws were not what they \nshould be. They needed to be changed. We have changed them some and we \nneed to change them some more. We learned the Federal agencies weren't \nnecessarily set up properly to do what needed to be done in the \naftermath of a disaster. We had questions about homeland security and \nthe Federal Emergency Management Administration and how the military, \nthe Coast Guard, and everybody interplayed together. So we have been \ntrying to make those corrections.\n  We need to ask ourselves: Do we need to give some additional thought \nto how\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\nwe deal on a national level with the coverage of people or how we help \nthem recover? Do we need a national catastrophic insurance program? I \ndon't know that I am satisfied I know the answer yet, but I think we \nneed to ask that question in advance.\n  I also found, to my absolute horror, something I should have known, \nwhich is that the insurance industry is not covered by antitrust laws. \nThey have a waiver. I said: How could that be? I remember hearing \ndiscussion over the years about the McCarran-Ferguson Act, but I never \nfocused on it. When I realized that ratesetting and actually policy \nactions by the industry were not covered by antitrust laws, I was \nstunned. I understand you need a lot of information to decide on rates, \nbut that information can be used back and forth to in effect set rates \nas an industry without making sure that it is not done in an \nanticompetitive way. Do you mean that under this exemption, that \ncompanies could collude on what actions they take or, even worse, what \nactions they don't take, which is what we got into after Hurricane \nKatrina? We had companies basically saying: Oh, no, no, you are covered \nby Federal flood insurance. We don't have to pay under the household \npolicies for wind damage.\n  So as I got into it, I found that this happened back in 1944. At that \npoint, there was regulation of the insurance industry, but there was a \ncase styled the United States v. South Eastern Underwriters Association \nwhich caused a change in how insurers were regulated. Then the Congress \nimmediately acted and said: Oh, no, we are going to say that federal \nantitrust laws do not apply to this industry.\n  Soon the courts got into this issue and took a look at what happened. \nThey looked at the record. There were no hearings in the Senate. It was \npassed quickly on a voice vote, and it went quickly through the House. \nThe conference report was debated for 2 days by the Senate, and most of \nthe debate, as I have looked at it, looks as though everybody thought \nthis was going to be a temporary moratorium. However, that is not the \nway the courts have interpreted the laws.\n  Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, insurers are exempt from antitrust \nscrutiny, so long as they are regulated by State law. Then you get into \na patchwork of State laws: Do the States actively regulate them? Is \nthere a process for antitrust activities to be considered?\n  Over the years, many have advocated the repeal of this antitrust \nexemption. The Judiciary Committee had hearings on this last summer. \nThe American Bar Association's antitrust section noted that the \norganization for nearly 20 years has supported repeal of this \nexemption. Look, there is a unique role for States to deal with \ninsurance questions and needs in those States, but my question beyond \nthat is: Should the Federal Government have the right to make sure \nthere are not anticompetitive activities, to make sure there is no \ncolluding? I think we need to take a serious look at that. This \nlegislation would do that. It would take away that exemption. It would \nmake the insurance industry subject to the same coverage of almost \nevery other corporation in America: antitrust legislation.\n  I know my time has expired. I thank the Chair for his leniency. I \nthank Senator Leahy for doing this. I look forward to having the \nhearings and testifying. This is wrong, Mr. President, and the Senate \nin a bipartisan way should, and I believe will, correct it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Mississippi, and I \nam proud to be joining with him on this. He and I have discussed this \nseveral times over the past several months. I told him last fall I \nwould join with him on such legislation, and I am proud to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \n``Insurance Industry Competition Act of 2007,'' which repeals the well-\nknown McCarran-Ferguson Act. McCarran-Ferguson gave States the \nauthority to regulate the business of insurance and exempted insurance \nfrom the Federal antitrust laws. Unfortunately, McCarran-Ferguson came \nabout as a result of a Senator from my State of Nevada, McCarran, and a \nSenator from Michigan, Ferguson. It was passed to give a few years of \nrelief to the insurance industry. In 1944, the United States Supreme \nCourt ruled against the industry-wide practice of cooperating to set \npremium prices in United States v. Southeastern Underwriters \nAssociation. Insurers argued that most companies were too small to rely \nsolely on their own experience in setting premiums. As a result of \nthese protests the McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed by Congress in \n1945, exempting insurance-rate fixing from the Sherman Antitrust Act, \nand placing responsibility for industry regulation in the hands of \nstate governments.\n  Now, some 60 plus years later, insurance companies are the only \nbusinesses--other than Major League Baseball--not subject to antitrust \nlaws. Congress began investigating the effectiveness of State insurance \nregulation in 1958, under the oversight of Senator O'Mahoney, who had \nbeen a principal architect of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and found \nState regulation lacking, incapable of dealing with interstate and \ninternational issues, and unwilling or unable to ``bring the blessings \nof competition'' to insurance rate-making. The same thing is true \ntoday, and its time we take action to remedy this situation. The \nrationale for this exemption has long since passed. Insurance should be \nlike any other business--subject to antitrust laws.\n  Senator Leahy's bill would accomplish this. ``The Insurance Industry \nCompetition Act of 2007'' would repeal the exemption and simply give \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission the \nauthority to apply the antitrust laws to anticompetitive behavior by \ninsurance companies. Such oversight could ensure that the industry is \nnot engaging in the most egregious forms of anticompetitive conduct--\nprice fixing, agreements not to pay, and market allocations. This Act \nwould not affect the ability of each State to regulate the business of \ninsurance.\n  If insurers around the country are operating in an honest and \nappropriate way, they should not object to being answerable under the \nsame Federal antitrust laws as virtually all other businesses. American \nconsumers should be confident that the cost of their insurance reflects \ncompetitive market conditions, not collusive behavior, and they should \nbenefit through lower prices, more choices, and better services.\n  Perhaps nowhere has the insurance industry and its practices come \nunder as much scrutiny as along the Gulf Coast in the wake of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Just yesterday, the AP reported that \n``State Farm Insurance Cos. is suspending sales of any new commercial \nor homeowner policies in Mississippi starting Friday.'' I ask Unanimous \nConsent that a news article dated February 14, 2007, from the \nAssociated Press be printed in the Record. Insurers have been too often \ndenying claims and delaying payouts to residents of New Orleans and all \nalong the Gulf Coast instead of honoring their contractual commitments \nto their customers, and thereby contributing to the rebuilding and \nrejuvenation of the area. We need to act now to end this practice. I \nthank Senators Leahy, Specter, and Lott for their work on this \nimportant legislation.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  State Farm: No New Policies in Miss.\n\n                         (By Michael Kunzelman)\n\n       State Farm Insurance Cos. is suspending sales of any new \n     commercial or homeowner policies in Mississippi starting \n     Friday, citing in part a wave of litigation it has faced \n     after Hurricane Katrina, a company official said Wednesday.\n       Mike Fernandez, vice president of public affairs for State \n     Farm, said Mississippi's ``current legal and political \n     environment is simply untenable. We're just not in a position \n     to accept any additional risk in this homeowners' market.''\n       Fernandez said the action was not a direct response to any \n     specific development in the litigation. That litigation has \n     included a recent federal jury's $2.5 million punitive damage \n     award to a policyholder who sued State Farm for refusing to \n     cover the 2005 hurricane's storm surge damage.\n       State Farm, the largest homeowners insurer in Mississippi \n     with more than 30 percent of the market, agreed to settle \n     hundreds of lawsuits by policyholders and reopen and pay \n     thousands of other disputed claims. The landmark deal is \n     potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars for \n     Mississippi homeowners devastated by Katrina.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\n  S. 620. A bill to establish a demonstration project to train \nunemployed workers for employment as health care professionals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the third in a \nseries of bills intended to support American companies and American \nworkers. Earlier this week, I introduced a resolution which would set \nsome minimum standards for future trade agreements into which our \ncountry enters, and legislation which would strengthen the Buy American \nAct. Today I am introducing legislation that would help workers who \nhave lost their manufacturing or service sector jobs to be retrained \nfor jobs in high-demand health care fields. I am pleased that my \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, is cosponsoring this important legislation \nand I look forward to working with her to advance it during the 110th \nCongress.\n  According to statistics from the Department of Labor, Wisconsin has \nlost over 90,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2000 and November \n2006. Nationally, the country has lost around 3 million manufacturing \njobs since January 2001, yet the administration has continued to \nsupport policies that lead to the outsourcing of American jobs. I \ncontinue to be deeply troubled by the Bush Administration's contention \nthat the outsourcing of American service sector and other jobs is good \nfor the economy. I am concerned about the message that this policy \nsends to Wisconsinites and all Americans who are currently employed in \nthese sectors.\n  There is something of a silver lining to the looming cloud of \nmanufacturing and other jobs loss: the country's workforce development \nsystem.\n  In spite of stretched resources and long waiting lists for services, \nour workforce development boards are making a tremendous effort to \nretrain laid-off workers and other job seekers for new jobs. And this \neffort is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where my State's workforce \ndevelopment boards--despite shoestring budgets--are leading the way in \nfinding innovative solutions to retraining workers for new careers.\n  I strongly support the work of these agencies, and have urged the \nAdministration and Senate appropriators to provide adequate funding for \nthe job training programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act. I \nlook forward to the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act \nthis year and I will continue to work to ensure that the workforce \ndevelopment boards in my state and across our country receive the \nresources that they need to help job seekers get the training they need \nto be successful.\n  I am committed to finding resources to retrain those who have been \nlaid off from the manufacturing and service sectors and who wish to \nfind new jobs in high-demand fields such as health care.\n  As most of my colleagues know all too well, we are facing a \nsignificant shortage of health care workers. Congress has made some \nprogress in addressing the nursing shortage, but we need to expand our \nefforts. Shortages of health professionals pose a real threat to the \nhealth of our communities by impacting access to timely, high-quality \nhealth care. Studies have shown that shortages of nurses in our \nhospitals and health facilities increase medical errors, which directly \naffects patient health.\n  As our population ages, and the baby-boomers need more health care, \nour need for all types of health professionals is only going to \nincrease. This is particularly true for the field of long-term care. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are going to need an \nadditional 1.4 million nursing aides, home health aides, and other \nhealth professionals in long-term care before the year 2014. In total, \nthere will be almost 1.7 million job openings in health care support \noccupations through 2012.\n  As our demand for health care workers grows, so does the number of \njobs available within this sector. According to the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development, the surging job growth in health \ncare will translate into a real need for workers, and real opportunity. \nIn Wisconsin alone, there will be an additional 61,910 health care \npositions by 2014. This represents a 27 percent increase in jobs in \nhealth care by 2014.\n  Workforce development agencies in my home State of Wisconsin are \nalready working to support displaced workers in their communities by \ntraining them for health care jobs, since there is a real need for \nworkers in these fields. These agencies are helping communities get and \nmaintain access to high-quality health care by ensuring that there are \nenough health care workers to care for their communities.\n  As the executive director of one of the workforce development boards \nin my State put it, ``[t]here are simply not many good quality jobs to \nreplace manufacturing jobs lost to rural communities. The medical \nprofessions, by offering a `living wage' and good benefits, provide an \nexcellent alternative to manufacturing for sustaining a higher, family-\noriented standard of living.''\n  I believe we should support our communities in these efforts by \nproviding them with the resources they need to establish, sustain, or \nexpand these important programs. For that reason, today I am \nintroducing the Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act. This bill \nwould amend the Workforce Investment Act to authorize a demonstration \nproject to provide grants to community-based coalitions, led by local \nworkforce development boards, to create programs to retrain unemployed \nworkers who wish to obtain new jobs in the health care professions. My \nbill would authorize a total of $25 million for grants between $100,000 \nand $500,000, and, in the interest of fiscal responsibility, my \nlegislation is fully offset.\n  This bill will help provide communities with the resources they need \nto run retraining programs for the health professions. The funds could \nbe used for a variety of purposes, from increasing the capacity of our \nschools and training facilities, to providing financial and social \nsupport for workers who are in retraining programs. This bill allows \nfor flexibility in the use of grant funds because I believe that \ncommunities know best about the resources they need to run an efficient \nprogram.\n  This bill represents a nexus in my efforts to support workers whose \njobs have been shipped overseas and to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to the high-quality health care that they deserve. By providing \ntargeted assistance to train laid-off workers who wish to obtain new \njobs in the health care sector, we can both help unemployed Americans \nand improve the availability and quality of health care that is \navailable in our communities.\n  I am pleased that this bill is supported by a variety of \norganizations that are committed to providing high-quality job training \nand health care services, including: the Wisconsin Association of Job \nTraining Executives, the Wisconsin Hospital Association, Madison Area \nTechnical College, the Northwest Wisconsin Concentrated Employment \nProgram, the Workforce Development Board of South Central Wisconsin, \nthe Bay Area Workforce Development Board, the Healthcare Workforce \nNetwork, the Southwest Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Sauk \nCounty Development Corporation, the American Osteopathic Society, Umos, \nthe Fox Valley Workforce Development Board, and the West Central \nWisconsin Workforce Development Board.\n  In order to ensure that our workers are able to compete in the new \neconomy, we must ensure that they have the tools they need to be \ntrained or retrained for high-demand jobs such as those in the health \ncare field. My bill is a small step toward providing the resources \nnecessary to achieve this goal. I will continue to work to strengthen \nthe American manufacturing sector and to support those workers who have \nbeen displaced due to bad trade agreements and other policies that have \nled to the loss of American jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish commissions to review the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European Americans, \nEuropean Latin Americans, and Jewish refugees during World War II; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act. This bill would create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II, and another commission to review the U.S. government's \ntreatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War \nII. This bill is long overdue.\n  I am very pleased that my colleagues Senators Grassley, Kennedy, \nLieberman and Inouye have joined me as cosponsors of this important \nbill. I thank them for their support. And I thank Congressman Wexler, \nwho has been the unflagging champion of this legislation in the House \nof Representatives.\n  The victory of America and its allies in the Second World War was a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all Americans.\n  But, at the same time that so many brave Americans fought for freedom \nin\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nEurope and the Pacific, the U.S. government was curtailing the freedom \nof people here at home. While, it is, of course, the right of every \nnation to protect itself during wartime, the U.S. Government must \nrespect the basic freedoms for which so many Americans have given their \nlives to defend. War tests our principles and our values. And as our \nNation's recent experience has shown, it is during times of war and \nconflict, when our fears are high and our principles are tested most, \nthat we must be even more vigilant to guard against violations of the \nbasic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  Many Americans are aware that during World War II, under the \nauthority of Executive Order 9066, our government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes and ultimately into internment \ncamps. Japanese Americans were forced to leave their homes, their \nlivelihoods, and their communities and were held behind barbed wire and \nmilitary guard by their own government. Through the work of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, created \nby Congress in 1980, this shameful event finally received the official \nacknowledgement and condemnation it deserved. Under the Civil Liberties \nAct of 1988, people of Japanese ancestry who were subjected to \nrelocation or internment later received an apology and reparations on \nbehalf of the people of the United States.\n  February 19, 2007, is the ``Day of Remembrance,'' the 65th \nanniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066. On this day, we \nshould remember the freedoms all of these individuals were forced to \ngive up, and resolve never to make these mistakes again.\n  While I commend our government for finally recognizing and \napologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World War \nII, I believe that it is time that the government also acknowledge the \nmistreatment experienced by many German Americans, Italian Americans, \nand European Latin Americans, as well as Jewish refugees.\n  The Wartime Treatment Study Act would create two independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to review this unfortunate history, so that \nAmericans can understand why it happened and work to ensure that it \nnever happens again. One commission will review the treatment by the \nU.S. government of German Americans, Italian Americans, and other \nEuropean Americans, as well as European Latin Americans, during World \nWar II.\n  I believe that most Americans are unaware that, as was the case with \nJapanese Americans, approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic \nItalians, and scores of Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians or other \nEuropean Americans living in America were taken from their homes and \nplaced in internment camps during World War II. We must learn from this \nhistory and explore why we turned on our fellow Americans and failed to \nprotect their basic freedoms.\n  A second commission created by this bill will review the treatment by \nthe U.S. government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi \npersecution and genocide. We must review the facts here as well and \ndetermine how restrictive immigration policies failed to provide \nadequate safe harbor to Jewish refugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi \nGermany. It is a horrible truth that the United States turned away \nthousands of refugees, delivering many refugees to their deaths at the \nhands of the Nazi regime.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a measure of justice for \nJapanese Americans who were denied their liberty and property. It is \nnow time for the U.S. government to complete the accounting of this \nperiod in our nation's history. It is time to create independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to conduct a full and through review of the \ntreatment of all European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees during World War II.\n  Up to this point, there has been no justice for the thousands of \nGerman Americans, Italian Americans, and other European Americans who \nwere branded ``enemy aliens'' and then taken from their homes, \nsubjected to curfews, limited in their travel, deprived of their \npersonal property, and, in the worst cases, placed in internment camps.\n  There has been no justice for Latin Americans of European descent who \nwere shipped to the United States and sometimes repatriated or deported \nto hostile, war-torn European Axis powers, often in exchange for \nAmericans being held in those countries.\n  Finally, there has been no justice for the thousands of Jews, like \nthose aboard the German vessel the St. Louis, who sought refuge from \nhostile Nazi treatment but were callously turned away at America's \nshores.\n  The injustices to European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees occurred more than fifty years ago. Americans can learn \nfrom these tragedies now, while the people who survived these \ninjustices are still with us, and are still here to teach us. We cannot \nput this off any longer. If we wait, the people who were affected will \nno longer be here to know that Congress has at last recognized their \nsacrifice and resolved to learn from the mistakes of the past.\n  We should never allow this part of our Nation's history to repeat \nitself. And, while we should be proud of our Nation's triumph in World \nWar II, we should not let that justifiable pride blind us to the \ntreatment of some Americans by their own government.\n  As the Day of Remembrance approaches, I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting the Wartime Treatment Study Act, and to allow this bill \nto become law as soon as possible. I have been seeking to enact this \nlegislation for six years. It is time for a full accounting of this \ntragic chapter in our Nation's history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Wartime Treatment Study \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance fair and open competition in the production \nand sale of agricultural commodities; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Competitive \nand Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2007.'' Cosponsors joining me in \nintroducing this legislation are: Senators Enzi, Feingold, Thomas, \nDorgan, Baucus and  McCaskill. This legislation seeks to level the \nplaying field for agricultural producers by strengthening and \nclarifying the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 and the Agricultural \nFair Practices Act of 1967 and strengthening enforcement of both laws \nby USDA. I intend to use this legislation as the basis for developing a \nproposed competition title in the new farm bill this year.\n  Consolidation is happening in all sectors of agriculture and having a \nnegative effect on producers and consumers across the Nation. \nConsolidation in itself is not a violation of the Packers and \nStockyards Act, but when some entities become larger and more powerful \nthat makes enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act absolutely \ncritical for independent livestock and poultry\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\nproducers. The statistics speak for themselves. For example, today, \nonly four firms control 84 percent of the procurement of cattle and 64 \npercent of the procurement of hogs. Economists have stated that when \nfour firms control over 40 percent of the industry, marketplace \ncompetitiveness begins to decline. Taken together with fewer buyers of \nlivestock, highly integrated firms can exert tremendous power over the \nindustry.\n  The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, GIPSA, \nat USDA has the responsibility to enforce the Packers and Stockyards \nAct. This Act is critical, and protects livestock producers from \nunfair, unjustly discriminatory and anti-competitive practices in the \nmarketplace. For years I have had my doubts about whether USDA was \nserious about enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act. In 2005, I \nrequested an audit by USDA's Inspector General to investigate USDA's \noversight, and enforcement of the law. Last year, the Inspector General \nconfirmed the concerns I had and uncovered even more systemic problems. \nThe report described widespread inaction, management of the agency \nactively blocking employees from conducting investigations into anti-\ncompetitive behavior and a scheme to cover up the lack of enforcement \nby inflating the reported number of investigations conducted.\n  That is why today, the legislation I introduce will reorganize the \nstructure in how USDA enforces the Packers and Stockyards Act and \ncreate an office of special counsel on competition matters. The special \ncounsel would be appointed by the President with advice and consent \nfrom the U.S. Senate. Some would argue that Senate advice and consent \nis not needed. However, for over five years, GIPSA failed to move \ncompetition investigations forward and no one above the level of deputy \nadministrator at GIPSA seemed to have any idea that any problems were \ngoing on, despite the fact I was sending letters to the Secretary of \nAgriculture pointing out that USDA was failing to enforce the law.\n  In the past year, GIPSA has worked in good faith to improve its \nenforcement activities. However, GIPSA only investigates potential \nviolations of the law, they do not litigate and follow-through with the \ninvestigation to the end. Litigating cases is reserved only for USDA's \nOffice of General Counsel, OGC, unless they refer it to the Department \nof Justice.\n  USDA's Office of General Counsel has not been active on cases \ninvolving anti-competitive practices in recent years since GIPSA was \nnot referring cases to them. To be sure, only two cases involving anti-\ncompetitive practices were referred to OGC in 5 years. But there are \nconcerns that OGC is not as committed to enforcing competition \ninvestigations as they should be. This lack of commitment was clearly \nevident last year in testimony provided by OGC Assistant General \nCounsel in the Trade Practices Division at a hearing by the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n  Concerns about OGC's attitude toward enforcing the Packers and \nStockyards Act are not new. USDA's Inspector General stated in its 1997 \naudit that Packers and Stockyards program officials were concerned that \nOGC did not want to litigate competition cases ``because they are \ncomplicated and time consuming'' and OGC had ``limited expertise'' with \nthem. In 2000, the Government Accountability Office found \n``disagreements'' between OGC and GIPSA regarding the interpretation of \nthe Act's competition provisions. By combining investigation and \nprosecution activities into the proposed special counsel office, \ndesignated to handle competition issues, it reduces the ability for \ninvestigations to be batted back and forth within USDA.\n  This legislation also makes many important clarifications to the \nPackers and Stockyards Act. The Packers and Stockyards Act prohibits \nunfair, unjustly discriminatory and anti-competitive practices, but \nsome courts have ruled that producers need to prove an impact on \ncompetition in the market in order to prevail in such cases involving \nunfair or deceptive practices. For example, the United States Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals ruled that a poultry grower operation failed \nto prove how its case involving an unfair termination of its contract \nadversely affected competition. The court indicated that the grower had \nto prove that their unfair treatment affected competition in the \nrelevant market. That is very difficult to prove and was never the \nintent of the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  This legislation also modifies the Packers and Stockyards Act so that \npoultry growers have the same enforcement protections by USDA as \nlivestock. Currently, it is unlawful for a livestock packer or live \npoultry dealer to engage in any unfair, unjustly discriminatory or \ndeceptive practice, but USDA does not have the authority to enforce \nviolations because the enforcement section of the law is absent of any \nreference to poultry. This important statutory change is long overdue. \nIn addition, to better reflect the integrated nature of the poultry \nindustry, this legislation also ensures that protections under the law \nextend to all poultry growers, such as breeder hen and pullet \noperations, not just those who raise broilers.\n  The Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 was passed by Congress to \nensure that producers are allowed to join together as an association to \nstrengthen their position in the marketplace without being \ndiscriminated against by handlers. Unfortunately, this act was passed \nwith a clause that essentially abolishes the actual intent of the law. \nThe act states that ``nothing in this Act shall prevent handlers and \nproducers from selecting their customers'' and it also states that it \ndoes not ``require a handler to deal with an association of \nproducers.'' This clause in effect allows handlers to think of any \nreason possible to not do business with certain producers, as long as \nthe stated reason is not because they belong to an association.\n  I propose to expand the Agricultural Fair Practices Act to provide \nnew needed protections for agricultural contracts. As I have mentioned \nearlier, consolidation in all sectors of agriculture is reducing the \nnumber of buyers of commodities and for the very few who are left, many \nrequire contracts to conduct business. With so few buyers, it increases \nthe chances that some firms will force unfair contracts upon producers. \nAs a result, some producers have little or no choice but to contract \nwith a firm with questionable practices or face leaving the industry \nthey have known for their whole lives.\n  This amendment to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act requires that \nthe contract spell out in clear language what is required by the \nproducer. This legislation prohibits confidentiality clauses, ensuring \nproducers the ability to share the contract with family members or a \nlawyer to help them make an informed decision on whether or not to sign \nit. This legislation also prevents companies from prematurely \nterminating contracts without notice when producers have made large \ncapital investments as a condition of signing the contract. And it only \nallows mandatory arbitration after a dispute arises and both parties \nagree to it in writing. Producers should not be forced to sign \ncontracts with arbitration clauses thereby preventing them from seeking \nlegal remedy in the courts.\n  Mr. President, producers deserve to have a fair and evenhanded market \nin which to conduct business. This legislation won't be able to turn \nback the clock, but it will strengthen laws and enforcement of them so \nthat markets operate more fairly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Vitter, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 623. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe licensing of comparable and interchangeable biological products, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Access to \nLife-Saving Medicine Act with my colleague, Senator Clinton. \nRecognizing the promise of generic drugs as safe and effective \ntreatments at greatly reduced prices, I have worked for years with my \ncolleagues in the House and the Senate to increase generic drug \navailability and accessibility, most notably with Senator McCain on a \n2003 law. This legislation represents the next step in the availability \nof generic drugs for American consumers by creating a statutory pathway \nfor generic\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nversions of biotech drugs to enter the market.\n  While generic drugs save American consumers an estimated eight to ten \nbillion dollars each year, American consumers have not yet reaped the \nfull potential savings from the generic drug market. Under current law, \nthere is no generic approval process at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, for an entire category of drugs, even once the \npatents have expired. These biologic drugs, which are an expensive and \ngrowing sector of the pharmaceutical market, will obtain monopoly \npricing on the market indefinitely without the possibility of generic \ncompetitors.\n  Drug companies that invest in the research and development of life-\nsaving drugs, whether biological or chemical in nature, deserve to be \nrewarded for their work. At the same time, patients need the ability to \naccess affordable drugs. We have created a statutory framework for \nchemical drugs that balances incentives for continued innovations with \naccess to affordable drugs for patients. But, this framework has not \nyet expanded to biotech drugs, which are on the cutting edge of science \nbut for which the laws are hopelessly out of date.\n  Now is the time to ensure that American consumers have the same \naccess to life-saving biotech drugs that consumers have to well-known, \nwidely used chemical drugs. Patients need to be able to afford and \naccess their medications, and they don't care what kind of drug they \nhave. Patients rely on biotech drugs to treat a wide array of diseases, \nranging from diabetes to cancer to AIDS, but with no generic versions \nof biotech drugs available, these drugs can cost tens of thousands of \ndollars a year--too expensive for many patients to afford. Introducing \nfair competition for biotech drugs is essential to make life-saving \nbiotech treatments affordable.\n  The Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act will allow the FDA to approve \ngeneric versions of biologic drugs that have been determined to be both \nsafe and effective. The FDA is not required to approve any generic \nbiologics, but if the data is there, they will now have the ability to \ndo so.\n  A report released earlier this year by Pharmaceutical Care Management \nAssociation estimated that the introduction of generic biotech drugs \ninto the market could save Medicare Part B $14 billion over the next \nten years. We need to embrace those potential savings and provide \nAmerican consumers access to affordable biotech drugs.\n  Moving this legislation forward and creating a statutory pathway for \ngeneric versions of biotech drugs to enter the market is one of my \nhighest priorities in the 110th Congress. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues, especially Senator Clinton, to accomplish this \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Ms. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator \nSchumer to introduce the Access of Life-Saving Medicine Act. This \nlegislation will have a dramatic impact on the rising costs of \nprescription drugs, which puts the squeeze on employers trying to \nprovide health coverage for employees while turning a profit, on \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet, and on our economy. We spend 16 \npercent of our national income on health care and prescription drugs \nand that number is on the climb.\n  In 2005, the cost of biologics grew 17.5 percent compared to the cost \nof traditional drugs, which increased 10 percent. According to CMS, the \ntop 2 anemia drugs--both biologics--accounted for 17 percent of all \nMedicare Part B carrier drug spending, while two other biologics for \nrheumatoid arthritis and cancer accounted for an additional 13 percent. \nIn 2006, the Medicare Part B program spent more than $5 billion on \nbiologic drugs.\n  More than $10 billion worth of biopharmaceuticals will come off \npatent in the next 5 years but will continue to cost on-patent prices \nunless we act. Our legislation creates a pipeline for approval of safe, \ncost effective generic versions of these biologic drugs. Without \naction, the manufacturers of these biotech drugs can continue to charge \nmonopoly prices indefinitely.\n  This is a perfect example of skyrocketing costs in health care--and a \nperfect opportunity to put the brakes on this overspending, which is \nbad for patients, businesses, and our country.\n  According to a report released in January by Engel & Novitt to the \nPharmaceutical Care Management Association, passage of this bill could \nsave, by conservative estimates, $14 billion over the next 10 years in \nMedicare Part B alone.\n  Scientific advances over the past 20 years have made the \nbiotechnology industry an integral part of the pharmaceutical industry, \nbut our health care system has not kept pace. Our laws need to be \nupdated to reflect the critical role biologics now play in treatment.\n  The Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act amends the Public Health \nService Act to authorize the FDA to approve abbreviated applications \nfor biological products that are ``comparable'' to and \n``interchangeable'' with previously approved biological products. And \nbecause biological products are very diverse, the Secretary has \ndiscretion on a case-by-case basis to determine what studies are \nnecessary to establish comparability and interchangeability, and may \nrequire a clinical study or studies if necessary.\n  To encourage the development of substitutable products, the \nlegislation gives the first applicant to obtain approval of an \ninterchangeable product a period of exclusive marketing during which no \nother interchangeable version of the product may be approved. In order \nto facilitate timely access to these products, an approval may, \nhowever, be granted for a comparable version of the brand name product \nif it is not interchangeable.\n  Finally, to encourage early resolution of patent disputes which might \notherwise delay competition, a patent holder must disclose relevant \npatents in response to a request and bring a patent infringement suit \nwithin 45 days of notice of a challenge or lose the right to certain \nremedies in court.\n  Biotech drugs hold great promise, but we break that promise when \ncosts push treatment out of reach for American families and employers. \nWe should bring safe, effective and affordable generic versions of \nthese medicines to patients through passage of the Access to Life-\nSaving Medicine Act, saving money and lives.\n  This issue is part of a larger challenge. It is time to develop a \nhealth care system that reflects and responds to how people are living \ntoday, that addresses the critical problems in cost, quality, and \ncoverage.\n  We can use what is right in health care--incredible ingenuity, \nleaders at the forefront of medical research, advances in technology, \nthe best medical professionals in the world--to fix what is wrong.\n  Smart solutions to the vexing problems plaguing our health care \nsystem will require evidence-based--not ideologically-based--decision \nmaking.\n  My wonderful predecessor, Senator Moynihan, memorably said, \n``Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but no one is entitled to \nhis own facts.'' Well, right now, we see a lot of people who have their \nown facts that are not based on the evidence.\n  The fact is, building a pipeline for generic biologics is long \noverdue. Achieving this goal is a top priority for me in the HELP \nCommittee when we consider FDA-related legislation this spring and I \nlook forward to working with Senator Schumer and my other colleagues to \nget it done.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food and \nDrug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we are introducing legislation to \ngive the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate \ntobacco products. Congress cannot in good conscience allow the Federal \nagency most responsible for protecting the public health to remain \npowerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco, the most deadly \nof all consumer products. Health experts believe this legislation is \nthe most important action Congress could take to protect children from \nthis deadly addiction.\n  This is a bipartisan, bicameral initiative. The bill that Senator \nCornyn and I are introducing already has over 25 cosponsors. \nCongressman Waxman and Davis will introduce identical legislation in \nthe House. Our bill has the support of a broad coalition of public \nhealth organizations led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the \nAmerican Lung Association. They all recognize the importance of \nenacting this bill this year.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is well known. It is the \nsame bill that passed the Senate in 2004, and that we introduced in the \nlast Congress. However, in this new Congress, the likelihood of passage \nis greatly enhanced. Last November's election swept away many of the \nbarriers to passage from prior years. We believe 2007 is the year that \nlegislation empowering the FDA to regulate tobacco products will \nfinally become law.\n  We intend to move forward on the legislation quickly. I have already \nscheduled a hearing in the HELP Committee for February 27, and a markup \nis planned soon thereafter.\n  The stakes are vast. Four thousand children have their first \ncigarette every day, and one thousand become daily smokers. More than \none-third of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced diseases. \nCigarettes kill well over 400,000 Americans each year. That is more \nlives lost than from automobile accidents, alcohol abuse, illegal \ndrugs, AIDS, murder, and suicide combined. Congress's response to a \npublic health problem of this magnitude is long overdue.\n  Regulating the conduct of tobacco companies is as necessary today as \nit has been in years past. The facts presented in the Federal \nGovernment's landmark lawsuit against the tobacco industry demonstrate \nthat the misconduct is substantial and ongoing. The decision of the \ncourt states: ``The evidence in this case clearly establishes that \nDefendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful activity . . . \nDefendants continue to engage in conduct that is materially \nindistinguishable from their previous actions, activity that continues \nto this day.''\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over $15 billion a year to \npromote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways designed to \ntempt children to start smoking, before they are mature enough to \nappreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry knows that \nnearly 90 percent of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the \ntime they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Studies by the Institute of \nMedicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the substantial role \nof industry\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\nadvertising in decisions by young people to use tobacco products.\n  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the \npower to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children \nwherever it will be seen by children. This legislation will give FDA \nthe authority to stop tobacco advertising that glamorizes smoking to \nkids. It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising \n``consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First \nAmendment.''\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every State makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give \nthe youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA \nthe immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new \nstatute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical \nproblems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the \nauthority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  The nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say \nthat it is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. No one \ncan forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under oath \nbefore Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. Overwhelming \nevidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process \nproves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness for \ndecades, but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing \nstrategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers chemically \nmanipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more \naddictive.\n  A newly released analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health \ndemonstrates that cigarette manufacturers are still manipulating \nnicotine levels. Between 1998 and 2005, they significantly increased \nthe nicotine yield from major brand name cigarettes. The average \nincrease in nicotine yield over the period was 11 percent.\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public. Over 40 million \nAmericans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible public \nhealth official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban would \nleave 40 million people without a way to satisfy their drug dependency. \nFDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers \novercome their addiction, and to make the product less toxic for \nsmokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA must have \nthe authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from \ncigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nSome are already on the market making unsubstantiated claims. This \nlegislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced risk'' \nproducts to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nCongress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating \ntobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs to \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren, to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction, to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them, and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  Enacting this bill this year is the right thing to do for America's \nchildren. They are depending on us. By passing this legislation, we can \nhelp them live longer, healthier lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     have failed adequately to curb tobacco use by adolescents, \n     comprehensive restrictions on the sale, promotion, and \n     distribution of such products are needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2003, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than \n     $15,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than \n     adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily \n     marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and \n     older, smoke these same brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment \n     made by this Act) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) affect any action pending in Federal, State, or Tribal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the \n     Secretary to take certain actions with regard to tobacco and \n     tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any \n     authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law \n     regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, the amendments made by this \n     Act, or the application of any provision of this Act to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder \n     of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions of this Act to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected and shall continue to \n     be enforced to the fullest extent possible.\n\n         TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. 101. AMENDMENT OF FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.\n\n       (a) Definition of Tobacco Products.--Section 201 of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(rr)(1) The term `tobacco product' means any product made \n     or derived from tobacco that is intended for human \n     consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a \n     tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco \n     used in manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a \n     tobacco product).\n       ``(2) The term `tobacco product' does not mean--\n       ``(A) a product in the form of conventional food (including \n     water and chewing gum), a product represented for use as or \n     for use in a conventional food, or a product that is intended \n     for ingestion in capsule, tablet, softgel, or liquid form; or\n       ``(B) an article that is approved or is regulated as a drug \n     by the Food and Drug Administration.\n       ``(3) The products described in paragraph (2)(A) shall be \n     subject to chapter IV or chapter V of this Act and the \n     articles described in paragraph (2)(B) shall be subject to \n     chapter V of this Act.\n       ``(4) A tobacco product may not be marketed in combination \n     with any other article or product regulated under this Act \n     (including a drug, biologic, food, cosmetics, medical device, \n     or a dietary supplement).''.\n       (b) FDA Authority Over Tobacco Products.--The Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating chapter IX as chapter X;\n       (2) by redesignating sections 901 through 909 as sections \n     1001 through 1009;\n       (3) in section 1009 (as so redesignated), by striking \n     ``section 908'' and inserting ``section 1008''; and\n       (4) by inserting after chapter VIII the following:\n\n                     ``CHAPTER IX--TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\n     ``SEC. 900.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Bond in \nintroducing ``The Arthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act.''\n  Our goal in this important initiative is to provide a strong federal \nresponse to arthritis. Early diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate \nmanagement of arthritis can control its symptoms, improve the quality \nof life of patients, and Federal action will improve the lives of the \nfamily members and caregivers of those affected by the disease.\n  Arthritis exits in more than a hundred different forms. It's one of \nthe most devastating diseases impairing the health of the American \npeople. It's second only to heart disease as a cause of work \ndisability. It undermines everyday activities such as walking, dressing \nand bathing for more than seven million Americans.\n  One out of very five adults in the United States suffers from some \nform of arthritis. The number of patients in the U.S. with arthritis \nwill keep growing as the number of older Americans continues to \nincrease dramatically in the next few decades. Today, 8.7 million \nadults, ages 18 through 44, have arthritis and millions of others are \nat risk of developing the disease.\n  In fact, arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic illnesses and \nthe\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nleading cause of disability among Americans over age 15. More than 40 \npercent of adults with arthritis are limited in their activities \nbecause of their arthritis. By 2030, nearly 25 percent of the projected \nUnited States adult population will have arthritis and these numbers \ndon't account for the current trends in obesity, which may contribute \nto future cases of the disease.\n  It is an illness that affects all types of people in the U.S., not \njust older Americans. Arthritis knows no boundaries. Men, women and \nchildren are all afflicted with the disease. According to the Arthritis \nFoundation, 24 million women and 17 million men have been diagnosed \nwith arthritis by their doctors. Women are still disproportionately \naffected by the disease.\n  Nearly 3 out of every 1,000 American children are affected by \narthritis. The devastating effects of pediatric arthritis justifies \ngreater investment by the federal government in research and to \nidentify more effective treatments.\n  Special concerns are raised by juvenile arthritis because of its \nimpact on family relationships, school life, dating, sports and other \naspects active, growing youths. Teens and young adults entering the \nworkforce face even greater challenges.\n  Arthritis an other rheumatic diseases cost our economy $128 billion \nannually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nIn 2003, the cost was equivalent to 1.2 percent of the nation's gross \ndomestic product. $80 million of that amount were direct costs for \nmedical care and $47 million were indirect costs for lost earnings. \nNational medical costs attributed to arthritis grew by 24 percent \nbetween 1997 and 2003, with an increase attributed to the growing \nnumber of people affected with the disease.\n\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the National Arthritis Act to encourage \nbasic and clinical research, establish Multipurpose Arthritis Centers \nand expand clinical knowledge of the illness. The act was successful in \nimplementing and continued funding of research and has led to important \nadvances in the control, treatment and prevention of the illness.\n  Early diagnosis, treatment and management can control symptoms and \nimprove the quality of life. Weight control and exercise can help lower \nrisks. Patient education, training and self-management also contribute \nto greater control of these diseases. Innovative and increasingly \neffective drug therapies, joint replacements, and other therapeutic \nalternatives are being developed.\n  Despite much research identifying effective interventions, many of \nthem are not being used well enough and the inevitable result is \nunnecessary loss of life, poorer health and poorer quality of life.\n  Our legislation will expand the effort to find new ways to prevent, \ntreat and care for patients with arthritis and related rheumatic \ndiseases.\n  It will enhance the National Arthritis Action Plan by providing \nadditional support to federal, state and private efforts to prevent and \nmanage arthritis. It will establish a National Arthritis Education and \nOutreach Campaign to inform the health care profession and the public \nabout the most successful self-management strategies for controlling \nthe illness.\n  With greater coordination and intensification of federal research, \nthis bill will organize a National Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases \nSummit to look at the challenges and opportunities related to these \nefforts.\n  In addition, the bill will provide greater attention to juvenile \narthritis research by offering planning grants for research specific to \njuveniles and by prioritizing the activities that create better \nunderstanding of the incidence and outcomes associated with juvenile \narthritis.\n  Finally the bill contains incentives to encourage health \nprofessionals to enter the field of pediatric rheumatology by education \nloan repayment and career development awards.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this public health initiative to \nreduce the pain and disability of arthritis. Early diagnosis, effective \ntreatment and greater investment in research and prevention can help us \nwage a stronger battle against one of the most widespread and \ndevastating conditions affecting our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Specter, and Mr. \n        Martinez):\n  S. 627. A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974 to improve the health and well-being of \nmaltreated infants and toddlers through the creation of a National \nCourt Teams Resource Center, to assist local Court Teams, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Oregon, Senator Smith, to introduce \nthe Safe Babies Act of 2007.\n  It is a tragic fact that America's child welfare system is failing \nour most vulnerable. From birth to age five, children develop their \nsocial, emotional, cognitive and moral capacities more rapidly than at \nany other time in life. Early experiences and relationships are \nabsolutely critical to future development; they set the stage for how \nwell individuals learn, think, control their emotions, and relate to \nothers.\n  This critical period is a time of tremendous promise, but also a time \nof great vulnerability. Unfortunately, infants and toddlers are \ndisproportionately affected by child abuse and neglect. Children \nbetween birth and age three are twice as likely as older children to \nbecome victims of maltreatment, and are three times more likely to be \nplaced in foster care. Abuse and neglect during this significant period \ncan lead to perilous developmental outcomes, including school failure, \ndelinquency and crime, substance abuse, and mental health problems.\n  Yet the current child welfare system does a particularly poor job of \nserving infants and toddlers. Once in foster care, infants and toddlers \nare more likely to be abused. And they stay in foster care longer than \nolder children. More than 40 percent of infants and toddlers involved \nin a maltreatment investigation are developmentally delayed, yet only \n10 percent of these young people currently receive treatment for \ndevelopmental problems.\n  A Federal review of 19 States' performance on child welfare outcomes \nfound that all of the States received failing grades on outcomes \nrelated to providing adequate physical and mental health services.\n  Without intervention, we put our future generation at risk and \nperpetuate the cycle of maltreatment. But we can alter these \ndevelopmental outcomes by ensuring that children are in safe, permanent \nhomes and have access to necessary mental and physical health care. The \nSafe Babies Act authorizes funding for juvenile courts to create Court \nTeams for the integrated handling of infant and toddler abuse and \nneglect cases. By bringing together the legal, child welfare, and \nchildren's services communities, we can promote the health and well-\nbeing of our babies and toddlers.\n  First, this bill establishes a National Court Teams Resource Center. \nThis Resource Center would provide grants and technical assistance to \njuvenile courts for the creation of local Court Teams to better handle \ninfant and toddler abuse and neglect cases. Few judges have all the \nnecessary knowledge about early childhood development and they \nfrequently lack resources in the community for services necessary for \nyoung children. They are often frustrated by the piecemeal provision of \nservices and the overburdened child welfare system. To adequately serve \nchildren, they need the expertise of child welfare workers, Guardians \nAd Litem, Court Appointed Special Advocates, substance abuse treatment \nproviders and mental health care providers. Court Teams bring together \nthis expertise. Through monthly case reviews, judges can coordinate \nefforts by all members of the team to ensure efficient and effective \nprovision of services. The goal of these courts is to prevent multiple \nplacements for infants and toddlers in foster care, secure needed \nservices, and find a permanent home for these children as quickly as \npossible.\n  Court Teams work with families in an effort to reunite children with \ntheir parents. By bringing together multiple service providers, they \ncan facilitate opportunities for parents to learn to create a safe and \nnurturing home environment. Court Teams ensure support for future \nreunification only when the\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nparent is ready and able to step up to provide an appropriate and safe \nenvironment. We know from research that each visit between a child and \nbirth parent triples the likelihood of achieving permanence. Through \nthe Court Teams, judges are able to coordinate education and \nsupervision so parents can visit their children and continue to nurture \na loving bond.\n  Although reunification with parents is the ultimate goal, when that \nis not possible, Court Teams are also focusing on Plan B. By conducting \nconcurrent planning, Court Teams are more likely to find an appropriate \nplacement that will lead to permanency and minimize disruptions. By \nsupporting training for foster parents and newly reunified biological \nparents, we can prevent children from being bounced around in the \nfoster care system.\n  Court Teams are also able to coordinate services for children. Judges \nand child welfare services are able to collaborate to include necessary \nmedical and developmental interventions. By improving access to mental \nhealth and substance abuse treatment for parents and children, Court \nTeams make sure children are able to access needed services and \nincrease the chances of successful, healthy development.\n  Finally, Court Teams provide services and supports for families to \npreserve and stabilize homes for children. Judges are able to use court \noversight to ensure compliance, facilitate visits with caregivers to \npromote positive attachments, and make sure that children are in safe \nenvironments after placement.\n  The Safe Babies Act will make an important impact in the way we treat \ninfants and toddlers in the court system. By facilitating involvement \nfrom all parties, Court Teams are better equipped to ensure that young \nchildren have the community support and services they need. Early \nevaluation research in the Miami/Dade County court project finds a high \nrate of permanency for children in the court and increased quality of \nparent-child interaction. By finding permanent homes, children were \nable to escape the limbo of the foster care system. More importantly, \nthe court was successful in preventing any future recurrence of abuse \nor neglect.\n  Together we can work to protect the safety and well-being of our \ninfants and toddlers. With this legislation, we have the opportunity to \nensure that children are placed quickly in safe and loving homes. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nlegislation is passed and signed into law.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, to introduce the Safe Babies Act of 2007. The safety \nand well-being of our nation's children, including its most vulnerable \ninfants and toddlers, is very important and I am confident that this \nbill will take an important step forward in protecting them.\n  Mr. President, in our Nation millions of children are reported abused \nor neglected each year. Of these, more than 900,000 are confirmed \nmaltreated by child protective service organizations and our court \nsystems. Abuse and neglect of children causes about 1,500 deaths each \nyear. Children who are under the age of four are at the greatest risk \nfor injury or death--making up nearly 80 percent of child maltreatment \nfatalities. We also know that shaken-baby syndrome, SBS, is a form of \nabuse that affects more than 1,200 babies each year.\n  Studies also tell us that younger children who are abused or \nneglected are vulnerable to long-term challenges associated with their \nmaltreatment. Their long-term outcomes show much higher rates for \nsocial, emotional and cognitive impairment. They also are more likely \nto adopt high risk behaviors and develop substance abuse and mental \nhealth problems than their peers who have not been abused.\n  These numbers tell us very loudly that there is a problem in America. \nOur most vulnerable and innocent are being abused and need our help.\n  Children who come through our Nation's court systems need more \nsupport. While the hardworking judges, attorneys, child welfare workers \nand volunteers do so much to help stop the child abuse and neglect they \nsee every day, they too often see families returning to the courts \ngeneration after generation. They see their workloads expand. They see \ntoo many families in strife.\n  The Safe Babies Act will help these most vulnerable children. This \nbill puts into motion a proven model for helping infants and toddlers \nto recover from their abuse, and for families to stop the cycle of \nabuse and reunite. This model is made up of a judicial and mental \nhealth partnership, or ``court team,'' that provides the needed abuse \nand neglect prevention and early intervention services to children and \ntheir families. It is based on a model developed by the Honorable Cindy \nLederman of the Miami-Dade Juvenile Court in Miami. Seeing the success \nshe has had with this model. It has been replicated in courts across \nthe nation.\n  In my home State of Oregon, our Salem courts have developed the \n``Foster Attachment'' program based on Judge Lederman's model. This \nprogram brings together the courts, local treatment providers, and \nchild welfare agencies to provide substance abuse treatment and mental \nhealth treatment, as well as parenting intervention to help parents who \nhave had their children removed due to methamphetamine use.\n  I look forward to the passage of this important legislation and to \nworking with my colleague Senator Harkin to ensure its passage. There \nis no issue of greater importance than the safety and welfare of our \nnext generation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 628: A bill to provide grants for rural health information \ntechnology development activities; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill I introduce today, the Remote Monitoring Access Act of 2007, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Remote Monitoring Access Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Remote patient monitoring can make chronic disease \n     management more effective and efficient for patients and the \n     health care system.\n       (2) By collecting, analyzing, and transmitting clinical \n     health information to a health care practitioner, remote \n     monitoring technologies allow patients and physicians to \n     manage the patient's condition in a consistent and real-time \n     fashion.\n       (3) Utilization of these technologies not only improves the \n     quality of care given to patients, it also reduces the need \n     for frequent physician office appointments, costly emergency \n     room visits, and unnecessary hospitalizations.\n       (4) Monitoring a patient's disease from the home reduces \n     the need for face-to-face physician interactions, thereby \n     minimizing unnecessary travel and missed work and providing \n     particular value to individuals residing in rural or \n     underserved communities who would otherwise face potentially \n     significant access barriers to receiving needed care.\n       (5) Four major areas in which remote management \n     technologies are emerging in health care are the treatment of \n     congestive heart failure, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, and \n     sleep apnea (sleep disordered breathing). Prompt transmission \n     of clinical data on each of these conditions, to the \n     physician or the patient as appropriate, are essential to \n     providing timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions \n     which can then reduce expensive hospitalizations.\n       (6) Despite these innovations, remote management \n     technologies have failed to diffuse rapidly. A significant \n     barrier to wider adoption is the relative lack of payment \n     mechanisms in fee-for-service Medicare to reimburse for \n     remote, non-face-to-face management.\n       (7) This Act will eliminate this barrier to new \n     technologies by requiring Medicare to\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n     reimburse doctors for time spent analyzing data transmitted \n     to them by remote patient management technologies.\n       (8) This Act also promotes high quality care by requiring \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consult with \n     physician groups to create a standard of care and a quality \n     standard for remote patient management services for the \n     covered chronic conditions.\n       (9) This Act provides physicians with a financial incentive \n     to meet or exceed the standard of care and quality standards.\n\n     SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF REMOTE PATIENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR \n                   CHRONIC HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (Z), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (AA), by inserting ``and'' at the end; \n     and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (AA) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(BB) remote patient management services (as defined in \n     subsection (ccc));''.\n       (b) Services Described.--Section 1861 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new subsection:\n\n                  ``Remote Patient Management Services\n\n       ``(ccc)(1) The term `remote patient management services' \n     means the remote monitoring and management of an individual \n     with a covered chronic health condition (as defined in \n     paragraph (2)) through the utilization of a system of \n     technology that allows a remote interface to collect and \n     transmit clinical data between the individual and the \n     responsible physician or supplier for the purposes of \n     clinical review or response by the physician or supplier.\n       ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `covered \n     chronic health condition' includes--\n       ``(A) heart failure;\n       ``(B) diabetes;\n       ``(C) cardiac arrhythmia;\n       ``(D) sleep apnea; and\n       ``(E) any other chronic condition determined by the \n     Secretary to be appropriate for treatment through remote \n     patient management services.\n       ``(3)(A) The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate \n     physician groups, shall develop guidelines on the frequency \n     of billing for remote patient management services.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill I introduce today, the Working Together for Rural Access to \nMental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors Act, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Working Together for Rural \n     Access to Mental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Providing adequate mental health care in rural \n     communities is a national problem. Mental health is an \n     integral part of a person's general health and well-being. In \n     rural areas, where specialized mental health services are \n     scarce, accessing mental health professional services is \n     difficult. Primary care is often the only system for \n     delivering mental health services.\n       (2) Rural primary care providers are seeing an increase in \n     mental health issues in their clinics.\n       (3) The need is overwhelming with the Surgeon General \n     estimating 21 percent of children experience the signs or \n     symptoms of a mental disorder. Left untreated, these problems \n     lead to rampant school failure, drug abuse, and often \n     incarceration.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n       (4) The Department of Health and Human Services indicates \n     that 1 in 5 children and adolescents may have a diagnosable \n     disorder, yet 70 percent to 80 percent receive little or no \n     help.\n       (5) Few schools have the resources to implement a full \n     range of school mental health interventions. Identifying \n     sustainable and flexible funding sources for these programs \n     is extremely important.\n       (6) Health, and especially mental health, is a fundamental \n     cornerstone for ensuring that all youth have an equal \n     opportunity to succeed at school.\n       (7) Promoting and expanding telemental health \n     collaborations to strengthen delivery of mental health \n     services in remote and underserved areas is needed.\n       (8) Telemental health is an effective tool for diagnosing \n     and treating some mental health conditions. For rural and \n     remote areas, telemental health offers patients access and \n     care.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) provide assistance to rural schools, hospitals, and \n     communities for the conduct of collaborative efforts to \n     secure a progressive and innovative system to improve access \n     to mental health care for youth, seniors and families;\n       (2) increase access of elementary and secondary school \n     students to mental health services in rural areas by \n     operating a mobile health services van program in such areas; \n     or\n       (3) increase access of individuals of all ages to mental \n     health services in rural areas by providing telemental health \n     services in such areas.\n\n     SEC. 3. RURAL ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) State Grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall award grants to States to enable such States to award \n     subgrants to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n       (b) Eligibility and Amount.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--To be eligible for a grant under \n     subsection (a), a State shall submit to the Secretary an \n     application at such time, in such manner, and containing such \n     information as the Secretary may require, including an \n     assurance that the State will designate a lead agency in \n     accordance with subsection (c) and submit a State plan in \n     accordance with subsection (d).\n       (2) Amount.--The Secretary shall award a grant to a State \n     under this section in an amount that is based on the \n     respective number of critical access hospitals (as defined in \n     section 1861 (mm)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395x(mm)(1)) in the State as such compares to the total \n     number of critical access hospitals in all States that are \n     awarded grants under this section.\n       (c) State Lead Agency.--\n       (1) In general.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     this section, the governor of a State shall select a lead \n     agency within the State to administer the State programs \n     under the grant.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ngrant programs to provide for education and outreach on newborn \nscreening and coordinated followup care once newborn screening has been \nconducted, to reauthorize programs under part A of title XI of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague \nSenator Hatch to introduce legislation to protect the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society: newborn infants. Many people know the joy of \nparenthood. These parents know the sense of worry about whether their \nkids are doing well, are feeling well, and are safe. Nothing is of \ngreater importance than the health and well-being of our children.\n  Thanks to incredible advances in medical technology, it is now \npossible to test newborns for more than 50 genetic and metabolic \ndisorders. Many of these disorders, if undetected, would lead to severe \ndisability or death. However, babies that are properly diagnosed and \ntreated can, in many cases, go on to live healthy lives. So newborn \nscreening can literally save lives.\n  Frighteningly, the disorders that newborn screening tests for can \ncome without warning. For most of these disorders, there is no medical \nhistory of the condition in the family and no way to predict the health \nof a baby based on the health of the parents. Although the disorders \nthat are tested for are quite rare, there is a chance that any one \nnewborn will be affected. In that sense, this is an issue that has a \ndirect impact on the lives of all families.\n  Fortunately, some screening has become common practice in every \nstate. Each year, over four million infants have blood taken from their \nheel after birth to detect these disorders that could threaten their \nlife and long-term health. As a result, about one in 4,000 babies is \ndiagnosed with one of these disorders. That means that newborn \nscreening could protect the health or save the life of approximately \n1,000 newborns each year. That is 1,000 tragedies that can be averted \nfamilies that can know the joy of a new infant rather than absolute \nheartbreak.\n  In 2004, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) completed a \nreport commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nwhich recommended that every baby born in the U.S. be screened for \ntwenty-nine disorders, including certain metabolic conditions and \nhearing deficiency. Unfortunately, as of February 2007, only 11 States \nand the District of Columbia require infants to be screened for all \ntwenty-nine of these recommended disorders. If diagnosed early, all of \nthese conditions can be successfully managed or treated to prevent or \nmitigate severe and often lifelong health problems.\n  For every baby saved, another two are estimated to be born with \npotentially detectable disorders that go undetected because they are \nnot screened. These infants and their families face the prospect of \ndisability or death from a preventable disorder. The survival of a \nnewborn may very well come down to the state in which it is born, \nbecause not all states test for every detectable disorder.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a report in 2003 \nhighlighting the need for this legislation. According to the report, \nmost states do not educate parents and health care providers about the \navailability of tests beyond what is mandated by a State. States also \nreported that they do not have the resources to purchase the technology \nand train the staff needed to expand newborn screening programs. \nFinally, even when States do detect an abnormal screening result, the \nmajority do not inform parents directly.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will give states an \nadditional helping hand toward meeting the advisory's committee's \nrecommendation by providing $25 million for states to expand and \nimprove their newborn screening programs. In order to access these \nresources, states will be required to commit to screening for all 29 \ndisorders.\n  Our legislation will also authorize $15 million for two types of \ngrants. The first seeks to address the lack of information available to \nhealth care professionals and parents about newborn screening. Every \nparent should have the knowledge necessary to protect their child. The \ntragedy of a newborn's death is only compounded by the frustration of \nlearning that the death was preventable. This bill authorizes grants to \nprovide education and training to health care professionals, state \nlaboratory personnel, families and consumer advocates.\n  The second type of grant will support States in providing follow-up \ncare for those children diagnosed by a disorder detected through \nnewborn screening. While these families are the fortunate ones, in many \ncases they are still faced with the prospect of extended and complex \ntreatment and major lifestyle changes. We need to remember that care \ndoes not stop at diagnosis.\n  To ensure the quality of laboratories involved in newborn screening, \nso that tests are as accurate as possible and infants receive \nappropriate care, the legislation authorizes $5 million for the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to carry out a number of \nfunctions such as quality assurance for newborn screening tests, \nperformance evaluation services, and technical assistance and \ntechnology transfer to newborn screening labs.\n  In the event of a public health emergency, such as Hurricane Katrina, \nnewborn screening may seem like a low priority. However, if babies \naren't tested and, when necessary, treated within the first few days of \nlife, they may suffer irreparable harm or even death. In the wake of a \npublic health crisis, contingency planning for newborn screening is \nessential. Our legislation requires the CDC, in consultation with the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, to develop a \nnational contingency plan for newborn screening in the event of a \npublic health emergency within 180 days of enactment of the bill.\n  Finally, the bill directs the CDC, in consultation with HRSA, to \nestablish a national surveillance program for newborn screening, and \nauthorizes $15 million for that purpose. Such a program will help us \nconduct research to better understand these rare disorders, and will \nhopefully lead us toward more effective treatments and cures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation so that \nevery newborn child will have the best possible opportunity that \nAmerica can offer to live a long, healthy and happy life. I look \nforward to working with the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions (HELP) Committee, Senator Kennedy, and Ranking Member Enzi \nto advance this legislation as early as possible.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Newborn Screening Saves \n     Lives Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Each year more than 4,000,000 babies born in the United \n     States are screened by State and private laboratories to \n     detect some conditions that may threaten their long-term \n     health.\n       (2) However, there is a lack of uniformity in the number of \n     conditions for which newborns are screened throughout the \n     United States. While a newborn may be screened and treated \n     for a debilitating condition in one State, in another State, \n     the condition may go undetected and result in permanent \n     disability or even death.\n       (3) Approximately 4,000 infants born each year are \n     diagnosed with these detectable and treatable disorders. If \n     diagnosed early, these conditions can be successfully managed \n     or treated to prevent severe and often lifelong health \n     consequences.\n       (4) In 2004, the American College of Medical Genetics \n     (ACMG) completed a report commissioned by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services which recommended that every baby \n     born in the United States be screened for 29 specific \n     disorders, including certain metabolic conditions and hearing \n     deficiencies.\n       (5) Currently only 11 States and the District of Columbia \n     require infants to be screened for all 29 of these \n     recommended disorders.\n       (6) Continuity, especially during a public health \n     emergency, plays a critical role in the screening, diagnosis, \n     referral, and treatment of these disorders. Currently there \n     is no national contingency plan for maintaining continuity of \n     newborn screening systems following a public health \n     emergency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague \nSenator Christopher Dodd, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of \n2007.\n  Every State and U.S. territory routinely screens newborns for certain \ngenetic, metabolic, hormonal and functional disorders. Most of these \nbirth defects have no immediate visible effects on a baby but, unless \ndetected and treated early, can cause physical problems, mental \nretardation and, in some cases, death.\n  Babies who have these diseases and babies who do not have these \ndiseases look the same at birth. Fortunately, most babies are given a \nclean bill of health when tested. In cases where babies are found to \nhave metabolic disorders or hearing impairment, early diagnosis and \nproper treatment can make the difference between healthy development \nand lifelong impairment.\n  Except for hearing screening, all newborn screening tests are done \nusing a few drops of blood from the newborn's heel. Newborn screening \nchecks for diseases that can cause problems with the way the body gets \nenergy, how the body makes hormones, or how the body makes blood cells.\n  Currently each state or region operates by law its own newborn \nscreening program. Individual programs vary widely in the number and \ntypes of conditions for which they test. According to the National \nNewborn Screening and Genetics Resources Center, some States test for \nas few as four disorders, while others test for 30 or more.\n  Disparities among States in screening tests given at birth result in \ntoo many babies with serious birth defects not being diagnosed and \ntreated in time to avoid death or long term disability. Many States \noffer only limited educational materials for parents and health care \nproviders about the availability of newborn screening tests; therefore \nparents are often unaware of the importance of testing and may learn \ntoo late that their newborn has an abnormal metabolic condition which \ncould have been treated.\n  In 2004, the American College of Medical Genetics completed a report \ncommissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services which \nrecommended that every baby born in the United States be screened for \n29 disorders, including certain metabolic conditions and hearing \ndeficiency. Currently, only 11 States and the District of Columbia \nrequire the recommended screening for all 29 disorders.\n  Last year there was much success in improving newborn screening in my \nhome State of Utah, which increased testing from 4 to 36 disorders. The \nexpansion of newborn screening is a major advancement for children's \nhealthcare in Utah, as the screening should identify an additional 15 \nto 20 Utah infants every year in time to help them get the treatment \nthey need to live a fuller and healthier life.\n  Enactment of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act would provide \nnecessary resource materials to educate parents and health providers \nabout newborn screening and help states expand and improve their \nnewborn screening programs. Other important provisions of this \nlegislation help ensure the quality of laboratories involved in newborn \nscreening and call for establishing a system for collecting and \nanalyzing data from newborn screening programs.\n  The bill will establish grant programs to provide for education and \noutreach on newborn screening and coordinated follow-up care once \nnewborn screening has been conducted. It will help States expand and \nimprove their newborn screening programs, educate parents and providers \nand improve follow-up care for infants. The bill also contains \nprovisions for a contingency plan for newborn screening in the case of \na national public health emergency, such as that which was witnessed in \nthe wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 is endorsed by the \nMarch of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Easter Seals, and \nthe American Public Health Labs. These groups recognize that expanded \nnewborn screening will help pediatricians and other healthcare \nproviders identify rare disorders than can be easily confused with \ncommon pediatric problems. Diagnosing and treating these conditions \nwill help prevent irreversible brain damage, permanent disabilities, \nand possibly death. I urge my colleagues to take a stand for newborn \nhealth and support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 636. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe reporting period for certain statements\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nsent to taxpayers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Reduce \nWasteful Tax Forms Act of 2007.'' This bill extends the deadline from \nJanuary 31 to February 15 for certain types of 1099 forms to be sent to \ntaxpayers. 1099 forms are used to report non-wage income, such as \nincome from dividends and capital gains. These forms are distributed by \nbrokerage firms and financial institutions to their investors, who must \nreport the information on their income tax returns.\n  Due to recent changes in tax laws that govern income from interest \nand dividends, there has been a significant increase in the number of \ninaccurate forms sent out by firms in order to meet the January 31 \ndeadline. The problem is that much of the tax data for certain types of \ninvestment income cannot be calculated until after the first of the \nyear, resulting in a compressed window for calculating data in \ncompliance with the new laws and mailing the forms. Once accurate data \nbecomes available, financial institutions must send taxpayers an \namended form with the correct information.\n  These amended forms create confusion for taxpayers, and in some \ncases, those who receive an amended 1099 may have to re-file their \ntaxes. If taxpayers underpaid in their initial return, they could face \ninterest charges and penalties if they do not file again before the \nApril 15 deadline. The January 31 deadline results in tons of wasted \npaper, confusion for taxpayers, and wasted expenses incurred in sending \nthe amended forms.\n  This problem affects an increasing number of taxpayers. According to \nrecent press reports in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, prior to \n2003, an average of 5 to 8 percent of 1099 forms required correcting. \nThat number has since jumped to an average of 13 percent, translating \ninto millions of amended 1099s being sent to taxpayers each year.\n  My legislation would extend the deadline for sending 1099 forms to \ntaxpayers to February 15, by which time the vast majority of required \ndata will be available to ensure the accuracy of the forms. The bill \nextends the deadline only for certain types of 1099 forms used to \nreport investment income; it would not extend the deadline for 1099 \nforms sent to independent contractors or for statements that only \nreport interest earned on bank deposits. Accordingly, this extension \nwill not delay filing for the vast majority of taxpayers.\n  This year, the IRS granted several brokerage firms an extension to \nthe January 31 deadline. However, this bill would provide a permanent \nextension for all firms and financial institutions to remove the \nuncertainty for taxpayers that arises due to this unnecessarily early \ndeadline. My bill will help taxpayers by reducing confusion, the \nfinancial industry by cutting costs and waste, and the environment by \neliminating millions of unnecessary mailings.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with other Finance Committee \nmembers to have it considered during the 110th Congress. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to codify Executive Order 12898, relating to \nenvironmental justice, to require the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to fully implement the recommendations \nof the Inspector General of the Agency and the Comptroller General of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce, with Senators Kerry and \nMenendez, an environmental justice bill that will help protect the \nwell-being of minority and low-income communities throughout the United \nStates.\n  In 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive Order instructing \nGovernment agencies to develop strategies to identify and address \nenvironmental inequities that might be created through agency programs. \nThe Executive Order recognized that low-income and minority communities \noften end up with more than their fair share of pollution, associated \nhealth risks and environmental degradation.\n  More advantaged communities--with strong advocates, more resources, \nand better access to information--are less likely to have landfills, \npetrochemical plants, or waste incinerators built in their \nneighborhoods.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has not \nhonored the 1994 Executive Order and the goal of environmental justice \nhas not been met. In a March 2004 report, the EPA Inspector General \nconcluded that the agency ``has not fully implemented Executive Order \n12898 nor consistently integrated environmental justice into its day-\nto-day operations. EPA has not identified minority and low-income \n[populations] . . . and has neither defined nor developed criteria for \ndetermining [who is] disproportionately impacted. Moreover, in 2001, \nthe Agency restated its commitment to environmental justice in a manner \nthat does not emphasize minority and low-income populations, the intent \nof the Executive Order.''\n  Today, with the introduction of the Environmental Justice Act of \n2007, we ask Congress to codify the Executive Order. The legislation \nalso directs the EPA to implement recommendations in this area from \nboth the EPA Inspector General and the Government Accountability \nOffice. The recommendations include creating offices to review programs \nand policies for environmental justice implications, training staff to \naddress environmental justice concerns in the rule making process and \nspecifically assessing the impacts of future regulation and enforcement \non the communities most at risk to human and environmental health \nproblems. Finally, the bill establishes reporting requirements for the \nimplementation of the recommendations.\n  I am pleased that our legislation currently has the support of 18 \norganizations, including: Earthjustice; Lawyers' Committee for Civil \nRights Under\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nLaw; Center for Health, Environment and Justice; Natural Resources \nDefense Council; Advocates for Environmental Human Rights and Labor \nCouncil for Latin American Advancement.\n  The bill we are introducing today is an important step toward \nshifting the balance of environmental hazards, so the burden is not \nshouldered unfairly by low-income and minority communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CODIFICATION OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President of the United States is \n     authorized and directed to execute, administer and enforce as \n     a matter of Federal law the provisions of Executive Order \n     12898, dated February 11, 1994, (``Federal Actions To Address \n     Environmental Justice In Minority Populations and Low-Income \n     Populations'') with such modifications as are provided in \n     this section.\n       (b) Definition of Environmental Justice.--For purposes of \n     carrying out the provisions of Executive Order 12898, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) The term ``environmental justice'' means the fair \n     treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless \n     of race, color, national origin, educational level, or income \n     with respect to the development, implementation, and \n     enforcement of environmental laws and regulations in order to \n     ensure that--\n       (A) minority and low-income communities have access to \n     public information relating to human health and environmental \n     planning, regulations and enforcement; and\n       (B) no minority or low-income population is forced to \n     shoulder a disproportionate burden of the negative human \n     health and environmental impacts of pollution or other \n     environmental hazard.\n       (2) The term ``fair treatment'' means policies and \n     practices that ensure that no group of people, including \n     racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups bear \n     disproportionately high and adverse human health or \n     environmental effects resulting from Federal agency programs, \n     policies, and activities.\n       (c) Judicial Review and Rights of Action.--The provisions \n     of section 6-609 of Executive Order 12898 shall not apply for \n     purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY ENVIRONMENTAL \n                   PROTECTION AGENCY.\n\n       (a) Inspector General Recommendations.--The Administrator \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, as promptly as \n     practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations \n     of the Inspector General of the agency as set forth in report \n     # 2006-P-00034 entitled ``EPA needs to conduct environmental \n     justice reviews of its programs, policies and activities'':\n       (1) The recommendation that the agency's program and \n     regional offices identify which programs, policies, and \n     activities need environmental justice reviews and require \n     these offices to establish a plan to complete the necessary \n     reviews.\n       (2) The recommendation that the Administrator of the agency \n     ensure that these reviews determine whether the programs, \n     policies, and activities may have a disproportionately high \n     and adverse health or environmental impact on minority and \n     low-income populations.\n       (3) The recommendation that each program and regional \n     office develop specific environmental justice review guidance \n     for conducting environmental justice reviews.\n       (4) The recommendation that the Administrator designate a \n     responsible office to compile results of environmental \n     justice reviews and recommend appropriate actions.\n       (b) GAO Recommendations.--In developing rules under laws \n     administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     Administrator of the Agency shall, as promptly as \n     practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations \n     of the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth \n     in GAO Report numbered GAO-05-289 entitled ``EPA Should \n     Devote More Attention to Environmental Justice when \n     Developing Clean Air Rules'':\n       (1) The recommendation that the Administrator ensure that \n     workgroups involved in developing a rule devote attention to \n     environmental justice while drafting and finalizing the rule.\n       (2) The recommendation that the Administrator enhance the \n     ability of such workgroups to identify potential \n     environmental justice issues through such steps as providing \n     workgroup members with guidance and training to helping them \n     identify potential environmental justice problems and \n     involving environmental justice coordinators in the \n     workgroups when appropriate.\n       (3) The recommendation that the Administrator improve \n     assessments of potential environmental justice impacts in \n     economic reviews by identifying the data and developing the \n     modeling techniques needed to assess such impacts.\n       (4) The recommendation that the Administrator direct \n     appropriate agency officers and employees to respond fully \n     when feasible to public comments on environmental justice, \n     including improving the agency's explanation of the basis for \n     its conclusions, together with supporting data.\n       (c) 2004 Inspector General Report.--The Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency shall, as promptly as \n     practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations \n     of the Inspector General of the agency as set forth in the \n     report entitled ``EPA Needs to Consistently Implement the \n     Intent of the Executive Order on Environmental Justice'' \n     (Report No. 2004-P-00007):\n       (1) The recommendation that the agency clearly define the \n     mission of the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) and \n     provide agency staff with an understanding of the roles and \n     responsibilities of the office.\n       (2) The recommendation that the agency establish (through \n     issuing guidance or a policy statement from the \n     Administrator) specific time frames for the development of \n     definitions, goals, and measurements regarding environmental \n     justice and provide the regions and program offices a \n     standard and consistent definition for a minority and low-\n     income community, with instructions on how the agency will \n     implement and operationalize environmental justice into the \n     agency's daily activities.\n       (3) The recommendation that the agency ensure the \n     comprehensive training program currently under development \n     includes standard and consistent definitions of the key \n     environmental justice concepts (such as ``low-income'', \n     ``minority'', and ``disproportionately impacted'') and \n     instructions for implementation of those concepts.\n       (d) Report.--The Administrator shall submit an initial \n     report to Congress within 6 months after the enactment of \n     this Act regarding the Administrator's strategy for \n     implementing the recommendations referred to in subsections \n     (a), (b), and (c). Thereafter, the Administrator shall \n     provide semi-annual reports to Congress regarding his \n     progress in implementing such recommendations as well as his \n     progress on modifying the Administrator's emergency \n     management procedures to incorporate environmental justice in \n     the agency's Incident Command Structure (in accordance with \n     the December 18, 2006, letter from the Deputy Administrator \n     to the Acting Inspector General of the agency).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 643. A bill to amend section 1922A of title 38, United States \nCode, to increase the amount of supplemental insurance available for \ntotally disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Disabled Veterans \nInsurance Improvement Act of 2007. The legislation would increase the \namount of supplemental life insurance available to totally disabled \nveterans from $20,000 to $40,000. Many totally disabled veterans find \nit difficult to obtain commercial life insurance. These are the \nveterans we are trying to help with this legislation by providing them \nwith a reasonable amount of life insurance coverage.\n  VA's Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance, commonly known as S-DVI, \nwas established during the Korean War to provide life insurance for \nveterans with service-connected disabilities. This $10,000 benefit has \nnever been increased.\n  In comparison, the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and Veterans' \nGroup Life Insurance benefits, which were $10,000 and $20,000 \nrespectively at their inception, have been increased over time to \n$400,000. The most recent increases to these programs have been in \nresponse to public sentiment and the determination by Congress that the \namount provided to the beneficiaries of servicemembers who die while \nfighting in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom is \ninsufficient.\n  In 1992, Congress increased the amount of life insurance available to \nS-DVI policyholders by offering $20,000 worth of supplemental coverage \nto those who are considered totally disabled. Forty percent of the \nveterans enrolled in the S-DVI program are considered totally disabled \nand are eligible for a premium waiver for their basic coverage. In \nfiscal year 2006, thirty-two percent of veterans granted new policy \nwaivers also opted to pay for this supplemental coverage. Even with \n$30,000 in coverage, the amount of life insurance available to disabled \nveterans falls well short of the death benefits available to \nservicemembers and veterans enrolled in the Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance and Veterans' Group Life Insurance programs.\n  The 2001 Congressionally mandated study entitled Program Evaluation \nof Benefits for Survivors of Veterans with\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nService-Connected Disabilities found the lowest area of veteran \nsatisfaction to be the maximum amount of coverage that veterans were \nauthorized to purchase. My bill would allow totally disabled veterans \nto purchase an additional $20,000 in insurance coverage.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Disabled Veterans Insurance \nImprovement Act of 2007. This is a modest and affordable way of \nincreasing the life insurance coverage for those veterans with the \ngreatest need. I realize that there are paygo implications associated \nwith this legislation and I am actively looking for ways to pay for \nthis bill.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been more than 200 years since Lewis \nand Clark first laid eyes on Mount Hood. Today, I propose, with Senator \nSmith, that the spectacular mountain, seen first by our pioneers, \nshould be preserved for all time.\n  The Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2007, which we \nintroduce today, is similar to the bill Senator Smith and I introduced \nin the last Congress. It does include several improvements that came \nabout from comments and constructive suggestions\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nfrom a variety of groups at home in Oregon.\n  The legislation also includes input from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We appreciate their input and believe their views \ncan help speed the bill's passage.\n  In tribute to the great river-dependent journey of Lewis and Clark, \nour legislation adds nine free-flowing stretches of rivers to the \nNational Wild and Scenic River System. This reflects the views of \nOregonians, but, frankly, I hear it from folks in the Midwest, where \nthe Presiding Officer lives, and from people from every nook and cranny \nin this country who have all come to treasure our spectacular mountain.\n  This legislation contains a number of provisions of the original \nMount Hood legislation I introduced in 2004. The bill protects the \nlower elevation forests surrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River \nGorge as Lewis and Clark saw them. These forests embody the natural \nbeauty of our home State. They provide the clean water necessary for \nthe survival of threatened steelhead, Coho, and Chinook salmon. They \nprovide critical habitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, deer, lynx, \nand the majestic bald eagle. These are the forests that provide \nunparalleled recreational opportunities for Oregonians and the scores \nand scores of visitors we get from Minnesota and every other part of \nthe country as well.\n  But the legislation I offer today with Senator Smith differs from the \nbill I introduced several years ago because it responds to the many \ncomments we have heard. We have received thousands of comments on our \nproposed legislation. Some comments came as a result of the general \npublic meetings I held at home in Oregon. Many of the meetings lasted \nover 3 hours. Everybody who wanted to speak was given the opportunity \nto do so. Other comments came from the second Mount Hood summit that \nwas held at Timberline Lodge, hosted by Congressmen Walden and \nBlumenauer. My staff and I met with over 100 community groups and local \ngovernments, the members of the Oregon congressional delegation, the \nGovernor, and the Bush administration. More comments came from calls \nand letters from Oregonians who are saying that now, now, now is the \ntime to preserve Mount Hood.\n  Overwhelmingly, these comments have urged that we build on Oregon's \nwilderness system. This goal is as important today as it was in 1804, \nwhen Lewis and Clark first viewed Mount Hood; in 1964, when the \nWilderness Act was passed; or in 1984, when wilderness protections were \nlast designated on Mount Hood. It is time to plan now to protect this \ntreasure for future generations.\n  The Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most visited national \nforest in our country. In the 22 years that have elapsed since any new \nwilderness has been designated on Mount Hood, the population in the \nlocal counties has increased significantly--25 percent in Multnomah \nCounty, 24 percent in Hood River County, and 28 percent in Clackamas \nCounty.\n  The predominant public use of this urban forest is nonmechanized \nactivities such as hiking, camping, and fishing. With increasing \nemphasis on wild scenery, unspoiled wildlife habitats, free-flowing \nrivers, wilderness, and the need for opportunities for diverse outdoor \nrecreation, sometimes it seems we are in jeopardy of loving our wild \nplaces to death. We all see Americans coming together to make sure the \nmost special places are protected for future generations.\n  A few years ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the \nnumber of people who could hike on the south side of Mount Hood. \nSuffice it to say, the public outcry in opposition was enormous. It \nseems to me, rather than tell people they are going to be restricted \nfrom using our public lands, part of the solution for Mount Hood lies \nin providing more opportunities for them to enjoy the mountain's great \nplaces. We ought to ensure that the Mount Hood National Forest can meet \nthe increased demand for outdoor experiences, and the legislation I \noffer today with Senator Smith provides these opportunities. Hundreds \nof people spoke at the public meetings I held throughout the State. I \nhave received 2,500 written comments urging additional wilderness on \nMount Hood. There are a few key areas the citizens continually come \nback and refer to:\n  First, by astonishing numbers, they want to see additional wilderness \non Mount Hood. A large number of Oregonians didn't think enough \nwilderness had been included, for example, in the legislation that was \nconsidered by the other body.\n  A second area is mountain biking. Some mountain bikers expressed \nconcern that their recreation opportunities not be unfairly curtailed. \nSenator Smith and I had many discussions with them to ensure that would \nnot be the case.\n  Third, fire protection and forest health was something referred to by \nmany Oregonians. Citizens were concerned about the health of the \nforest. Those living in towns on the mountain and the gorge were \nconcerned about fire protection in their communities, and we sought to \naddress those issues as well.\n  An additional concern was developed recreation, with some citizens \nworried about maintaining a role for developed recreation, such as \nskiing, on Mount Hood.\n  In each of these areas, Senator Smith and I tried to follow up and be \nresponsive to what citizens at home were saying.\n  With respect to additional wilderness, there are currently 189,200 \nacres of designated wilderness in the Mount Hood National Forest. This \nbill increases wilderness on Mount Hood by designating approximately \n128,000 acres of new wilderness.\n  The bill adds the areas surrounding the oldest Mount Hood \nwilderness--the mountain itself--which was designated in the original \nWilderness Act of 1964. These additions include cathedral old growth \nforests, special trails, lava beds that were created during the Mount \nHood eruptions, and much of the legendary route that Oregon's pioneers \nused when they came to our great State.\n  To the north and west of the mountain, we add the viewshed of the \nColumbia Gorge to the current Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness. These areas \nencompass the spectacular ridges that frame the gorge that we marvel at \nfrom I-84 and include perhaps the greatest concentration of waterfalls \nin all of North America.\n  To the southwest of the mountain, we add lands to the current Salmon \nHuckleberry Wilderness to conserve their diverse wildlife and protect \nunique recreational areas such as those around the extremely popular \nMirror Lake. These lands include Alder Creek, the source of drinking \nwater for the city of Sandy, and that city unanimously endorsed the \ndraft proposal.\n  Over to the east are proposed additions to the Badger Creek \nWilderness area. These areas provide a critical link between westside \nforests and eastside ecosystems. This area is known for its spectacular \ncolors in the fall and the best deer and elk hunting in our entire \nMount Hood National Forest.\n  Among the areas we are protecting is the newly designated Richard L. \nKohnstamm Memorial area. It is dedicated in honor of Mr. Kohnstamm who \nrestored the historic Timberline Lodge built originally by the Works \nProgress Administration in 1937. Our new 2007 bill adds 2,730 acres of \nMarion County lands in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness Additions, \nwhile removing lands where users identified potential conflicts.\n  Second, in the area of wild and scenic rivers, we protect over 79 \nmiles of wild and scenic rivers on nine free-flowing rivers. This \nprotects some of the most pristine rivers in our State. Among those \nproposed rivers are the picturesque waterfalls and glacial outwash of \nthe East Fork of the Hood River, and the ancestral hunting and fishing \ngrounds of Fish Creek. Over 17 miles of extraordinary salmon and \nsteelhead habitat on the Collowash River have also been added for \nprotection under our legislation.\n  Mountain biking is an area where there has been a lot of debate. We \nbelieved the local riders raised valid concerns, and we took two steps. \nFirst, we proposed the Mount Hood National Recreation Area. This area \nwas so popular in our last bill that Senator Smith and I decided to \ngreatly expand it to include 34,640 acres, an increase of over 16,000 \nadditional acres. It is going to offer permanent environmental \nprotection to those beautiful areas, while\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nproviding mountain bikers, recreational users, and others an \nopportunity to enjoy recreation on the mountain.\n  Additionally, I made boundary adjustments to ensure that all open \nmountain biking trails were not included in this proposed legislation.\n  With respect to fire protection and forest health, we tried to make \nclear that where there are healthy, older trees, they should not be \nharvested on Mount Hood or in the gorge. Older healthy stands are most \nresistant to fire and disease. However, there is an enormous backlog of \novercrowded plantation, second growth that really ought to be thinned. \nThe legislation includes provisions that would give the Forest Service \na mandate to prepare an assessment for promoting forests resilient to \nfire, insects, and disease. This also includes provisions to study and \nencourage the development of biomass in conjunction with forest health \nwork.\n  We happen to think that biomass is one of the most exciting new \nfields for Oregonians to get into. The opportunity to generate clean \nenergy, help small rural communities, create family wage jobs, is \nsomething that we should not miss out on. This legislation tries to tap \nthe potential for progress in the biomass field as well.\n  Finally, we add fire-safe community zones so that the Secretary of \nAgriculture will construct a system of fire-safe buffer zones around \nthe communities of Cascade Locks and Government Camp.\n  With respect to developed recreation, we wanted to facilitate \nrecreational opportunities in this area and thus adopted a provision \nthat came from the other body known as ``fee retention'' that would \nestablish a special account for the Mount Hood National Forest.\n  In addition, in order to help address growth while ensuring access to \nrecreational opportunities, we have adopted provisions originally \ncoming, again, from language from the other body directing the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the State of Oregon to develop an \nintegrated transportation plan for the Mount Hood region.\n  I commend particularly my colleague in the other body, Congressman \nBlumenauer, one of the real pioneers in thinking about transportation.\n  Finally, with respect to key relationships with our tribes and our \nlocal governmental bodies, we have incorporated provisions on local and \ntribal relationships, emphasizing the rich history of the Mount Hood \narea and affirming the rights of Native peoples to access the mountains \nas they have for generations.\n  The protections of these important Oregon places is going to depend \non the hard work and dedication of all Oregonians. I am very pleased--I \nam summing up, and the Senate has been patient in giving me this extra \ntime--to say that this has been a bipartisan effort by the Oregon \ncongressional delegation. Senator Smith joins me in introducing this \nlegislation. We believe this brings together our county commissioners, \nentrepreneurs, environmentalists, Chamber of Commerce, State-elected \nofficials, the Governor. All of those who feel so strongly about \nprotecting Mount Hood rolled up their sleeves, went to work, and joined \nmyself and Senator Smith to try to find common ground to make sure that \nMount Hood would be protected for all time.\n  We are looking forward to perfecting the legislation together in the \ncoming weeks and looking forward to seeing a swift adoption by \nCongress.\n  The grandeur of Mount Hood and our special treasures is pretty much \nin the chromosomes of Oregonians. Protecting our treasures is something \nabout which we feel so strongly. Today is a special day for us because, \nonce again, the citizens of our State have come together and have \nworked with myself and Senator Smith to take action to protect our \ntreasures.\n  Mr. President, Oregon's Mount Hood is a cherished State treasure. \nThis wild place is often photographed, visited and enjoyed by scores of \nOregonians and non-Oregonians. Today, I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague Senator Smith, a bi-partisan Oregon Wilderness bill: the \n``Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2007.'' This bill is \nsimilar to the one Senator Smith and I introduced in the last Congress, \nbut it includes several improvements that resulted from comments \nreceived from stakeholders. The bill also includes input from the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which we hope will help speed \nthe bill's passage. In tribute to the great riverdependent journey of \nLewis and Clark, our legislation adds nine free-flowing stretches of \nrivers to the National Wild and Scenic River System. This reflects the \nOregonian wish to protect but also actively experience our State's \ntreasures.\n  This bill contains many elements of the Mount Hood bill I introduced \nin 2004, while also incorporating many new provisions to protect and \nimprove the Mount Hood region. This bill protects the lower elevation \nforests surrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge as Lewis \nand Clark saw them. These forests embody the natural beauty of Oregon. \nThey provide the clean water necessary for the survival of threatened \nsteelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon. These forests provide critical \nhabitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, deer, lynx and the majestic \nbald eagle. And these are the forests that provide unparalleled \nrecreational opportunities for Oregonians and our visitors.\n  But the bill I introduce today differs from the bill I introduced 2 \nyears ago because it responds to the many comments I heard in the \nensuing years. I received thousands of comments on proposed Mount Hood \nlegislation. Some comments came as a result of the general public \nmeetings I held in Oregon. Many of the meetings lasted over 3 hours, \nand everyone who wanted to speak was given an opportunity to do so. \nOther comments came from the second Mount Hood Summit held at \nTimberline Lodge hosted by Representatives Walden and Blumenauer. I and \nmy staff met with over 100 community groups and local governments, the \nmembers of the Oregon congressional delegation, the Governor, and the \nBush administration. And still more comments came from letters and \nphone calls from Oregonians.\n  Overwhelmingly, these comments urged me to protect and build on \nOregon's Wilderness system. This goal is as important today as it was \nin 1804, when Lewis and Clark first viewed Mount Hood, 1964, when the \nWilderness Act was passed, or 1984, when wilderness protections were \nlast designated on Mount Hood--if not more so. To succeed, we must \nprovide the tools that help us create a planned future on Mount Hood. \nThis bill does both.\n  The Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most visited National \nForest in the United States. In the 22 years that have elapsed since \nany new wilderness has been designated in the Mount Hood area, the \npopulation in local counties has increased significantly--25 percent in \nMultnomah County, 24 percent in Hood River County, and 28 percent in \nClackamas County.\n  The predominant public use of this urban forest is non-mechanized \nactivity like hiking, camping, and fishing. With increasing emphasis on \nwild scenery, unspoiled wildlife habitats, free flowing rivers, \nwilderness and the need for opportunities for diverse outdoor \nrecreation, sometimes it seems we are in jeopardy of ``loving our wild \nplaces to death.''\n  A few years ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the \nnumber of people that could hike the south side of Mount Hood and the \npublic outcry was enormous. Seems to me, rather than tell people that \nthey are going to be restricted from using our public lands, part of \nthe solution for the future of the Mountain lies in providing more \nopportunities for them to enjoy the Mountain's great places. We should \nensure the Mount Hood National Forest can meet the increased use and \ndemand for outdoor experiences--my bill will provide those \nopportunities.\n  Of the hundreds of people who attended the meetings I held throughout \nthe State of Oregon, the vast majority spoke in favor of more \nwilderness. Additionally, I have received more than 2,500 written \ncomments supporting additional wilderness for Mount Hood.\n  This is what I have heard: First and foremost, I heard that \nOregonians in astonishing numbers support protecting Mount Hood and the \nColumbia River Gorge with additional wilderness. A large number of \nOregonians didn't think that enough wilderness areas had been included \nin the House proposal.\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\n  Some mountain bikers expressed concerns that their recreation \nopportunities not be unfairly curtailed.\n  Some people were worried about forest health, and those living in \ntowns on the mountain and in the gorge were concerned about fire \nprotection for their communities.\n  Some people were worried about maintaining a role for developed \nrecreation, like skiing, on Mt. Hood.\n  This is what my bill does to address those concerns: There are \ncurrently l89,200 acres of designated wilderness in the Mount Hood \nNational Forest. This bill increases wilderness on Mount Hood by \ndesignating approximately 128,600 new acres of wilderness.\n  This bill adds the areas surrounding the oldest Mt. Hood Wilderness--\nthe mountain itself--which was designated in the original Wilderness \nAct of 1964. These additions include cathedral old growth forests, the \nhistoric Tilly Jane trail, lava beds that were created during the Mt. \nHood eruptions, and much of the legendary route that Oregon's pioneers \nused when they were settling our great State. To the north and west of \nthe mountain, I would add the viewshed of the Columbia Gorge to the \ncurrent Mark O. Hatfield wilderness. These areas encompass the \nspectacular ridges framing the Gorge that we all marvel at from 1-84 \nand include perhaps the greatest concentration of waterfalls in North \nAmerica. To the southwest of the mountain I add lands to the current \nSalmon Huckleberry Wilderness to conserve their diverse wildlife and \nprotect unique recreational areas like those around popular Mirror \nLake. These lands include Alder Creek, the source of drinking water for \nthe City of Sandy, which unanimously endorsed the draft proposal. Over \nto the east are proposed additions to the Badger Creek Wilderness. \nThese areas provide a critical link between Westside forests and \nEastside ecosystems. This area is known for beautiful fall color and \nthe best deer and elk hunting in the entire Mount Hood National Forest. \nAmong the areas we are protecting is the newly designated Richard L. \nKohnstamm Memorial Area. It is dedicated in honor of Mr. Kohnstamm who \nrestored the historic Timberline Lodge--built originally by the Works \nProgress Administration in 1937--to its former grandeur. Our new 2007 \nbill adds 2730 acres of Marion County lands in the Bull of the Woods \nWilderness Additions, while removing lands where users identified \npotential conflicts.\n\n  My proposal seeks to protect over 79.6 miles of wild and scenic \nrivers on nine free flowing rivers. This includes some of the most \npristine and beautiful rivers in Oregon. Among those proposed rivers \nare the picturesque waterfalls and glacial outwash of the East Fork of \nthe Hood River, and the ancestral hunting and fishing grounds of Fish \nCreek. Over 17 miles of superb salmon and steelhead habitat on the \nCollowash River have also been proposed for protection.\n  I believe that local riders raised some valid concerns, so I did two \nthings. I have proposed Mount Hood National Recreation Area. This area \nwas so popular in our last bill that Senator Smith and I decided to \ngreatly expand it to include 34,640 acres--an increase of over 16,700 \nacres. It will offer greater, permanent environmental protections to \nthose beautiful areas, while providing mountain bikers and other \nrecreational users an opportunity to continue to recreate in these \nareas. Additionally, I made boundary adjustments to ensure all open \nmountain biking trails were not included in my proposed wilderness.\n  I protect wilderness, where there are healthy, older trees that \nshould never be harvested on Mount Hood or in the Gorge. Older, healthy \nstands are the most resistant to fire and disease. However, there is an \nenormous backlog of over-crowded, plantation, second-growth that should \nbe thinned. My bill includes provisions that would give the Forest \nService a mandate to prepare an assessment for promoting forests \nresilient to fire, insects and disease. This also includes provisions \nto study and encourage the development of biomass in conjunction with \nforest health work. In addition, I added fire safe community zones so \nthat the Secretary will construct a system of fire safe buffer zones \naround the communities of Cascade Locks and Government Camp.\n  In order to facilitate developed recreation opportunities, I have \nadopted the House provisions establishing a ``feeretention'' provision \nthat will establish an account for the Mount Hood National Forest. In \naddition, in order to help address growth while ensuring access to \nrecreational opportunities, I have adopted provisions, originally \ncoming from the language passed in the House last Congress, directing \nthe Secretary and the State of Oregon to develop an integrated \ntransportation plan for the Mount Hood region.\n  I have also incorporated provisions on local and tribal relationships \nemphasizing the rich history of the Mount Hood region and affirming the \nrights of Native peoples to access the mountain's resources, as they \nhave for generations.\n  The protection of these important Oregon places will depend on the \nhard work and dedication of all Oregonians and particularly that of my \nOregon colleagues here in the Congress. I am especially pleased that \nSenator Smith has joined me in developing this bipartisan legislation \nand putting forth our proposal for wilderness. I am hopeful everyone \nwill pull together: county Commissioners, environmentalists, \nentrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, State elected officials, the \nGovernor, and the Oregon delegation here in the Capitol. I look forward \nto perfecting legislation together in the coming weeks, and seeing its \nswift adoption by Congress thereafter. Then the grandeur of Mount Hood \nand other Oregon treasures can be assured for future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nevada Test Site Veterans' \n     Compensation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security \n     of the United States throughout the Cold War and since has \n     been unparalleled.\n       (2) In 1950, President Harry S Truman designated what would \n     later be called the Nevada Test Site as the country's nuclear \n     proving grounds and, a month later, the first atmospheric \n     test at the Nevada Test Site was detonated.\n       (3) The United States conducted 100 above-ground and 828 \n     underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 \n     to 1992.\n       (4) Out of the 1,054 nuclear tests conducted in the United \n     States, 928, or 88 percent, were conducted at the Nevada Test \n     Site.\n       (5) The Nevada Test Site has served, and continues to \n     serve, as the premier research, testing, and development site \n     for the nuclear defense capabilities of the United States.\n       (6) The Nevada Test Site and its workers are an essential \n     and irreplaceable part of the Nation's defense capabilities.\n       (7) Individuals working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons \n     programs were employed in facilities owned by the Federal \n     Government and the private sector producing and testing \n     nuclear weapons and engaging in related atomic energy defense \n     activities for the national defense beginning in the 1940s.\n       (8) These Cold War atomic energy veterans helped to build \n     and test the nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent \n     during the Cold War, sacrificing their personal health and \n     well-being in service to the United States.\n       (9) During the Cold War, many of these workers were exposed \n     to radiation, beryllium, and silica, and were placed in \n     harm's way by the Department of Energy and contractors, \n     subcontractors, and vendors of the Department without the \n     workers' knowledge or consent, without adequate radiation \n     monitoring, and without necessary protections from internal \n     or external occupational radiation exposure.\n       (10) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (in this section \n     referred to as ``EEOICPA'') was enacted to ensure fairness \n     and equity for the men and women who, during the past 60 \n     years, performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear \n     weapons\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\n     production and testing programs of the Department of Energy, \n     its predecessor agencies, and its contractors by establishing \n     a program that would provide timely, uniform, and adequate \n     compensation for beryllium- and radiation-related health \n     conditions.\n       (11) Research by the Department of Energy, the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), NIOSH \n     contractors, the President's Advisory Board on Radiation and \n     Worker Health, and congressional committees indicates that at \n     certain nuclear weapons facilities--\n       (A) workers were not adequately monitored for internal or \n     external exposure to ionizing radiation; and\n       (B) records were not maintained, are not reliable, are \n     incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes to \n     which workers were exposed.\n       (12) Due to the inequities posed by the factors described \n     above and the resulting harm to the workers, Congress \n     designated classes of atomic weapons employees at the \n     Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge K-25, \n     Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, Alaska, sites as members \n     of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA.\n       (13) It has become evident that it is not feasible to \n     estimate with sufficient accuracy in a timely manner the \n     radiation dose received by employees at the Department of \n     Energy facility at the Nevada Test Site for many reasons, \n     including the following:\n       (A) The NIOSH Technical Basis Document, the threshold \n     document for radiation dose reconstruction under EEOICPA, has \n     incomplete radionuclide lists.\n       (B) NIOSH has not demonstrated that it can estimate dose \n     from exposure to large, nonrespirable hot particles.\n       (C) There are significant gaps in environmental measurement \n     and exposure data.\n       (D) Resuspension doses have been seriously underestimated.\n       (E) NIOSH has not been able to estimate accurately \n     exposures to bomb assembly workers and radon levels.\n       (F) NIOSH has not demonstrated that it can accurately \n     sample tritiated water vapor.\n       (G) External dose records lack integrity.\n       (H) There are no beta dose data from before 1966.\n       (I) There are no neutron dose data from before 1966 and \n     only partial data after such date.\n       (J) There are no internal dose data from before late 1955 \n     or 1956, and limited data until well into the 1960s.\n       (K) NIOSH has ignored exposure from more than a dozen \n     underground tests that vented, including Blanca, Des Moines, \n     Baneberry, Camphor, Diagonal Line, Riola, Agrini, Midas Myth, \n     Misty Rain, and Mighty Oak.\n       (L) Instead of monitoring individuals, groups were \n     monitored, resulting in unreliable personnel monitoring.\n       (14) Some Nevada Test Site workers, despite having worked \n     with significant amounts of radioactive materials and having \n     known exposures leading to serious health effects, have been \n     denied compensation under EEOICPA as a result of flawed \n     calculations based on records that are incomplete or in \n     error, or based on faulty assumptions and incorrect models.\n       (15) Although basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic \n     leukemia are both radiogenic cancers that employees at the \n     Nevada Test Site may have contracted in the scope of their \n     work, EEOICPA currently will not include individuals with \n     basal cell carcinoma as members of the Special Exposure \n     Cohort, nor does it provide for compensation for employees \n     with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM WORKERS \n                   IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT UNDER ENERGY \n                   EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3621 of the Energy Employees \n     Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 \n     U.S.C. 7384l) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (9), by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) An individual described in paragraph (14)(D).''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (14), by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) The employee was so employed at the Nevada Test Site \n     or other similar sites located in Nevada during the period \n     beginning on January 1, 1950, and ending on December 31, \n     1993, and contracted an occupational illness, basal cell \n     carcinoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and, during such \n     employment--\n       ``(i) was present during an atmospheric or underground \n     nuclear test or performed drillbacks, tunnel re-entry, or \n     clean-up work following such a test (without regard to the \n     duration of employment);\n       ``(ii) was present at an event involving the venting of an \n     underground test or during a planned or unplanned radiation \n     release (without regard to the duration of employment);\n       ``(iii) was present during testing or post-test activities \n     related to nuclear rocket or ramjet engine testing at the \n     Nevada Test Site (without regard to the duration of \n     employment);\n       ``(iv) was assigned to work at Area 51 or other classified \n     program areas of the Nevada Test Site (without regard to the \n     duration of employment); or\n       ``(v) was employed at the Nevada Test Site, and was \n     employed in a job activity that--\n\n       ``(I) was monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation; or\n       ``(II) was comparable to a job that is, was, or should have \n     been monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation at the \n     Nevada Test Site.''.\n\n       (b) Deadline for Claims Adjudication.--Claims for \n     compensation under section 3621(14)(D) of the Energy \n     Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of \n     2000, as added by subsection (a), shall be adjudicated and a \n     final decision issued--\n       (1) in the case of claims pending as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, not later than 30 days after such \n     date; and\n       (2) in the case of claims filed after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, not later than 30 days after the date \n     of such filing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 651. A bill to help promote the national recommendation of \nphysical activity to kids, families, and communities across the United \nStates; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as you may have heard, today we are \nlaunching the Partnership for Play Every Day and it has been \nspearheaded by three terrific organizations: the YMCA, the National \nRecreation and Park Association, and the National Association for Sport \nand Physical Education. Together, they have 350 years of experience in \nhelping our kids to be physically active or, to use the old-fashioned \nword, ``to play.''\n  More than a century ago, these groups came together to support the \nPlayground Movement, which took kids out of factories and coal mines, \nand gave them parks and playgrounds where they could be children again.\n  Well, today we face a different challenge. As we confront an epidemic \nof childhood obesity, as many new elementary schools are built without \nplaygrounds, as recess and PE are phased out of so many of our schools, \nwe need a 21st century Playground Movement. And that's what we are \nlaunching this morning.\n  On a personal note, I have been a lifelong admirer of the YMCA. When \nI was in my early 20s and aspiring to join the Navy as a fighter pilot, \nthey told me: First you've got to learn how to swim. So what did I do? \nI signed up at the Y in downtown Des Moines for swimming lessons.\n  Well, the Y was there for me, just as the Y is there for millions of \nAmerican families, giving them the facilities and tools to stay fit and \nhealthy.\n  You know, there is something fundamentally wrong when kids spend \ntheir free time parked in front of the TV instead of playing in parks.\n  I mentioned the childhood obesity epidemic. ``Epidemic'' is not my \nword. That's what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call \nit. Today, nearly 15 percent of American children and teenagers are \nobese. A quarter of the children between the ages of 5 and 10 already \nshow the early warning signs of heart disease. Cases of adult-onset \ndiabetes in children--which used to be almost unheard of--have exploded \ntenfold in the last two decades.\n  Add it all up, and experts say there is a very real prospect that \ntoday's kids could be the first generation in American history to have \na shorter lifespan than their parent's generation.\n  And that is unacceptable. We are not going to let that happen. And \nthat is why we have set the goal of ensuring that every child in \nAmerica gets 60 minutes of play and physical activity every day.\n  Hand in hand with this important new initiative, today I am honored \nto introduce with Senator Hillary Clinton a bill called the PLAY Every \nDay Act. That first word, PLAY, is an acronym for ``Promoting Lifelong \nActive Communities.''\n  The PLAY Every Day Act will help to promote the national physical-\nactivity standards for both children and adults.\n  To that end, the legislation will do two things:\n  One, it will mandate the development of a well-validated assessment \ntool called the ``community play index,'' to identify barriers \npreventing young people from being physically active in a given \ncommunity.\n  And two, it will help local coalitions to use this ``community play \nindex'' as they craft plans to promote physical activity and wellness \nin their communities.\n  My vision is to have every community in America focused on promoting\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nhealth and preventing disease--instead of just dealing with the bad \nconsequences of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\n  By the way, I am grateful to the good corporate citizens that are \njoining in the Partnership for Play Every Day, including PepsiCo, \nToyota, Kellogg Company, General Mills, PlayCore, and Landscape \nStructures. Your support of this legislation and new initiative is \ngoing to be critical to the Partnership's success.\n  So, again, I salute all the players in this new Partnership. \nTogether, we can build a better, healthier future for America's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 654. A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to protect \nthe public health by preventing food-borne illness, ensuring the safety \nof food, improving research on contaminants leading to food-borne \nillness, and improving security of food from intentional contamination, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, years ago, a friend from Chicago went out \nand bought hamburger meat at a local grocery store. She took it home, \ncooked it, and gave it to her five-year-old boy. That poor boy was \nexposed to E. coli and died a few days later, a gruesome, horrible \ndeath.\n  In 1992, four children died and 700 people were sickened by an E. \ncoli outbreak that was traced to hamburgers served at Jack in the Box \nrestaurants. That outbreak proved to be a pivotal moment in the history \nof the beef industry. The Federal Government revamped the meat \ninspection program which has led a decline in the number of illnesses \nfrom beef since 2000.\n  The E. coli outbreaks from fresh produce that occurred at the end of \n2006 may prove to be the critical events for the produce industry as \nthe Jack in the Box outbreak was for the meat industry. Three people \ndied and nearly 200 were sickened in 26 States due to E. coli that was \ntraced back to packaged spinach.\n  The breadth of the problem of foodborne illness is stunning. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that as many as 76 \nmillion people suffer from food poisoning each year. Of those \nindividuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized and more than \n5,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to \nfoodborne pathogens. Despite these statistics, our food supply is still \nthe safest in the world; however, there are widening gaps in our food \nsafety system due to the fact that food safety oversight has evolved \nover time and is spread across several agencies.\n  As the number of foods imported from outside the United States \ncontinues to increase so do concerns that terrorists could easily \nattack our food supply and distribute a harmful product widely. It is \nmore important now then ever to reinforce any potential weak spots in \nour food safety system.\n  Last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated the \nFederal oversight of food safety as a high-risk area. In order to \nachieve greater effectiveness and accountability, there needs to be a \nbroad-based transformation of our federal food safety oversight. GAO \nconcluded that the fragmented federal system, with 15 agencies \ncollectively administering at least 30 laws, has caused inconsistent \noversight and an inefficient use of resources. An accidental or \ndeliberate contamination of the food supply could undermine consumer \nconfidence and cause severe economic consequences. It is not a surprise \nthat GAO placed food safety oversight on its high-risk list this year. \nGAO has been calling for a single food safety agency for the past 30 \nyears.\n  Here is one example of where our current food safety system doesn't \nmake sense. Take a pre-packaged ham and cheese sandwich that's \navailable at your local convenience store. The way the sandwich is \nregulated depends on how it is presented. USDA has jurisdiction if the \nsandwich is a packaged open-face meat or poultry sandwich that contains \none slice of bread. If the sandwich is a closed-face meat or poultry \nsandwich, meaning it has two slices of bread, FDA inspects it. USDA \ninspects the open-face sandwiches that are sold in interstate commerce \non a daily basis while FDA inspects closed-face sandwiches an average \nof once every five years.\n  Here's another example that illustrates the inefficient use of \nresources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) both inspect shipments of imported food at 18 \nU.S. ports-of-entry; however the two agencies do not share inspection \nresources at these ports. USDA import inspectors are assigned to USDA-\napproved import inspection facilities at these ports and some of the \nports also handle FDA-regulated products. USDA does not have \njurisdiction over the FDA-regulated products. USDA has inspectors \nassigned to these facilities every day while the FDA-regulated products \nmay remain at the facilities for some time awaiting FDA inspection. In \nfiscal year 2003, USDA spent nearly $16 million on imported food \ninspections and FDA spent over $115 million. This is just one example \nof where millions of dollars could have been saved if one agency \noversaw the inspection process.\n  Please join me in sponsoring the Safe Food Act of 2007, which \naddresses our Nation's fractured food safety system. The Safe Food Act \nof 2007 would create a single, independent Federal food safety agency \nto administer all aspects of Federal food safety efforts, including \ninspections, enforcement, standards-setting and research, in order to \nprotect public health. The agencies and sub-agencies now charged with \nprotecting the food supply, primarily housed at the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the Department of Agriculture, would be transferred \nto this new agency.\n  A single food safety agency with authority based on sound scientific \nprinciples would provide this country with the greatest hope of \nreducing foodborne illness, and would also prevent or minimize the harm \nof a bioterrorist attack on our food supply. The Safe Food Act of 2007 \nwould put authority for imported and domestic food in the hands of one \nFood Safety Administrator. The Administrator would oversee one science-\nbased food safety law that would harmonize the various authorities that \ncurrently govern food safety regulation.\n  Our food distribution system has undergone many changes over the \nyears. For example, in the past, it was likely that produce that ended \nup in a local grocery store came from a farm not too far from the \nretailer. Fast forward to today produce grown on a single farm in one \nstate could end up on dinner tables in many states across the country. \nWe cannot continue trying to use a 1950s food safety model to oversee a \n21st Century food distribution system. That's like asking a propeller \nplane to keep up with an F-18. We need to change, to shed the old \nbureaucratic shackles that have tied us to the overlapping and \ninefficient ad hoc food safety system of the past and create a system \nfit for the 21st Century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is \n     vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food \n     supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's \n     economy;\n       (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of \n     public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers \n     and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate \n     commerce;\n       (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an \n     integrated, system-wide approach to preventing food-borne \n     illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and \n     applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient \n     management of the Nation's food safety program;\n       (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of \n     the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--\n       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the \n     ability to detect all forms of contamination;\n       (B) an aging and immune compromised population, with a \n     growing number of people at high-risk for food-borne \n     illnesses, including infants and children;\n       (C) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate \n     monitoring and inspection; and\n       (D) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food \n     processing and food service industries;\n       (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best \n     available science and public health considerations and food \n     safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways \n     that most effectively prevent food-borne illness;\n       (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at \n     least 12 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food \n     safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current \n     conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge \n     about the cause and prevention of food-borne illness;\n       (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated \n     laws preclude an integrated, system-wide approach to \n     preventing food-borne illness, to the effective and efficient \n     operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the \n     most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the \n     report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' \n     that Congress establish by statute a unified and central \n     framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and \n     recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically \n     supportable assessments of risks to public health; and\n       (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the \n     United States to exert food safety leadership \n     internationally, which is detrimental to the public health \n     and the international trade interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food \n     Safety Administration'' to--\n       (A) regulate food safety and labeling to strengthen the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) ensure that food establishments fulfill their \n     responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the \n     public health of all people in the United States;\n       (C) lead an integrated, system-wide approach to food safety \n     and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to \n     prevent food-borne illness;\n       (D) provide a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership, both nationally and internationally; and\n       (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, \n     utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and \n     statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic \n     institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and \n     State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of \n     research on food-borne illness and contaminants;\n       (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food \n     safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, \n     as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are \n     performed by other Federal agencies; and\n       (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety \n     laws to achieve more effective application and efficient \n     management of the laws for the protection and improvement of \n     public health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 82\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2007 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind the battle line by means \n     of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas those units, together with additional units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise \n     the forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n     war against terrorism by carrying out combat operations in \n     Afghanistan, training operations in the Philippines, and \n     other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2007 as the 67th anniversary of the first official \n     jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2007 as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Airborne Day'' with appropriate programs, \n     ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas, at the age of 21, William Wilberforce was elected \n     to the House of Commons of Great Britain;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce and his colleagues actively engaged \n     in many initiatives with the sole purpose of renewing British \n     culture at the turn of the 19th century in order to bring \n     about positive social change;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce advocated prison reform that \n     equally respected justice and human dignity, and encouraged \n     reconciliation;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce sought to improve the conditions \n     for, and minimize the use of, child laborers;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce dedicated his life to ending the \n     British slave trade and the abolition of slavery despite \n     forceful opposition;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce was mentored by former slave trader \n     and author of the hymn ``Amazing Grace,'' John Newton, on the \n     horrors and inhumanity of the slave trade;\n       Whereas approximately 11,000,000 human beings were captured \n     and taken from Africa to the Western Hemisphere to be sold as \n     commodities and forced into slavery and bondage;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce fought for 20 years in the House of \n     Commons to pass legislation banning the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on February 23, 1807, Parliament passed a bill \n     banning the slave trade in the British Empire as a direct \n     result of the efforts of Mr. Wilberforce;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce inspired and encouraged those who \n     opposed slavery in the United States, including political \n     leaders like John Quincy Adams, and spread a message of hope \n     and freedom throughout the United States;\n       Whereas Mr. Wilberforce labored for 46 years to abolish the \n     institution of slavery in the British Empire, ceaselessly \n     defending those without a voice in society;\n       Whereas, in 1833, Mr. Wilberforce was informed on his death \n     bed that the House of Commons had voted to abolish slavery \n     altogether;\n       Whereas section 102(a) of the Victims of Trafficking and \n     Violence Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101(a)) states \n     that human trafficking is ``a contemporary manifestation of \n     slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children'';\n       Whereas the scourge of human slavery continues to pollute \n     our world and assault human dignity and freedom;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the United States Department of State \n     estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 men, women, and \n     children were trafficked across international borders for use \n     as bonded laborers or sex slaves, or for other nefarious \n     purposes;\n       Whereas the International Labour Organization estimates \n     that there are more than 12,000,000 people in forced labor, \n     bonded labor, forced child labor, and sexual servitude around \n     the world, a number that is greater than the number of slaves \n     that existed at the time of Mr. Wilberforce's death;\n       Whereas all people must continue to fight, as Mr. \n     Wilberforce fought, for the true abolition of slavery and for \n     respect for human dignity in all aspects of modern culture; \n     and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should carry on the \n     legacy of William Wilberforce by working to end the modern \n     slave trade, human trafficking, and the degradation of human \n     dignity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes February 23, 2007, as the 200th anniversary of \n     the ban of the slave trade in the British Empire;\n       (2) recognizes the positive impact William Wilberforce had \n     on renewing the culture of his day and ending the inhumane \n     practice of human slavery;\n       (3) commends to the people of the United States the example \n     of William Wilberforce and his commitment to the values of \n     inherent human dignity and freedom, which reside in each and \n     every human being;\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the 200th anniversary of the ban of the slave \n     trade in the British Empire;\n       (B) reflect on William Wilberforce's selfless dedication to \n     the fight against slavery and his commitment to the neediest \n     in society; and\n       (C) commit themselves to recognize the value of human life \n     and human dignity; and\n       (5) unequivocally condemns all forms of human trafficking \n     and slavery, which are an assault on human dignity that \n     William Wilberforce would steadfastly resist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2112-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2112-S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 12--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A \n NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR AND TO CELEBRATE AND HONOR THE RECIPIENTS OF \nTHE MEDAL OF HONOR ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST AWARD OF THAT MEDAL \n                                IN 1863\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Levin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kerry, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Webb, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Warner, \nMr. Ensign, Mr. McCain, Mr. Salazar, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution;

Con. Res. 13\n\n       Whereas article I, section 8 of the United States \n     Constitution grants Congress the power to ``declare war'', to \n     ``lay and collect taxes'', to ``provide for the common \n     defence and general welfare of the United States'', to \n     ``raise and support armies'', to ``provide and maintain a \n     navy'', to ``make rules for the government and regulation of \n     the land and naval forces'', to ``provide for calling forth \n     the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress \n     insurrections and repel invasions'', to ``provide for \n     organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia'', and to \n     ``make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other \n     powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the \n     United States, or in any department or officer thereof'';\n       Whereas the Constitution also grants Congress exclusive \n     power over the purse, stating, ``No money shall be drawn from \n     the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by \n     law . . . .'';\n       Whereas the sole war power granted to the executive branch \n     through the President can be found in article II, section 2, \n     which states, ``The President shall be the Commander in Chief \n     of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia \n     of the several States, when called into the actual Service of \n     the United States . . . .'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush and his Administration \n     have argued that this ``Commander in Chief'' clause grants \n     the President wide latitude to engage United States military \n     forces abroad without prior authorization from Congress;\n       Whereas the President further argues that previous \n     unilateral actions by Presidents of both political parties \n     add credence to this interpretation of the Constitution;\n       Whereas, in reality, nothing in the history of the \n     ``Commander in Chief'' clause suggests that the authors of \n     the provision intended it to grant the executive branch the \n     authority to engage United States forces in military action \n     without any prior authorization from Congress, except to \n     allow the President to repel sudden attacks and immediate \n     threats;\n       Whereas in the Federalist Paper Number 69, while comparing \n     the lesser war-making power of the President of the United \n     States with the war-making power of the King of Great \n     Britain, Alexander Hamilton wrote, ``The President is to be \n     commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States. \n     In this respect his authority would be nominally the same \n     with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much \n     inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the \n     supreme command and direction of the military and naval \n     forces, as first general and admiral of the confederacy; \n     while that of the British king extends to the declaring of \n     war, and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies; \n     all which, by the constitution under consideration, would \n     appertain to the legislature.'';\n       Whereas James Madison declared that it is necessary to \n     adhere to the ``fundamental doctrine of the Constitution that \n     the power to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in \n     the legislature'';\n       Whereas, in 1793, President George Washington, when \n     considering how to protect inhabitants of the frontier of the \n     United States, instructed his Administration that ``no \n     offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until \n     after [Congress] have deliberated upon the subject, and \n     authorized such a measure'';\n       Whereas, in 1801, when Thomas Jefferson sent a small \n     squadron of frigates to the Mediterranean to protect against \n     possible attacks by the Barbary powers, he told Congress that \n     he was ``unauthorized by the Constitution, without the \n     sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense'', and \n     further noted that it was up to Congress to authorize \n     ``measures of offense also'';\n       Whereas, according to the most definitive United States \n     intelligence report, Iran is several years away from \n     developing a nuclear weapon, and even the most pessimistic \n     analysis by outside experts predicts that Iran is at least 3 \n     years away from developing a nuclear weapon, assuming Iran \n     suffers no setbacks during development, which would be \n     unprecedented;\n       Whereas diplomatic efforts involving Iran, the United \n     States, the European Union, Russia, the People's Republic of \n     China, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United \n     Nations Security Council continue; and\n       Whereas, despite these diplomatic efforts and statements by \n     President Bush and other members of his Administration that \n     diplomacy is the preferred route, there are an increasing \n     number of reports that preparations for war are underway: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly affirms that initiating military action \n     against Iran without congressional approval does not fall \n     within the President's ``Commander in Chief'' powers under \n     the Constitution;\n       (2) rejects any suggestion that the Authorization for Use \n     of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), \n     approved in response to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, explicitly or implicitly extends to authorizing \n     military action against Iran, including over its nuclear \n     program;\n       (3) rejects any suggestion that the Authorization for Use \n     of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law \n     107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) explicitly or implicitly \n     extends to authorizing military action against Iran, \n     including over its nuclear program; and\n       (4) strongly and unequivocally affirms that seeking \n     congressional authority prior to taking military action \n     against Iran is not discretionary, but is a legal and \n     constitutional requirement.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue of American presence in the \nMiddle East is of great importance. We are currently engaged in a war \nin Iraq from which, according to poll after poll, a majority of the \nAmerican people believe we should withdraw.\n  In the face of the momentous elections of this past November, in \nwhich the American electorate indicated their dissatisfaction with the \nPresident's policies in Iraq, President Bush has responded with a call \nfor more troops, not less. At this moment, he is escalating the war, \nnot redeploying our brave men and women out of harm's way. He is \nsending these troops into the middle of a civil war.\n  Now there are reports that the President may be considering expanding \nthis tragic war into Iran. The President has no constitutional \nauthority to make war on Iran, nor has he historical precedent. I offer \ntoday a resolution ``expressing the sense of Congress that the \nPresident should not initiate military action against Iran without \nfirst obtaining authorization from Congress.'' It sets forth the \nconstitutional grant of authority to Congress for declaring war and \nfunding any war, which cites Federalist paper number 69 on the \nintention of the drafters of the Constitution, and which cites \nPresidents Washington and Jefferson on the power reserved to Congress \nto authorize war.\n  The resolution strongly and unequivocally affirms that the President \ndoes not have the power to initiate military action against Iran \nwithout first obtaining authorization from Congress, that neither of \nthe existing authorizations to use military force in Iraq gives him \nsuch authority, and that the President must seek congressional \nauthority prior to taking any military action against Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/15/senate-section/article/S2113-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 266.

Mr. President, in January, I joined Senator Salazar in \nintroducing a bill to include Cesar E. Chavez among the names of the \ngreat civil rights leaders we honor in the title of last year's Voting \nRights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, VRARA. We \nreported this bill out of committee last week, and I am pleased the \nSenate was able to take it up and pass it so quickly.\n  I supported taking this action last year during the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's consideration of the VRARA when I offered an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Salazar to add the Hispanic civil rights leader to \nthose for whom the law is named. As Senator Salazar reminded us, Cesar \nChavez is an American hero who sacrificed his life to empower the most \nvulnerable in America. Like Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta \nScott King, for whom the VRARA is named, he believed strongly in the \nright to vote as a cornerstone of American democracy. I offered the \namendment in the Judiciary Committee last year and it was adopted \nwithout dissent.\n  In order not to complicate final passage of the Voting Rights Act, \nthe Senate proceeded to adopt the House-passed bill without amendment. \nThis was done so that the bill could be signed into law without having \nto be reconsidered by the House. At that time, I committed to work with \nSenator Salazar to conform the law to include recognition of the \ncontribution to our civil rights, voting rights and American society by \nCesar Chavez.\n  I have supported adding Cesar Chavez's name to the law as an \nimportant recognition of the broad landscape of political inclusion \nmade possible by the Voting Rights Act. This bill would not alter the \nbill's vital remedies for continuing discrimination in voting but is \noverdue recognition of the importance of the Voting Rights Act to \nHispanic-Americans. Prior to the VRA, Hispanics, like minorities of all \nraces, faced major barriers to participation in the political process, \nthrough the use of such devices as poll taxes, exclusionary primaries, \nintimidation by voting officials, language barriers, and systematic \nvote dilution.\n  We amended the bill in committee to add the names of two more great \nAmerican leaders, Barbara Jordan and William C. Velasquez. \nCongresswoman Jordan was not only a pioneer as the first African \nAmerican woman from a southern State to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives but also a great leader with an impressive career in \npublic service as a Texas state legislator, a Member of Congress, and a \nprofessor at the University of Texas. She received the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom from President Clinton in 1994. Her work on the House \nJudiciary Committee in 1975 was instrumental in renewing the Voting \nRights Act and adding the vital minority language provisions to the \nVRA. Barbara Jordan's life and career, not to mention her powerful \nspeeches, have been an inspiration to so many that I am pleased to \nsupport adding her name to the bill.\n  On behalf of Senator Salazar, I offered an amendment to add the name \nof another Presidential Medal of Freedom honoree from Texas, William C. \nVelasquez. In 1974, Willie Velasquez founded the Southwest Voter \nRegistration and Education Project, the Nation's largest voter \nregistration project aimed at the Hispanic community. Under his \nleadership, the SVREP launched hundreds of successful get-out-the-vote \nand voter registration drives throughout the Southwest, greatly \nexpanding the number of registered Latino voters and increasing \nHispanic participation in the political process. Mr. Velasquez, who was \nalso a leader with the United Farm Workers and helped found the Mexican \nAmerican Youth Organization, MAYO, and la Raza Unida, helped others \nbelieve as he did that ``Su voto es su voz'', your vote is your voice. \nWhen President Clinton posthumously awarded Mr. Velasquez the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom in 1995, he was only the second Latino to \nreceive the Nation's highest civilian honor. We should honor him now by \nadding his name to the title of the VRARA. I offer this additional \namendment on behalf of Senator Salazar.\n  Of course, there are many great leaders we could add to honor their \ngreat contributions to the expansion of voting rights to all Americans. \nWithout leaders like Congressman John Lewis and House Judiciary \nChairman John Conyers, we would not have the Voting Rights Act today. \nWe are indebted to them as we are to so many others for the strides \nthat we have made. Taking up and passing this bill today is a sign of \nour commitment to ensuring that the great promises of the 14th and 15th \namendments are kept for all Americans and that the Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization and Amendments Act is fully implemented to protect the \nrights of all Americans.\n  Mr. REID. I ask consent that the committee-reported amendments be \nconsidered and agreed to, the amendment at the desk be considered and \nagreed to and the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 267) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 267\n\n  (Purpose: To add the name of Dr. Hector P.
