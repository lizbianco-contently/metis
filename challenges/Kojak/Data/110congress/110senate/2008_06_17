Mr. President, my distinguished friend, the Senator from \nthe State of Arizona, is here. As a result, I am going to propound a \nunanimous-consent request so as not to cause him to have to spend any \ntime here he would not ordinarily have to do.\n  The House has passed an unemployment compensation bill. I am going to \nshow the Senate in a little while that we are at 76 filibusters. I am \nnot going to go through another one on unemployment compensation. If we \ndo not agree to pass this bill at this time, there will not be a long \nfloor debate on unemployment compensation. What we will do, it is my \nunderstanding this legislation will be in the supplemental we will get \nfrom the House. That being the case, we will have ample time to talk \nabout the issue if anybody wants to.\n  The distinguished majority whip is going to speak on unemployment \ncompensation, as are some others today. But right now I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. \n780, H.R. 5749, a bill we recently received from the House, the \nEmergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act. I ask that the bill \nbe read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do object. I wonder if I may make one brief \ncomment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to make the point that when we do \nextend unemployment benefits, if we do, the Senate needs to weigh in on \nits ideas about how it ought to be done, for one thing. The House-\npassed bill, which I don't think we want to consider, eliminates the \n20-week work requirement which has been the law now since 1981. So \ntheoretically someone could work a very short period of time and be \nentitled to this 13-week extension, something I don't think we want to \nchange. As a result, we would like the Senate to weigh in and get it \ndone the right way. For that reason, I have to object to bringing the \nHouse bill up at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will be willing now to accept that change \nin the legislation and pass it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might further address the majority \nleader\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nthen, I have several concerns. I highlighted one.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this, I believe, will be in the package \nwe get from the House, and we will be happy to work with the minority \nif they feel some changes should be made. There are a number of people \non my side who would agree to this, and maybe there are other points on \nwhich we can agree.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. I think there are some issues the Senate \nwishes to modify in the proposal. The offer to work together is a fair \none, and that is how we ought to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5670-S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAX EXTENDER LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday was a remarkably good day. When I \ngot out of law school, I went back to Nevada and thought I would be \nthis great golfer. I golfed for 6 months or so, and then realized I was \nbecoming obsessed with the game. Therefore, I decided I shouldn't do \nthis. I had a family, and it took so much time.\n  For a number of years, I have listened to my friends talk about how \nmuch they enjoy golf, and I am sure they do. But it has only been in \nrecent years that the American public has focused on golf, and that is \nbecause of Tiger Woods.\n  I can remember the first time I watched this little boy play. They \nshowed him on the late night shows. Of course, as we all know, it was \ntaped a lot earlier before his bedtime. This little kid, when he was 3 \nyears old, could do remarkable things with his golf club. That is the \nway it was through his entire career, including at Stanford University.\n  Over the weekend, we all watched with attention while Rocco Mediate \nwas going stroke for stroke with the great Tiger Woods. They tied in \nregulation play. They played an extra 18 holes. It was a tie. Finally, \nyesterday, it was concluded. All of us had mixed emotions as for whom \nwe were pulling. Everyone likes Tiger Woods because he is so good and \nso nice, but we all also rooted for this underdog.\n  The one thing we noted yesterday is this golf tournament took place \nin San Diego. The sun was shining, and it was a beautiful day for golf. \nThat is what the commentators kept saying. We were literally stuck in \nthe rain yesterday. Those of us who were here last night about 4 \no'clock saw a violent storm. There was lightning, thunder, driving \nrain, and lots of wind. As a result, I spoke with Senator McConnell, \nand we thought it was best to delay the vote. We had people calling \nsaying: I am stuck in Richmond. One Senator was supposed to go to \nDulles. She had to land in Richmond. Another Senator was stuck in \nBuffalo. We had people stuck all over the country. So we did this, and \nit was the right thing to do.\n\n  We intended to vote on the motion to proceed to the Renewable Energy \nand Job Creation Act, known as the tax extender bill. Some on the other \nside, I am sure, may have welcomed yesterday's delay, but we are where \nwe would have been last night. We need to return to a vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the tax extender bill today, and we will do that, \nas has been indicated.\n  The cornerstone of this legislation is an extension of incentives for \nbusinesses to invest in clean, renewable energy. Right now, we reward \nthese innovators who are blazing the trail to a greater, cleaner, more \naffordable energy future, but we don't reward them very much. These \npeople are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. The potential is out \nthere. If we can pass this legislation, it would mean so much to the \nAmerican economy and the world ecology, the world environment.\n  This is not just the Democrats talking. Somebody I have gotten to \nknow over the years is a man by the name of T. Boone Pickens. As I \nunderstand, he is from the State of Texas. He has proven one thing: He \nknows how to make money. He has proven he is willing to take chances, \nand most always his chances turn out good at the bank for him.\n  What T. Boone Pickens has now decided to do is make money on \nrenewable energy. He has done so much in the State of Texas alone. He, \namong others, thinks we should pass the legislation that is so \nimportant to give these tax credits to the American entrepreneurs so \nthey will create jobs.\n  Here is a chart: Republican filibusters and counting, 76. For a long \ntime, we had to keep creating new charts because they kept \nfilibustering so much and it got to be a burden. So what we have done \nis we put Velcro on this chart. We can peel these babies off. Because \nthe Republicans are so often filibustering, we now have a Velcro chart. \nWe hope we don't have to change this too much more, the ``7,'' or \nchange the ``6.'' Of course, we changed that a couple times last week. \nThe Republicans are filibustering what T. Boone Pickens and others \nwant.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs out there \nwe could create if we have this tax incentive. They are doing it other \nplaces. In Australia, they are in the process of constructing a solar \nenergy plant. That one plant will be 10,000 megawatts. They can do that \nall over Australia. It is an Australian company that is heavily \ninvolved now in California and other parts of the West.\n  These tax credit extensions will continue to encourage the renewable \nenergy industry in States all over the West, States that have wind and \nSun, and some States, such as California or Nevada, have a lot of \ngeothermal. If the Senate does not act to extend these tax incentives, \nthis research and entrepreneurship will literally be in jeopardy. \nThousands of Americans will lose jobs. They are already in the process \nof losing jobs because the tax credits are about to expire.\n  We need an opportunity to move away from $140 barrel oil imported \nfrom unstable regions and unfriendly governments. There is no problem \nfacing America that American ingenuity cannot handle. Failing to pass \nthis tax incentive legislation will mean stacking the deck against \ninnovation.\n  The minority is saying we shouldn't pay for these extensions, we \nshould run up the red ink. During the last 7\\1/2\\ years, we have had \nthe master at running up the red ink in the White House. We have now \nalmost a $10 trillion deficit. We are saying we should pay for this \nlegislation. The House has already done that.\n  The setoffs are very simple. One tax that does not kick in we have \nextended on a number of occasions in the past. The Republicans did \nthis. We want to do it again. We also believe these offshore \nshenanigans that are taking place in America where they put these phony \ncompanies offshore to get tax breaks should come to an end. And that is \nwhat we have done. Most of it would be directed toward billionaires. \nThese hedge funders have recognized they had a good deal going, and \nthey have indicated, with rare exception, that they think it is a good \nidea. So it is not as if we are trying to ramrod some vicious tax \nincrease to the American middle class. In fact, that is not the case.\n  We cannot let this legislation fail, and the Republicans are going to \nlet it fail unless we get cloture on this legislation. Not only does \nthis legislation do good things for renewable energy and job creation, \nbut it also expands the child tax credit for families of 13 million \nchildren; it provides as many as 30 million homeowners with property \ntax relief; it helps 4.5 million families afford the cost of college \nwith the tuition deduction; it allows millions of teachers to deduct \nout-of-pocket classroom expenses; and it levels the playing field by \nproviding tax relief to people living in States with no income tax \nthrough the State and local sales tax deduction. Our economy is losing \njobs, for 6 months now losing jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs. In \nthe 8 years President Clinton was President, almost 23 million jobs \nwere created. In this administration, it is quite to the contrary. The \ndisastrous Bush economic policy is the reason we have these job losses, \na policy that Republican nominee John McCain wants to preserve. We \nthink this is wrong.\n\n  With millions of Americans suffering from job loss, home \nforeclosures, record gas, energy, and grocery prices, there is no \nreason on Earth to oppose the bill before us now. I spoke with someone \nin New Mexico yesterday. He said his home has dropped in value by 50 \npercent. In many places in America, the value of homes has dropped 25 \npercent. This bill would create hundreds of thousands of good jobs here \nat home, lower taxes for American businesses and families and lower \nenergy prices.\n  Yesterday, my friend, the Republican leader, indicated his caucus \nplans to oppose this legislation. Why? It seems,\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nas I have indicated, Republicans object to paying for these crucial tax \ncuts by eliminating an existing tax loophole that unfairly allows \nhedge-fund billionaires to avoid paying taxes. Even the hedge funders \nthemselves realize this loophole is unfair and is destined to be \ncorrected. Yesterday, hundreds of major American corporations sent a \nletter to Congress urging that we pass the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 16, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned companies, representing \n     a broad cross section of the U.S. business community and \n     hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, request that the Senate \n     take action during the current work period to extend tax \n     provisions that expired at the end of 2007 or will expire at \n     the end of 2008.\n       The House of Representatives last month passed a tax \n     extenders package included in H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy \n     and Job Creation Act of 2008, which provides a good starting \n     point for Senate consideration. In April, Senate Finance \n     Committee Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley introduced S. \n     2886 containing a tax extenders package, including a critical \n     increase in the Alternative Simplified Credit to spur R \n     jobs in the United States. Swift action is now needed by the \n     Senate to enact a tax extenders package that will bring \n     significant positive benefits to the U.S. economy.\n       Important tax provisions, including the R tax credit and \n     the deduction for state and local sales taxes, have already \n     expired. Others, including critical renewable energy \n     incentives, the Subpart F active financial services and look-\n     through rules, the New Markets Tax Credit, and the incentive \n     for domestic film production, expire at the end of this year. \n     Large tax increases would fall on American companies and \n     American workers if the expired and expiring provisions are \n     not extended.\n       Failure by Congress to move quickly to extend these \n     important provisions will bring investment in renewable \n     energy and energy efficiency projects to a standstill, make \n     it more difficult for U.S. companies to invest in critical \n     R projects in this country, reduce private sector \n     investment in business and economic development projects in \n     distressed areas, and force many U.S.-based financial \n     institutions to suffer a massive tax increase at a time when \n     they can least afford it.\n       Failure to act this summer on tax extender legislation will \n     have significant negative consequences for the U.S. economy. \n     The value of the legislation to the U.S. economy and the need \n     to act quickly at this critical time should be the dominant \n     considerations.\n       We look forward to working with you on this important \n     legislation and urge action during Congress' June legislative \n     session.\n           Sincerely,\n       A.O.

Mr. President, I think it is glaring to note that of these \nmajor companies--hundreds and hundreds of them that have signed this \nletter--not a single oil company has signed on. Oil companies don't \nwant us to do this legislation. They want us to keep being beholden to \nthem. But look at the companies that signed onto this legislation: \nGenetech, Cummins Inc., The Chubb Corporation, Merck, Merrill Lynch, \nMicrosoft, Owens Corning, Pfizer, U.S. Bank, Wachovia, Verizon, and \nWhirlpool Corporation.\n  Scores and scores of other major companies are telling our Republican \ncolleagues to vote for legislation the way it is written. They know the \nbill and they list the number of it. The letter was signed by the \n``Who's Who'' of the Fortune 500 companies and many others--titans of \nAmerican business. Hundreds of small companies in addition to that all \nagree Congress needs to act now to extend tax incentives for clean \nenergy and innovation to provide the American people with desperately \nneeded tax cuts.\n  We got nine Republicans when we voted on this last Thursday, and I \npublicly commended them. I hope we get more today. The record should be \nvery clear that this, the 76th filibuster of the Republican minority, \nis something that is going to cause the further deterioration of the \nAmerican economy. We want this legislation passed to help Americans \nwean themselves from that which is ruining our country economically and \nenvironmentally.\n  So I hope we have some people who will join Boeing, General Electric, \nCoca Cola, Intel, and other companies I have mentioned and move forward \nwith this legislation. It is vitally important for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5672-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has been more than a week since the \nDemocratic nominee for President, the junior Senator from Illinois, \nresponded to high gas prices by saying it wasn't high gas prices he \nminded but the fact that people didn't have time to get used to them. \nIn his words, he would have preferred a ``gradual adjustment'' to a \nsudden jolt.\n  As I said last week, I can't imagine this is a view many other people \nshare, certainly not the people of Kentucky, who I assure you are not \nat all interested in getting used to $4-a-gallon gas, however gradual \nthe adjustment. Our Democratic colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have had a week to demonstrate they do not embrace the ``gradual \nadjustment'' philosophy of their nominee. We haven't heard a word from \nany of them.\n  Maybe they don't have a problem with $4-a-gallon gasoline either. \nMaybe the junior Senator from North Dakota was speaking for all of them \nwhen he said over the weekend that $4-a-gallon gasoline was finally \nforcing people to conserve. Telling people whose livelihoods depend on \ngetting to and from work that they should get used to high gas prices \nis not an energy policy.\n  Supporting a gradual adjustment to $4-a-gallon gasoline is not an \nenergy policy. Americans need an energy policy befitting America, and \nthat means using the natural resources we have here at home to bring \ndown prices in the short term, while pursuing a long-term strategy for \nenergy independence through clean technologies. We can do both, and we \nshould do both.\n  We need more American energy now. That is the short-term solution to \nthe current crisis. So, again, I call on our friends to consider this \nreasonable two-part solution and to drop their absolutist opposition to \nenergy exploration in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5672-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to begin my remarks this morning by \nquoting the distinguished junior Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, \nwho said recently:\n\n       Our dependence on foreign oil strains family budgets and it \n     zaps our economy. Oil money pays for the bombs that go off \n     from Baghdad to Beirut, and the bombast of dictators from \n     Caracas to Tehran. Our Nation will not be secure unless we \n     take that leverage away, and our planet will not be safe \n     unless we move decisively toward a clean energy future.\n\n  I would like to say to those comments from Senator Obama: Amen. He is \nexactly right. And so I would ask him: Why does he and our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle continue to oppose domestic energy \nproduction that would reduce our dependency on oil from the Middle \nEast?\n  As this chart shows, restricted domestic production in the United \nStates sends billions of dollars to the Middle East, where we purchase \nthat oil, and to countries such as Venezuela in South America. When one \nof my constituents back in Texas goes to the gas station and fills \ntheir pickup truck, and it costs him $75 to $100, he is wondering \nperhaps where the money goes. Our colleagues would suggest it just goes \nto big oil companies. But the fact of the matter is, it is more \ncomplicated than that. I think the picture needs to be painted and the \nstory needs to be told of exactly what our refusal to depend more on \nour own domestic resources, rather than depending, as we do \nincreasingly, on foreign sources of oil, means to our national \nsecurity.\n  While taxes, refining, shipping, and marketing add to the cost of \nretail gasoline, 70 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is \nrelated to the cost of oil--crude oil. When the United States imports \nroughly 60 percent of the oil it consumes, the real profiteers of our \ndependence are the foreign nations from which we import.\n  In 2007, the U.S. fuel bill on oil imports was about $330 billion, \nand some anticipate that figure will go to $400 billion this year. We \nshould be investing more money in America to increase our domestic \nenergy production and creating jobs right here in America as we work to \ndiversify our energy mix and pursue alternative energy sources. \nUnfortunately, we send American dollars to foreign nations and energy \ncartels, such as Venezuela and Iran--nations that openly condemn the \nUnited States and the principles for which we stand and seek to \nundermine our national interests at every turn.\n  Last year, in Venezuela alone, U.S. consumers spent an estimated $30 \nbillion on oil imports. We are all familiar with President Hugo Chavez \nand his thinly veiled threats and outlandish attacks on our country. \nBut the money that is sent to Venezuela does not just empower the \nabsurd talk of one man, it is helping him assemble a substantial \nmilitary arsenal.\n  These pictures show some of the things Hugo Chavez is doing with the \nmoney we are sending him as we buy crude oil: fighter aircraft, \nsubmarines, Kalashnikov assault rifles, air defense\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nbatteries. As a matter of fact, Russia has agreed to actually create a \nfactory in Venezuela for the production of both AK-103 assault rifles, \nand 7.62-millimeter ammunition at a cost in excess of $500 billion.\n  In 2006 alone, Venezuela entered into multiple agreements with Russia \nfor the purchase of numerous advanced Russian-made weapon systems. \nThese transactions included, as I have depicted on this chart, these 24 \nmodern fighter-bomber aircraft at a price of more than $1 billion, \nnumerous attack and transport helicopters at the price of $700 million, \nand an arsenal of these modern Kalashnikov assault rifles, which I \nshowed a moment ago.\n  Last week, Venezuela conducted a preliminarily agreement for its Navy \nto buy three Russian-made, improved Kilo patrol submarines--depicted \nhere. This year, Venezuela accepted delivery of the first of several \nbatteries of Russian-made Tor-M1 air defense systems, depicted on this \nchart.\n  In 2005, Venezuela ordered nine Chinese-made mobile air radar \nsystems, valued at $150 million. Earlier this year, the Venezuelan \nGovernment ordered six Austrian-made, multipurpose surveillance \naircraft.\n  But we should not delude ourselves into thinking that money only goes \nto the buildup of the Venezuelan military. Colombia--of course, right \nnext door to Venezuela in South America--our strongest U.S. ally in \nLatin America, tells us Hugo Chavez has been supporting the FARC, a \nnarcoterrorist organization, and enabling attacks on the people of \nColombia. In fact, a laptop recently captured from a terrorist leader \ndemonstrates Hugo Chavez's close ties with the FARC.\n  The situation has prompted some in Congress to call for Venezuela to \nbe put on our designated ``state sponsors of terrorism'' list. Clearly, \nthe actions of Hugo Chavez and his accelerated militarization of \nVenezuela poses a significant threat to the stability of Latin America \nand to the United States because of its close proximity to our country.\n  It doesn't just stop there. As we know, President Mahmud Ahmadinejad \nin Iran is enjoying all the money America is sending to him and other \ncountries when they purchase oil, with a price tag now of $135 a \nbarrel. We can't afford to forget that oil is a global commodity used \nby every country throughout the world, so money spent on oil imports \nfrom the Middle East or anywhere benefits Iran. Iran is continuing its \neffort to develop nuclear technology, depicted at these compounds in \nBushehr and Natanz, depicted on these maps.\n  It is clear that Iran has nuclear ambitions to build nuclear weapons \nto dominate the Middle East and, frankly, represents a threat to world \npeace. So money spent on oil imports from the Middle East or anywhere \nactually benefits Iran, and they use that money to pursue their nuclear \nambitions.\n  Iran is continuing its efforts to develop nuclear technology with the \nobvious goal of producing nuclear weapons. The last thing we need to do \nis to provide a steady stream of money to a man who openly pledges to \n``wipe Israel off the map'' and promises that the United States, along \nwith Israel, ``will soon be destroyed.''\n  Aside from Iran's very troubling nuclear ambitions, U.S. military \ncommanders have seen very clear evidence of Iranian involvement of \nIraq. We have heard from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker about \nIran's attempts to destabilize Iraq. What is worse, we have heard \nreports of the Iranians training militias and ``special groups'' in \nIraq, both of whom have been a major source of violence and instability \nthere.\n  Even more concerning, we have seen reports that Iran has been \nproviding advanced improvised explosive devices called explosively \nformed penetrators that have been and continue to be used to kill and \ninjure American soldiers in Iraq. As I have said, Iran has been linked \nto explosively formed penetrators used to kill American troops, and \nwhile these penetrators make up only a small percentage of the overall \nnumber of IEDs in Iraq, they generate a disproportionate share of \nAmerican casualties.\n  The short side of this story is that our dependence on foreign oil is \nbankrolling deadly weapons. The money we continue to send to the Middle \nEast and to Venezuela does nothing but enrich or enemies. Why in the \nworld, then, would we deny ourselves access to the very natural \nresources that would allow us to become less dependent?\n  While Congress may not get it, it is clear that the American people \nget it. Rasmussen has just come out of the field with a new poll that \nsays that 67 percent of the respondents support offshore drilling in \nAmerica and 64 percent expect that it will lower gasoline prices. That \nis two-thirds of the respondents who believe offshore drilling should \nbe allowed. Congress, of course, is the major impediment, having passed \nmoratoria against production of oil from the Outer Continental Shelf \nsince the early 1980s. Congress is the problem, and Congress needs to \nget out of the way and allow America to do what it does best, and that \nis to try to achieve less dependence on imported oil from our enemies.\n  The short version of this story is that our dependence on foreign oil \nis bankrolling deadly weapons that are being used against our troops \nand even more advanced weapons systems that could one day be turned on \nus or our allies--countries such as Colombia. Soaring gas prices are \nnot just a problem for the American consumer, they are a problem for \nthe American soldier, sailor, airman, and marine. They are a problem \nfor our national security. The longer we sit idle and do nothing to \nincrease our domestic energy production, the more money we ship \noverseas and the more likely it is to empower the threatening actions \nof some of America's staunchest enemies.\n  While Congress agrees about the importance of reducing our Nation's \ndependence on foreign sources of oil--indeed, that is what Senator \nObama said in the quotation I read at the start--Congress has not yet \nacted in a way consistent with those expressed concerns or in a way \nwhich would improve not only our economic security but our national \nsecurity as well. I appreciate the determination of Congress to pursue \nand encourage alternative energy sources and increased energy \nefficiency--and these energy policies will serve us well into the \nfuture--but what we must realize is that oil and gas is the bridge to \nthat future. It is not economically responsible to bypass solutions \nthat will increase energy supply and help bring down the price of gas \nat the pump. Americans are spending an additional $1,400 on energy \ncosts just this last year, and the Department of Defense--perhaps the \nlargest consumer of oil and gas in the country--spent $12.6 billion on \nfuel just last year.\n  We cannot afford to keep filling the coffers of hostile, oil-rich \nnations such as Iran and Venezuela while we wait for alternative fuels \nto become a substantial and reliable source for our energy needs. We \nneed a comprehensive and balanced energy policy that includes increased \nAmerican energy production. We have raised fuel-efficiency standards, \nwe have implemented a renewable fuels standard, we supported tax \nincentives for wind, solar, biomass, and energy efficiency appliances. \nNow we need to grow our domestic energy production by tapping into \nAmerica's proven oil and gas reserves.\n  If we can begin to produce more energy here at home, then we can \nbegin to ease our minds about how rogue states, such as Venezuela and \nIran, will be using those dollars to threaten us. We have all said on \nnumerous occasions that energy security is national security, but I \nfear many of us have failed to realize exactly what that means. We need \nto recognize that our inaction is not only raising the burden on \nAmerican families, it is growing armies and weapons that may one day be \nused against us. In the case of Iran, that money is already being used \nagainst our troops in Iraq through these explosively formed penetrators \nthat have injured and literally killed American citizens.\n  This is not an issue we can afford to take lightly. We all need to \nwork together to expand American oil production in order to decrease \nthe profits of sworn enemies of the United States and limit their \nmilitarization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I ask how much time is left on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I hope my colleagues had a chance to \nlisten to the distinguished Democratic leader talk about the tax bill \nvote coming up and about Republican filibusters. I wish to tell the \nother side of the story.\n  As there are 76, according to their count, filibusters, presumably \nRepublican, what defines a filibuster around here is when you file a \ncloture motion. If people have a desire to talk a few hours on a bill, \nmaybe even a few minutes on a bill, and immediately a cloture motion is \nslapped in, then that defines a filibuster.\n  That doesn't define a filibuster. If it does, then the Democrats, by \nnot letting the Senate work its will, have in a sense shut off the \npurpose of the Senate, which is, of course, to thoroughly debate what \npassed the other body.\n  Tax bills can only start in the other body, and they go through there \nin 2 or 3 hours. If they are going to be thoroughly debated, they have \nto be debated here. I think it is a little disingenuous to talk about a \nfilibuster on a tax bill when the definition of a filibuster is when a \ncloture motion is filed. It is filed by the majority party, not by the \nminority party.\n  Over the past few years, anyone who has observed the workings of \nCongress has probably discovered that we spend a lot of time every year \nwrestling over what are called tax extenders--probably tax policy that \nfor the most part has been on the books for decades, one or two \ndecades, and then sunsets, and then if you are going to keep that \npolicy in place--in other words, keep the existing tax policy--they \nmust be extended. We call them tax extenders. Popular provisions in the \nInternal Revenue Code, then, are set to expire every year or two unless \nCongress acts. Of course, if Congress doesn't act, then taxes go up.\n  In the past, I have compared this constant repetition to a film \ncalled ``Groundhog Day,'' staring Bill Murray, where Bill Murray's \ncharacter relives the same day over and over again. I have a chart \nshowing a scene from that classic and very enlightening film. It almost \nseems ironic that it would be appropriate on so many occasions for me \nto talk about a movie that itself is about repetition, but the \nrepetitive actions of the Democratic majority and its leadership make \nit too hard to resist bringing Bill and Phil down here again to show \nyou and remind you what this body, the Senate, goes through \nperiodically.\n  Less than a week ago, the Senate, by a vote of 50 to 44, rejected a \nmotion to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to the House bill, H.R. \n6049, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. In just a few moments \nwe are going to repeat that exact same vote. Why? There does not seem \nto be a discernible reason.\n  Getting back to Bill and Phil driving the truck, I bet the thinking \non the other side is that it is the Senate Republicans who are \nrepresented by Bill on this chart, in that the Democrats want people \nlike me to be put through the same actions on the same issues until we \ndo what the other side thinks is the right thing. However, that \nthinking is mistaken. I am not sure how much resemblance there is, but \nBill represents the Democratic leadership. Why? Because the majority \nsets the schedule for the Senate. When Republicans are in the majority, \nwe set the schedule. Despite having slogged through this very same \nissue several times over the past few years, the Democratic leadership \nstill insists on beating the same dead horse--or maybe in this case the \nsame dead groundhog.\n  As anyone familiar with this fine film knows--the film called \n``Groundhog Day''--this chart depicts Bill and Phil driving a truck \nmoments before it goes over the cliff. In a few moments, the Democratic \nleadership is going to drive this Chamber over the same cliff we went \nover last Tuesday. The vote, again, is one I predict will fail, and we \nwill be exactly where we were before.\n  Going back to the ``Groundhog Day'' example, the Democratic \nleadership is stuck in the part of the film where Bill Murray relives \nthe same day because he is doing the wrong things and refuses to change \nbehavior.\n  I would rather not see this body go over the cliff. But what really \nconcerns me is that the Democratic leadership is not alone. In the back \nof his truck are roughly 140 million families and individuals who file \ntax returns. The extenders affect millions of taxpayers. Congress \nshould have learned from the experience we had less than 6 months ago, \nin December. Waiting until the end of the year to solve these problems \ncreates problems instead for agencies like the IRS. It is a problem for \ntaxpayers who are not getting back their refunds soon enough. If the \nDemocratic leadership cares about those millions of taxpayers, they \nwill slow this truck down. They will not drive over the cliff. They \nwill stop the truck, they will work with the Senate--in the bipartisan \nway that is the only way to get things done in the Senate--to finally \nget this bill passed, a bill that will be signed into law.\n  Included in those roughly 140 million families and individuals in the \nback of the truck are around 24 million taxpayers who are now subject \nto the crushing alternative minimum tax. We need to extend the AMT \nexemption for middle-income taxpayers. Right now, around 24 million of \nthose middle-income families are liable for the AMT because Congress \nhas not acted to protect them for the year we are in, 2008.\n  The House bill that is the subject of the upcoming cloture vote does \nnothing to protect those taxpayers, nothing on the AMT.\n  Many of those families who make estimated payments are hopefully \nfamiliar with the form 1040-ES for the second quarter of 2008. That was \ndue yesterday. Many taxpayers who were not subject to the AMT last year \nbut are now caught this year should have filed this form but do not \nknow they are supposed to. It is a tax that these 23 million, or maybe \na part of that 23 million, do not pay because they never had to pay it \nbefore. Under current law those individuals are subject to penalty.\n  I made this point on several occasions last year when a quarterly \nestimated tax return was due. I hope I do not get the same reaction now \nas I did every time I talked about the estimated tax payments last \nyear, because that response was silence.\n  I know many will say that Congress will act, but that is not good \nenough. The American people should no more accept an IOU from Congress \nthan the IRS would accept an IOU from the taxpayer. The right thing to \ndo now is to vote ``no'' on this cloture motion. The sooner we can get \nthe Democratic leadership to stop driving the Bill-and-Phil truck over \nthe cliff, the sooner we can get to work on this extenders bill.\n  That bill, unlike the bill before us now, will pass both Houses of \nCongress and will be signed by the President. This law change will \nprotect additional families from being captured by the AMT. Right now \nthe Democratic leadership is in the driver's seat. You see, we have the \nDemocratic leadership in the driver's seat. As I have said of Bill and \nPhil in the past, I hope eventually they decide to drive responsibly. \nDo not do what Bill and Phil do, go over the cliff all of the time. \nVote ``no'' on the motion to proceed, put the Senate back on a path to \na real AMT fix and also pass the extenders bill so it becomes law.\n  We have been having a lot of discussion over whether these extensions \nof the expiring tax relief provisions might be offset with tax \nincreases. We heard the distinguished Democratic leader say they \nshould, because it might make the deficit go up otherwise.\n  My position is if you extend policy that has been in place for a \ncouple decades continuing existing tax policy, you are not making the \ndeficit bigger. You would only do that if you increased or came up with \nsome new tax policy.\n  I am not going to rehash all the elements of that debate again. The \ndifference between Republicans and Democrats on this point is \nimportant. The Democrats have their view, the Republicans have our \nview. That is the way democracy works. But here is why this is a \ndifferent point of view. It is important because the hurdle to a \nbipartisan bill signed by the President on the AMT patch and extenders \nwill not happen unless we get the differences worked out.\n  There is a group of so-called conservative Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives who are called Blue Dogs. I want to say that I respect \nthe Blue Dogs' call for fiscal discipline. It is critically important \nin this era of deficit spending.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n  Revenues are not the problem. One would think from the Democratic \nleadership that we do not tax people enough so we tax people more. In \nfact, we are on a revenue path that is above the historic average in \nterms of Federal revenue as a share of gross national product.\n  So when the Blue Dogs in the House of Representatives bark about \ndeficit reduction, we on this side will howl with them. We have \nHuckleberry Hound here to illustrate what I am talking about. The Blue \nDogs continue to bite only on the tax side.\n  When it comes to spending cuts, we do not hear much more than a \nwhimper out of the Blue Dogs. They do not want spending cuts, they want \nhigher taxes. We agree with them on fiscal responsibility, but higher \ntaxes do not bring fiscal responsibility. Higher taxes bring an excuse \nfor Congress to spend more money.\n  Spending cuts are the way to get taxes down. In fact, when I hear \nfrom my constituents, they do not think the American people are \nundertaxed, they think the American people or the Congress overspend.\n  On our side, that tax-hike hungry dog won't hunt. We have seen the \nstory of this Huckleberry Hound chart play out in recent legislation. \nOn the additional GI education benefits, the Blue Dogs held out for a \ntax increase to offset the new spending. But when the pressure from \ntheir political leadership got too hot, that objection is now history.\n  We have another popular new spending proposal, extension of \nunemployment benefits. The Blue Dogs said no offset was required \nbecause it is ``temporary spending.''\n  Now we have an AMT fix and we have the extenders bill before us. \nBecause it is current law tax relief, the Blue Dogs are insisting on \ntax increases on other taxpayers. Such inconsistency I do not \nunderstand. As with GI benefit packages, we will meet the Blue Dogs' \nchallenge. We will put our money where our mouth is.\n  The budget resolution, written by the Democratic majority and \nsupported by the Blue Dogs, contains $300 billion in nondiscretionary \nappropriations. This is brand new extra spending not subject to pay-go. \nThe AMT patch in the extender bill is a $110 billion package. After \nbeing challenged by the Blue Dog Democrats to stand up for spending \ncuts, I suggested we take one-fifth of what they are going to increase \nspending by, and it will pay for these new spending programs.\n  I would put them to a challenge of not increasing taxes every time to \nreduce the deficit, but reduce expenditures to be consistent. Instead \nof raising taxes, I said let's look at the new non-defense \ndiscretionary spending built into the budget. We could let that new \nundefined future spending expire by an amount necessary to make that \nAMT patch and extenders bill deficit neutral. Many on the other side \nsay it is harmless to let defined current law tax relief expire. If \nthat is true, then it ought to be easier to let undefined future \nspending expire.\n  After meeting the dollar amount in the spending cut challenge, some \nin the Blue Dog coalition still complained. They said we had to define \nthe spending to be cut. That's a bit curious because the spending is \nfuture non-defense discretionary spending. Over the next 10 years, \nappropriators will spend this new extra money in future appropriations \nlaws. Those bills have not been written yet. So, I don't know how I \nrespond with any more specificity. I've provided the amount and the \nsource of the funds.\n  The last time I checked, a dollar of spending cuts is the same as a \ndollar of forgone revenue. If we apply that basic math to taxes and \nspending, then we will achieve fiscal discipline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5675-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5675-S5677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of \nextending unemployment insurance benefits to workers whose regular \nbenefits ran out before they could get a new job.\n  As we know, the labor market is weak. The unemployment rate has \njumped to 5.5 percent in April from 5 percent in March. That is an \nextraordinary jump. This is the largest single month spike in 22 years \nand the highest level in 3.5 years.\n  In addition, the Labor Department's alternative unemployment rate, a \nmeasure that includes people who want to work but who are discouraged \nfrom actively seeking employment because they cannot find full-time \njobs, reached 9.7 percent in May. This latter statistic might be more \naccurate with what has actually happened in neighborhoods across \nAmerica.\n  For Rhode Islanders, the situation is among the worst in the Nation. \nThe number of unemployed Rhode Islanders has risen to approximately \n35,000, which has been trending upward and is the highest since June \n1994. Indeed, 6.1 percent are jobless right now, a figure which has \nremained unchanged over the past 2 months.\n  This is the fourth highest unemployment rate in the United States, \nand the highest rate in Rhode Island since August 1995, more than 12 \nyears ago. It is also critical to point out that almost half, 41 \npercent of Rhode Islanders unemployed in January, February and March, \nexhausted their benefits, which is more than any other State in New \nEngland. Unfortunately, other economic indicators are equally \ndiscouraging. Economists think inflation is here to stay, and it is \nlikely to get worse. We have received a very poor inflation number this \nmorning which suggests that the forecasts of economists are sadly \nbecoming true.\n  Food prices are high. Consumers are able to afford fewer groceries at \nthe supermarket and restaurants are being squeezed by food costs. Food \nprices across the country spiked by more than 4 percent in 2007, the \nbiggest jump in 17 years, and they are expected to escalate another 6 \npercent this year, though some items, including eggs and milk, have \ngone up much more. So we are not talking about luxury items, we are \ntalking about the basics to survive. They are getting more and more \nexpensive as more and more people are not able to find adequate work.\n  The price of gasoline has risen 35 percent from a year ago, when it \naveraged approximately $3. In Rhode Island, it now costs $4.11, on \naverage, for a gallon of regular unleaded, making it very difficult for \nworking families simply to get to school, to get to their job, and to \nget around the State.\n  The gross domestic product, the Nation's total output of goods and \nservices, the measure of the overall economic activity of the country, \nincreased at a mere .9 percent in the first quarter of 2008, which is \nnearly the same as the fourth quarter of last year. This stagnant \ngrowth obviously is highly correlated with the rising unemployment.\n  In April, consumer credit borrowing rose $8.9 billion for the month \nto $2.56 trillion. This is significantly higher than economists \nforecast. This means increasingly that Americans are going to their \ncredit cards to get by, and this is a timebomb ready to explode in our \neconomy.\n  More American families are being overwhelmed by debt. More and more \nfamilies are forced, because they do not have adequate jobs, adequate \nwages to face the rising cost of gasoline and food, to take out the \nplastic. That can only last a certain amount of time. This is a looming \nproblem that we have to recognize.\n  Similarly, there is speculation that the impact of the foreclosure \ncrisis will continue to spread. In my home State of Rhode Island, we \nhave the highest foreclosure rate in New England. And the outlook is \njust as bleak. A recent Credit Suisse report noted that foreclosures \ncould impact about 6.5 million loans by 2012, meaning that nearly 13 \npercent of residential borrowers could be put out of their homes; 13 \npercent of homeowners in America are facing the prospect within the \nnext few years of losing their homes. That is a startling and \nunacceptable projection.\n  Given that the economic situation is significantly harsher now than \nthe start of the last recession, the need to extend unemployment \nbenefits is clear. In doing so, we can start to stimulate the economy. \nWe have virtually no growth, we have a foreclosure crisis with \nescalating gasoline and food prices. If we want to get this country \nmoving again, we have got to stimulate the economy. We tried with the \nrebates a few months ago; that has not proved effective. Unemployment \ninsurance\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nbenefits have a very high return on their investment. It generates \napproximately $1.64 in gross domestic product for every dollar we put \nin, and that makes sense.\n  Individuals receiving these benefits are going to go right to the \nstore, they are going to fuel their cars, they are going to buy food, \nthey are going to try to take care of their children. This money is \ngoing right back in the economy. It is going to stimulate 64 cents more \nthan we invest.\n  I am disappointed that the administration has released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy stating that it strongly opposes the bipartisan \nmeasure overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives last \nweek.\n  I am disappointed that the minority is unwilling to enact this \nmeaningful legislation before us today. This would make a positive \ndifference for America. I think it is reckless and irresponsible. \nUnfortunately, it is characteristic of this administration that they \nwould oppose unemployment benefits for Americans while they continue to \nexhort us to spend billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \ncontrast could not be more stark and, I think, more condemning of this \nadministration.\n  I believe we have to pass this legislation. We have to face it. And \nfor my constituents in Rhode Island, it would be extremely useful.\n  According to the Center for Budget Policy Priorities, we have done \nthis, we have extended benefits seven times over the past half century. \nThey have provided much needed relief to workers. This is not something \nnovel and unique. This is something we have done and we should do. We \ncannot afford to delay extending these benefits any longer. People are \nstruggling throughout this Nation. It is our responsibility to respond \nto their needs, to give them a chance, to keep them afloat in a very \nstormy economic sea.\n  I urge the immediate passage of these unemployment benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I too rise to support extension in \nunemployment benefits, and express the profound regret I and so many \nothers, not only in this Chamber but throughout America, are having \nthat our minority colleagues blocked the attempt to move this bill \nforward this morning.\n  There are two reasons to do this. One is the individual and the \nhumane, to help the people who need help. Of course, that is first and \nforemost. But the second is to give a real shot in the arm to the \neconomy. There is no better way when an economy is in recession, going \nslow, to give it a shot in the arm than unemployment benefits. They are \nbetter than tax cuts, better than any long-term spending program. The \neconomists have shown that.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to say no to \njust about everything.\n\n  The sad status quo is not very good. Look at the number of jobs this \neconomy has lost this year: 324,000. That is probably 1 million people, \ngiven that so many of them are family members and breadwinners; 1 \nmillion people who had jobs or had loved ones who had jobs last year \nand don't have them today. We refuse to give them the barest of \nlifelines, an extension of unemployment insurance? That is disgraceful.\n  Let me talk about who these people are because each one is an \nindividual. How about Vincent DiRoma, former senior engineer for Kodak? \nNot only does he have a wife and three children, he also supports his \nelderly mother who relies on Social Security to get by. Vincent is \ncurrently training for a new career. We all know Kodak has laid off \nthousands and thousands in the Rochester area, highly qualified people, \npeople with tremendous work ethic who don't want to or can't leave the \nRochester area. Vincent is now training for a new career. He is the \nkind of American we all appreciate. He is not sitting down and cursing \nthe darkness. He is trying to make his situation better. His old job \ndoesn't exist. An extension of his unemployment insurance will allow \nhim time to complete the training and find a new job to support his \nextended family which, including himself, is six people.\n  Why are we telling Vincent DiRoma no? Why are we telling the other \nhundreds of thousands like Vincent no? That is so important. Again, we \njust block it.\n  Economists, liberal and conservative, will tell us, when an economy \nis teetering on the edge of a recession, or, as many of us think, in \nrecession, the best way to get money into that economy is unemployment \nbenefits. The people who get them spend it. A tax cut is often saved. \nThat is not a bad thing, but it doesn't mainline money into the economy \nthe way unemployment benefits do. The money is sent out quickly. There \nis an existing system so we don't have to set up a whole new program.\n  In the past, there have been bipartisan moves to extend unemployment \ninsurance when the economy heads south. Only in this new Congress--this \n``no, no, no'' Congress, where Republicans block everything almost \ninstinctively, atavistically--do we not get this kind of extension.\n  Obviously, there is an attempt to put this in the supplemental bill. \nWe will try to do that, but it should pass like that. There should not \nbe a single opponent to Vincent DiRoma and the other 323,999 people and \nfamilies who have lost their jobs.\n  For the sake of humanity, those who are unemployed such as Vincent \nand need the help, and for the sake of our economy, I urge colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to reconsider. Again, there is no better \nway--none--to get the economy moving than an extension of unemployment \nbenefits. It is something we should move to quickly, without partisan \nwrangling, without ideological preconception. We should just move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, after 7 long years of the Bush \nadministration, our country's economy is in the worst condition it has \nbeen in decades. In my State of Rhode Island this week, a gallon of gas \ncost $4.11. Grocery bills are up. Utility bills are up. Affordable \nhousing is scarce. Many homes are in foreclosure. Health care costs \nremain high. As a blistering hot summer approaches, there seems to be \nno end in sight. These are difficult times for many families. But for \nmillions of Americans who are looking for a job today, the challenges \nseem almost insurmountable. Today, Senate Republicans showed yet again \nthat they are more loyal to the failed economic policies of President \nBush than to Americans who right now need our help. Majority Leader \nReid and Senate Democrats pushed for quick passage of legislation to \nextend unemployment benefits. But Senate Republicans said no, even \nthough last month the national unemployment rate saw its biggest 1-\nmonth increase in over 20 years, reaching a 4-year high of 5.5 percent.\n  In Rhode Island, things were a bit worse. Last month the unemployment \nrate in our ocean State exceeded 6 percent. That is one of the highest \nin the country. These men and women are being forced to deal with both \nthe deep disappointment of losing their jobs and the challenge of \ntrying to make ends meet for their families in an economy that is in \nrecession.\n  One of these people is Brian Perry. Brian lives in East Providence, \nRI. He wrote me earlier this month to ask about the possibility of \nextending unemployment benefits. Brian had been a law clerk at a firm \nin downtown Providence, but he has been unemployed since January 11.\n  Since January 11, he has applied unsuccessfully for more than 65 \njobs. One of those positions had more than 300 applicants. Brian is \nreceiving unemployment insurance, but it is not enough. Because he \ncouldn't afford to pay both his mortgage and his monthly COBRA \npayments, Brian has been without health insurance since the end of \nJanuary.\n  In the United States of America, a working man trying to find a job \nwithout health insurance.\n  He says it has become more and more difficult just to afford \ngroceries, and some nights he goes to bed hungry. He could go to a food \npantry, of course, but he has not yet because he thinks there are too \nmany people who are worse off than he is. Brian's unemployment benefits \nexpire at the end of July.\n  People such as Brian need our help, and they need it now. What are we \nhere for, if not to help our fellow Americans at times such as this? \nThe Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act would help. It \nwould temporarily extend unemployment benefits\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n13 weeks beyond the ordinary 26-week eligibility period. In States such \nas Rhode Island, where people have been hardest hit, jobless workers \nwould receive an additional 13 weeks of unemployment compensation. This \ncritical measure was modeled after a bill introduced in January by \nSenator Ted Kennedy, a true champion of working Americans. It passed \nthe House of Representatives last week with a strong bipartisan vote.\n  As my colleagues know, unemployment insurance is just that--\ninsurance. Millions of Americans go out pounding the pavement each and \nevery day looking for work to support themselves and their families. \nThey find work, they work hard, and they earn their paychecks. As part \nof an employee's compensation, employers pay into the unemployment \ninsurance system so that workers will be covered if they lose their \njobs through no fault of their own. Unemployment benefits help hard-\nworking men and women in this terrible Bush economy cover bills and \nliving expenses while they search for a new job. The Emergency Extended \nUnemployment Compensation Act could help over 3 million Americans pay \nthe mortgage or the rent or feed their families, as they continue to \nnavigate a perilous job market. In Rhode Island alone, there are more \nthan 18,000 people in need of a job, and their benefits either already \nhave or will soon run out.\n  I have heard the argument that people would not be motivated to find \nwork if we extend this benefit; that they need this little spur to get \noff the couch and out into the workforce. In my experience, this is a \nridiculous argument, a demeaning argument, one that is completely \ndisengaged from the day-to-day experience of regular Rhode Islanders, \nfrom ordinary Americans, a true beltway special of an argument. This is \na hard-working country, and it is in tough economic times. Good people \nare hurting. We should gather together around this legislation, support \nthem as they try to get back into the workforce, and pass this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5677-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5677-S5678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to emphasize the importance of \nextending the production tax credits for renewable energy in the tax \npackage we are voting on today at 2:15. These tax credits have helped \ncreate a strong and growing renewable energy industry, not only for \nwind power but also for geothermal, biomass, and landfill gas. Wind \npower, especially in a State such as Montana and across the country, is \ncritically important, but we have a long way to go before renewable \nsources of energy can have the full impact on lowering energy costs and \nfighting climate change. That is why these tax credits are so very \nimportant.\n  Last year the United States installed more than 52 hundred megawatts \nof wind power, enough to power a million and a half households for an \nentire year. Put another way, if the population--every man, woman, and \nchild in Montana and Wyoming--each had their own house, there would be \na million and a half homes.\n  All that wind power was about a $9 billion investment into the \neconomy. Wind now powers over 4.5 million homes in the United States. \nAt this rate, the United States will overtake Germany as the world's \nleader in wind power next year, but only if we extend this tax credit. \nUnfortunately, everything grinds to a halt if the tax credits are not \nextended.\n  Congress has let these tax credits lapse before. Each time we have \nseen growth in the renewable energy industry flatline. This chart shows \nexactly what happens when we refuse to extend the tax credits. Over the \nlast 9 or 10 years, you can see where the high bars are, where wind \nenergy megawatts have gone on. That is with the tax credits. When we \nfailed to extend tax credits, we see virtually no growth in wind \nenergy.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues will be voting to extend these credits \nby year's end, but waiting until the last minute is just as bad as \nletting them expire. Right now wind developers are working out \nfinancing for future projects. They cannot move these projects forward \nwithout certainty. That means projects that are starting right now will \nstall if we don't re-up these tax credits today.\n  We have heard a lot for the last few months about energy costs and \nclimate change. Renewable energy is attractive because it can help us \nget a handle on both problems. Wind is getting more and more affordable \nand more efficient each year, especially as fossil fuel costs go \nup. The wind power capacity added last year accounted for 30 percent of \nall new energy brought online. Because of the wind, we are keeping 28 \nmillion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. That is 28 million tons. \nThere is no more efficient way to help fight climate change than by \nsupporting the tax credits that drive renewable energy. It is just \ncommon sense.\n\n  Last month, the Department of Energy reported that the United States \ncan get 20 percent of its power from wind by the year 2030, but we need \nto quit talking about wind power and get some more turbines off the \nground and into the air. Wind power means real dollars and cents and \nreal jobs and economic development, especially for rural America.\n  The first commercial wind farm in Montana started operating in 2005 \nin Wheatland County. Wheatland County has a population of about 2,000 \npeople and a median household income of about $24,000 a year. In 2007, \nthe wind farm paid over half a million dollars in property taxes to \nState and local governments. That included nearly a quarter of a \nmillion dollars to the local school district. It brought in jobs and \nroyalty revenue for landowners.\n  Wheatland County, as you can tell by the name, is a farming, \nagricultural county. Folks there have spent the last century cursing \nthe wind. Today, the local Chamber of Commerce calls Wheatland County \nthe Wind Energy Capital of the United States. Next weekend, Wheatland \nCounty is putting on its first Festival of the Wind. Their slogan is to \n``honor the wind, celebrate our community, and move forward to a vital \nfuture.''\n  With high gas and food prices, wind power is not just a mirage on the \nhorizon. In fact, we have only skimmed the surface of our potential. To \nput things in perspective, Montana produces about 150 megawatts of \nwind-generated electricity. Montana is almost exactly the same size as \nGermany. Germany has about 22,000 megawatts of wind power. The entire \nUnited States has only 16,000 megawatts. Montana will double its wind \nproduction this year. Next year, we hope to have a new wind energy \ntransmission line between Montana and Alberta, and we will double it \nagain. But we need that production tax credit in place, not only for \nnext year but well into the future.\n  Already this year, things have started to slow as developers \nanxiously watch Congress. One wind farm currently under construction is \nracing the clock to start selling power before year's end. Developers \nare scrambling to take advantage of the production tax credit. Their \nplans for several other wind farms are on hold until the production tax \ncredit is passed here.\n  I cannot overstate the significance of the production tax credit to \nmy State of Montana and throughout rural America for economic \ndevelopment. But our country cannot afford to let it lapse because of \nclimate change and because of high energy costs.\n  High costs might be an underestimate. I just read yesterday that \ncompanies are raising power prices to the tune of 29 percent. That is \n29 percent. That means ordinary folks all across this country are going \nto have to make some very difficult decisions as they sit around their \nkitchen tables. We cannot afford to sit back and just talk about it. It \nis time to get to work, and the work starts today by passing this \nextension, not by waiting until the end of the year.\n  That is why I appreciate the leadership of Senator Baucus on \ncontinuing to bring this measure forward. I believe that passing an \nextension now will send a good signal to business that Congress is \nserious about wind power.\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nCongress can invest in renewable energy that will help control energy \ncosts and fight climate change. I urge my colleagues once again to \nsupport this measure and to vote yes and pass it today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. shall be equally divided and controlled by the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have townhall meetings all around \nLouisiana on a very regular basis. At these meetings we discuss a \nnumber of crucial issues facing all of us. Lately, of course, it has \nbeen dominated by sky-high gasoline prices and the need for a coherent \nenergy policy. But what I hear more than anything else as I reach out \nto my constituents all around the State, the biggest, most important \nsentiment I hear is: When are most folks in Congress going to stop \nplaying political games and actually act? When are most folks in \nWashington going to stop posturing and arguing just toward the next \nelection and take care of the people's business? Unfortunately, I \nbelieve this exercise we have going on on the Senate floor is yet \nanother example of the posturing and of the political gamesmanship that \nfeeds that understandable frustration.\n  We are going to have a vote coming up later today on the Democratic \ntax extenders bill. This is a pure political exercise and a pure waste \nof time. Whether you are for it or against it, whether you like most \nprovisions in it or not, one thing is perfectly clear: This Democratic \npartisan bill is going nowhere. It doesn't have the support in the \nSenate. In addition to that, there is a veto threat--a very crystal-\nclear veto threat--from President Bush. That is for substantive \nreasons. There are significant objections to the bill--I share most of \nthem--with what is included in this package, things such as a huge \nearmark to build a train in New York, a new tax break for trial \nlawyers, expansion of the Davis-Bacon Act, and $55 billion of taxes.\n  The point isn't the substance. Whether you agree with the substance \nor not, the point is this bill is going nowhere, and therefore to call \nit up again and again and to posture and to make speeches is just a \npolitical exercise and a waste of time. It is perfectly clear from the \nvote we took last week that this package doesn't have near the 60 votes \nrequired in the Senate to pass it through the process.\n  If that weren't enough, it is perfectly clear that President Bush \nwill veto the bill. Of course, to override a veto doesn't simply take \n60 votes, it takes two-thirds of the Senate--67. So it is perfectly \nclear that it is going nowhere, and here we are again posturing, making \npolitical speeches and political points on the floor.\n  I have a radical idea. Let's come together in a bipartisan way. Let's \ncome around a consensus bill and actually pass it through the process \nand get it signed by the President. I believe the Grassley bill, which \nhas been introduced in the Senate, is the basis for that sort \nof bipartisan discussion and real work.\n\n  This is particularly important for many of my constituents in \nLouisiana because many of those Louisianans, as well as folks in \nMississippi and elsewhere, have been suffering from a very unfair \nsituation. They are actually paying a tax penalty because of the \nenormous losses they suffered during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. What \nam I talking about? It is this: In 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the \ngulf coast with enormous ferocity. A few weeks later, Hurricane Rita \nstruck southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. Of course, as we all \nknow, many folks suffered enormous and tragic losses. Many folks I know \npersonally lost their entire homes and virtually all of their \nbelongings. Of course, folks in that situation legitimately could take \na big loss on their next tax return. As a result, in 2005, people did \nwhat you would expect them to do: They filed loss deductions on their \ntax returns for that year because of these enormous and tragic losses.\n  Push forward to 2007. The good news is that the American people \nresponded to the enormous tragedy and Congress responded, representing \nthe American people. One of the most important things the American \npeople funded, one of the most important things Congress passed, was \nhelp for these folks I am describing who suffered uninsured losses. In \nLouisiana, it became known as the Road Home Program. In Mississippi, \nthere was a similar program called the Housing Assistance Program--\ngrants, help from the American taxpayers to help cover uninsured \nlosses.\n  So what is the problem? The problem is that under present Federal \nlaw, the IRS says that you have to add that check many of these folks \ngot in 2007 to their income and pay taxes on it because under present \nFederal law that is taxable income. If it was simply a matter of \ncounteracting, equalizing the tax benefit these same individuals gained \nby claiming a huge loss deduction in 2005, that would be fair, but it \nwent far beyond that in many cases. It increased many of these \nindividuals to a higher marginal tax rate. Because of the size of the \nhelp, it pushed them into a whole other tax bracket. It subjected many \ntaxpayers to the AMT, which they would not have been subjected to \notherwise. It phased out certain deductions for them. It even subjected \nsome individuals' Social Security benefits to additional taxation. It \nmade many taxpayers ineligible for Federal student loans. So it didn't \nsimply counteract and equalize the tax benefit some folks got in 2007 \nby claiming a very large loss deduction; it went beyond that in \nthousands upon thousands of cases.\n  So on top of Katrina, on top of Rita, on top of unimaginable--to most \nof us--personal tragedy, what happened is these folks got a tax \npenalty. That is ridiculous. We need to fix that. There is a clear \nsentiment and a clear majority in Congress to fix that. That fix for \nthe Road Home Program in Louisiana and for the Housing Assistance \nProgram in Mississippi is included in this Grassley tax extenders bill, \nwhich can be a bipartisan product, which can garner bipartisan support, \nwhich can gain far more than 60 votes in the Senate, and which can and \nwould be signed into law by the President.\n  This is enormously important for tens of thousands of Louisianans. \nThis is enormously important for many folks in Mississippi. These \naren't simply run-of-the-mill folks; these are by definition folks who \nsuffered through some of the worst losses due to Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. In that context--as they wait year after year simply for a fix so \nthat they aren't penalized by the tax man on top of everything they \nsuffered through because of the hurricanes--in that context, how dare \nanyone play political games. How dare anyone posture and make political \nspeeches rather than simply trying to come together and do the people's \nbusiness. But again, that is what is going on here on the floor.\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\n  We have a tax extenders package which has provisions that many folks, \nincluding myself, have major objections to: A huge earmark to build a \ntrain in New York, a new tax break for trial lawyers, an expansion of \nthe Davis-Bacon Act which would hurt our economy, and $55 billion of \ntax provisions. I cannot support that Baucus package because of those \nclearly objectionable items. More importantly, about half of the Senate \ncan't support it for that reason, and therefore the Senate isn't near \nthe 60 votes required to pass that on in the process. Even if it were, \nas I said before, President Bush has made it crystal-clear that because \nof these controversial provisions, he would veto the bill. So this \npackage is going nowhere. To revote on this package is to waste time \nand play political games. I don't know why the majority leader is \ndetermined to do that, but he is doing that today. He has even talked \nabout doing it a third time.\n  I urge the majority leader and all of my colleagues to act for the \ngood of the American people, to come around a consensus package that \ncan be passed and be signed into law, not to simply try to score \npolitical points, make more speeches, and waste even more time on the \nSenate floor.\n  All of the American people deserve that. But, surely, folks who \nsuffered enormous losses because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita deserve \nthat even more. Surely, those folks deserve the relief contained in \nboth bills, but also the relief that can actually be passed and signed \ninto law in a bipartisan consensus package.\n  Let's do the work of the American people. Let's put people before \npolitics, and let's pass this important legislation by moving on to a \nconsensus bill that can gain far more than 60 votes in the Senate and \nbe signed into law by the President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I would like to \nmake a simple point. He mentioned various provisions he would like to \nsee enacted. I suppose most of them concern his State of Louisiana, as \nthey appropriately should. Let's ask ourselves, what is the \nparliamentary position we are in now? It is very clear.\n  The vote before us, which will be taken soon today, is very simple. \nIt is whether we move to the next step to get on legislation. It is \ncalled a motion to proceed. It is true it is a motion to proceed to a \nHouse-passed bill. If the Senate lets us proceed--including the Senator \nfrom Louisiana--to that bill, then I will offer a substitute and \npresumably we will be on the substitute. I thought it was not only the \nprerogative of the Senate, but it is an opportunity for Senators to \ndebate amendments and for Senators to offer amendments--amendments to \nstrike certain provisions or amendments to add certain provisions. That \nis called legislating. It is debate. Before we can do that, we have to \nget onto the bill. We cannot pass legislation until we can get on the \nbill.\n  So I am asking my good friend from Louisiana if maybe the better \nalternative--nobody is playing politics. We are trying to get ourselves \ninto a procedural situation so we can debate legislation and pass \nlegislation for the good of the country. I ask my good friend from \nLouisiana if he might consider voting for the motion to proceed so that \nwe can get on the legislation and so that other Senators can offer \namendments to improve the legislation and so the Senate can vote.\n  Mr. VITTER. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate his comments. I \nwould be open for that path forward if there was assurance from the \nmajority leader that there would be that full opportunity for \namendments, particularly on the crucial objectionable items that I \noutlined. Unfortunately, to date, there has been absolutely no \nassurance in that regard. In fact, the majority leader, through his \nactions, has taken the opposite course time after time after time, as \nthe Senator knows, by filling up the tree. So if we could take that \npath forward, with the assurance to have votes on amendments regarding \nthose clearly objectionable matters, that might be productive. \nUnfortunately, that hasn't been the assurance the majority leader has \noffered to give, and it hasn't been his practice.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will ask another question. If we vote for the motion to \nproceed, with the assurance and understanding that there would be the \nfull opportunity for amendments, but also, I think, in the spirit of \ncomity and good faith--sometimes amendments are blocked because they \nare not good-faith amendments, such as on abortion and other issues \nthat have nothing to do with the bill. They are political amendments. \nThe Senate has, unfortunately, come to the point where because they \noffer political amendments, with nothing to do with the issue at hand, \nthe majority leader is sometimes forced into that situation in order to \nset up a procedure to minimize the possibility of the occurrence of \nthose political amendments. So it is a two-way street. It is my \nobjective--and I would counsel the majority leader to allow amendments. \nThat is the way the Senate should operate.\n  There has to be a good-faith understanding on the Senator's side of \nthe aisle on good-faith amendments.\n  Mr. VITTER. I only say to the distinguished Senator, if the majority \nleader would come to the floor and guarantee amendments on the \nsubstance of the bill, on the train to New York and the Davis-Bacon \nprovision and down the line in terms of all those highly objectionable \nissues I outlined a minute ago, which go to the substance of the bill, \nI will be all ears. Unfortunately, that has not been his practice on \nprior issues or in this situation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe we are making headway because the substitute \namendment I will offer would not include Davis-Bacon, or may not \nconsider some provisions the Senator is addressing. Again, to go back, \nthere has to be an understanding on the Senator's side of the aisle \nthat the amendments offered would be good-faith amendments and not \nobstructive political amendments.\n  I thank the Senator for the dialog. Maybe we have made a little \nheadway so we can get enough support to proceed to the bill.\n  Mr. President, Samuel Johnson called a second marriage ``the triumph \nof hope over experience.'' Actually, that is where we are today. The \nSenate seeks a similar triumph of hope today because we are here again \nto consider the vote on a motion to proceed to H.R. 6049, the Renewable \nEnergy and Job Creation Act of 2008. This time I hope for a better \nresult. And maybe somewhat, based on the discussion I just had with the \nSenator from Louisiana, we can find a way so that we can proceed to the \nbill and pass these very important provisions.\n  This bill will foster clean, new energy sources. This is a bill to \nextend some very important tax provisions that benefit American \nfamilies and businesses. This is a bill on which I hope to offer an \namendment to stave off certain tax increases under the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Last Tuesday, we tried to do this same thing--move to this bill--but \nwe fell short of 60 votes. Many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle were against moving to the bill. That meant we could not even \nget on the bill; therefore, we could not offer amendments to improve it \nand pass it to help many Americans and individuals in businesses. \nAgain, that meant we could not even discuss the merits of the bill. \nThat meant we could not consider my substitute amendment, which would \nhave addressed several Senate priorities, including a couple on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  This bill contains a robust energy package, with more than $17 \nbillion in incentives for alternative energy, efficiency, and clean \ncoal. This package is important for our environment and our energy \nsecurity, and it is important to facilitate the transition to a carbon-\ncontrolled economy. If we don't get this bill, we cannot do any of \nthat.\n  This bill would extend expiring individual tax provisions, including \nthe teacher expense deduction and the qualified tuition deduction. The \nbill would also extend expiring business tax provisions. These include \nthe R tax credit and the active finance expensing provisions.\n  These business provisions help to keep America competitive in a \nglobal economy. These business provisions help to maintain and create \njobs. If these individual and business provisions are not extended, \nmillions of families and businesses will face tax increases. If we \ndon't pass this bill, many\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nindividuals and businesses will find their taxes going up.\n  The bill is paid for with two revenue raisers that have very broad \nsupport. It is also sound tax policy. The arguments against this bill \nthis week may as well be the same as last week's arguments. Last week, \nwe heard that we should not increase taxes to pay for tax cuts.\n  As I said before, and will say again, these revenue raisers are not \ntax increases. The first revenue-raising provision in the bill is the \ndelay of the effective date of the worldwide allocation of interest. \nThis provision would delay application of the interest rule, which was \nnot supposed to go into effect until next year.\n  Many of the companies that will benefit from this provision told me \nthey would rather have the business extenders than early applications \nof the worldwide application of interest.\n  Why? These companies realize that because of the firm position of the \nHouse of Representatives, we need to offset extending these valuable \ntax benefits. To make that point more clear, this body knows the House \nhas been insisting that offsets be utilized to pay for some of these \ntax reductions that will pass with this bill. That is a political \nreality, something we all face. That is partly why these offsets are in \nthis bill, including delaying application of worldwide allocation of \ninterest.\n  These companies have weighed the costs and benefits, and they have \nmade the choice in favor of the tax extenders in the bill. The second \nrevenue-raising provision addresses offshore deferred compensation. \nThis provision would prevent hedge fund managers from deferring income.\n  This is not an increase in tax on hedge fund managers. Rather, it is \na change in the timing of when income tax will be applied. This is a \ntiming issue, not a tax increase. Therefore, I believe it is sound tax \npolicy.\n  Last week, we heard that we should not need to offset extending \ncurrent tax benefits. This is a curious argument. It is curious because \nthe Senate paid for extending expiring tax provisions in the recent \npast.\n  We paid for extenders in the JOBS Act in 2004, we paid for extenders \nin the Tax Relief Act of 2005, and we paid for extenders in the \nmilitary tax relief bill that Congress just passed and presented to the \nPresident on June 6. We have done that. So this week the Senate is \nfaced with a choice that, in my opinion, is relatively easy. If we can \nget to H.R. 6049, if the Senate will vote to get to the bill, we could \nthen take up my substitute amendment.\n  My substitute amendment contains the provisions that I have talked \nabout, plus a 1-year AMT patch--making sure people don't have to pay \nthe AMT in the next taxable year, and that is without any offsets. So \nby going to the bill and seeing it through, Congress would take care of \na lot of families and a lot of businesses.\n  We need to decide whether we will develop new jobs and new \nmedications. We need to decide whether we will help teachers, families, \nand schools. We need to decide whether we are going to make energy \nindependence a priority, or we can continue to allow hedge fund \nmanagers to defer, without limitation, their compensation for investing \nother people's money.\n  Let's show America we can make the right choice. Let's give American \nfamilies and businesses reason for hope. Let's not give them the same \nexperience they received last Tuesday. Let's proceed to this important \ntax relief bill for many American families and businesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum calls prior to \nthe recess be charged equally to both sides, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have a vote that will occur momentarily. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary be \nauthorized to meet during the session of the Senate in order to conduct \na hearing entitled ``Responding to the Growing Need for Federal \nJudgeships: The Federal Judgeship Act of 2008.'' It is scheduled for \n2:30 this afternoon in the Dirksen Building. The witness list is \nremarkably good. We have the chairman of the Judiciary Resources \nCommittee, Judicial Conference of the United States; the Director of \nHomeland Security and Justice from the United States Government \nAccountability Office, William O. Jenkins. That would be an important \nhearing to go forward. As of now, we have not had consent from the \nminority to go forward with this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object. I will use a few moments of \nleader time to explain why.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we need to get back to first principles \naround here. The Democratic majority scheduled the hearing my good \nfriend references in a way that would violate the standing rules of the \nSenate. Rule 26.5 provides:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the rules, when the \n     Senate is in session, no committee of the Senate or any \n     subcommittee thereof may meet, without special leave, after \n     the conclusion of the first two hours after the meeting of \n     the Senate commenced and in no case after two o'clock . . . \n     unless consent therefor has been obtained from the majority \n     leader and the minority leader . . .\n\n  Typically, as we all know, the minority provides consent for \ncommittees to violate rule 26.5. The minority routinely provides this \nconsent, frankly, in the interest of comity. But comity also requires \nthe majority to treat the minority fairly which means, at a minimum, \nthat the majority needs to keep its commitments to the minority. If \ncommitments in this body are not kept, then comity breaks down. If that \noccurs, the minority will not routinely grant consent to those matters \nthat we usually do. In this case, we have unfulfilled commitments with \nrespect to treating circuit court judges fairly. It is the middle of \nJune. The Senate has only confirmed eight circuit court nominees. This \nis less than half the number the majority leader and I agreed to at the \nbeginning of the Congress. It is barely half the number of circuit \ncourt nominees that a Republican Senate confirmed in President \nClinton's final Congress. More troubling, the chairman has threatened \nto soon stop confirming circuit court nominees altogether here in June.\n  The Republican conference does not consider this lack of progress and \nthinly veiled threat to be, frankly, in good faith. Not surprisingly, \nit is, therefore, not inclined to freely give its consent to matters \nthat are important to the majority. That is the way things work around \nhere. As I have said before, the Senate works best when there is a \nspirit of cooperation. Absent that spirit, the minority will be \ncompelled to protect its rights using all protections afforded it under \nSenate rules.\n  There is an easy solution to the problem. We have been talking about \nit both privately and publicly over the last few months. The majority \nneeds to start confirming circuit court nominees, at least those who \nmeet the chairman's own criteria.\n  And it seems to me that before the committee spends its time creating \nnew vacancies, which is what the hearing today was about, it needs to \nwork\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\non filling the vacancies that already exist. Unfortunately, the \nJudiciary Committee is moving at a glacial pace toward that end. It has \nonly held two circuit court hearings this year. Before that, it hadn't \nheld a single one since last September. We have no indication that it \nis going to pick up the pace. There are several outstanding nominees \nwho have been sitting in committee who meet the chairman's criteria. \nUntil they are treated fairly, the majority will find our cooperation \nincreasingly hard to come by.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand that my distinguished \ncounterpart has a right to do this, an absolute right. I don't question \nthat right. We will just have to schedule the hearing at a different \ntime, if they don't want to have the hearing. I will, though, briefly \ncomment, quoting Majority Leader Lott from years past. When we go home \nto our respective States, there are a lot of issues. Every State has \nthe same issues: housing problems, high gas prices, doing something \nabout global warming. When is the last time anyone went home and \nsomebody said to you: Boy, are you guys going to do something about \nthose judges? As Senator Lott said: The question never comes up.\n  Senator Leahy, chairman of this committee, and I have said before, \nthis Judiciary Committee has wide-ranging jurisdiction over a lot of \nissues, most of which are extremely difficult to deal with. He does a \nremarkably good job. I am very proud that he is the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. But he and I said we would do our utmost by the \nMemorial Day break to confirm three more circuit court judges. I think \nit was three; I don't remember the number. We did our utmost. Senator \nLeahy did his utmost. But it was slow walked by the Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee. So we are at a point now where finally we had two \ncircuit court judges reported out of the committee last week. We are \ngoing to vote on those as soon as we can. We have fulfilled our \ncommitment, so no one needs to talk about commitments not being \nfulfilled.\n  Again, I didn't invent the Thurmond rule. It was invented by long-\ntime Senator Strom Thurmond, at one time chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He said that after June 1, he felt it was appropriate not to \nrush into appointing more Federal judges. We have not said that the \nThurmond rule is in place. But some said we should have it in place. It \nis well after June 1, and Senator Leahy and I are still committed to \ntaking care of more circuit court judges. We are going to do that. I am \nsure there will be opportunities to take a look at some trial court \njudges. But we are doing our very best.\n\n  I admire and appreciate the work of Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair, did the majority \nleader not hear the distinguished Republican leader say they don't want \nto give consent to these hearings that the majority may want? I was \nwondering if the distinguished majority leader was aware of this \ndiscussion on May 15 of this year about this judgeship act. First, I \nquote Senator Sessions, a noted Republican:\n\n       My comments on the judges' bill, as a member and Ranking on \n     the Courts Subcommittee, we did have hearings several years \n     ago but not recently.\n\n  Then we heard from Senator Kyl, the distinguished deputy minority \nleader:\n\n       So what I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, is just recommend \n     that you take our colleagues up on the suggestion that we \n     have a hearing to validate the requirements.\n\n  At which point Senator Coburn, another Republican, said:\n\n       If we're going to fix it, let's fix it right. Let's have a \n     great hearing. Let's bring the GAO in, let's bring the \n     Conference in, and let's find out [how] to do it right.\n\n  And then Senator Grassley, another noted Republican said:\n\n       That is the purpose of a hearing, and that's why it is very \n     important that we give this adequate study. I ask the \n     distinguished leader, was he aware of the fact that this \n     hearing was being held after four senior members of the \n     Republican caucus asked me to have the hearing?\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, in response to his question, yes. And \nthe Senator from Vermont followed the advice of his colleagues and had \nsomeone from the General Accounting Office testify. I appreciate that.\n  I ask that we have the vote now. Members have been waiting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5681-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Cardin, E. Benjamin Nelson, Maria Cantwell, \n           Patty Murray, Bernard Sanders, Daniel K. Akaka, Robert \n           Menendez, Ron Wyden, Debbie Stabenow, Blanche L. \n           Lincoln, Patrick J. Leahy, Richard Durbin, Sheldon \n           Whitehouse.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss my \nvote against cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 6049, the Energy \nand Job Creation Act of 2008.\n  H.R. 6049 would revive important tax provisions that expired at the \nend of 2007 and extend provisions that are set to expire at the end of \n2008. I support extension of the R tax credit, teacher expenses \ndeduction, tuition deduction, accelerated depreciation for leasehold \nand restaurant improvements, the renewable energy tax incentives, and \nmany other important provisions in this package.\n  In addition, the bill includes a provision that I introduced, S. 814, \nwhich would allow attorneys to deduct reimbursable court costs and \nexpenses in the same tax period in which they are paid or incurred. I \nstrongly support this provision and have urged Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley to include it in this bill.\n  While the House bill, H.R. 6049, does not address the alternative \nminimum tax, AMT, it is my understanding that a Baucus substitute \namendment will include a 1-year AMT ``patch,'' without offsets, to \nprevent millions of additional taxpayers from being hit by the AMT as a \nresult of bracket creep. I support the AMT ``patch'' so long as it is \nnot used as an excuse to raise taxes elsewhere by adding offsets. The \nAMT revenues on millions of taxpayers were never intended to be \ncollected.\n  Despite the positive elements of this legislation, there are still \nsignificant issues that must be addressed. The main sticking point \nbetween Democrats and Republicans is whether temporary extensions of \ntax relief should be offset with permanent tax increases elsewhere. \nFollowing that process year-in and year-out means that permanent tax \nincreases must be enacted so that taxpayers can maintain the current \ntax structure. On April 23, 2008, I, along with 40 other Republicans, \nwrote to Finance Chairman Baucus to support ``enacting a 2008 AMT patch \nand extending the various expiring tax provisions without offsetting \ntax increases.'' It would be my preference to see the tax extenders \npackage passed without offsets.\n  As it relates to the renewable energy tax incentives, it is difficult \nto understand why the House bill and the anticipated Baucus substitute \nwould require offsets when the Senate has already spoken clearly on the \nissue. On April 10, 2008, the Senate voted 88 to 8 for an Ensign/\nCantwell amendment to the Foreclosure Prevention Act to extend the \nrenewable energy tax incentives without offsets. Pennsylvania is among \nthe leading producers of wind energy east of the Mississippi River. The \nthousands of Pennsylvanians employed in the alternative energy industry \nand those interested in clean, renewable sources of energy for their \nhomes are looking to Congress to provide clarity and certainty on this \nissue. Without immediate action, it is widely believed that investments \nwill decline significantly throughout the second half of 2008.\n  On June 10, 2008, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 6049 by a vote of 50 to 44. That vote, and the vote \nwhich occurred\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\ntoday 52 to 44, demonstrate that Senate Republicans need to be included \nin the process of drafting the bill. An open amendment process is \nimportant for this bill to proceed. Republican amendments must be \nallowed. However, an open process is threatened by the Majority \nLeader's standard operating procedure of ``filling the tree'' and \nfiling cloture to cut off further amendments and debate.\n  On May 21, 2008, the White House issued a Statement of Administration \nPolicy which states that the President's senior advisers would \nrecommend a Presidential veto of this bill in its current form. It is \nmy hope that in light of today's vote, leadership on both sides will \nwork quickly to bring up this bill in a bipartisan manner that will \nallow the Senate to work its will and pass legislation that can be \nquickly signed by the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation \nAct of 2008, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                 Burma\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, yesterday I came to the floor, along \nwith Senators Harkin, Grassley, and others, to talk about the \ndevastating floods the Midwest has experienced, and no one would know \nmore than the Presiding Officer about the tragedies these types of \nnatural disasters can cause for everyone in those communities and for \nthe infrastructure.\n  But today I am here to talk about something a little different, about \nhow another country, the country of Burma, has dealt with this. I come \nto the floor today to call attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis \nin Burma more than 6 weeks after the deadly storm that wreaked \nwidespread death and destruction throughout that region.\n  When Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta on May 2, the \ninternational community's attention was captivated by the catastrophic \nloss of life and the ensuing dangerous and deplorable conditions faced \nby 2.4 million Burmese who survived the storm.\n  In the days immediately following the storm, the United States, the \nU.N., and other nations and organizations applied strong pressure on \nBurma's ruling Government to allow all international aid workers to \nenter disaster areas and provide medical and humanitarian aid to \nsurvivors. The 16 women Senators who are united in the Congressional \nCaucus for Women's Issues on Burma sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary \nurging him to convince the Burmese Government to allow disaster relief \nassessment teams into the country and lift restrictions on \ninternational humanitarian organizations. When the Burmese Government \nfinally consented and pledged to allow international aid workers to \nenter the country, I believe many of us hoped the full-scale recovery \nprocess had begun and that we could turn our attention elsewhere. \nSadly, this was not the case. The situation in Burma remains perilous, \nand the 2.4 million storm survivors need our attention now more than \never.\n  I recently met with representatives from the local Burmese community \nin my State who have been personally impacted by this deadly natural \ndisaster, the most deadly in their country's history. Minnesota is home \nto thousands of people from Burma, including the largest U.N. \nconcentration of refugees who have been victims of religious and ethnic \npersecution under Burma's military regime. As with so many immigrant \nand refugee communities in our Nation, the members of Minnesota's \nBurmese community maintain extensive ties to their country, and the \nstorm and its aftermath has been a particularly painful period. Too \nmany members of this community are still waiting after 6 weeks to hear \nfrom grandparents and cousins and sisters and brothers. They do not \nknow if they are alive.\n  I met with the leaders of their community in order to listen to the \ninformation and reports they were receiving from friends and relatives \ncaught in the middle of an ongoing disaster. The stories I heard were \nheartbreaking. Over 100,000 people are believed to have lost their \nlives during and after the storm. Tens of thousands are still missing, \nand millions are homeless and without adequate food or fresh water. \nThis disaster was nearly of tsunami proportions; however, it affected \none small country, which time and time again refused our help.\n  The local Burmese with whom I met told me how difficult it is to get \nbasic information and stay in contact with their family members in the \ndisaster areas. One woman told me she still has not been able to locate \nher sisters in Burma. Others expressed their fears that the Burmese \nregime would never admit the need for outside help or allow the aid \nthat entered the country to reach the areas it was needed the most. \nThey feared that unless the international community remained vigilant \nand refused to accept the Burmese Government's conditions and control \nover humanitarian aid, the plight of the people would grow weaker while \nthe regime's grip would grow stronger.\n  Casualties from the Burma cyclone, as I mentioned, are nearly on the \nsame scale as the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. But in that instance, \nthe impacted countries accepted and even\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nasked for international aid. With the military regime in Burma, they \nhave tried to shut the world out. While the outpouring of donations, \nrelief supplies, and aid personnel from around the world has been \nsubstantial, only a fraction of available international aid is reaching \nthe storm's 2.4 million survivors. U.N. officials have reported that \naid groups are unable to provide 1.1 million survivors with sufficient \nfood, clean water, and shelter, while trying to prevent a second wave \nof deaths from malnutrition and disease. Of the 1.3 million people who \nhave received some form of help, the U.N. found they only have had \naccess to inconsistent levels of assistance. Yet the Burmese regime \ncontinues to raise bureaucratic obstructions to the help waiting \nhelplessly offshore.\n  Those international recovery workers who have been allowed to enter \nthe country, and even Burma's own aid donors and relief organizations, \nare facing roadblocks in accessing the disaster regions to provide aid, \nleaving hundreds of thousands of survivors to fend for themselves. We \nhave seen news reports that survivors have been forced to drink from \ndirty canals and to go for days without food. Many are turning to \nBurmese monks for help due to the Government's inaction--the same monks \nwho faced a brutal military crackdown last fall for their peaceful \nprodemocracy demonstrations.\n  According to aid officials, in a normal recovery effort, 6 weeks \nafter a disaster--and you think about 6 weeks after Katrina in your \nhome State of Louisiana, Madam President--survivors should be on the \nroad to recovery and thinking about what they need to do to restart \ntheir lives. In Burma, 6 weeks after the storm, many survivors still \ndidn't know how they were going to find food, water, or shelter on a \ndaily basis.\n  We are now receiving reports that the Government is forcibly closing \naid camps and forcing homeless survivors to return to devastated \nvillages. They are being told to rebuild their homes, but they haven't \nbeen given the assistance to do so.\n  The representatives of the Burmese community I met with in Minnesota \nunderstand that the cyclone, and its aftermath, is more than a natural \ndisaster, it is a political disaster. It is a disaster made far worse, \nfar more deadly, because of the repressive military regime that \ncontrols the country. The Burmese people have been repressed and \nimpoverished by their own Government for years. The regime's lack of \nresponse to the cyclone disaster just highlights how bad the human \nrights situation is. Rather than focusing on ways to help the millions \nof Burmese struggling to survive, the regime instead used the chaos of \nthe storm's aftermath to quietly extend another year the detention of \nAung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's democracy movement, who has \nbeen detained at home on and off for 12 of the last 18 years.\n  What would be an appalling and inexcusable action in any other nation \nfacing similar circumstances comes as little surprise to anyone who has \nbeen following the events in Burma over the last few years. But it \nwasn't always that way. In fact, the current political conditions in \nBurma are ironic and tragic, especially when we consider that this \ncountry produced one of the great statesmen of the modern world--U \nThant. As Secretary General of the United Nations from 1961 to 1971, he \nworked so hard to promote international human rights and to bring peace \nto troubled regions of the world. In an address to the General Assembly \ncommemorating the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, U Thant said that in the age of jet plane and satellites \ncircling the globe, ``the world is fast becoming a community, a \ncommunity with common interests and common aspirations. Gone are the \ndays when each nation was an island unto itself. Today, questions of \nhuman rights are a matter of international concern.''\n  Unfortunately, the Government in Burma wants to stay an island unto \nitself and doesn't think the world should concern itself with the human \nrights of its people. The military regime's neglect and abuse of its \nown people challenges our traditional notions of national sovereignty \nand noninterference. The indifference of Burma's military regime has \ngenerated an international debate about humanitarian aid and the need \nfor stronger international law to deal with cases where national \ngovernments fail or refuse to provide adequate aid.\n  In recent years, the international community has come to recognize \nthat a government has a fundamental responsibility to protect its own \npeople and that we have a responsibility to take action with \nhumanitarian intervention when a government fails in that \nresponsibility.\n  Two weeks ago, U.S. Navy ships loaded with aid supplies and equipment \nwithdrew from Burmese waters after repeated unsuccessful attempts to \ndeliver their vital cargo that could save thousands of lives. U.S. \nofficials have said they will return only when Burma's leaders change \ntheir minds and allow them to offload their supplies in Burma's ports. \nBut we cannot simply turn away from the Burmese people and allow the \nBurmese regime to continue to sacrifice thousands of lives in order to \nprotect its own security. We must use all available means to compel the \nregime to allow full aid supplies and personnel to enter the disaster \nareas and to stay there until survivors are ready and able to begin \nrebuilding their lives.\n  At the end of the meeting with our local Burmese, I pledged to them \nthat I would take their stories to Washington and do what I can to \nbring attention to the plight of the people in their country as we use \nour influence to bring about immediate and long-term constructive \nchange. The rebuilding process in Burma will take years, and it is \nimperative that in the weeks and the months to come, we don't lose our \nfocus or our commitment or our obligation to assist the Burmese people. \nSo I will continue to work with my colleagues to draw attention to this \nsituation and to continue to provide every available opportunity to \ncall attention to it. This is our moral responsibility.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in the last 16 months, I have held some \n100 roundtables across my State where I invited some 65 Ohio counties \nof the 88. I invited a cross section of people, 15 to 20 people from a \ncommunity, to sit down and talk about their hopes, dreams, and ideas \nfor working together, the Federal Government with local government, \nbusinesses, labor organizations, schools, and others.\n  I have met with a number of workers and small business owners, \ncommunity leaders, and teachers. I heard over and over, as the \nPresiding Officer has, about the economic anxiety facing families in \nthe State. I have done these roundtables from Bryan to Steubenville, \nfrom Ashtabula to Hamilton. Nowhere is this anxiety felt more acutely \nthan among displaced workers and Ohio families struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  Fundamentally flawed trade agreements and Bush economic policies have \ncrippled communities in too many cases and devastated far too many \nfamilies. Since January 2001, Ohio State has lost 200,000 manufacturing \njobs. Since that time, the Nation has lost 3 million manufacturing \njobs. When one loses a manufacturing job, especially if it is a plant \nshutdown in a relatively small community--this is not happening only in \nCleveland and Dayton and Youngstown and Toledo; it is happening in \nTiffin, Defiance, Portsmouth, and Chillicothe--if it has 300 workers, \nit means fewer police officers because of what happens to taxes. There \naren't as many people working and businesses and individuals who are \npaying city income tax or county tax. It means teacher layoffs, police, \nand fire layoffs. It means services from the community to support \nfamilies are not what they were prior to the plant closings.\n  Clearly, a big reason is our trade policy, the NAFTA-CAFTA model, \nPNTR\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nwith China, which has caused the outsourcing of millions of jobs. It is \nbad tax policy and Bush economic policy. We obviously need to change \ndirection. That is not going to happen with this President. It is not \ngoing to happen with the filibusters going on in the Senate right now. \nBut what we can do something about immediately is to help those Ohio \nfamilies and Louisiana families with unemployment insurance. It is the \nonly economic lifeline so many families have.\n  Unemployment compensation is insurance. It is called unemployment \ninsurance. It is not a giveaway. It is not welfare. It is individuals \npaying in while they are working to an insurance plan. The reason it is \ncalled insurance is, if they lose their jobs, it is insurance against \nthe loss of the job. They have earned this money. Yet an awful lot of \npeople, most of my friends on the other side of the aisle as well as \nthe gentleman sitting in the White House, seem to think that \nunemployment insurance is a giveaway, a welfare program, something that \npeople want to game the system and don't want to work. They want to \nstay home, watch TV, and collect unemployment insurance.\n  The fact is, we should reward work. People want to work. But hundreds \nof thousands of Ohioans and millions all over the country have seen \ntheir unemployment expire, and they are asking for an additional 13 \nweeks to get them through the day. Many of these are single parents. \nMany people, if they have lost a job, lose their health care, and they \nneed a little bit of help.\n  Extending unemployment benefits is not only the right thing morally \nto do for these families, it is also a good economic stimulus package. \nThe Presiding Officer knows that when we were earlier trying to figure \nout how we could do a stimulus package to get the economy going, the \nsingle best way is unemployment insurance extension, because that puts \nmoney right into pockets immediately. The mechanism of government is \nalready in place so we extend to them their unemployment which had run \nout. We already know how to do it. It is people who will spend the \nmoney on daily living--on food, clothes, books for their kids, paying \nthe rent, paying heating or cooling bills. That is why it is so \nimportant.\n  I have letters I have received in the last few weeks from people in \nOhio, individuals, most of who are unemployed. Sometimes they are \nwriting for a neighbor or family member. Usually they are writing for \nthemselves saying: Please extend unemployment insurance.\n  It is clear that all of us are getting these letters. Members of \nCongress in the House and Senate are receiving tens of thousands of \nletters, so it is crucial. In my State, in the last 7 weeks, we have \nseen a GM plant, 2,500 workers, is going to close near Dayton. We have \nseen DHL, a company in southwest Ohio that delivers packages, talking \nabout literally shutting their operation down. That is 7,000 jobs in \nWilmington, a community of 13,000 people. Imagine what it does to them. \nThere is a company in Geauga County in the northeast part of the State \nthat announced layoffs of hundreds of workers. Continental Airlines is \nlaying off 3,000 workers, not only in Ohio but mostly in its hubs in \nNewark, Houston, and Cleveland. That is why this is so very important.\n  It is not a giveaway. It is unemployment insurance. It will be an \neffective economic stimulus to get the economy going. It is all about \nthousands of Ohioans, hundreds of thousands of people across the \ncountry, thousands of people in my State saying simply: I am trying to \nfind a job. I am working to find a job. I haven't found a job yet, but \nI need an extension of my unemployment benefit.\n  Shawna from Akron wrote to me:\n\n       We are facing losing our house, our car, and much more. I \n     beg you to work for an extension of unemployment benefits.\n\n  Patricia and David Troy, a small community north of Dayton, wrote:\n\n       My husband is one of 334,000 unemployed Ohioans.\n\n  Brent from West Chester, not far from Cincinnati, wrote:\n\n       We need our benefits to be extended or families won't be \n     able to make it.\n\n  Nicole from Huron, a town near Lake Erie in northern Ohio, writes in \nthe most direct terms:\n\n       Please help us.\n\n  This is something we can do. It is not going to solve our economic \nproblems, but it will help an awful lot of families. It will, in part, \nbe a stimulus for the economy. There is no reason we should not do it.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to support the \nextension of unemployment benefits, and I ask the President to change \nhis mind and sign this legislation. It will matter for the country, for \nStates, communities, and especially for families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, over the last 8 years, American \nfamilies have watched as the price of everything from gas to groceries \nhas gone up and up while the value of the dollar has gone down and \ndown. Last month, they got more bad news. Employers cut jobs for the \nfifth straight month, bringing the total number of people looking for \nwork to 8.5 million. It was the worst 1-month jump in unemployment in \n22 years. That means that more of our workers are losing paychecks, \neven as they need money to pay for electricity, fuel, and food. It \ncomes on top of the mortgage and credit crisis in which millions of \nfamilies have watched their primary source of wealth, their homes, \nplummet in value.\n  Americans are looking to us for help, and we have to take action \nimmediately. We have a proposal before us that would offer some relief \nby extending unemployment insurance for an extra 3 months. That would \nhave two benefits. It would ensure that Americans, while they are \nlooking for work, will still be able to put food on the table and fill \nup their gas tanks, and it will give our economy an immediate boost \nbecause that money will be spent quickly. This same measure passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly last week, because Members on both sides of the \naisle realize that we have to move quickly. I am concerned that now \nRepublicans are more interested in blocking our progress on anything \nthan actually taking meaningful action for the American people. Instead \nof working with us, Republicans have filled endless hours on the floor \nwith speeches complaining about problems but not offering any \nsolutions. Instead of focusing on the concerns of working families, \nPresident Bush threatened to veto this bill, and then he left on a tour \nof Europe.\n  The American people are hurting. They have had enough of political \ngames at their expense. I truly hope the President and his Republican \nallies will join us in supporting this very important measure to extend \nunemployment insurance.\n\n\n                        American Aerospace Jobs\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I turn now to another example of how \nthe President's priorities are hurting working families, and that is \nthe administration's decision to send 44,000 American aerospace jobs to \nEurope. Within the next couple days, the Government Accountability \nOffice is going to issue a ruling on a decision regarding a defense \ncontract. It is Boeing's first protest of a defense contract in three \ndecades. Boeing is challenging the Air Force's choice to award a $35 \nbillion contract to supply the military's next generation of aerial \nrefueling tankers to a European company, Airbus. We are all now \nawaiting the GAO's ruling because it was clear there were some major \nflaws in that contract.\n  Ever since the Air Force announced in February that it had awarded \nthe contract to Airbus, the Air Force has insisted there were no \nmistakes and the Airbus tanker cost less. Yet we have already learned \nthat is not true.\n  Last week, the Air Force admitted to making a critical error when it \ncalculated the operating cost of the two tankers. It is now \nacknowledging that the Airbus plane actually cost tens of millions of \ndollars more.\n  That isn't news that surprises us, but it is further evidence that we \nhave to get more answers from the Pentagon before we, Congress, allow \nthis contract to become a reality. That is why\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nI have come to the floor this afternoon. While the GAO decision is \nimportant, it won't even come close to addressing all of the questions \nthat have been raised about this contract. That is because the GAO's \nrole in this process is very limited. It can examine whether the Air \nForce followed the letter of the law in the selection process, but it \ncannot look at anything beyond that. So even if it is obvious to them \nthat the Airbus tanker costs more, that it is less safe, or it doesn't \nmeet the Air Force's needs, the GAO can't take any action. That is our \njob. That is Congress's job. We have to get answers to the questions \nthat have been raised about this deal.\n\n  This is one of the largest contracts in our history, and it is \nincredibly important. Our tankers refuel planes and aircraft from every \nsingle branch of our military. As long as we control that refueling \ntechnology, we control our skies and our security, and that is \nextremely important to our national security. We have to make sure we \nare making the best decision for our taxpayers and for our \nservicemembers. That is Congress's responsibility.\n  I am especially concerned because when you compare Boeing's 767 with \nAirbus's A-330, the 767 is clearly a better plane. Compared to the 767, \nthe Airbus tanker is a lot larger, it is less efficient, and it is more \nexpensive to operate. According to the Air Force itself, the A-330--the \nAirbus tanker--ranked lower than the Boeing 767 in survivability, which \nis our ability to make sure that our warfighters who are flying those \nplanes are safe. The Airbus tanker ranked much lower than the Boeing \nplane in keeping our men and women who are flying them safe.\n  Yet although I have asked the Air Force to explain its decision on \nthis tanker numerous times over the last 3 months, I have been \nstonewalled again and again on answers. No one has explained why the \nAir Force would ask for a medium-sized plane and then go out and choose \na much larger design which is going to cost billions of dollars more in \njust fuel and maintenance.\n  No one has explained why we would buy a plane that is so big that we \nare going to have to rip out and replace hundreds of runways, ramps, \nand hangars around the globe in order to land that plane.\n  No one has explained why we would not buy the safest possible \nairplane for our servicemembers.\n  Perhaps most importantly, no one can explain why we are giving a \nmultibillion-dollar contract to a company that has made no secret of \nits desire to dismantle our U.S. aerospace industry.\n  For years, the foreign governments that own Airbus have flooded it \nwith illegal subsidies in order to compete with Boeing. In fact, the A-\n330 is a result of that subsidized system. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative is so concerned that our Government has accused the EU \nof unfair trade practices before the World Trade Organization. It makes \nabsolutely no sense to me that we would accuse Europe of illegally \nsubsidizing Airbus and then turn around and award it a $35 billion \ncontract of U.S. taxpayer money. It is especially troubling because the \nconsequences to our national security and our economy will be huge.\n  A report by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute shows that \nBoeing would create at least twice as many American jobs as Airbus. In \nother words, we stand to lose as many as 14,000 jobs right here in the \nUnited States by sending this contract to Airbus. With those jobs that \nwe lose, we lose the knowledge and we lose the expertise that helped us \ncreate our global military strength and has made the United States the \nworld leader in aerospace technology. Yet no one has explained why we \nwould let that slip away.\n  Not only am I very troubled that I haven't been able to get answers \nto these questions, but this month the Air Force gave us new reason to \nbe concerned. About 2 weeks ago, the Defense Secretary forced out the \nAir Force Secretary, Michael Wynne, and its Chief of Staff, Michael \nMoseley, after finding systemic problems in the service that led him to \nhave a serious lack of confidence in their leadership and in their \noversight. Mr. Wynne and General Moseley blessed this Airbus contract. \nClearly, we in Congress--those who represent the taxpayers of this \ncountry--need to look at this deal more closely.\n  Congress is entrusted by the American people with the responsibility \nto look out for our taxpayers and to be a check on this administration \nor any administration. When it is clear that the administration has \ngone in the wrong direction, we--Congress--have to step in. Now is one \nof those times. We owe it to our taxpayers and to our service men and \nwomen to make sure we buy the right plane. This contract is too \nimportant.\n  So I am here this afternoon on the floor of the Senate to implore my \ncolleagues to stand with me and continue to demand that the Air Force \njustify this decision.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5685-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Vermont State Housing \nAuthority, VSHA, on 40 years of excellence. This organization, which \ncame into existence with a creative spark as the first statewide \nhousing authority in the country, continues to find new and innovative \nways to use Federal housing programs to find affordable homes for \nVermonters.\n  Reaching this milestone should bring great pride to the visionaries \nthat created the system in 1968, including Governor Phil Hoff, and to \nthe 40 years of staff, board members and leaders that have ensured that \nthe statewide mission of VSHA has been carried out on a daily basis.\n  The VSHA executive director, Richard Williams, has been at the helm \nof the VSHA for more than half its lifespan, working since 1984 to \nexpand the reach of the organization, develop and maintain properties \nand move people out of the cold and into their own homes. It takes a \nman of great conviction to accomplish what he has done, and it takes a \ngreat team to deliver on the mission he and the board created. Richard \nwas recently quoted saying, ``We are proud of what we've been able to \naccomplish for Vermonters over the past 40 years, but the challenges \nhave never been greater. We're inspired and motivated by the knowledge \nthat our services are needed more than ever.''\n  One of VSHA's primary responsibilities is administering the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's, HUD, Section 8 Voucher \nProgram in Vermont. During the past 40 years, the VSHA has worked to \nincrease the number of vouchers available to Vermonters in all corners \nof the State. This has been increasingly important as the Federal \nresources for the programs many of our Nation's most vulnerable \npopulations depend upon have been shrinking and poorly prioritized. The \nnumber of low- to moderate-income Vermonters seeking affordable \nhousing, including those with disabilities, the elderly and returning \nveterans, continues to climb. Fortunately for Vermonters, the VSHA is \nconstantly recognized by HUD as one of the Nation's most well run and \neffective housing authorities--giving hope to those that might have \nlost hope in virtually every other government system.\n  Not only has the VSHA worked to assist people in finding affordable \napartments, but they have also helped many Vermonters pursue their \ndreams of homeownership. It gives me great pride to say that VSHA's \nHomeownership program has given more than 80 low-income Vermont \nfamilies the opportunity to become homeowners. This dynamic program \nworks to improve self-sufficiency by converting Section 8\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nvouchers into Homeownership Vouchers. I am happy to say that the VSHA \nHomeownership program has enabled low-income Vermonters to build equity \nand wealth while increasing their civic involvement.\n  While providing housing for Vermonters, the VSHA has simultaneously \npreserved and revitalized town centers, historical buildings and a \ngeneral sense of community across the State. They have done this with \ncommendable collaboration with nonprofit organizations, the private \nsector and various government agencies. I have seen their work, and \nmost importantly, I have seen the tremendous impact their programs have \nhad on my home State and the people who call the Green Mountains their \nhome.\n  I congratulate the VSHA on their outstanding achievements over the \npast 40 years. On behalf of the people of Vermont, I applaud everyone \nwho has worked to make the Vermont State Housing Authority a great \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5686-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 5749, Emergency \nExtended Unemployment Compensation Act. Earlier this month we were met \nwith troubling news about our economy. We learned that the unemployment \nrate, one of the strongest indicators of our Nation's economic health, \nexperienced the largest one month increase since 1986, from 5 percent \nto 5.5 percent.\n  In real terms, this jump in the unemployment rate means that between \nApril and May, 49,000 more American workers lost their jobs. In 2008, \nour economy has lost a total of 324,000 jobs.\n  In my State of California, the unemployment rate is the third highest \nin the Nation at 6.2 percent. Some areas in California's Central Valley \nhave unemployment rates as high as 10 to 12 percent.\n  Families in these communities are struggling in this economy, and \nwith Governor Schwarzenegger's recently declared a drought emergency in \nthe Central Valley, farmers there tell me that because of the water \nshortage, fewer acres will be planted this year, which will mean fewer \njobs in this area of the State with already skyrocketing unemployment.\n  Yet in this time of economic uncertainty, when so many workers can't \nmake ends meet because they have lost their jobs, Senate Republicans \ntoday did as they have done so many times this year on issues important \nto American families and said ``no'' to passing a stand-alone \nunemployment benefits extension bill.\n  This bill, passed with strong bipartisan support by the House, could \nhave been sent to the President immediately so that unemployed workers \nwho have exhausted their unemployment benefits can get additional \nsupport while they try and find a new job.\n  Opponents of this bill wrongly suggest that extending benefits for an \nadditional period of time in high unemployment States creates a \ndisincentive for unemployed workers to seek a job. This flawed logic is \nnot only demeaning to hard-working Americans, it also ignores the \nreality for job seekers pounding the pavement in today's economy.\n  Unemployed workers are out looking for new jobs, but because of the \neconomic downturn, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to find \nwork. Today there are only 3.7 million existing job opportunities for \n8.5 million unemployed workers.\n  In addition, the long-term unemployment rate is 62 percent higher \nthan it was in January of 2001, when our country was in a recession. \nThis means that more and more unemployed workers are running out of \nbenefits before finding new jobs.\n  In California, over 50 percent of newly unemployed workers are \nexhausting their benefits before finding a new job.\n  Californians are also struggling to deal with rising fuel and food \ncosts, making it even more difficult for the 324,000 Americans who have \nlost their jobs this year to provide for their families.\n  We learned today that the national gas price average increased yet \nagain to $4.08, up $1.07 from last year.\n  Prices for food staples like bread and eggs are up as high as 20 \npercent from last year.\n  Food banks and soup kitchens, like the Alameda County Food Bank in \nCalifornia, are seeing demand for food aid grow as much as 40 percent \nover last year, with the increase in visits a direct result of the high \nunemployment rate.\n  Senate Democrats know that we must act now to provide additional \nrelief to workers who have exhausted their benefits and in areas of the \ncountry with high unemployment.\n  This bill would immediately provide up to 13 weeks of extended \nunemployment benefits in every state to workers who have exhausted the \n26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits.\n  Workers in States with higher levels of unemployment, like \nCalifornia, would be eligible for 26 weeks of extended benefits.\n  This bill will also provide an additional stimulus to the Nation's \neconomy. Leading economists tell us that for every dollar the Federal \nGovernment spends on unemployment benefits, it adds $1.64 to the \nnational gross domestic product.\n  We know that people out of work use extended unemployment benefits to \nmeet the essential needs of their families, to buy groceries and to pay \nbills. With the much-needed resources this bill provides, jobless \nworkers will help inject money into the lagging economy.\n  This bill is a win for struggling families and a win for the Nation's \neconomy, and it is unfortunate that Senate Republicans refused to work \nwith us to consider this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5686-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5686-S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SELECT AGENT PROGRAM AND BIOSAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3127, the \nSelect Agent Program and Biosafety Improvement Act of 2008. Last week, \nI introduced this important legislation with my friend Senator Ted \nKennedy. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his partnership. I \nenjoyed working closely with him in the 109th Congress on the Pandemic \nand All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which was signed into law in December \n2006. He continues to be one of the great leaders in the U.S. Senate \nand I look forward to continuing to work with him to ensure our laws \nprotect the American people from health threats of all kinds.\n  S. 3127 will enhance our Nation's biosecurity and improve the \nbiosafety of our most secure laboratories. The bill achieves two \noverarching goals.\n  First, it reauthorizes and improves the Select Agent Program. This \nprogram was created in the 1990s to control the transfer of certain \ndangerous biological agents and toxins that could be used for \nbioterrorism. The program expanded after the anthrax attacks in 2001; \nhowever, the authorization expired at the end of September 2007.\n  Second, the bill evaluates and enhances the safety and oversight of \nhigh containment laboratories. These laboratories are used by \nscientists to study select agents and other infectious materials. Labs \nare categorized by their safety level. There are four levels, termed \nBiosafety Level, BSL, 1 through 4, with 4 being the highest level. The \nnumber of these labs has grown, both domestically and internationally, \nin the last several years. Recent incidents in which laboratory workers \nwere exposed to disease agents have highlighted the need to evaluate \nways to improve the safety of these labs.\n  The Select Agent Program is jointly administered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services', HHS, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's, \nUSDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS. The program \nwas intended to prevent terrorism, and protect public and animal health \nand safety, while not hampering legitimate research. This is an obvious \nstruggle that requires careful consideration, particularly when science \nis rapidly advancing around the globe.\n  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, it is illegal to possess ``select agents'' \nfor reasons other than legitimate research. The Public Health Security \nand Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 further required \nlaboratories and laboratory personnel to undergo background checks by \nthe FBI prior to approval for possession of select\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nagents. As of April 2008, there are 72 select agents, meaning the \nagents pose a severe threat to public or animal health and safety. \nThirteen of these agents are found naturally in the United States. \nThere are 325 entities and 9,918 individuals registered with the CDC to \nwork with select agents and toxins, and 75 entities and 4,336 \nindividuals registered with APHIS.\n  We take four key actions in S. 3127 to strengthen the Select Agent \nProgram.\n  First, our legislation reauthorizes the program through 2013 and \ncalls for a comprehensive evaluation of the program. The review, to be \nconducted by the National Academy of Sciences, will look at the effects \nof the program on international scientific collaboration and domestic \nscientific advances. Historically, the United States has been an \ninternational leader in biosecurity. In fact, Canada recently proposed \nlegislation to tighten safety and access to pathogens and toxins of \nconcern for bioterrorism. Canada's new legislation, released in April \n2008, would establish a mandatory licensing system to track human \npathogens, similar to our Select Agent Program. It also ensures \ncompliance with the country's Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines across \nthe country.\n  Second, the bill ensures a comprehensive list of select agents. \nCurrently, CDC and APHIS develop a list of agents and toxins to which \nthe program regulations apply. However, we believe some additional \nfactors should be considered in revising the list. For example, \nscientific developments now make it possible to create agents from \nscratch or to modify them and make them more deadly. Highly infectious \nviruses or bacteria that are otherwise difficult to obtain can now be \ncreated by scientists using ``synthetic genomics''. In addition, we now \nhave more information from the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nabout the threat posed by certain bioterrorism agents.\n  In 2002, U.S. researchers assembled the first synthetic virus using \nthe genome sequence for polio. Later, in 2005 scientists reconstructed \nthe 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Then in January 2008, a ``safe'' \nform of Ebola was created synthetically. While this ``safe'' Ebola can \nbe used for legitimate research to develop drugs and vaccines to \nprotect against it, a scientist could also change it back to its lethal \nform. Also, earlier this year, advancements in technology yielded the \nfirst synthetic bacterial genome.\n  We must consider these scientific advances, including genetically \nmodified organisms and agents created synthetically, if we are to \naddress all agents of concern. In addition, DHS's recent biological \nrisk assessments provide new information for our assessment of \nbiological threats. This information should also be considered when \ndetermining which agents and toxins should be regulated.\n  Next, the bill encourages sharing information with State officials to \nenable more effective emergency State planning. State health officials \nare currently not made aware of which agents are being studied within \ntheir State. This leaves medical responders, public health personnel, \nand animal health officials unprepared for a potential release, whether \naccidental or intentional.\n  Lastly, S. 3127 clarifies the statutory definition of smallpox. The \nIntelligence and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 criminalized the use \nof variola virus, the agent that causes smallpox. The statutory \ndefinition of the virus includes agents that are 85 percent identical \nto the causative strain. Researchers are worried this could be \ninterpreted to also include the strain used to develop the smallpox \nvaccine, as well as less harmful naturally occurring viruses. This sort \nof ambiguity could be detrimental to necessary medical countermeasure \nresearch and development. Our bill requires the Attorney General to \nissue guidance clarifying the interpretation of this definition.\n  In addition, in this legislation we take three key actions to \nevaluate and enhance the safety and oversight of high containment \nlaboratories.\n  First, our bill evaluates existing oversight of BSL 3 and 4, or high \ncontainment, labs. The bill requires an assessment of whether current \nguidance on infrastructure, commissioning, operation, and maintenance \nof these labs is adequate. As I mentioned, the number of these labs is \nincreasing around the globe. As these new facilities age, we need to \nmake sure they are appropriately maintained. It is essential that \nlaboratory workers and the public know these facilities are as safe as \npossible. If the guidance we currently have in place is not adequate, \nthen we need to know how to improve it.\n  Second, the bill improves training for laboratory workers. As the \nnumber of laboratories and personnel increases, we must ensure workers \nare appropriately trained and lab accidents to not increase. Accidents \nand injuries in the lab, such as chemical burns and flask explosions, \nmay result from improper use of equipment. Our bill develops a set of \nminimum standards for training laboratory personnel in biosafety and \nbiosecurity, and encourages HHS and USDA to disseminate these training \nstandards for voluntary use in other countries.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a voluntary Biological Laboratory \nIncident Reporting System. This system will encourage personnel to \nreport biosafety and biosecurity incidents of concern and thereby allow \nus to learn from one another. Similar to the Aviation Safety Reporting \nSystem, which gathers information on aviation accidents, this system \nwill help identify trends in biosafety and biosecurity incidents of \nconcern and develop new protocols for safety and security improvements. \nLab exposures to pathogens not on the select agent list will also be \ncaptured through this type of voluntary reporting system.\n  In closing, I encourage my Senate colleagues to join Senator Kennedy \nand me as we work to improve our Nation's biosecurity and biosafety \nsystems by passing S. 3127, the Select Agent and Biosafety Improvement \nAct of 2008. I thank the many researchers, scientists, and State health \nofficials from across the country who shared with me and my staff their \nideas, experiences, and recommendations. In this time of exciting \nscientific advances, we must ensure our laws and prevention programs \nare updated to reflect current conditions. In addition, we must remain \nvigilant in our efforts to protect the American people from \nbioterrorism. The Select Agent Program is an important part of ensuring \nthe Nation's safety and security and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to reauthorize and improve the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5687-S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated May 15, 2008, to Majority Leader \nReid, Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader \nBoehner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 15, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader \n     McConnell and Minority Leader Boehner: As representatives of \n     non-partisan organizations committed to improving health care \n     for all children, we are writing to share our deep concern \n     regarding the impact of the directive to states that was \n     issued by the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     (CMS) on August 17, 2007. In particular, we are concerned \n     that scores of children who are currently enrolled in the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) will lose \n     coverage as a result of this policy change. Unfortunately, \n     the letter CMS sent to states on May 7, 2008, which seeks to \n     clarify the directive's requirements, does not change the \n     policy outlined in the August 17 directive and, sadly, does \n     nothing to mitigate its impact. States still must overcome \n     serious hurdles before they can provide SCHIP coverage to \n     uninsured children in working families and children--even \n     those who lose a parent or whose parents become unemployed--\n     will be subject to a one-year waiting period before they will \n     be eligible for coverage under SCHIP. We urge Congress to \n     enact legislation that would impose a moratorium on the \n     implementation of this directive.\n       As organizations committed to ensuring that all of our \n     nation's children have access to affordable health care \n     coverage, we strongly believe that no child in America\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\n     who is currently covered under SCHIP or Medicaid should lose \n     their health coverage or access to care as a result of this \n     administrative directive. We share your commitment to \n     ensuring that federal health coverage programs make our \n     nation's lowest income children the foremost priority, \n     however, the CMS directive runs directly contrary to our \n     common goal of covering America's poorest children first. The \n     August 17 directive already is jeopardizing access to health \n     care for low-income children in at least 23 states. Moreover, \n     recent reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) affirm that the \n     directive goes beyond what is permissible under current law. \n     Unfortunately, CMS' May 7, 2008 letter to states did not \n     address these serious concerns. In light of the directive's \n     impact on state efforts to provide coverage for uninsured \n     children and the recent GAO and CRS findings, we urge the \n     House and Senate to take immediate action to halt the \n     implementation of the August 17 directive and restore states' \n     ability to determine how best to cover their children.\n       With more than nine million American children lacking any \n     form of health insurance and nearly two-thirds of that number \n     already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, we must do all we can \n     to reduce coverage barriers, not add additional ones. This \n     directive already is having a chilling effect on states, \n     stalling efforts in several states that were poised to enact \n     policy changes to improve coverage of uninsured children. \n     Halting the implementation of this directive is essential if \n     we are to tackle the coverage crisis facing our nation's most \n     vulnerable children. No child in America should lose their \n     health coverage as a result of philosophical differences in \n     Washington, D.C. Our nation must do better for our children.\n       We know you agree that our children are our nation's most \n     precious resource and that investments in health care for \n     kids reap benefits that last a lifetime. We welcome the \n     opportunity to discuss these issues with you and to work with \n     you to be sure that all of our nation's children have \n     access to the health care services and coverage they need.\n           Sincerely,\n       First Focus;

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nthe House Concurrent Resolution, H. Con. Res. 325, which was introduced \nby Congressman Stupak and recognizes the celebration of the 50th \nanniversary of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission's Historical \nPreservation and Museum Program. This anniversary, which will take \nplace on June 15, 2008, honors the work of the Commission to protect, \npreserve, and communicate the rich history and natural wonders of \nMackinac Island.\n  Located in the heart of the Great Lakes, between Michigan's Upper and \nLower Peninsulas, Mackinac Island is an important part of this Nation's \nhistory. In colonial years, the island provided strategic fur-trading \nposts for French, British, and American settlements. During the Civil \nWar, Britain's Fort Mackinac was established on this island and the \nfort was also used during the War of 1812. In 1817, the village of \nMackinac was incorporated and served as the seat for the territorial \ncounty of Michilimackinac, which covered much of what is now Michigan. \nIt also functioned as the seat of Mackinac County from 1849 through \n1882. The island was considered a sacred place to Native Americans and \nfunctioned as a tribal gathering place and burial site. Today, the \nisland is a popular tourism destination where people can relax, enjoy \nnature, and learn about history.\n  Since its inception in 1895, the Mackinac Island State Park \nCommission has been actively engaged in a variety of\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nrestoration activities and has worked to interpret and communicate the \nmultiple stories of this important island to millions of visitors. The \nCommission has participated in a number of initiatives, including \narcheological excavation, lighthouse restoration, and exhibit \ninstallation, to protect and manage the historic resources of the park.\n  The U.S. Congress recognized the significance of Mackinac when it \nestablished the Mackinac Island National Park in 1875, making it the \nNation's second National Park after Yellowstone. In 1895, park \nownership was transferred to the State of Michigan, creating Michigan's \nfirst State park. In 1958, the Mackinac Island State Park Commission \nestablished the Historical Preservation and Museum Program. This \nprogram has served as the primary caretaker and purveyor of the \nIsland's considerable tale. I am pleased to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to those individuals involved with this program who \nhave painstakingly restored and preserved Mackinac Island for future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN ENGBER\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize John Engber for \nhis 11 years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of Washington \nState. John served as my State Director during this time, and he was a \ncritical part of my staff. On June 1, he ended his tenure in my office. \nWe were sad to see him go, but we wish him all the best in his next \nendeavor.\n  John was a thoughtful and dedicated public servant. As my State \nDirector, he helped ensure that even though Washington State residents \nare 2,500 miles from DC, their needs are up-front and center. \nOverseeing my State operations, he was responsible for listening to the \npeople in our communities and for connecting them to the Senate and the \nFederal Government. And thanks to his hard work, residents of towns \nfrom Forks to Clarkston have access to me and my office.\n  One of John's greatest accomplishments during his time with my office \nwas his help in drafting the recently enacted Wild Sky Wilderness law. \nJohn worked closely with local leaders, the environmental community, \noutdoor enthusiasts, and others to create a wilderness proposal built \non community consensus. We faced some tremendous obstacles over the 9 \nyears that we worked on the bill, but John helped us all remain \ndedicated to the goal of preserving Wild Sky for future generations.\n  Finally, I would like to thank John for his years of service to me \nand the people of Washington State. His leadership and his dedication \nare truly appreciated, and I know that he will always have Washington \nState's interests at heart. I wish him happiness and success as he \nmoves on to the next phase of his career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5689-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              11TH ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH SCREENINGS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Chamber's \nattention the 11th Annual Congressional Health Screenings and I would \nlike to commend my colleague, Senator Shelby, for his leadership at \nthis event. The Congressional Health Screenings occur each year during \nNational Men's Health Week the week prior to Father's Day. I encourage \nall of my colleagues and their staffs to participate in these \nscreenings. As U.S. Senators, we must set an example and not only \nencourage healthy habits but practice them as well. This year's program \noffers a number of convenient screenings, including prostate specific \nantigen, PSA, cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, and body fat tests, \nas well as health education materials. The purpose of this event is to \nincrease our awareness of health issues and to help develop \ncomprehensive strategies to improve our health and that of our \nfamilies.\n  The state of men's health has become a national crisis. Because of \npoor health habits, lack of health insurance, failure to seek timely \nmedical attention, and dangerous occupations, men are afflicted with \nmore maladies and die younger than women. Today, men are living \napproximately 5 fewer years than that of their female counterparts and \nare dying at higher rates for 9 out of the Nation's top 10 causes of \ndeath. This includes death from cancer, diabetes, suicide, accidents, \nand diseases of the heart, kidney, and liver. When speaking about \ncancer, it is important to note that one in two men in his lifetime \nwill be diagnosed with cancer and one in six will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer.\n  The Men's Health Network, along with Women Against Prostate Cancer, \nuse National Men's Health Week to emphasize the fact that prostate \nhealth issues and prostate cancer is not merely a ``man's disease.'' \nEach year thousands of wives, daughters, sisters, and friends are \nimpacted--often in devastating ways--by the loss and/or suffering of a \nman from prostate health issues. Early and regular screenings \nsignificantly increase the chance of early detection and successful \ntreatment.\n  I am pleased to report that we are steadily making progress. Last \nyear during September's Prostate Awareness Month, Men's Health Network \nand the Washington Redskins held a prostate screening at FedEx Field in \nLandover, MD. Over 300 people gathered to help their fathers, \ngrandfathers, sons, uncles, and friends move one step closer toward a \nhappier, healthier future. Five of the gentlemen screened had \npotentially dangerous PSA readings.\n  There is no better time than now to become more proactive with regard \nto men's health. Women are 100-percent more likely than men to \nregularly visit their doctors for annual examinations and to seek out \npreventative services. Half of the Nation's elderly widows living in \npoverty did not face economic hardships before the deaths of their \nhusbands. Men between the ages of 45 and 54 are three times more likely \nto die of heart attacks, 1.5 times more likely to die from heart \ndisease, and 1.5 times more likely to die from cancer than women.\n  Half of the estimated 54,000 men diagnosed this year with colon \ncancer will die from it. Over 185,000 men are expected to develop \nprostate cancer in 2008--almost 15 percent of these cases are expected \nto be terminal. Preventive measures, such as prostate specific antigen \nexams, blood pressure and cholesterol screens, and routine self-testing \nexams for these and other types of cancers that target men can lead to \ninvaluable early detection that will increase the survival rates for \nsuch cancers by almost 100 percent.\n  In addition, I must reiterate the need for an Office of Men's Health \nin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tackle many of \nthese aforementioned issues. Last year, I introduced S. 640, the Men's \nHealth Act, which would establish such an office. The Office on Women's \nHealth in the department does a fantastic job of saving the lives of \nthousands of women and improving the lives of many more. Similarly, an \nOffice of Men's Health would provide a support network that would reach \nout to all men on issues related to men's health.\n  In closing, I thank the Men's Health Network for hosting the 11th \nAnnual Congressional Health Screenings. I hope that my colleagues and \ntheir staffs will take this unique opportunity to not only better their \nown health, but to encourage the people around them to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5689-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MONROE ROTARY CLUB\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor the Monroe Rotary \nClub, which is celebrating its 90th anniversary this month, and I would \nlike to take a few moments to publicly recognize their great history.\n  The Rotary Club of Monroe was founded on April 29, 1918, with a \nmembership of 31; however, they did not receive their charter until \nJune of 1918. The stated purpose of the organization is to bring \ntogether business and professional leaders to provide humanitarian \nservice, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help \nbuild goodwill and peace in the world. In order to carry out its \nservice programs, Rotary is structured in club, district, and \ninternational levels.\n  In furtherance of the goals of Rotary, the Rotary Club of Monroe has \nsponsored many local projects including, scholarships at the University \nof Louisiana at Monroe, Goodfellows, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Monroe \nYouth\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\nBaseball, The Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, Camp Quality, The \nSalvation Army, and Girl's and Boy's State, to name a few. In addition \nthey also sponsor Interact Clubs at Neville High School and River Oaks \nHigh School and sponsor two students each year to attend District \n6190's Camp RYLA--Rotary Youth Leadership Award, a program for young \npeople intended to develop qualities of leadership, good citizenship, \nand personal development.\n  Each year the members of the Rotary Club of Monroe also open their \nhomes to members of the Rotary Foundation's Group Study Exchange \nprogram. They have proudly participated in this program for many years \nhosting teams from India, France, Norway, England, Brazil, Australia, \nScotland, Belgium, Japan, Austria and several other countries. \nAdditionally many of their members have traveled abroad as a part of \nthe Friendship Exchange, where Rotarians seek opportunities to visit \nother districts throughout the world.\n  Today, I applaud the Rotary Club of Monroe on their 90th anniversary \nand thank them for their continued service to the state of Louisiana \nand the rest of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTIFICATION OF THE DESIGNATION OF SHARA L.

\n     and\n       Whereas, the demands and sacrifices are such that few \n     Americans are willing to bear or accept them for a multiyear \n     career; and\n       Whereas, a primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life for the national interest for so many years; \n     and\n       Whereas, many private sector firms are curtailing health \n     benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n     employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n     members of the uniformed services are turning to health care \n     services from the Department of Defense and its TRICARE \n     program for the health care benefits in retirement that they \n     earned by their service in uniform; and\n       Whereas, while the Department of Defense has made some \n     efforts to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE \n     program, a large part of these efforts has been devoted to \n     shifting a larger share of the costs of benefits under that \n     program to retired members of the uniformed services; and\n       Whereas, the cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program \n     far exceeds the thirty-three percent increase in military \n     retired pay since such fees, deductibles, and copayments were \n     first required on the part of retired members of the \n     uniformed services eleven years ago; and\n       Whereas, proposals of the Department of Defense for \n     increases in the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments \n     of retired members of the uniformed services who are \n     participants of the TRICARE program fail to recognize \n     adequately that such members paid the equivalent of enormous \n     in-kind premiums for health care in retirement through their \n     extended sacrifices by service in uniform; and\n       Whereas, some of the nation's health care providers refuse \n     to accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements for health care services; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the uniformed services that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense has many additional \n     options to constrain the growth of health care spending in \n     ways that do not disadvantage retired members of the \n     uniformed services who participate in the TRICARE program and \n     should pursue any and all such options rather than seek large \n     increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments \n     for such retirees and their families or survivors who do \n     participate in the program; and\n       Whereas, any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program \n     for retired members of the uniformed services and their \n     families or survivors should not in any case exceed the \n     percentage increase in military retired pay. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact legislation \n     limiting certain increases in health insurance premiums, \n     deductibles, copayments, and other charges of military \n     retirees for their military health benefits being proposed by \n     the Department of Defense. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-376.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio urging Congress to renew the \n     exemption for the sternwheel river steamboat Delta Queen from \n     the 1966 Safety at Sea Act; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, The sternwheel river steamboat Delta Queen, built \n     in 1926, has been transporting passengers on the Western \n     Rivers system since 1947. It is one of only two sternwheel \n     river passenger boats operating under steam and is the sole \n     remaining Western Rivers system overnight passenger boat; and\n       Whereas, The Delta Queen serves as a reminder of a time \n     when steamboats transported people and supplies on the rivers \n     of the United States. Life on the steamboat today is much as \n     it was in the 1920s, a relaxing 8- to 10-mile-an-hour pace \n     with no modern electronic distractions such as television and \n     the Internet; and\n       Whereas, The Delta Queen carries 174 overnight passengers \n     and is currently exempt from the 1966 Safety at Sea Act, \n     which prohibits wooden boats from carrying more than 50 \n     overnight passengers. However, this exemption is set to \n     expire at the end of 2008, and influential members of the \n     Congress of the United States have stated that they are \n     planning on not renewing the exemption, an action that would \n     eliminate this important reminder of Ohio's and America's \n     history; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 127th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Congress of the \n     United States to renew the exemption for the sternwheel river \n     steamboat Delta Queen from the 1966 Safety at Sea Act so that \n     it can continue to carry overnight passengers on the Western \n     Rivers system; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     send duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the President Pro Tempore and the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, to the members of the \n     Ohio Congressional delegation, and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-378. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to establish grant \n     programs to mitigate the damages caused by the opening of the \n     Bonnet Carre Spillway; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 51\n\n       Whereas, on April 11, 2008, the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers opened the Bonnet Carre Spillway for the first time \n     in eleven years for the purpose of preventing flooding in the \n     New Orleans area; and\n       Whereas, the seafood industry in St. Tammany, St. Bernard, \n     Orleans, and Plaquemines parishes have been negatively \n     impacted by the opening of the Bonnet Cane Spillway. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to establish a grant \n     program to assist the seafood industry in St. Tammany, St. \n     Bernard, Orleans, and Plaquemines parishes. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana con ssional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-379. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to oppose the \n     authorization of\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\n     offshore aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico; to the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, there is currently pending before Congress the \n     National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007, which authorizes \n     the secretary of the United States Department of Commerce to \n     establish and implement a regulatory system for offshore \n     aquaculture in the Exclusive Economic Zone; and\n       Whereas, despite the absence of statutory authority in the \n     Magnusson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act to provide a \n     framework for development of deepwater fish farms, the Gulf \n     of Mexico Fisheries Management Council has nevertheless \n     proposed implementation of a regulatory system for marine \n     aquaculture in federal waters off the coast of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, as drafted, the proposed plans envision the use of \n     large containment cages located between two and three hundred \n     miles off the coast of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the cages are proposed to be filled with numerous \n     fish and to be located on or near oil and gas rigs in the \n     Gulf of Mexico, without any restrictions as to the location \n     of such cages; and\n       Whereas, past experiences with aquaculture operations of \n     this nature have resulted in increased pollution of the \n     surrounding waters due to concentrated amounts of fish food, \n     fish waste, and chemicals and antibiotics used to treat the \n     caged fish, and have resulted in damaged cages floating free, \n     interfering with maritime commerce and endangering others \n     attempting to use the surrounding waters; and\n       Wheres, additional concerns about the development of \n     deepwater fish farming include potential genetic damage to \n     both the farmed fish in the cages and the wild fish in the \n     surrounding waters, the spread of disease among the farmed \n     fish and the wild fish, and the stress that the farms would \n     put on forage fish, such as menhaden; and\n       Wheres, Louisiana is known for its seafood and for its \n     devotion to fishing the Gulf of Mexico for a myriad of fish, \n     all of which may be impacted by the establishment of \n     deepwater aquaculture facilities in the very areas where our \n     commercial and recreational fishermen pursue their passion \n     for fishing; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is also known for its oil and gas \n     industry, much of which is now located offshore in the very \n     areas where these fish farms are likely to be located and \n     where the large containment cages may break their moorings \n     during hurricanes, adding to the damage to oil and gas rigs \n     during times of inclement weather; and\n       Whereas, there has been little in-depth research conducted \n     into the unintended consequences of deepwater fish farming, \n     particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, and it appears that the \n     Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council is acting too \n     quickly to enact rules allowing the establishment of \n     deepwater fish farms in the Gulf of Mexico and, in fact, is \n     acting in advance of congressional direction to begin \n     development and implementation of such a program; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has had little input into the \n     development of the regulatory system that would govern \n     deepwater fish farming, an industry that has every potential \n     for dramatic impact on Louisiana's commercial and \n     recreational fishing industries, the largest such industry in \n     the continental United States; and\n       Whereas, the recreational and commercial fishing industries \n     in this state combine for an annual economic impact well in \n     excess of a billion dollars, and the oil and gas industries \n     have an even greater economic impact in this state, with \n     accompanying tax revenues that fund many of the services \n     provided by the state; and\n       Whereas, the development of deepwater fish farms off the \n     coast of Louisiana could have a tremendous negative impact on \n     both these industries which could, in turn, have a tremendous \n     negative impact on the tax revenues received by the state \n     from the industries and related transactions, thereby causing \n     a reduction in the funds available for state expenditure. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to oppose the \n     authorization of offshore aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation, to the National \n     Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanographic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, and to the Gulf of Mexico \n     Fisheries Management Council.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-380. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii expressing its support \n     for assistance for persons present in the United States under \n     the Compacts of Free Association; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in 1986, the United States (U.S.) entered into a \n     Compact of Free Association (COFA or Compact) with the \n     Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands and, in 1994, the U.S. entered into a \n     similar Compact with the Republic of Palau that created a \n     unique relationship between the U.S. and the Freely \n     Associated States; and\n       Whereas, the terms of the Compacts set out mutually \n     beneficial rights and obligations in several areas, including \n     economic development and defense, and created the right of \n     citizens from the Freely Associated States to freely travel \n     to, and work and reside in, the U.S. without durational \n     limit; and\n       Whereas, a significant number of COFA citizens travel to \n     and reside in the State of Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, many COFA migrants arrive in the state with \n     serious medical needs, and many need financial assistance or \n     housing assistance because of the relative lack of resources \n     they have available; and\n       Whereas, when the Compacts were initially executed, \n     Congress recognized there could be a significant effect on \n     the resources of the places to which the COFA citizens \n     migrated and explicitly stated that, ``it is not the intent \n     of Congress to cause any adverse consequences for an affected \n     jurisdiction'' P.L. 108-188, section 104(e)(1) (emphasis \n     added); and\n       Whereas, in 1997, Congress passed the Personal \n     Responsibility Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act \n     (PRWORA), which provided that most non-citizens in the U.S., \n     with limited exceptions, became ineligible for federally-\n     funded welfare programs including Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and Supplemental \n     Security Income; and\n       Whereas, COFA migrants were among the non-citizen groups \n     excluded by PRWORA, and not included as one of the \n     exceptions, despite the fact that they are legal residents in \n     the U.S. and are more like citizens than immigrants or other \n     legally resident non-citizens in terms of their ability to \n     reside, work, and attend school in the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, despite losing access to federal funds for \n     services to COFA migrants because of PRWORA, the State of \n     Hawaii has continued to make the services available through \n     equivalent state-funded services to address the social, \n     educational, public safety, and medical needs of COFA \n     citizens who legally reside in the state, just as it provides \n     them to other legal residents; and\n       Whereas, the State has consistently reported increasing \n     costs each year for the services provided to COFA migrants, \n     the majority of which are not reimbursed by the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the cost reported by the state agencies \n     to provide services for COFA migrants was over $91,000,000, \n     while the federal assistance to the State as Compact Impact \n     Assistance was approximately $10,600,000; and\n       Whereas, the federal government created the relationship \n     with the Freely Associated States that allows their citizens \n     to freely reside in the U.S. with few limitations; and\n       Whereas, extending eligibility for federal assistance to \n     the COFA migrants would better support the purposes \n     underlying the COFA; and\n       Whereas, providing federal assistance for COFA migrants \n     additionally would alleviate much of the burden on the \n     State's budget while still maintaining the same level of \n     services for the COFA migrants; and\n       Whereas, the Governor has repeatedly suggested in reports \n     and letters to the U.S. Department of the Interior that COFA \n     migrants should be made eligible for federal financial \n     assistance, and Hawaii's Congressional Delegation has \n     consistently supported the idea of extending federal \n     assistance to COFA migrants; and\n       Whereas, in 2007, Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye \n     introduced a bill in the United States Senate, S. 1676, which \n     would extend eligibility for certain federal benefits to COFA \n     migrants legally residing in the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, in 2007, Representative Abercrombie and \n     Representative Hirono introduced a bill in the United States \n     House of Representatives, H.R. 4000, which would extend \n     eligibility for certain federal benefits to COFA migrants \n     legally residing in the U.S.; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, that this body supports the bills currently in \n     Congress, S. 1676 and H.R. 4000, and urges that the bills be \n     heard and moved out of Committee, to receive the \n     consideration of the full Senate and the full House of \n     Representatives, and further to encourage Congress and the \n     President to enact the bills into law, which would benefit \n     COFA migrants in the U.S. regardless of the state or \n     territory in which they reside and support the stated intent \n     of Congress that the relationship created by the Compacts not \n     cause adverse consequences to the states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Department of Labor and Industrial \n     Relations Office of Language Access is requested to provide \n     its services to citizens of COFA nations, and that other \n     programs that may be available to individuals whose first \n     language is not English be provided to citizens of COFA \n     nations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, all \n     members of Congress, the Secretary of the Interior, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n     Agriculture, the Governor, the President of the Republic of \n     Palau, the President of the Federated States of Micronesia, \n     and the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-381. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to pass the Rights-of-\n     way Recognition Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, in 1866, the United States Congress passed an \n     open-ended grant of ``the right-of-way for the construction \n     of highways over public lands, not reserved for public \n     uses'';\n       Whereas, the statute, commonly referred to as R.S. 2477, \n     remained in effect for 110 years, and most of the \n     transportation routes in the West were established under its \n     authority;\n       Whereas, although Congress repealed R.S. 2477 in 1976 by \n     passing the Federal Land Policy Management Act, it purposely \n     protected all rights-of-way established prior to October 21, \n     1976;\n       Whereas, unlike any other federal land statute the \n     establishment of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way required no entry, \n     application, license patent, or deed on the part of the \n     federal government, and no formal act of public acceptance on \n     the part of the states or localities in whom the rights were \n     vested;\n       Whereas, because R.S. 2477 rights-of-way were not required \n     by the grant to be formally recorded, they have become one of \n     the more contentious land use issues in the West, resulting \n     in on-the-ground conflicts and expensive litigation;\n       Whereas, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Bureau of \n     Land Management (SUWA v. BLM), a 10th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals' order filed January 6, 2006, provides a thoughtful \n     and reasonable way to resolve road disputes between the \n     federal government and counties;\n       Whereas, the United States Department of the Interior has \n     developed and issued guidelines implementing the well-\n     reasoned principles in SUWA v. BLM, formerly known as the \n     ``Norton Implementation'';\n       Whereas, certain members of Congress and certain \n     nongovernmental organizations are attempting to defeat the \n     principles of SUWA v. BLM as adopted by the Department of the \n     Interior, and are trying to redefine R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     out of existence in order to create additional wilderness \n     across the West, which by definition is roadless;\n       Whereas, Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico has \n     introduced in Congress the ``R.S. 2477 Rights-of-Way \n     Recognition Act,'' a bill that codifies the beneficial \n     principles established in SUWA v.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to designate a new \n     recipient of royalties from Navajo reservation lands in Utah; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, in 1933 Congress added federal lands located in \n     San Juan County to the Navajo reservation and directed Utah \n     to receive 37.5% of oil and gas royalties from those lands \n     for ``the tuition of Indian children in white schools and/or \n     the building or maintenance of roads . . . or for the benefit \n     of Indians residing therein'';\n       Whereas, in 1968 Congress amended the purposes for which \n     the 37.5% of oil and gas royalties are to be expended to be \n     ``for the health, education, and general welfare of the \n     Navajo Indians residing in San Juan County, Utah'';\n       Whereas, Utah is unique amongst the states in having such \n     an obligation and the San Juan Navajos are unique in having \n     this relationship to the state;\n       Whereas, by treaty in 1868 the Navajo Nation was recognized \n     as a sovereign and it is now the largest American Indian \n     tribe in the country with significant expertise in its \n     governance of its people;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Nation receives and expends the other \n     62.5% of the oil and gas royalties from the San Juan County \n     portion of the Navajo reservation;\n       Whereas, the San Juan Navajos are valued citizens of the \n     state of Utah whose interests include the need for critical \n     infrastructure such as water and electricity;\n       Whereas, the state first received monies from the 37.5% of \n     the oil and gas royalties in 1959 and litigation related to \n     those royalties began almost immediately, with a first major \n     decision occurring in 1961;\n       Whereas, the litigious environment surrounding the state's \n     administration of the oil and gas royalties harms the \n     relationship between the state and the San Juan Navajos and \n     complicates all parties' ability to meet the needs of the San \n     Juan Navajos;\n       Whereas, Navajos have expressed a desire to have greater \n     input or control over the administration of the 37.5% of oil \n     and gas royalties;\n       Whereas, there exists several Navajo related entities that \n     are equipped to find a more effective way to administer these \n     royalties where the state is not cast in the role as trustee;\n       Whereas, removal of the state as a go-between provides an \n     opportunity for Navajos to determine the best use of these \n     royalties;\n       Whereas, Congress should designate a new recipient of the \n     37.5% of oil and gas royalties; and\n       Whereas, the state will continue to assist its citizens in \n     the San Juan County through more traditional state tools such \n     as the Navajo Revitalization Fund: Now, Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, encourages the United States \n     Congress to expeditiously designate a new recipient of the \n     37.5% of oil and gas royalties as quickly as possible. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and Governor support \n     congressional action that results in the 37.5% of oil and gas \n     royalties continuing to flow to the benefit of San Juan \n     Navajos. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and Governor request \n     Congress to work with interested parties to ensure the best \n     solution possible regarding the distribution of the 37.5% of \n     oil and gas royalties.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to \n     agree to an economy-wide reduction in its greenhouse gas \n     emissions; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, the White House is convening a Major Economies \n     Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change with seventeen \n     invited countries at the Center for Cultural and Technical \n     Interchange Between East and West, Inc. (East-West Center) on \n     the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on January 30 \n     and 31, 2008, to discuss potential international agreements \n     on global climate change; and\n       Whereas, for more than half a century, researchers have \n     used atmospheric samples taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory \n     on the island of Hawaii to track a steady annual increase in \n     the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and \n     have concluded that concentrations are now higher than they \n     have been in the past eight hundred thousand years; and\n       Whereas, scientific consensus links the anthropogenic \n     increase in greenhouse gases to global climate change; and\n       Whereas, the Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that \n     global emissions of greenhouse gases need to peak in the next \n     ten to fifteen years and be reduced to levels well below half \n     those in 2000 by the middle of this century in order to \n     stabilize greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at the lowest levels assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel \n     on Climate Change to date in its scenarios; and\n       Whereas, achieving the lowest levels assessed by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to date and its \n     corresponding potential damage limitation would require \n     developed countries as a group to reduce emissions in a range \n     of twenty-five to forty percent below 1990 levels by 2020; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and \n     the signatory nations of the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change have recognized the special \n     dangers of climate change to island states, territories, and \n     nations; and\n       Whereas, global climate change is causing rapid melting of \n     ice at both the north and south polar regions, which, in \n     conjunction with thermal expansion due to warmer water \n     temperatures, is leading to a rapid rise in sea level; and\n       Whereas, University of Hawaii experts have demonstrated \n     that a one meter rise in sea level would inundate much of \n     Hawaii's coastline, including the world renowned Waikiki \n     resort area, the Honolulu International Airport's reef \n     runway, the majority of Hawaii's wastewater treatment \n     facilities, many historic sites, and many populated areas, \n     including lands up to a mile away from the existing shoreline \n     in parts of Honolulu; and\n       Whereas, global climate change also threatens Hawaii with \n     stronger hurricanes, prolonged drought, shifting weather \n     patterns, warmer temperatures, shifting micro-climates, \n     increased spread of invasive species, and saltwater intrusion \n     into its aquifers; and\n       Whereas, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide \n     concentrations foster greater carbon dioxide uptake by the \n     world's oceans, leading\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\n     to ocean acidification and the resultant decreases in reef \n     health and decreases in survival of ocean life that rely on \n     calcium carbonate shells; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii is doing its part to reduce its \n     contribution to global climate change by adopting progressive \n     energy policies that promote the use of clean energy \n     technologies such as wind, solar, wave, and biomass energy; \n     and\n       Whereas, Act 234, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, placed a \n     binding statewide cap on Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions, \n     by requiring Hawaii to reduce its non-aviation greenhouse gas \n     emissions to their 1990 levels before 2020; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, That in recognition of Hawaii's overwhelming \n     vulnerability to global climate change, the President of the \n     United States is urged to use the January 30 and 31, 2008, \n     Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate \n     Change, which is being hosted in Hawaii, to commit to an \n     economy-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the \n     United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States is urged \n     to consent to binding and quantified commitments for the \n     United States under the United Nations Framework Convention \n     on Climate Change that would result in the rapid \n     stabilization and decrease in atmospheric greenhouse gas \n     concentrations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, and the Secretariat of the United \n     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-384. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to extend Louisiana's \n     seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine \n     leagues; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico \n     has been judicially determined to be three geographical miles \n     and the United States has jurisdiction past the three \n     geographical miles; and\n       Whereas, Congress has the power to amend the Submerged \n     Lands Act of 1953, to allow for the recognition that \n     Louisiana's seaward boundary extends three marine leagues \n     into the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana acts as a significant energy corridor \n     vital to the entire United States and provides intersections \n     of oil and natural gas intrastate and interstate pipeline \n     networks which serve as references for future markets, such \n     as the Henry Hub for natural gas, the St. James Louisiana \n     Light Sweet Crude Oil, and the Mars Sour Crude Oil contracts; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana provides storage for the nation's \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve and is the home of the Louisiana \n     Offshore Oil Port, the nation's major import terminal for \n     foreign oil; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana and its coastal wetlands provide access \n     to nearly thirty-four percent of the U.S. natural gas supply \n     and nearly twenty-nine percent of the U.S. oil supply, upon \n     which the United States' economic growth depends; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana ranks first in crude oil production, and \n     ranks second in natural gas production, both including the \n     Outer Continental Shelf production; and\n       Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown that the \n     loss of vital oil and gas infrastructure in Louisiana and the \n     Gulf of Mexico has an immediate and direct impact upon the \n     economy and well-being of the entire country and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately \n     one hundred square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal \n     wetlands into open water, and destroyed more wetlands east of \n     the Mississippi River in one month than experts estimated to \n     be lost in over forty-five years; and\n       Whereas, the states of Texas and Florida have seaward \n     boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine leagues; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana will receive an increase in Outer \n     Continental Shelf oil and gas revenues, but such revenues \n     will not be of a significant amount until 2017; and\n       Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into \n     the Gulf of Mexico for three marine leagues will provide an \n     immediate stream of revenue for use in the state's efforts to \n     clean up, rebuild, and restore southern Louisiana; therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to extend Louisiana's \n     seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine \n     leagues; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-385. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to take such \n     actions as are necessary to prohibit the importation of \n     nuclear waste generated outside of the United States; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 99\n\n       Whereas, EnergySolutions, based in Salt Lake City, is \n     seeking a license from the United States Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC) to import up to approximately twenty \n     thousand tons, a total volume of up to approximately one \n     million cubic feet, of various types of materials from \n     decommissioned nuclear facilities in Italy; and\n       Whereas, EnergySolutions would process and recycle most of \n     the contaminated material at its facilities in Tennessee, in \n     accordance with licenses issued by the state of Tennessee; \n     and\n       Whereas, the remaining waste would be sent to \n     EnergySolutions' low-level radioactive waste disposal \n     facility in Clive, Utah, and any waste that does not qualify \n     for disposal at the Utah facility would be returned to Italy; \n     and\n       Whereas, EnergySolutions' license application specifies \n     that the waste is to be transported to the United States by \n     oceangoing vessel to the ports of Charleston or New Orleans, \n     and at the time of the application, the generators of the \n     waste were ``not fully known'' nor could the waste be \n     evaluated for classification pursuant to federal regulations; \n     and\n       Whereas, although the NRC seeks the input of the states of \n     Tennessee and Utah as the states where the waste is processed \n     and disposed, the states of Louisiana and South Carolina were \n     not consulted despite the fact that the waste would spend \n     significant time in these states while the cargo is \n     transferred from an oceangoing vessel to either barge, truck, \n     or rail transportation; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana continues to rebuild in the \n     wakes of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita where substantial \n     federal, state, and private resources are being brought to \n     bear on the New Orleans metro area, and the fact or the \n     perception that New Orleans is a staging area for foreign \n     nuclear waste is counterproductive to that rebuilding effort; \n     and\n       Whereas, Europe as a whole may see an increase in the need \n     to process and dispose of nuclear waste as many of the \n     countries in Europe rely on an aging inventory of nuclear \n     power plants that will be decommissioned in the coming years, \n     as in the EnergySolutions application, and new facilities are \n     being planned not only as replacements but also to reduce \n     reliance on fossil fuel; and\n       Whereas, the current application from EnergySolutions may \n     only be the beginning of a trend as the decrease in value of \n     the United States dollar in relation to the Euro will make \n     disposal of Europe's nuclear waste in the United States \n     economically attractive and make New Orleans the gateway to \n     that cheap disposals; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to prohibit the importation of nuclear waste \n     generated outside of the United States of America; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-386.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania recognizing the month of May 2008 as \n     ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month'' to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 326\n\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is better \n     known as Lou Gehrig's disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the lower \n     motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horns of the \n     spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, the initial symptom of ALS is weakness of the \n     skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; and\n       Whereas, as ALS progresses, the patient experiences \n     difficulty in swallowing, talking and breathing; and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy, and the \n     patient becomes a functional quadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, because ALS does not affect mental capacity, \n     persons with ALS remain alert and aware of the loss of motor \n     function and the inevitable outcome of continued \n     deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most commonly between the \n     ages of 40 and 70, with the peak age about 55; and\n       Whereas, ALS affects men two to three times more often than \n     women; and\n       Whereas, more than 5,000 new ALS patients are diagnosed \n     annually; and\n       Whereas, on average, patients diagnosed with ALS survive \n     only two to five years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, research indicates that military veterans are at a \n     50% or greater risk of developing ALS than other persons; and\n       Whereas, ALS has no known cause, means of prevention or \n     cure; and\n       Whereas, ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month'' \n     increases public awareness of ALS patients' circumstances, \n     acknowledges the terrible impact of ALS on patients and their \n     families and recognizes ongoing research to eradicate ALS: \n     Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania recognize the month of May 2008 as ``Amyotrophic \n     Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month'' in the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge the President and Congress \n     of the United States to enact legislation to provide \n     additional funding for ALS research; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the members of Congress from Pennsylvania \n     and to the United States Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-390. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Arizona urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to provide adequate school facilities on \n     tribal lands; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2007\n\n       Whereas, to achieve true self-determination, Native \n     American governments, including the Hopi Tribe, must have the \n     resources necessary to provide a quality education to their \n     children living on federally recognized tribal lands so that \n     those children have the same opportunity for learning as \n     nonreservation children; and\n       Whereas, it is vital to Indian education that the concepts \n     of the No Child Left Behind Act be implemented in a manner \n     consistent with the social, civic, economic, educational and \n     cultural needs of American Indian tribes and communities; and\n       Whereas, the Hopi Day School and the Hotevilla-Bacavi \n     Community School at Third Mesa, Arizona have been in \n     existence collectively for over one hundred and twenty-five \n     years; and\n       Whereas, due to the age and poor physical condition of the \n     Hopi Day School and the Hotevilla-Bacavi Community School \n     facilities, neither school can provide an appropriate \n     educational environment for its students. The schools' \n     deficiencies include classrooms that do not meet minimum \n     space requirements and that lack a reliable means of \n     controlling the temperature and air quality, interior walls \n     painted with lead-based\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\n     paint, numerous cracks in the masonry walls making the \n     structural integrity of the building questionable and a lack \n     of the standard amenities common to most schools. Both school \n     facilities have been described by two different Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs inspections as having exceeded their \n     usefulness and functional life: and\n       Whereas, the Hopi children living at Third Mesa who attend \n     the Hopi Day School and the Hotevilla-Bacavi Community School \n     are at risk and suffer from a significant educational \n     disadvantage in comparison to their off-reservation peers, \n     and this situation will continue until the federal government \n     replaces the facilities at both schools; and\n       Whereas, in the face of the deplorable physical conditions \n     of their school facilities, the Hopi children attending these \n     schools have nevertheless excelled at their AIMS test \n     (Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards) and their Adequate \n     Yearly Progress (AYP) assessments for the last five years, \n     despite the fact that only one-third of tribal schools \n     nationwide are attaining the AYP, thereby demonstrating their \n     desire to achieve educational excellence; and\n       Whereas, at a time when schools across the entire country \n     are diligently engaged in educational reforms to ensure that \n     ``no child is left behind'', the Hopi children living in the \n     Third Mesa area are being left behind by the very entity \n     responsible for the reform movement, the federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Hopi Tribe is the only tribe in Arizona that \n     does not have a gaming compact and, therefore, has no other \n     financial resources with which to improve the conditions of \n     its schools; and\n       Whereas, the Hopi Tribe believes that a single school \n     facility designed and built to serve the combined student \n     populations served by the Hopi Day School and the Hotevilla-\n     Bacavi Community School would be economically advantageous \n     and would allow the addition of specialized staff and \n     programs not available in the current separate school \n     facilities, would reduce or eliminate duplication of staff, \n     services and bus routes required under the two-school \n     structure, would provide a proper learning environment for \n     delivery of the whole educational program for each child from \n     preschool through the eighth grade, would allow local control \n     and would provide a school facility that is designed and \n     constructed to last for many years and that can appropriately \n     accommodate the growth of the local population; and\n       Whereas, the Bureau of Indian Education has recognized that \n     combining these two schools on the Hopi reservation would be \n     a more meaningful, appropriate and just solution to the \n     problems caused by the current dilapidated buildings; and\n       Whereas, the governing boards for the two schools formally \n     agreed to the concept of having a single school facility for \n     the entire Third Mesa area providing educational programs \n     that include early childhood education through the eighth \n     grade; and\n       Whereas, the reservation-wide Hopi Board of Education \n     adopted a resolution supporting the single school concept and \n     took formal action to reserve a landsite for the new school; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Village of Kykotsmovi Governing Board endorsed \n     the single school concept and took formal action to reserve a \n     landsite for the new school; and\n       Whereas, the Hopi Tribal Council adopted a resolution \n     approving both the single school concept and the landsite \n     assignment. Wherefore your memorialist, the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate \n     concurring,\n       Prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress recognize that failure \n     to maintain adequate school facilities on Indian lands is a \n     violation of the rights of tribal governments and communities \n     to exercise and assert equitable education in their \n     boundaries.\n       2. That the United States Congress provide a sufficient \n     set-aside of Bureau of Indian Education monies to ensure that \n     one new school will replace the two extremely old schools on \n     the Third Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in order to promote \n     fair and quality education for the children of the Hopi \n     Indian Nation.\n       3. That the United States Congress promote and support \n     adequate funding of schools on American Indian Reservations.\n       4. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-391. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to \n     ratify the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of \n     discrimination against women; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women (Convention) was adopted by the \n     United Nations General Assembly in 1979; and\n       Whereas, the Convention is the most complete international \n     agreement that focuses specifically on basic human rights for \n     women; and\n       Whereas, the Convention requires ratifying nations to \n     improve the status of women and to work towards eliminating \n     discrimination and violence against women by establishing \n     equality in legal status, political participation, education, \n     employment, healthcare, and the family structure; and\n       Whereas, the Convention has resulted in reforms for women \n     around the world, including measures against sex slavery, \n     domestic violence, and trafficking of women; increasing \n     primary education previously denied to females; and improved \n     health care that have saved lives during pregnancy and \n     childbirth; and\n       Whereas, in 1972, Hawaii was the first state to ratify the \n     federal Equal Rights Amendment, which would have amended the \n     United States Constitution by establishing a guarantee of \n     equal rights for women; and\n       Whereas, although the United States played an important \n     role in drafting the Convention on the Elimination of All \n     Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the United States is \n     one of only eight countries that include Sudan, Somalia, \n     Qatar, Iran, Nauru, Palau, and Tonga, that have not ratified \n     the Convention as of March 1, 2007; and\n       Whereas, the United States' failure to ratify the \n     Convention undermines the principle that human rights of \n     women are universal and worthy of being guaranteed through \n     international human rights standards; and\n       Whereas, as women in the Unites States are succeeding in \n     greater leadership roles in business and government and \n     participate in local and national elections in record \n     numbers, it is appropriate that the United States Congress \n     demonstrate its unequivocal support for the rights of women \n     internationally by ratifying the United Nations Convention on \n     the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, the Senate concurring, That the Legislature urges the \n     United States Senate to demonstrate our national commitment \n     to human rights for all people by ratifying the United \n     Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, and joining the one hundred \n     eighty-five ratifying nations in endorsing the most \n     comprehensive treaty ensuring fundamental human rights and \n     equality for all women; and be it futher\n       Resolved, that certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-392. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Utah reaffirming the words, ``Under God,'' in the \n     pledge of allegiance; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance is a promise or oath of \n     allegiance to the United States as represented by its \n     national flag;\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance is commonly recited in \n     unison at public events and especially in public school \n     classrooms;\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by \n     Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister;\n       Whereas, by presidential proclamation, and later at the \n     urging of the National Flag Conference, Reverend Bellamy's \n     original version of the Pledge was altered prior to being \n     officially recognized as the official national pledge in \n     1945;\n       Whereas, on Flag Day, 1954, at President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower's urging, the United States Congress passed a \n     resolution to add the words ``under God'' to the Pledge of \n     Allegiance;\n       Whereas, President Eisenhower explained, ``These words \n     [``under God'] will remind Americans that despite our great \n     physical strength we must remain humble. They will help us to \n     keep constantly in our minds and hearts the spiritual and \n     moral principles which alone give dignity to man, and upon \n     which our way of life is founded.''; and\n       Whereas, it is fitting that the phrase ``under God'' in the \n     Pledge of Allegiance be reaffirmed as part of the official \n     Pledge of Allegiance of the United States; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     reaffirms the words ``under God'' as part of the official \n     Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-393. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania urging Congress to enact bill S. 70 of 2007 \n     relative to Memorial Day; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 321\n\n       Whereas, Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who \n     have died in this nation's service; and\n       Whereas, the United States observes Memorial Day as a time \n     to honor and reflect on those sacrifices; and\n       Whereas, Memorial Day was officially proclaimed by General \n     John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the \n     Republic, in his General Order No. 11, and it was first \n     observed on May 30, 1868; and\n       Whereas, Congress established Memorial Day as the last \n     Monday in May when it approved the National Holiday Act of \n     1971 (P.L. 90-363) to ensure a three-day weekend for the \n     Federal holiday; and\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\n       Whereas, traditional observance of Memorial Day has \n     diminished over the years as many Americans have forgotten \n     the meaning and traditions of Memorial Day and instead use \n     that day to celebrate the beginning of summer; and\n       Whereas, to help re-educate and remind Americans of the \n     true meaning of Memorial Day, President George W. Bush signed \n     the National Moment of Remembrance Act in 2000 (P.L. 106-\n     579), designating 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day as the \n     National Moment of Remembrance to encourage citizens to pause \n     and remember our fallen soldiers; and\n       Whereas, to fully return the solemn spirit to Memorial Day, \n     this nation should also return to the traditional day of \n     observance of May 30 each year, regardless of the day of the \n     week on which it falls; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania memorialize the President and the Congress of \n     the United States to enact bill S. 70 of 2007, which would \n     designate the legal public holiday of Memorial Day as May 30, \n     call for the flying of the flag at half-staff until noon that \n     day and encourage Americans to observe Memorial Day as a day \n     of ceremonies for showing respect for American veterans of \n     wars and other military conflicts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-394. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to pass balanced \n     immigration reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, the economic relationship with Mexico, which \n     shares our border, is vital to the United States because \n     Mexico is the United States' second most important trading \n     partner, the United States is Mexico's most important trading \n     partner, and the U.S. is the largest source of direct foreign \n     investment in Mexico;\n       Whereas, economic, historic, and cultural ties between the \n     U.S. and Mexico are critical to many U.S. industries, \n     including many in Utah;\n       Whereas, as a result of their shared borders and proximity \n     to Mexico, western states, including Utah, suffer a \n     disproportionate financial burden on health care, education, \n     the environment, and criminal justice systems because of \n     unauthorized immigration from Mexico, affecting the economy \n     of the entire region;\n       Whereas, the economic impacts may be offset by allowing \n     more legal and readily available foreign workers to enter the \n     U.S.;\n       Whereas, seasonal industries, including agriculture and \n     hospitality, historically and currently play a pivotal role \n     in Utah's economy, and are heavily dependent upon a stable \n     and reliable foreign labor pool; and\n       Whereas, current immigration law addresses neither \n     documented U.S. labor shortages nor marketplace dynamics, and \n     without a lawful avenue to provide seasonal employees, \n     encourages continued unlawful immigration to the U.S. which \n     continues to negatively impact the state's economy; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express support for the \n     development of a balanced national immigration policy with \n     the overarching purpose of protecting and preserving the \n     safety and interests of the United States and its citizens \n     while recognizing the needs of Utah industries to have a \n     stable and legal supply of workers quickly available where \n     there are no U.S. workers otherwise available; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Utah's congressional delegation to work with the United \n     States Congress to ensure that any reform efforts focus \n     primarily on enabling Utah's employers to hire a legal \n     workforce sufficient to meet the needs of Utah industries \n     to enhance the economic growth of the state's private \n     sector; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to reform the current systems for obtaining work \n     visas and reduce the delay for legal immigration; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     their opposition to granting blanket amnesty to undocumented \n     persons and urge that appropriate sanctions be a part of any \n     solution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor recognize \n     that addressing the status of millions of undocumented \n     persons currently present in the U.S. is a complex issue; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     in passing immigration reform Congress not inadvertently \n     create unnecessary hurdles and lengthy delays for those who \n     wish to legally hire non-U.S. workers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     in passing immigration reform Congress not inadvertently \n     create incentives for additional illegal immigration by \n     creating unnecessary hurdles and lengthy delays for those who \n     wish to immigrate legally for work or citizenship; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to reform the Foreign Worker Visa system as part of \n     any immigration reform; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to eliminate current visa backlogs and prevent \n     future backlogs to help meet Utah workforce demands; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor recommend \n     that these tasks can be accomplished by:\n       (1) dramatically increasing the annual immigrant visa caps, \n     including the limits on H-1B and H-2B visas, particularly in \n     the industries requiring highly trained and educated workers \n     and seasonal hospitality operations;\n       (2) streamlining the processing of H-2A visas to create a \n     more workable system to enable agricultural employers to hire \n     needed foreign workers for seasonal jobs;\n       (3) maintaining the L-1 visa program; and\n       (4) expediting work authorization for foreign nationals who \n     complete University-level degrees in U.S. institutions to \n     ensure that the benefits of the educational investment the \n     nation has made in these individuals remains in the U.S.; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to ensure the enforcement of current federal \n     employer sanctions for knowingly hiring undocumented labor, \n     which requires the federal government to adopt a secure, \n     reliable, and fast employment verification system accessible \n     to employers electronically 24 hours a day; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Department of Homeland Security, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5697-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Dodd):\n       S. 3141.

A bill to amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to delay and reform the Medicare competitive acquisition program \nfor purchase of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and \nsupplies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce, with my friend Senator \nGrassley and twenty-four other Democratic and Republican Senators, the \nMedicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Reform Act of 2008. In doing \nso, I would also like to recognize the efforts of Congressman Pete \nStark, Congressman Dave Camp, and so many others in the House of \nRepresentatives who worked very hard on this bipartisan legislation.\n  This legislation will delay the durable medical equipment, \nprosthetics, orthotics, and supplies competitive acquisition program. \nMany Members of Congress and I have received reports about potential \ninaccuracies in the implementation of the CAP program. These reports \nrange from suppliers who believe they were wrongly disqualified to \nquestions about the clarity and consistency of information that \nsuppliers received during the bidding process. Some providers were \nawarded contracts to serve areas in which they did not previously have \na presence. Other suppliers were awarded contracts for service lines \nwith which they have little or no experience.\n  While I support the concept of competitive bidding as a way to \ndecrease costs, it is the obligation of Congress to make sure that \nthese savings are not at the expense of beneficiary access to the care \nthat they need in their own communities. I believe that Congress should \ntake a closer look to make sure this program lives up to its potential.\n  In order to ensure that we are getting the best possible price and \nquality for beneficiaries, it is critical that the competitive bidding \nprocess be accurate and inclusive. I am most concerned about the impact \nthat a poorly designed program will have on Medicare beneficiaries, \nmany of whom are confused about what this new program means for them \nand are concerned that they won't be able to get care from someone in \ntheir own community.\n  This means we must have as many bidders as possible who offer not \nonly the best price but clearly meet high quality standards. Based upon \nthe numbers we have seen as a result of bidding in phase one, I think \nwe need to look more closely to make sure that we are not missing an \nopportunity to consider additional suppliers who have experience \nfurnishing these services in the communities at play. Furthermore, we \nneed to examine the bidding process outcomes to make sure that the \nsuppliers being offered contracts to serve patients in a selected area \nhave the team on the ground to help patients in those areas.\n  I have also heard concerns that some of the products included in the \nfirst phase of the competitive acquisition program may not be the best \nfit for this type of program because they require specialized handling \nor expertise. At the end of the day, the most important goal of the \nMedicare program is to make sure patients get the care that is \nappropriate for them, so we must tread carefully when we move ahead \nwith a program covering these products.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put forth an admirable \neffort to implement a complex competitive bidding program in a short \ntime frame. I think that many of the concerns that people have raised \nabout the program can be resolved, but we cannot afford to ignore them. \nThe beneficiary services at stake are just too important to move \nhastily; no matter how much money we believe we can save.\n  I think that it is worth it for us to delay for just a bit and take a \ncloser look to make sure this program lives up to its potential. With a \nfew minor tweaks here and there, I am convinced that the competitive \nacquisition program will live up to its promise to provide cost \neffective, high-quality services and products to patients.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare DMEPOS Competitive \n     Acquisition Reform Act of 2008''.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nDMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Reform Act of 2008 with my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, to delay and reform the competitive bidding program for \nMedicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and \nsupplies. We are introducing this legislation to address serious \nconcerns that have arisen over implementation of the competitive \nbidding program which is set to take effect in certain areas of the \ncountry on July 1, 2008. The bill will delay the start of the \ncompetitive bidding program for 18 months and require the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services to review the program and address \nsignificant issues that have been raised regarding implementation of \nthe program.\n  We must act now before the competitive bidding program takes effect. \nWe must ensure that the frail elderly who depend on diabetic supplies, \noxygen, and other medical equipment for life-threatening conditions \nwill continue to have access to essential medical products and supplies \nwhich are vital to their daily lives. The continued viability of much \nof the home medical supply industry is in serious jeopardy as a result \nof flaws that surfaced in the program during the first round of \ncompetitive bidding. Many small home medical equipment suppliers are in \ndanger of going out of business through no fault of their own if the \ncompetitive bidding program is implemented as planned. Losing a \nsignificant number of small suppliers from the home medical equipment \nindustry would have severe, unintended adverse consequences on \nthousands of beneficiaries who need home medical equipment and \nsupplies. If that were to occur, it would severely hamper access to \nessential medical equipment for an untold number of beneficiaries. It \nwas due to these very concerns that I opposed competitive bidding for \nDME when it was under consideration in 2003. Now, my original concerns, \nunfortunately, have become a reality, and urgent action by Congress is \nrequired.\n  These concerns are especially problematic right now in states such as \nIowa in the Midwest which are already reeling from the disastrous \nfloods and tornadoes we have experienced this past month. The loss of \nmany more small businesses would be disastrous to beneficiaries whose \naccess to needed medical supplies has already been severely limited, \nlet alone the ripple effect this would inflict on local economies which \nhave already been severely impacted by record floods which have harmed \nscores of businesses and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in \ndamages.\n  We heard from many medical equipment suppliers that the rules of the \ncompetitive bidding program were unclear or were changed at the last \nminute, and that their bids were not considered. CMS has told us that \nroughly two-thirds of the bids submitted by suppliers were ultimately \nrejected for lack of proper documentation or other issues apart from \nprice. This was done even though CMS had assured suppliers when the \nprogram began that they would be notified if their bids lacked the \nrequired documentation. Two weeks before the bidding closed, CMS \nabruptly decided they would not provide such notification. \nAppropriately, this bill terminates the contracts that were awarded \nunder Round One and pays any applicable damages incurred as a result of \nthe terminations, if any. In the future, the bill requires a more \ntransparent process on the part of CMS. When Round One is re-bid, the \nbill requires CMS to provide feedback to suppliers with documentation \nissues or other problems and give them an opportunity to remedy the \nsituation before their bids are thrown out and excluded from \nconsideration.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am committed to \nensuring that Medicare dollars are spent wisely and provide high \nquality products to seniors at the lowest possible cost. The program \nimprovements required by this legislation will ensure more protections \nfor beneficiaries and lead to lower prices and higher quality medical \nproducts while ensuring that beneficiaries will still have access to \nthe medical equipment and supplies that they need. These improvements \nwill also help prevent many small home medical equipment suppliers from \ngoing out of business due to a flawed bidding process which unfairly \neliminated them from the Medicare program for three years.\n  In our bill, the cost of delaying the competitive bidding program and \nadding additional safeguards to the program would be fully paid for by \nthe durable medical equipment industry. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the delay in implementing competitive bidding and the \nreforms to the program included in this bill will increase Medicare \nspending by $3.1 billion over 5 years. To offset the cost of the \nlegislation, in 2009 those DME items subject to Round One of the \nprogram will not receive a CPI update, and payments for those items \nwill be reduced by 9.5 percent. Items not subject to Round One will \nreceive a CPI update in 2009, and all DME items will receive CPI \nupdates in years 2010 through 2013. In 2014, those DME items which were \nsubject to the 9.5 percent payment reduction in 2009 will receive an \nadditional payment increase of two percent over the CPI unless they are \ncovered by competitive bidding contracts then.\n  As is true in many sectors, the DME industry is given a bad name by a \nfew bad apples that spoil the barrel. Unfortunately, we hear on a \nregular basis from the Office of Inspector General and the Justice \nDepartment that the DME industry continues to have far too many \nincidents of waste, fraud and abuse. The multi-agency Medicare Fraud \nTask Force formed last year has uncovered numerous examples of criminal \nbehavior and successfully prosecuted dozens of fraudulent or non-\nexistent DME suppliers in South Florida and elsewhere. In just over a \nyear, the task force has brought more than 120 cases against nearly 200 \ndefendants in South Florida alone who have been charged with a total of \n$638 million in fraud. We must have stronger safeguards to ensure that \ncompanies who participate in competitive bidding are actual, legitimate \ncompanies that can provide the equipment and services they bid to \nprovide. In addition, the Inspector General of the Department of Health \nand Human Services is required to assess the process used by CMS to \nconduct competitive bidding and verify the calculations of the pricing \ndeterminations used to determine the payment amounts for competitively \nbid items in Rounds One and Two.\n  This bill also includes standards which will lead to an improved \ncompetitive bidding program. Under the bill, all DME suppliers must be \naccredited and meet quality standards by October 2009. We also close a \nloophole that currently allows subcontractors to remain unaccredited. \nWe heard many complaints about companies awarded contracts who had no \npresence in the competitively bid area and who then began to solicit \nsubcontractors to assist in carrying out the terms of the contract they \nhad been awarded. Under the current program, subcontractors do not need \nto meet accreditation standards. Our bill requires that every company \nthat supplies DME in the Medicare program must meet accreditation \nstandards, whether they are primary suppliers or subcontractors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to delay the \ncompetitive bidding program in order to ensure seniors continued access \nto needed home medical equipment and supplies and to remedy flaws in \nthe bidding process and make other necessary improvements in the \ncompetitive bidding program.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/17/senate-section/article/S5703-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this week we commemorate the 143rd \nanniversary of Juneteenth, the day our Nation's moral pendulum swung \nfrom slavery to freedom.\n  On June 19, 1865, our Nation turned a significant corner. We ushered \nin what President Lincoln called in his Gettysburg address a ``new \nbirth of freedom.'' We ended an oppression endured by generations of \nAmericans and threw off the chains that shackled our common bond of \nfreedom. We laid the roots for a constitutional revolution that, \nthrough the Civil War Amendments, transformed our founding charter from \none that defended oppression, to one that embraced equal rights and \nhuman dignity.\n  Over a century later we have made significant progress, but the \nstruggle to secure basic rights for all remains unfulfilled. Just a few \nmonths ago, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination found that racial disparities continue to \nchallenge our commitment to equality. I was not surprised to see that \nthe U.N. report rebuked this administration's poor civil rights record. \nAfter 9/11, the Bush administration eroded many of the most precious \nrights and liberties held by all Americans. Just last week, the Supreme \nCourt in the Boumediene opinion, beat back one of these most egregious \nattempts, restoring the Great Writ of habeas corpus to its rightful \nplace as a mechanism to guarantee liberty from arbitrary confinement. \nBut this administration has also played politics with critical voting \nlaws, and failed to protect our most vulnerable citizens. The Bush \nadministration's poor civil rights record has damaged America's \nprestige around the world, and undermined our tradition of progress on \ncivil rights.\n  Vermont is a State that holds a unique place in America's march \ntoward equal justice. It was the first to outlaw slavery. Vermonters \noffered shelter to runaway slaves seeking refuge while in transit to \nCanada. Indeed, in just the tiny town of Brandon, 17 homes were \nstations on the Underground Railroad. I am proud that this month \nVermont joined the States recognizing Juneteenth as a State holiday. It \nis important for our children and grandchildren to know our history, \nand to know that ordinary people can make a difference.\n  As we reflect on the sacrifices of past generations, their example \nshould inspire us all in our present day struggle to secure human and \ncivil rights. We must reaffirm our faith in our cherished freedoms and \nrestore our commitment to protect basic rights. I hope all Americans \nwill celebrate Juneteenth by working towards building the more perfect \nunion we want for generations to come.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 584) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
