Dorgan, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Kent Conrad, Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say, first, to my side of the \naisle, and any of those who are on our side, if you want to speak, just \nlet me know. I have no reason to need all the time. If any of you would \nlike to speak, I will be glad to yield.\n  With that out of the way, let me say it wasn't many months ago when \nthis Senator believed, as a bill passed the U.S. Senate and went its \nway to the House, that because of some very courageous Senators we had \nfinally reached a point where we could tame that voracious lion that \nwas eating up all the oil that we could import in transportation, in \nautomobiles, trucks, diesel trucks, and the like. We know that was the \nbiggest guzzler of imported fuel oil that America had.\n  A committee on which I did not serve--nor did my chairman, Senator \nBingaman serve on, although we were putting a bill together--the \nCommittee on Commerce, headed by Senator Inouye and the ranking member, \nSenator Stevens, with Senators such as Trent Lott on it--they had a lot \nof courage. They decided to put on our bill as part of an energy bill \nthe first major change in the fleet automobile standards for the United \nStates. What courage that took and how happy many of us were that \ncommittee had finally done that.\n  Couple that with what had been done in the other committees in the \nSenate, including that which was done by the Energy Committee itself, \nand we put together a very exciting bill. It went to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives as a bill that contained the provision I just spoke of. \nIt contained a very large provision, a major provision--what I would \ncall the ethanol 2 provision to save ethanol for the future, so it \nwould not continue to have trouble, and then build on the next 15 years \na major gigantic bill for further ethanol to be produced from other \nthan corn. That bill was a giant bill, and it went to the House with \nsome other small pieces. But no taxes were in that bill, and the \nproposal that we would mandate all of the States to have 15 percent of \ntheir electricity produced from alternative fuels was not in the bill.\n  It went to the House and there it sat. Senator Bingaman and I thought \nwe were negotiating with the House over the months under a proposal \nthat said the two of us represent the Senate, and we will sit down with \nthe House Members and see, since we cannot have a conference--there was \nno way to get a conference on our bills because of objection in the \nSenate--we would sit down together and produce a bill based upon the \nbill that had left the Senate and clearly some of the things that had \nbeen done in the House. It was pretty clear we could get a great bill \nout of that and would have the same basic format that I just described.\n  After talking it through and getting to the point where we were ready \nto go, the House decided to go its own way and leave us standing. Then \nthey used our bill which we had sent them, that was built around an \nInouye bill--they used that to put together a bill that came through \nthe House yesterday and is before us today.\n  The first thing that went awry is a Senator like myself, 35 years in \nthe Senate--I had never been dealt with this way ever before in my time \nin the Senate, where I was asked to do something by a committee, we \nwere in the process of doing it, and then a committee backs out and \nuses the work that was done by the working group, including this \nSenator, to produce a new bill.\n  That new bill is before us today, and it contains taxes which the \nPresident says he will veto--and he sent us the message. The message is \nhere: If those taxes are on this bill when it arrives at his desk, all \nour work will have been for naught. If the provision for mandatory \nelectric alternatives, the 15 percent mandated across the land, or 15 \nminus 4, as it sometimes is used--the President said if that is in \nthere he will veto the bill. So we could waste our time or we could do \nsomething meaningful. Today we are starting down a\n\n[[Page S15005]]\n\npath, trying to do something meaningful.\n  We worked very hard to see if we can't gather up more than 40 \nSenators who will vote with us so we will not impose cloture on this \nmessage. I say to my fellow Senators, please understand, there is no \nbill before us. It is a message, and there is a very big difference \nbetween a bill and a message. I had almost forgotten about it because I \ndon't think I managed a message very many times in 35 years. But a \nmessage has a lot of nuances to it that are different: the number of \namendments, the frequency that you can have amendments, and a whole lot \nof things.\n  Senators will wake up next week and find that many amendments they \nwould try to offer are shut out because of the number of amendments you \ncan offer because of the rules that apply to messages. I want them all \nto understand I am not promising anybody they can get amendments in if \nthey win this vote today on my side. We will have to follow the rules \nand see what we can do. But we stand this close to getting the most \nimportant Energy bill, from the standpoint of conservation of crude oil \nproducts--gasoline, for instance, and diesel fuel--we stand just the \ndistance between Senator Bingaman and me away from getting that kind of \nbill.\n  What we must do is not fly in the face of reality. Reality says you \ncannot put taxes on this bill. The Senate already defeated the taxes \nthat were on this bill. We all remember that day. We voted and took the \ntaxes out of the Energy bill that Senator Bingaman and I were operating \nunder. The taxes went.\n  In addition, we did not put on that bill what is now being called the \nalternative energy tax or some such thing. What it means is the \nelectric utilities across the land out in the future are going to have \nto use 15 percent alternative fuel to coal. That is tough. That is a \ntough one to do. If that is on the bill, because it is harmful to the \neconomy, a one-shoe-fits-all philosophy should not work, will not work. \nThe President of the United States, through his operatives, has told us \nhe will veto the bill.\n  Senators, I hope you vote with us and do not impose cloture. Then I \nhope the majority leader and the minority leader and Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens and myself, and whoever otherwise \nproperly fits, will sit down together and work this out as to how we \nmodify this bill that is before us--which is not a good bill now, but \nit can be turned into a great bill with some work--could be sent back \nto the House, and in no time we could tell the American people we have \nfinally done something extraordinary for them.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17\\1/2\\ minutes of which \n10 is reserved for the leader.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak first in support of this \nbill and going forward with cloture. I acknowledge the procedure we \nhave gone through to get to this point has not been ideal. Clearly, \nwhen we were unable to get agreement to appoint a conference in the \nSenate, it became clear we were going to have to use a very awkward \nprocedure. That is what has happened. But the substance of what is \nbefore us contains a substantial amount of very good public policy. \nThese are policies we have tried very hard to enact for a very long \ntime. On the whole, I believe this bill represents significant forward \nprogress.\n  Let me mention a few of the things the bill does that I think are \nvery worthwhile. First, the legislation brings about major improvements \nin vehicle fuel efficiency. My colleague, Senator Domenici, referred to \nthat and clearly that is a centerpiece of this legislation, the \nimprovements of corporate average fuel economy standards.\n  In addition to this hard-won compromise on CAFE, the bill will \nincrease the production and use of biofuels with a particular emphasis \non biofuels from cellulosic feedstock. That also is something the \nPresident spoke to us about in the State of the Union speech that many \nof us support, and it is a strong part of this legislation.\n  So I think the combination of improvements in CAFE standards and \nincreases in production and use of biofuels are efforts we have had \nunderway for a long time, and I believe it is important for us to \ncontinue with those efforts.\n  The bill also, beyond those two items, will boost energy efficiency \non an economywide basis. It has numerous provisions improving \nefficiency standards for household appliances. It has provisions to \nestablish efficiency standards for lightbulbs, for lighting fixtures, \nefficiency provisions related to building construction, which is very \nimportant throughout the country, requirements for greater efficiency \nsavings from the Federal Government across the board. All of that is \npositive.\n  The legislation also makes significant contributions in the area of \nrenewable energy technologies. It would increase our commitment to \nresearch and development of these renewable energy sources. It would \nhelp to demonstrate and commercialize the carbon capture and storage \ntechnologies.\n  It helps us by putting in place extensions of important tax \nincentives to increase both energy efficiency and more production of \nenergy from renewable sources. And it will, as my colleagues pointed \nout, require electric utilities to produce 11 percent of their energy \nfrom renewable sources by 2020.\n  I know that is a controversial provision in this bill. I know there \nis a great concern on the part of some Members here. Frankly, I do not \nshare most of that concern. The Senate has passed a renewable \nelectricity standard three different times. In the last three \nCongresses, we have passed such a provision with strong majorities in \neach case.\n  It has now passed the House of Representatives two times. It seems \nstrange to me to say that this should be a showstopper; this should be \nsomething we need to suggest a possible veto about.\n  I could go through the arguments at great length, but let me just \npoint out this is not a 15-percent requirement as it has been \nadvertised and described by many; it is an 11-percent requirement, and \nthe additional 4 percent that makes up the 15 percent can be achieved \nthrough energy savings, efficiency savings. Clearly, that is \npreferable. It also is substantially less ambitious in the first few \nyears than what we were considering in the Senate before and, in fact, \nwhat we have passed through the Senate before.\n  So this is a provision I think Members can support. It is one that \ncan give us lower greenhouse gas emissions, thousands of new jobs, \ncleaner air, and greater energy efficiency. It can do all of that at a \nlow cost and perhaps even a savings to consumers because many studies \nhave shown that the adoption of an electricity standard such as this, a \nrenewable electricity standard, will have the effect of reducing the \nprice of natural gas. It will take pressure off the price of natural \ngas and thereby reduce the price of natural gas. So we should pass that \nprovision as part of this legislation.\n  The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy has estimated \nthat when you total up all of those provisions I have elaborated here, \nthe legislation before us would reduce U.S. energy use by almost 8 \npercent in 2030 compared to current Department of Energy forecasts. In \ndoing so, these added efficiencies would reduce projected carbon \ndioxide emissions by 10 percent and save consumers more than $450 \nbillion by 2030.\n  On balance, I believe the energy legislation we have before us \ndeserves the support of my colleagues. It is not perfect in every \nrespect. Legislation of this size and complexity obviously cannot be. \nHowever, it represents an opportunity to make significant steps forward \nin a number of key areas of energy policy. With the passage of this \nlegislation, we can reduce our dependance on oil, we can increase our \nconsumption of homegrown fuels, we can provide substantial savings to \nconsumers, and we can create many new jobs. I think it is a real step \nforward, also, in curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 40 seconds \nremaining.\n\n\n         loan program for advanced vehicle technology vehicles\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nMajority leader, Senator Reid. I do so\n\n[[Page S15006]]\n\nto discuss a critical measure that will help keep jobs in the United \nStates and give a major boost to the domestic production of energy-\nefficient vehicles.\n  As my colleagues know, the pending energy bill has a 40-percent \nincrease in CAFE standards for vehicles sold in the U.S. This is by far \nthe largest mandate on any industry in this bill.\n  In addition to this mandate, I am pleased to have led the effort \nworking with Congressman Dingell, Senator Bingaman, and others, to \ninclude a new program in the bill that would provide $25 billion in \nlow-interest direct loans to the auto industry to help them retool \nfacilities to produce energy-efficient vehicles to comply with the very \nchallenging CAFE standards in the bill.\n  I believe that this loan program is only fair since we are asking the \nauto industry to spend approximately $80 billion in new capital \ninvestment to comply with the new CAFE title.\n  As many of my colleagues know, establishing a loan program of this \ntype is a two-step process. The first part, setting up the program, has \nbeen accomplished. The second part, however, providing the resources to \nback the loans, has not yet been done.\n  So I rise to ask Senator Reid, as you complete negotiations on a \nfinal energy bill, will you give me your assurance that you will \nprovide the resources necessary to fund the loan program that is \nauthorized in the current energy bill?\n  Mr. Reid. Mr. President, no one works harder on behalf of her \nconstituents than Senator Stabenow. She is a real leader in keeping \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I give the Senator from Michigan my word that I will \nwork with her and the Appropriations and Finance Committees to find and \nprovide the resources that would fully implement this loan program.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank Senator Reid for his assurances and all of his \nleadership on the energy bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion \nto concur in the House amendment to H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act, because I believe we need to move forward to address our \nNation's continued dependence on imported oil, increase our energy \nindependence, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The House amendment to H.R. 6 is a significant improvement over the \nbill the Senate passed in June. H.R. 6 will require new vehicle fuel \neconomy standards that will be challenging for auto manufacturers. \nReaching a fuel economy level of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 is \nambitious, but unlike the Senate passed bill, the provisions of this \namendment provide greater flexibility and predictability for auto \nmanufacturers in meeting those standards. The CAFE provisions of this \namendment are not perfect, and I believe that additional improvements \ncould be made. But this amendment includes positive language on some \nimportant issues to the auto manufacturers and their workers by \nrequiring separate car and truck standards, preserving domestic jobs \nwith an antibacksliding provision, and extending flexible fuel credits \nuntil 2014. Significantly, this amendment also maintains a key reform \nobtained during Senate consideration of the bill. By setting standards \nbased on vehicle size rather than having a fleetwide average for each \ncompany, we will end the many years of discriminatory impacts on \ndomestic manufacturers imposed by the existing CAFE system.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act. In particular, title I, otherwise known \nas the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, would mandate an increase in \nautomobile fuel economy to a nationwide fleet average of 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020. This is the first statutory increase in fuel economy \nstandards for cars since 1975. In addition, the Department of \nTransportation would adopt fuel economy standards for medium and heavy \nduty commercial vehicles for the first time.\n  With the cost of oil at approximately $90 per barrel, reducing our \ndependence on oil is of vital importance to our national security, \neconomic stability, and consumer welfare. The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy \nAct is a major step forward toward achieving these goals. In addition, \nthe act would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and \ndemonstrate to the world that America is a leader in fighting global \nwarming.\n  Legislation of this magnitude could have only been achieved through \nthe hard work of a coalition of Members. In this case, without Senators \nFeinstein, Stevens, Snowe, Kerry, Dorgan, Lott, Carper, Boxer, Durbin, \nAlexander, Corker, and Cantwell, the agreement would not have been \nreached.\n  In particular, I wish to congratulate Senator Feinstein on her \nefforts in developing this bill. Her dedication over the years has led \nus to an agreement that very few thought possible. I would also like to \npraise the efforts of my good friend Senator Stevens, who was \ninstrumental in forging the compromise before us. His work in the \nCommerce Committee, on the Senate floor, and in negotiations with the \nHouse reflects his commitment to working in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid recognized the importance of \nthe issue and have made fuel economy a major focus of the Energy bill. \nI thank them for their support and dedication.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Dingell and Senators Levin and \nStabenow for their hard work and willingness to achieve an agreement \nthat aggressively improves fuel economy while protecting the domestic \nautomobile manufacturing base and U.S. workers. Their leadership, \nhonesty, and technical expertise have been invaluable. The American \nautomaker and autoworker have no better advocates.\n  Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to all the hard-\nworking members of the staff who worked to make this historical \nlegislation a reality. In particular, I would like to commend David \nStrickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Mia Petrini, and Jared Bomberg of my \nCommerce Committee staff for a job well done.\n  The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated.\n  During the Arab oil embargo in 1973, Americans suffered the first \ndevastating effects of our addiction to oil. Our vulnerability to \ncurtailments in supply became apparent. While waiting in long lines at \ngas stations, we felt the immediate need for conservation, alternative \nenergy sources, and more efficient use of energy, especially in the \ntransportation sector. Born out of this embargo, Congress put in place \na fuel economy program that nearly doubled the gas mileage of cars from \n1975 to 1985.\n  Today's agreement marks historic progress. It is the first of its \nkind since 1975 and is a major step toward addressing our Nation's \nenergy needs. Title I of the bill will save approximately 1.1 million \nbarrels of oil per day in 2020--equal to one-half of what we currently \nimport daily from the Persian Gulf. By the year 2020, the legislation \nwill save consumers approximately $22 billion at the pump and prevent \napproximately 200 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from \npolluting our environment each year.\n  A diverse group of constituencies support the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy \nAct, from environmentalists to automotive workers and automakers. While \nit sets forth aggressive standards, the act also recognizes the \nchallenges faced by the auto industry and ensures that those concerns \nwill be addressed. For one, it provides flexibility to the automotive \nindustry. The sponsors of these fuel economy provisions have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to ensure that automakers have the \ntools they need to meet the requirements enumerated in the act.\n  The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to create two fuel economy curves, one for passenger \ncars and one for light trucks. This change from the Senate--passed bill \nprovides the certainty that American automakers, auto workers, and car \ndealers requested, but the act still requires that the combined car and \nlight truck fleet meet a fuel economy standard of at least 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020.\n  The act also provides automakers with the option of earning flexible \nfuel credits at a tapering rate set to expire in 2019. These credits \nwill incentivize the production of millions of flexible fuel capable \nvehicles while assisting automakers in achieving the target of 35 miles \nper gallon by 2020.\n  Passage of this bill will ensure that our Nation's energy priorities \nstart moving in the right direction. Higher fuel economy standards will \nwean the\n\n[[Page S15007]]\n\ncountry of its oil addiction, put billions of dollars of savings back \ninto our domestic economy and significantly reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Our actions today will improve national security, create jobs, help \nconsumers, and protect the environment. At times, it is the \nGovernment's responsibility to balance conflicting interests. Today, I \nbelieve we found that balance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak on the leader time for up to 3 minutes. That would come off \nSenator Reid's time. When Senator McConnell comes, I will yield to him \nat that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is a great moment for the \nSenate. I was hoping that we could, in fact, get 60 votes for this \nparticular version of the Energy bill. It does not appear likely that \nwill happen for reasons I am sure Senator Domenici has stated.\n  I think the bill, as it is before us, deserves to get 60 votes, \ndeserves to get 80 votes, deserves to get 100 votes, because at a time \nof very high prices of oil, gas at the pump going toward $4 in my \nState, heating oil going up at a rapid rate, affecting people mostly in \nthe Northeast and other areas, we should take bold action.\n  I wish to say to Senator Bingaman in particular how grateful I am for \nthe work he has put into this measure. I am sure Senator Domenici did \nas well, but I had to work very closely with Senator Bingaman and his \nstaff and my staff. This has been very difficult. I also wish to say \nthat Speaker Pelosi showed her amazing skill working with John Dingell \nand others over in the House to get this bill to where it is today. The \nAmerican people are very clear with us: They want action on the issues \nthat impact them every single day. And this is one.\n  I want to say that the other day--and you know this well, Mr. \nPresident, because you are on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--we voted out a very strong bill, a very strong bill to deal \nwith the problem of global warming. One of the great things about \ndealing with global warming is that the cure for global warming is \ngoing to mean less reliance on foreign oil, alternative fuels, and the \nrest. We are clearly taking action in this Senate to move to solve the \nproblems that face us.\n  I see Senator McConnell is here, and I will conclude in 30 seconds.\n  I hope we will have strong support for this bill. We have many \nprovisions in here that were voted unanimously out of the Environment \nCommittee, including green buildings and DOE solar wall and many other \nenergy efficiencies in our Government buildings that I think are going \nto work well for the taxpayers, and finally doing something about CAFE \nstandards--very important. So congratulations to everyone who worked so \nhard getting to this point. I hope we can get 60 votes. If we don't, I \nhope we can certainly get 60 votes for the next try.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a difference between passing a \nbill and actually making laws. The bill before us is a prime example. \nThe majority started with a bipartisan agreement that can be passed in \nboth Houses and signed by the President; in other words, it could \nactually become law. It chose, instead, to add the twin milestones of \nutility rate hikes and massive tax increases. The end result is that \nthe House passed a bill, but it will not become law. So there is a \nclear difference between making a partisan point and having an \naccomplishment. I hope at the end of this process, as it unfolds here \nbefore Christmas, we will actually make law.\n  Again, we can look at the current bill as an example. Rather than \ntake the elements of the bill that had near universal support and have \nan accomplishment on behalf of their constituents, the majority chose \ninstead to make a partisan point.\n  Now, I understand that the House is a different place, that the \nSpeaker rules, as the Senate majority leader put it Wednesday, ``with \nan iron fist.'' While she can muscle bills through the House on a \nparty-line vote, it does not work that way over here. We have shown \nthat all year on numerous political votes the majority has put on the \nfloor. We have shown that already this week on the AMT. When the \nmajority tried the ``my way or the highway'' approach, the bill failed. \nWhen they worked with us on a bill that could pass, we succeeded by a \nvote of 88 to 5. That I would call success. The same is true of the \nfarm bill. When the leadership of the majority tried to dictate to the \nminority what amendments we could offer, the Senate spun its wheels and \ngot nowhere. But when the majority worked with us, the result was a \nmutually beneficial agreement that will soon lead to an accomplishment \nthat both sides can be proud of.\n  But the bill we are voting on today is a massive tax hike and a \nutility rate increase for consumers across the Southeast. It is not a \nserious attempt to make law, and it is not a serious attempt at an \naccomplishment. It is a partisan bill that must be improved or set \naside.\n  So let's not waste even more time rehashing the lessons of the past \n11 months. If you are serious about an accomplishment, let's fix this \nbill. Walking away from a bipartisan deal in favor of raising taxes and \nraising utility rates, as the House majority has done, will not make a \nlaw. But working with us to find common ground to increase the use of \nrenewable fuels and raise fuel economy standards to historic levels \nwithout costing American jobs is something that would enjoy widespread \nsupport. I stand ready to work with all our colleagues on a realistic \nbipartisan bill, but I will vote no on this partisan tax increase and \nthis rate increase for consumers and urge our colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur with the House on the \nmessage they have sent us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked very hard this year to \naccomplish goals. But it takes a lot of work because everything we have \ndone has been after having filed cloture on sometimes multiple \noccasions, trying to terminate debate on the other side. My friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, said, finally, we did the right thing \non the farm bill. The only reason we were able to get agreement on the \nfarm bill is because cloture likely would have been invoked this \nmorning. The farm and ranching communities in America are up in arms \nthat the Republicans have stalled the farm bill for months. I am \nsatisfied where we are. It has been difficult to get where we are. We \nwill work through the farm bill and finish it. But for people to \nindicate it was the result of how we handled the legislation that has \ntaken so long to get there is without foundation.\n  This bill, the Energy bill, the vote we are going to take in a few \nminutes is a historic vote. We hear words all the time in the Senate \nabout ``landmark'' and ``historic.'' These words are often used but \noccasionally appropriately. Now is the time to talk about historic. \nThis is a historic vote. This Energy and Security Act will finally put \nAmerica on the right track to solve our grave and growing energy \ncrisis. No superlative is too strong to express how important this is \nto our country's future and, to a certain extent, the world's future, \nbecause we are the ones polluting the air more than any other nation in \nthe world, by far. Today, America consumes 21 million barrels of oil; \ntomorrow, 21 million barrels plus a few more. It is not going down; it \nis going up. Most of this oil comes from very unstable regions of the \nworld.\n  What did President Chavez say from Venezuela during the height of his \nrecent constitutional crisis? He said: We will cut off oil supply to \nthe United States.\n  Think about that. We are dependent on this tyrant for our oil. But he \nis not\n\n[[Page S15008]]\n\nthe only tyrant we are depending on for oil. The most tyrannical \ngovernments in the world today exist in the Middle East, countries we \nask for oil. Some say the war in the Middle East that is going on now \nis based on oil. I don't necessarily believe that, but people who do \nare not in any way without foundation and reason.\n  With the 21 million barrels of oil a day going to these nations that \nhave these despotic governments, we send as a nation at least a billion \ndollars every day overseas to pay for our oil addiction. Those 21 \nmillion barrels we will use today and those we will use tomorrow have \ncreated a three-pronged crisis that threatens our economy. On my last \ntrip to California, I saw prices on the pumps of more than $4 for a \ngallon of gasoline. Our national security, the example I gave for the \ndictator of Venezuela, is that affecting our security? Of course, it \ndoes. That is only one example. Our environment, does it affect our \nenvironment using 21 million barrels of oil a day, 65 percent of which \nis imported from these individuals and governments I talked about? What \ndoes this do to our environment? It pollutes it.\n  The cost of the pollution in our environment is affecting us from a \nhealth perspective. In June, the Senate took action to begin reversing \nthese threats. We passed the Energy bill with a bipartisan vote of 65. \nIt was a good vote. But the House has done even better than we did. \nThey have sent their version to us with a strong majority. I urge all \nmy colleagues to concur with the House bill and send this critical \nlegislation to President Bush. As I have indicated, with gas prices all \nover the country, with a gallon of gasoline being more than $3 and \nworking Americans spending more than ever to make their commute to \nwork, the time to act is not tomorrow. It is now. With home heating \nprices at record highs and the cold winter months now upon us, the time \nto act is now. With the threat of global warming growing by the day--\nand that is why there are more than 10,000 people assembled in Bali as \nwe speak to talk about the global warming that is taking place--the \ntime to act is now.\n  I so appreciate the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the work they are doing in that committee on the \nbipartisan measure reported out of that committee this week, Lieberman-\nWarner, led by the committee chair, Senator Boxer, to report out a \nglobal warming bill. The first global warming bill that meets the needs \nof our world was reported out of that committee this week. Now this \nbill adds to that. I appreciate very much the work of the chairmen who \nworked to get the bill out of the Senate and who worked to get the \nmeasure from the House to us: Senator Bingaman, Energy and Natural \nResources; Senator Inouye, Commerce; Senator Boxer, Environment and \nPublic Works. That is the bill we have before us.\n  The bill tackles each of the supply challenges by addressing both \nsides of the crisis--consumption and supply. On the consumption side, \nit increases fuel efficiency of cars and trucks for the first time in \n30 years to 35 miles per gallon. That is significant. Think about it. \nWhat was America like with its automobiles 30 years ago? Think back to \n1976. Cars didn't come with airbags. They were just getting cassette \nplayers. We had advanced past the invention of the eight-track stereo. \nWe now have cassette players. The closest thing you could buy to the \nGlobal Positioning System we now have on a lot of vehicles was a map. \nYou went to a service station and most of the time they gave you that \nmap. You would look at the map. My wife, we used to joke, she was the \nnavigator as we proceeded with the kids in the backseat yelling and \nscreaming. That is how we found our way. The navigator was my wife. \nThat is not the way it is now.\n  Things have changed in those 30 years. Today we have cars that were, \nin the past, science fiction, a hybrid electric car. My wife has one. \nIt runs on a big battery and it runs on gasoline. She loves her car, \nbut it is new. She bought it a few months ago. Ethanol cars, cars \nburning fuel produced from corn and other products, and electric cars, \ntotal electric cars--these things will add to the ability of Americans \nto lessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  But this bill we have now, with increasing the CAFE standards, will \nsave American families at least $1,000 a year at the gas pump. For our \ncountry, it will save a total of $22 billion by 2020, $22 billion a \nyear. It will also reduce greenhouse gases by the equivalent--listen to \nthis--of taking 28 million cars and trucks off the road. We take 28 \nmillion cars and trucks off the road by passing this legislation. That \nis pretty good. It will also reduce greenhouse gases in other ways. \nThis increase to 35 miles per gallon is supported by the environmental \ncommunity. Of course, it is.\n  If my time has expired, I will use leader time now.\n  The increase to 35 miles per gallon is supported by the environmental \ncommunity. Of course, it is. But it is now supported by the automobile \nindustry. As a result of that, the vote time will be extended, Mr. \nPresident. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I got a letter in my office this week from \nRon Gettekfubger, president of the United Auto Workers Association, \nsaying: Thanks for your work on the Energy bill. The automobile \nworkers, Detroit favors this legislation. The environmental community, \nthe unions, and the automobile industry, a pretty good deal. That \nwasn't the way it was a short time ago. That is the way it is now. The \nenvironmentalists support it because it will make our air cleaner and \ntake one step on the long road to stem the tide of global warming. The \nautomobile industry supports it because they know they can do it, and \nthey know it will make them more competitive. It will make the American \nautomobile industry more competitive.\n  It also saves Americans hundreds of billions of dollars through other \nthings, new energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting, and \nbuildings. If you have a washing machine that consumes 40 gallons of \nwater and another that does a good job with 10, we should save those 30 \ngallons. That is the principle we are working on. If one light bulb \nlasts as long as three light bulbs, we ought to save that electricity. \nIt is common sense, and that is what this legislation does. But \nconsumption is half the battle.\n  On the supply side, this Energy bill requires, for the first time, \nthat 15 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources. That \ndoesn't sound like anything that is too big of a hill to climb. What is \nmore, this renewable energy portfolio rewards innovation by allowing \nStates--lots of States but, for example, Nevada--that have already \ntaken the initiative and are national leaders on alternative energy to \nsell their excess product to other States. I have heard some complain: \nNevada has more wind and more Sun and more geothermal than other \nStates. The news last week was, we are now, off the coast of Florida, \ngoing to be producing electricity with the current, with waves. Nevada \ndoesn't have any currents or waves. So it all balances out. That is \nwhat this is all about. It rewards innovation. That is what America has \nbeen about since we were founded. This legislation makes an \nunprecedented commitment to American-grown biofuels by increasing the \nrenewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by the year 2022, which \nwill not just reduce our addiction to oil but create American jobs as \nwell. It repeals billions and billions of dollars in tax giveaways to \nbig oil that exports product from overseas and invests it instead in \ntax incentives to produce clean, renewable energy right here at home.\n  All across America, businesses, entrepreneurs, and local governments \nare taking the lead to solve this energy crisis. On my last trip to \nSilicon Valley, the discussion with these geniuses was on two topics: \nhealth care and energy. The great minds of America are focusing on \nthis. They need some incentives. You can't invest unless there are some \nincentives in this new field. All they want is a tax credit here, a tax \ncredit there. They deserve that. With these great minds, they will take \nus much further than we can imagine.\n  In California, for example, a professor is working on a new \ntechnology that can manufacture fuel out of simple plant material in \nany industrial park in America. In Pennsylvania, Amish farmers are \ncharging their\n\n[[Page S15009]]\n\nbuggy batteries with solar power. In Nevada, local governments are \nusing solar energy at water pumping stations to move water uphill, \nsomething that in the past would have required tremendous nonrenewable \npower. That kind of innovation is exactly what America does best. But \nas of right now, the Federal Government is lagging, not leading. This \nmust change, and today it can.\n\n  Our energy crisis will not be solved overnight, but this bill that is \nnow before us is a crucial big, big first step. So let's take that step \ntogether. To do so, we cannot let procedural disputes get in the way of \nthis much needed bill.\n  My Republican colleagues objected to this bill before going to \nconference. I wish we could have gone to conference. But that is their \nright. Even without a conference, we worked with Republicans, \nconsulting on and sharing proposed language. And that is an \nunderstatement. Many provisions were removed and modified at the \nrequest of Republican Senate and House Members.\n  We have acted on this bill in good faith. Now it is time for \nRepublicans and Democrats to put politics aside and unite behind a bill \nthat will deliver a cleaner, safer energy future for all of America.\n  Mr. President, after this vote, there will be no more votes today. \nThe next vote will be Tuesday morning. I have spoken to Senators Harkin \nand Chambliss. They are going to work on the farm bill this afternoon \nto try to have some amendments offered. I would hope those people who \nwant to have 1 of the 20 amendments on each side will start offering \nthese amendments. We are going to move through and finish the farm bill \nbefore we leave here, and we can complete some of that work today, and \nalso Monday afternoon.\n  On Monday, as I have just indicated, there will be no votes, but we \nare going to come in Monday afternoon and work on the farm bill. We \nwill get back to this bill on Tuesday. I will be conferring with the \ndistinguished Republican leader and other Republicans to decide how we \nare going to proceed. I have an idea, but I want to make sure they are \nin tune with what we are doing.\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation yesterday, and I hope we have a \nproductive day today.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture \nmotion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendments to \n     H.R. 6, comprehensive energy legislation.\n         Jeff Bingaman, Max Baucus, Blanche L.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendments to \nH.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

On this vote, the yeas are 53, the \nnays are 42. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this doesn't mark the end of this bill. \nThis marks the beginning of completing a process in the Senate so we \nwill have a bill that can be signed and that will be an excellent bill \nfor the American people. That means we have to go to work in trying to \nfix some of the problems the House bill has generated for us.\n  First of all, we are talking about ethanol II, the successor to the \nethanol bill we passed, which includes a very hopeful future for wheat \nand the kinds of things that are going to go into the thing that \nfollows ethanol. We cannot accomplish them, it seems to us, with what \nthey have in this bill. We have to look at that and see what we can do \nto fix it. In addition, we have to do something about both taxes and \nthe mandatory 15 percent that is required for electric generation in \nthis bill. We have to look at that and others.\n  I hope this sends a signal so Senator Bingaman and I--he as chairman \nand I as ranking member--can work with everybody who has concerns and \nput together an amendment we can offer that sends this bill back to the \nHouse, corrected and fixed, where it can become law and where it is \nmore to the accomplishment of what we expected when we passed the bill \nin the Senate.\n  I note the presence of Senator Bingaman. I hope he concurs. Our \nstaffs ought to go to work and have something by Monday, I hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do think we can make some changes that \nwould make this bill acceptable to a vast majority of Senators. I look \nforward to working on that along with my colleague. I know the majority \nleader intends to revisit this issue as soon as this next week, \nperhaps.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I may, I will add a comment to what the chairman \nsaid.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 395, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, en bloc; that any statements relating thereto \nbe printed at the appropriate place in the Record as if read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 395) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 395\n\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air \n     Force attacked the sovereign territory of the United States \n     at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii;\n       Whereas more than 2,400 United States service members and \n     civilians were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas there are more than 4,900 members of the Pearl \n     Harbor Survivors Association;\n       Whereas the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor \n     will be December 7, 2007;\n       Whereas on August 23, 1994, Public Law 103-308 was enacted, \n     designating December 7 of each year as National Pearl Harbor \n     Remembrance Day; and\n       Whereas section 129(b) of title 36, United States Code, \n     requests that the President issue each year a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities, and all departments, agencies, and \n     instrumentalities of the Federal Government, and interested \n     organizations, groups, and individuals, to fly the flag of \n     the United States at half-staff each December 7 in honor of \n     the individuals who died as a result of their service at \n     Pearl Harbor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion of the 66th \n     anniversary of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     Hawaii, pays tribute to--\n       (1) the United States service members and civilians who \n     died in the attack; and\n       (2) the members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Pearl \nHarbor Remembrance day. Earlier today, my good friend and colleague \nSenator Inhofe and I introduced a Senate Resolution expressing the \nsense of the Senate regarding National Pearl Harbor Remembrance day and \npaying tribute to those servicemembers and civilians who died in the \nattack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, as well as the current \nmembers of the Pearl Harbor Survivor Association.\n  Today is the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Memorial \nceremonies are taking place at the Naval Station Pearl Harbor to \ncommemorate the 66th anniversary of the attack. Later, the dedication \nceremony for the new USS Oklahoma Memorial will also take place on Ford \nIsland at Pearl Harbor. The battleship Oklahoma was anchored along Ford \nIsland on December 7, 1941, and suffered the second greatest loss of \nlife during the attack after the USS Arizona. It is the last ship to \nhave been destroyed that fateful day to get its own memorial. Clearly, \nthis memorial is long overdue. Prayers, reflections, and tributes will \nbe offered during each of these ceremonies to honor the service and \nsacrifice of the men and women who fought and died in the defense of \nour great country.\n  This 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor also marks the \nbeginning of a new commemoration for all of our Nation's fallen, called \nOld Glory's Journey of Remembrance. The journey begins today with Old \nGlory being flown over the USS Arizona Memorial. The flag will then be \ntaken to, and flown over, 24 other military memorial sites around the \ncountry. The journey culminates in observance of the National Moment of \nRemembrance on Memorial Day at 3 p.m. local time with Old Glory being \nflown above the U.S. Capitol.\n  Mr. President, the resolution that I and Senator Inhofe introduced \nrequests that all of my Senate colleagues join together with our fellow \nAmericans in Hawaii and across the Nation to remember and honor the \nmore than 2,400 courageous American sailors, soldiers, and marines who \nwere killed in the raid on Pearl Harbor, as well as to honor those who \nsurvived the attack.\n  For those too young to remember 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor is \nsomething learned in history books. But to those in Hawaii who, like \nmyself, witnessed the attack, the events of December 7 are a painful, \nvivid memory, and a personal experience that can never be forgotten. \nWhile the Japanese surprise attack was a calamity that forever changed \nthe course of history, our country fought back in the name of justice \nto preserve our Nation's sacred freedoms. I urge the citizens of this \nNation to remember that it was the sacrifices made by ordinary men and \nwomen who rallied in defense of freedom, liberty, and the great promise \nof our democracy that preserved our Nation's freedom and liberty. Their \nsacrifices represent the greatest heroism and patriotism in the service \nof our country.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me today in \nprayer and remembrance for those courageous men and women who died in \nPearl Harbor on that infamous day.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, every American owes a debt of gratitude to \nthe men and women who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. They gave all they had in selfless service to the Nation. We \nrecognize the contributions and sacrifice of the survivors of the \nattack who went on to secure our freedom and our cherished way of life. \nIn the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges and countless \nunknowns, they never demanded praise, they never presumed eminence. \nThey taught future generations the importance of recognizing and \nremaining vigilant against tyranny in all forms. We also remember the \nfamilies of the fallen service members. They bore the greatest burden \nand bravely perpetuated the dignity and the memories of the heroes \ntaken from us on that infamous day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment in \nremembrance of the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor and \npay tribute to all the Americans who lost their lives that day.\n  On December 7, 1941, our Nation was brutally attacked at Pearl \nHarbor, and over 2,400 Americans were killed. Though surprised and \noverwhelmed by wave after wave of Japanese planes, the members of our \narmed forces valiantly defended their ships, the naval base and the \nsurrounding army air fields.\n  I believe Pearl Harbor will all always hold a prominent place in the \nhistory of the United States, not only for the destruction that day \nwhich triggered our entry into the Second World War, but as a shining \nexample of American heroism and courage in the face of adversity. I \nknow Americans will never forget the American servicemen and women who \nwere at Pearl Harbor 66 years ago today.\n  One of those servicemen was John Anderson of Roswell, NM. John had \nonly recently been assigned to the USS Arizona along with his twin \nbrother Jake when the Japanese attacked on December 7. Though burned \nhimself, John worked to rescue other survivors from the badly damaged \nand sinking Arizona until the small boat he and other servicemen were \nusing to pull drowning men from the water of the harbor was also sunk. \nTerribly, 1,177 sailors from the Arizona, including John's brother \nJake, did not survive.\n  John went on to serve 35 years in the Navy, marry his wife, Karolyn, \nhave three sons and later become the long time weatherman for KBIM-TV \nin Roswell. I would like to thank John for his brave service and would \nlike to personally honor all the New Mexicans like Jake Anderson who \nfought and lost their lives that day.\n  Pearl Harbor, of course, was just the beginning of several long years \nof war during which millions of Americans would answer the call of \nduty. I would like to take this opportunity to mention the service and \nsacrifice of two such groups of individuals.\n  One of these groups is the Navajo Code Talkers, many of whom were \nfrom my home State. The Code Talkers were marines who used their native \nlanguage to quickly transmit messages\n\n[[Page S15011]]\n\nacross the battlefields of the Pacific Theater and served in every \nMarine division from 1942 to the end of the war. Though the Japanese \nwere able to break many American codes during the war, they were never \nable to decipher the system used by the Code Talkers. Their \ncontribution to victory cannot be underestimated. There is no doubt \nthat their efforts saved countless American lives, and it has even been \nsaid that without the Code Talkers the battle of Iwo Jima could not \nhave been won.\n  I would also like to talk about the soldiers of the 200th and 515th \nCoastal Artillery units of the New Mexico National Guard, also known as \nthe New Mexico Brigade, who soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor \nplayed a prominent and heroic role in the fierce fighting in the \nPhilippines. For 4 months the men of the New Mexico Brigade helped hold \noff the Japanese only to be defeated by disease, starvation and a lack \nof ammunition. Sadly, the survivors of the Battle of Bataan from the \nNew Mexico Brigade were subjected to the horrors and atrocities of the \n65 mile ``Death March,'' as well as years of hardship and forced labor \nin Japanese prisoner of war camps. Tragically, of the 1,800 men of the \nNew Mexico Brigade more than 900 never returned home.\n  In closing, I hope New Mexicans will take a moment to honor the \nindividuals who fought so gallantly 66 years ago today as well as all \nthose who served throughout the Second World War, and remember those \nwho paid the ultimate price for our Nation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me first say how moved I am to be \non the Senate floor after the remarks of the very distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii commemorating this day. But I rise to discuss a different \nquestion, a question that involves the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  We will shortly consider making right the things that are wrong with \nthe so-called Protect America Act, a second-rate piece of legislation \npassed in a stampede in August at the behest of the Bush \nadministration. It is worth for a moment considering why making this \nright is so important.\n  President Bush pressed this legislation not only to establish how our \nGovernment can spy on foreign agents but how his administration can spy \non Americans. Make no mistake, the legislation we passed in August is \nsignificantly about spying on Americans--a business this administration \nshould not be allowed to get into except under the closest supervision.\n  We have a plain and tested device for keeping tabs on Americans. It \nis our Constitution. Our Constitution has as its most elemental \nprovision the separation of governmental powers into three separate \nbranches. When the Government feels it is necessary to spy on its own \ncitizens, each branch has a role. The executive branch executes the \nlaws and conducts surveillance. The legislative branch sets the \nboundaries that protect Americans from improper Government \nsurveillance. The judicial branch oversees whether the Government has \nfollowed the Constitution and the laws that protect U.S. citizens from \nviolations of their privacy and their civil rights.\n  It sounds basic, but even an elementary understanding of this balance \nof powers eludes the Bush administration. So now we have to repair this \nflawed and shoddy Protect America Act.\n  Why are we in Congress so concerned about this legislation? Why is it \nso vital that we energetically insert the role of Congress and the \ncourts when the Bush administration seeks to determine the rules under \nwhich it will spy on Americans? Because look what the Bush \nadministration does behind our backs when they think no one is looking.\n  For years, under the Bush administration, the Office of Legal Counsel \nwithin the Department of Justice has issued highly classified, secret \nlegal opinions related to surveillance. This is an administration that \nhates answering to an American court, that wants to grade its own \nexams, and OLC is the inside place the administration goes to get legal \nsupport for its spying program.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was given access \nto those secret opinions and spent hours poring over them. Sitting in \nthat secure room, as a lawyer, as a former U.S. attorney, legal counsel \nto Rhode Island's Governor, and State attorney general, I was \nincreasingly dismayed and amazed as I read on.\n  To give an example of what I read, I have gotten three legal \npropositions from these secret OLC opinions declassified. Here they \nare, as accurately as my note-taking could reproduce them from the \nclassified documents. Listen for yourself, Mr. President; I will read \nall three and then discuss each one.\n  One:\n\n       An Executive order cannot limit a President. There is no \n     constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new \n     Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms \n     of a previous Executive order. Rather than violate an \n     Executive order, the President has instead modified or waived \n     it.\n\n  No. 2:\n\n       The President, exercising his constitutional authority \n     under article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful \n     exercise of the President's authority under article II.\n\n  And 3:\n\n       The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal \n     determinations.\n\n  Let's start with No. 1. Bear in mind that the so-called Protect \nAmerica Act that was stampeded through this great body in August \nprovides no--zero--statutory protections for Americans traveling abroad \nfrom Government wiretapping--none if you are a businesswoman traveling \non business overseas; none if you are a father taking the kids on \nvacation to the Caribbean; none if you are visiting your aunts or \nuncles in Italy or Ireland; none even if you are a soldier of the \nUnited States of America in uniform serving overseas.\n  The Bush administration provided in that hastily passed law no \nstatutory restrictions on their ability to wiretap you at will, to tap \nyour cell phone, your e-mail--whatever--once you are outside the \nborders of the United States. The only restriction is an Executive \norder called 12333 which limits executive branch surveillance to \nAmericans whom the Attorney General determines to be agents of a \nforeign power. That is what the Executive order says.\n  But what does this administration say about Executive orders?\n\n       An Executive order cannot limit a President. There is no \n     constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new \n     Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms \n     of a previous Executive order. Rather than violate an \n     Executive order, the President has instead modified or waived \n     it.\n\n  ``Whenever [the President] wishes to depart from the terms of a \nprevious Executive order,'' he may do so because ``an Executive order \ncannot limit a President.'' And he does not even have to change the \nExecutive order or give notice that he is violating it because by \n``depart[ing] from the Executive order,'' the President ``has instead \nmodified or waived it.''\n  So unless Congress acts, here is what legally prevents this President \nfrom wiretapping Americans traveling abroad at will: nothing. Nothing. \nThat was among the most egregious flaws in the bill passed during the \nAugust stampede orchestrated by the Bush administration, and this OLC \nopinion shows why we need to correct it.\n\n  Here is No. 2:\n\n       The President, exercising his constitutional authority \n     under article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful \n     exercise of the President's authority under article II.\n\n  That is right, the President, according to the George W. Bush Office \nof Legal Counsel, has article II power to determine the scope of his \narticle II power. Never mind a little decision called Marbury v. \nMadison written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803 establishing the \nproposition that it is emphatically the province and the duty\n\n[[Page S15012]]\n\nof the judicial department to say what the law is.\n  Does this administration agree that it is emphatically the province \nand the duty of the judicial department to say what the President's \nauthority is under article II of the Constitution? No. It is the \nPresident, according to this Office of Legal Counsel, who decides the \nlimits of his own article II power. The question ``whether an action is \na lawful exercise of the President's authority under article II'' is to \nbe determined by the President's own minions ``exercising his \nconstitutional authority under article II.'' It really makes one \nwonder: Where do they get these people? You have to be smart, you have \nto be really bright to get a job within the Office of Legal Counsel. \nHow can people who are so smart be so misguided?\n  And then it gets worse. Remember point 3:\n\n       The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal \n     determinations.\n\n  Let that sink in a minute. ``The Department of Justice is bound by \nthe President's legal determinations.'' We are a nation of laws, not of \nmen. This Nation was founded in rejection of the royalist principle \nthat ``the king can do no wrong.'' Our Attorney General swears an oath \nto defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States. We are \nnot some banana republic in which the officials all have to kowtow to a \nsupreme leader.\n  Imagine this in another context. Imagine a general counsel to a major \nU.S. corporation telling his board of directors: In this company, the \ncounsel's office is bound by the legal determinations of the CEO.\n  The board ought to throw that lawyer out. That is malpractice and \nprobably even unethical.\n  Wherever you are, if you are watching this, do me a favor: The next \ntime you are in Washington, DC, take a taxi some evening to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. Stand outside. Look up at that building shining \nagainst the starry night. Look at the sign outside: The United States \nDepartment of Justice. Think of the heroes who have served there. Think \nof the battles fought. Think of the late nights, the brave decisions, \nthe hard work of advancing and protecting our democracy that has been \ndone in those halls. Think about how all that makes you feel.\n  Then think about this statement:\n\n       The Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal \n     determinations.\n\n  If you don't feel a difference from what you were feeling a moment \nago, well, I guess congratulations because there is probably a job for \nyou somewhere in the Bush administration. Consider the sad irony that \nthis theory was crafted in that very building by the George W. Bush \nOffice of Legal Counsel.\n  In a nutshell, these three Bush administration legal propositions \nboil down to this: One, I don't have to follow my own rules, and if I \nbreak them, I don't have to tell you that I am breaking them; two, I \nget to determine what my own powers are; and three, the Department of \nJustice doesn't tell me what the law is, I tell the Department of \nJustice what the law is.\n  When the Congress of the United States is willing to roll over for an \nunprincipled President, this is where you end up. We should not even be \nhaving this discussion, but here we are. I implore my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle: Reject these feverish legal theories. I \nunderstand political loyalty; trust me, I do. But let's also be loyal \nto this great institution we serve in the legislative branch of \nGovernment. Let us also be loyal to the Constitution we took an oath to \ndefend from enemies foreign and domestic. And let us be loyal to the \nAmerican people who live each day under that Constitution's principles \nand protections.\n  We simply cannot put the authority to wiretap Americans whenever they \nstep outside America's boundaries under the exclusive control and \nsupervision of the executive branch. We do not allow it when Americans \nare at home; we should not allow it when they travel abroad.\n  The principles of congressional legislation and oversight and of \njudicial approval and review are simple and longstanding, and Americans \ndeserve their protection wherever on God's green Earth they may travel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, I stood on the Senate floor and \nasked for emergency funding for the Nation's food banks. I asked for \nthat funding because there are massive shortages of food bank supplies, \nempty shelves, and those shortages place at risk children, the elderly, \nand working families, people who have lost jobs, people who have had a \nstring of bad luck, and families across this Nation.\n  I spoke yesterday of Norm, an elderly man in Cleveland, who, after \nspending his few dollars on rent, on utilities, and medicine, has $19 \nleft. He needs the Cleveland Food Bank. The Cleveland Food Bank, I \nwould add, was awarded the best food bank in the country last year, but \nit is running short, as are food banks everywhere in this country.\n  I spoke yesterday of Christian, who has trained to be a nurse's \nassistant, and who just gave birth. She is unable to find a job as a \nnurse's assistant, even though she is well trained to do that. She runs \nshort of food, and she relies on, as does Norm, neighborhood food \nprograms, such as the Cleveland Food Bank and other church groups in \ngreater Cleveland.\n  In too many cases there is no dinner on the table. In too many cases \nthere is no food at Christmas time. In too many cases there is just not \nenough food. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world. Yet we cannot \nfeed our own people. This is an emergency. This is an outrage.\n  Yesterday, I talked about emergency funding to overcome that \nshortage. We asked for $40 million until we pass the farm bill, which \nwill have some dollars in it to provide some supply for these food \nbanks. We found out that food banks are projecting they will run out of \nfood in February, when originally they thought it would last until \nJuly.\n  In case after case, food banks in Cleveland, in Columbus, in Toledo, \nand Cincinnati, food banks in the Chair's city of Baltimore, and food \nbanks all over this country are running out of food. Grocery stores are \ncontributing a little less this year, and the Government has not done \nits part.\n  Yesterday, I talked about some $40 million in funding to overcome \nthat shortage, and today I want to talk about how to pay for it. We can \npay for it through shared sacrifice. The budget for Congress includes \nfirewood for fireplaces in the Capitol, fireplaces, in most cases, that \ndon't get used. When children are hungry, we can give up fireplaces. We \ncan give up some travel and some new technology. We can make easy \nsacrifices to address a tragic need.\n  The budget for Federal agencies includes annual buying sprees to \nexhaust whatever is left in departmental budgets. When children are \nhungry, buying sprees are offensive. We can sacrifice. We can pay for \nemergency funding for food banks by putting our heads together and \nshaving some less necessary spending from our own budgets and that of \nFederal agencies whose oversight is our responsibility. I am asking \nthat we do that. Food banks need resources. We don't need firewood, we \ndon't need buying sprees, and we can do without some other things. We \nneed to help hungry people.\n  I am going to propose a package of cuts to pay for an emergency \nincrease in food bank funding. I hope every Member of this body \nsupports me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report the pending \nbusiness.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2419) to provide for the continuation of \n     agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin amendment No. 3500, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Dorgan/Grassley) amendment No. 3508 (to amendment \n     No. 3500), to strengthen payment limitations and direct the \n     savings to increased funding for certain programs.\n       Reid amendment No. 3509 (to amendment No. 3508), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3510 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 3500), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3511 (to amendment No. 3510), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry, with instructions to report back \n     forthwith, with Reid amendment No. 3512.\n       Reid amendment No. 3512 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry, with instructions), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3513 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to recommit), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3514 (to amendment No. 3513), to change \n     the enactment date.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that all \npending motions and amendments, except the substitute, be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it now, Mr. President, the farm bill is \nbefore us. There are no pending amendments, also, whatsoever?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Harkin substitute is pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what I mean. The substitute is there, but there \nare no other pending amendments to it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me say to the chairman that I am \nvery appreciative of the discussions and negotiations we have had \nongoing over the last several weeks. He and I have both been very \nfrustrated by the lack of activity on this farm bill. We know very well \nthat we have worked in a bipartisan way to craft a farm bill that is \ngoing to be a great benefit to farmers and ranchers across America over \nthe next 5 years. This is a critically important piece of legislation \nthat was passed out of the committee by a unanimous vote, with only one \nperson who was not there saying he would not have voted for it. That is \nsignificantly unusual. It is also unusual to complete the markup of a \nfarm bill in a day and a half, which we did. I credit the chairman's \nleadership for that and the fact that we were able to work in a strong \nbipartisan way to make sure we got a bill that is not exactly like any \nof us would want it if we were the sole authors of the bill, but that \nis the way it is supposed to work in this body.\n\n  I do truly want to thank Chairman Harkin and his staff. I see Mark \nHalverson sitting over there, who has worked very closely with Martha \nScott Poindexter on my staff to clear so many of these almost 300 \namendments that popped up over the last 4 weeks. Without the staff \ndoing the work they have done, we simply would not be where we are \ntoday.\n  I also wish to say to Senator Conrad that I appreciate very much his \nwork--again, in a very bipartisan way--to come together and make sure \nwe get relevant amendments. There are going to be some that are going \nto be irrelevant that may be considered, but, again, that is part of \nthe way this body works; and to the two leaders for their discussions, \ntheir negotiations in allowing us ultimately to get to the point where \nwe have now reached an agreement that we have 20 amendments offered by \nthe Democrats, 20 amendments offered by the Republicans, and over the \nnext several days we are going to debate these amendments, have votes \non them, and move ahead with the conference with the House on a farm \nbill that is desperately needed by our farmers and ranchers. I think at \nthe end of the day it is going to be a farm bill that will have a very \npositive influence on American agriculture.\n  I thank the chairman for his cooperative spirit and for the fact that \nwe have been able to come together with this farm bill now, get it to \nthe floor, now get it debated, and you and I are going to work very \nhard to make sure we get it done in short order. I look forward to a \ndiscussion of the amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me thank my friend and colleague and \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, first for starting the process. It \nwas under his leadership on the Agriculture Committee that a lot of \nfield hearings were held across the country in preparation for this \nfarm bill. Then, by dint of the elections last year, I then took over \nas chairman this year, and we worked very closely to continue the great \nprogress Senator Chambliss had made moving the ball forward. We had \nsome bumps along the way, obviously. I shared the frustration of my \nfriend over the last few weeks. But we came out of the committee with a \ngood bill, a good bipartisan bill.\n  It is a bill that really responded to agricultural needs around the \nNation and also responded to nutrition needs. A large part of this \nbill, over 50 percent of this bill goes for nutrition, food stamps, \nthings like that. We took some great strides in the committee to make \nsure we updated some of the exemptions, things like that, so people who \nare on food stamps, people who need that kind of help are not hurt by \ninflation over the past number of years and that sort of thing.\n  There are good provisions in this bill on energy, on conservation. I \nthink there is a good, strong safety net for all of our agricultural \nproducers across the country. Obviously, there is a lot in here for \nspecialty crops, kind of a new part of our bill this year, reaching out \nto get more people involved in our process here--specialty crops all \nacross the country.\n  There is a lot of good in this farm bill for everyone in this \ncountry. I never like to dwell on the past. We have had some problems \nover the last few weeks, but we are through that. I thank Senator \nChambliss and his staff for working with us to get to this point. I \nthink we have a manageable bill now, with 20 amendments on either side. \nI am hopeful that as we get amendments we will be able to get some \nreasonable time agreements. I have already spoken to some people about \nthat. Most of the people with amendments are agreeable to certain time \nlimits on their amendments. That, hopefully, will expedite matters \nalso.\n  We are here, and I hope we are going to start moving the bill. As we \nknow, there are no more votes today, but amendments can be offered and \nlaid down and debated today, and, of course, they will be in the queue \nfor voting when we get back here next Tuesday. If anyone has any \namendment, I suggest now might be the time to come forward, on either \nside, and talk either to Senator Chambliss or to me about getting in \nthe queue to offer those amendment also.\n  We have a very important bill. Hopefully, we can get it done. I \nremain hopeful that before the end of next\n\n[[Page S15014]]\n\nweek--I don't know, maybe that is a little optimistic, but I believe in \noptimism--perhaps by the end of next week we might actually bring this \nto a close and get to conference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after consultation with the ranking \nmember, Senator Chambliss, and because of the structure of this before, \nit was assumed that the Dorgan-Grassley or Grassley-Dorgan amendment \nwould be the first amendment. I am going to call up that amendment, but \nthen, under the agreement we have, we will be setting it aside for any \nother amendments that come up.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3695 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n (Purpose: To strengthen payment limitations and direct the savings to \n                increased funding for certain programs)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3695 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for Mr. Dorgan, for \n     himself and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3695.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of November 15, 2007, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Therefore, the pending amendment would be the Grassley-\nDorgan amendment, and I ask unanimous consent to set that aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see our distinguished leader here, \nSenator Durbin, but I know Senator Klobuchar has been waiting to offer \nher amendment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The Senator may go forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3819 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for critical Farm Bill programs and \n                        improve crop insurance)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside, and I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, Mr. McCain, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n     Sununu, proposes an amendment numbered 3819 to amendment No. \n     3500.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment, in essence, moves money \nfrom the overpayment of huge subsidies of crop insurance to McGovern-\nDole, a long-term bipartisan program this Congress has supported, and a \nfew other things I will outline in more detail on Tuesday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3810 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3810 which \nis at the desk. I will set it aside after I say a few words about it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar], for herself, \n     Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3810 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I first wish to acknowledge the great \nleadership of Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss on this farm bill. I \nam proud to be a member of the Agriculture Committee and to be involved \nin this forward-looking farm bill. I also wish to thank the many \nauthors we have on this amendment that I am going speak on today, \nincluding Senator Durbin and Senator Brown, both of whom were in here \nin the last few minutes.\n  This amendment includes some reasonable income eligibility limits for \nsubsidies under the farm bill. The focus of this amendment is to make \nsure the subsidy and the safety net in the farm bill go to the people \nwhom it will most help; that is, the family farmers of this country, \nnot to real estate developers in Florida or art collectors in San \nFrancisco. The focus is on family farmers throughout this country.\n  America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as \nan essential reform to help support rural communities and protect \nstruggling family farmers from the financial shock of volatile weather \nand equally volatile commodity prices. Almost 75 years later, the \nreason for maintaining that strong safety net still exists.\n  The 2002 farm bill has spurred rural development by allowing farmers \nin Minnesota and across the country to take risks to expand production. \nBecause of productivity gains and innovation, including advances in \nrenewable energy, the farm support programs in the 2002 farm bill are \nprojected to come in at $17 billion under budget.\n  So as we debate this current farm bill, as we will in the coming \ndays, it is important not to underestimate the value of a strong bill \nto our country, to agriculture, to the rural communities throughout the \nNation.\n  That is why, as a member of the Ag Committee, I strongly supported \nthis farm bill and voted for it. It includes an increased focus, as the \nchairman mentioned, on energy, including cellulosic-based ethanol, \ncontinued support for a strong safety net, permanent disaster relief, \nso important to our farmers, and additional funds for conservation and \nnutrition.\n  Of particular importance, the country should know we balanced our \nbudget in this bill, with every dollar of new spending fully offset. So \nthere is a lot of good for Minnesota and the rest of the country in \nthis farm bill.\n  There is, however, one critical area where I believe we can do some \nmore reform; that is, to make sure the urban millionaires do not pocket \nthe farm subsidies that are intended for our hard-working farmers. Here \nis a fact in my State. Minnesota is the sixth largest agricultural \nState in the Nation. Naturally, however, 60 farmers have collected more \nthan $1 million each under the 2002 farm bill. None of those farmers \nare in my State.\n  The top 20 business recipients in the country have each gotten more \nthan $3 million under this farm bill. Yet the average income of a \nfarmer in Minnesota, after expenses, is $54,000. But under the current \nsystem, a part-time farmer can have an income as high as $2.5 million \nfrom outside sources and still qualify for Federal farm benefits.\n  I do not believe we should be handing out payments to \nmultimillionaires, when these payments should be targeted to family \nfarmers. Big payments to big-city investors threaten to undermine \npublic support for the farm bill as a whole, even though people should \nknow the commodity programs are projected to be just under 15 percent \nof the total farm budget over the next 5 years.\n  A poster boy for what needs to be changed is Maurice Wilder, the \nFlorida-based developer who is the Nation's top recipient of farm \npayments--not conservation payments but commodity payments--for \nproperties in five States, even though his net worth is estimated to be \n$500 million. This man is not a farmer. He is independently wealthy. He \nis a real estate developer, and he should not be getting Government \nchecks. We have examples from all over the country of people who have \nbeen getting these checks, from David Letterman to Paul Allen.\n  But the problem doesn't stop with the extremely wealthy. Checks that \nare intended for farmers are being sent all over urban areas. Since \nenactment of the 2002 farm bill, $3.1 million in farm payments has gone \nto residents in the District of Columbia, $4.2 million to people living \nin Manhattan, and $1 million of taxpayer money under the farm bill of \n2002 has gone to Beverly Hills 90210. Last time I checked there wasn't \na lot of farmland in these communities. We can fix this problem and do \nbetter for our farmers by using the new farm bill to close loopholes, \ntighten payment limits, and enforce tougher income eligibility \nstandards.\n  Again, I am a strong supporter of this farm bill. I believe the 2002 \nfarm bill did some wonderful things for our country in terms of \nexpanding production and revitalizing rural communities. What we want \nto do is build on the 2002 farm bill, fix some things, and make sure we \ngo forward with a strong rural economy.\n  One thing was already fixed in the bill that came out of committee, \nand that is the three-entity rule. The current Senate and House--and \nthis has actually gone through the House floor--proposals eliminate the \nthree-entity rule. This will cut down abuse by applying payment limits \nstrictly to individuals and married couples and ending the practice of \ndividing farms into multiple corporations so they can multiply \npayments. Second, as already\n\n[[Page S15016]]\n\nmentioned by our chairman, the longstanding amendment proposed by \nSenators Dorgan and Grassley would limit annual payments under this \nbill. This amendment would also bring meaningful limits to the \nmarketing loan program and close enormous loopholes that allow millions \nof dollars to flow to individual recipients under the current law. I \nsupport the Dorgan-Grassley amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I believe a third kind of reform is also needed. Congress should act \nto prevent payments that are intended for hard-working family farmers \nfrom going to urban millionaires. We can do this by placing reasonable \nlimits on the incomes of people and businesses that participate in the \ncommodity program. Under current law, if you are not a full-time \nfarmer, meaning that less than 75 percent of your income comes from \nfarming, you are eligible to get commodity payments as long as your \nadjusted gross income is less than $2.5 million per year. This is part-\ntime farmers under current law.\n  Let's figure out what that means. You can live in a city, have a job \nas an investment banker, make $2 million a year, and still get \nGovernment checks if you own shares in a farm. If you are a full-time \nfarmer or farm corporation, meaning that more than 75 percent of your \nincome comes from farming, under current law there is absolutely no \nlimit on how much net profit you can have in a given year and still get \nfarm payments. What we are talking about is, expenses are actually \ndeducted for us to get to these numbers. Even with the expenses \ndeducted, you can make, for part-time farmers, $2.5 million per year, \nand there is no limit for full-time farmers, and you are still eligible \nfor these subsidies.\n  It also means mega farms that span entire counties can bring in \nuntold millions in revenue and still get these kinds of payments. This \nflies in the face of common sense. It is against the intent of Congress \nand, along with two other amendments I support--one that is already in \nthe bill, the Dorgan-Grassley amendment and this one--it will allow us \nto address these problems that have given rise to scandals that have \nalready provided ammunition to those who say we should not have a farm \nbill. I believe we must have a farm bill. I have been pushing for this. \nI am glad we finally reached agreement on a total number of amendments \nso we can actually move forward with this farm bill next week.\n  I am offering this amendment, along with Senators Durbin, Brown, and \nmany others, to place reasonable limits on the incomes of those who \nreceive farm payments. Here is how the amendment works. If you are a \nfull-time farmer, meaning that more than two-thirds of your income \ncomes from farming, you can participate in the farm program, and you \ncan get the subsidies, as long as your income after you deduct expenses \ndoes not exceed $750,000. If you are a part-time farmer or farm \ninvestor, and you have substantial sources of income off the farm, you \ncan participate in farm programs if your income does not exceed \n$250,000. It is that simple.\n  I will note it is somewhat similar to some of the reforms the House \nenacted off the floor in their bill. Their amendment puts it at $1 \nmillion for a full-time farmer and then $500,000 of income for a part-\ntime farmer. Right now the bill that came out of the Senate committee \nplaces no limits on the income of full-time farmers, and then places a \nlimit on a part-time farmer at $750,000. What we are doing is trying to \nput the limits at $750,000 for a full-time farmer and $250,000 for a \npart-time farmer. This is better than the original proposal by the \nadministration which sort of lumped part-time and full-time farmers \ntogether. This makes more sense, having talked to farmers in my State \nand across the country.\n  Some of my colleagues have said $750,000 is too low; that some \nfarmers have a high cost of production and they need a higher income. \nAgain, I remind my colleagues the income limit is applied after your \nfarm expenses are deducted, including all your labor, your equipment, \nyour fuel, and your fertilizer. We are talking about how much profit \nyou have made at the end of the year.\n  If you own a farm that has netted $1 million in a single year after \nall your expenses are paid, I salute you. That is wonderful. There is \nnothing wrong with that. I would love it if every farmer in Minnesota \nhad $1 million in the bank at the end of the year. But if they did, \nthis amendment says they can't get the subsidy. But if you have \nreceived $750,000 in income, if you are a full-time farmer--$250,000 if \nyou are part time--then you would be eligible.\n  Some of my colleagues have said the $750,000 limit on part-time \nfarmers and nonfarmers is too low. If you live in the city and you own \nshares in a farm and you have a substantial source of income outside of \nfarming that puts you over $250,000 a year, that is great for you. That \nis a good thing. Lots of Americans would love to be in that position \nand have that problem. But they do not necessarily want to provide \ntheir tax dollars to give subsidies for these people who are living in \nBeverly Hills 90210 or New York and simply have investments. Vast \nAmericans don't believe that is where farm subsidies should be going. \nThey should be going to family farmers who make their income off \nfarming, who are facing volatile weather and volatile prices that could \nbasically put them under. We don't want to have that happen. Not only \nfor the economy but also for our national security, we must have \nfarming and we must have a strong agricultural sector.\n\n  In conclusion, the intent of this amendment is to strengthen the farm \nbill. All Americans have a vital stake in the fortunes of our farms and \nrural communities. Agriculture remains central to our Nation's economy, \nespecially our prosperity in the global marketplace. That is why I \nsupport this farm bill, a basically national security bill. I intend to \nsupport it. I supported it out of committee, and I intend to support \nthis legislation when it comes to a vote.\n  But it is not enough to have the support of just farm State Senators. \nI believe it is important to have the support of the entire country. We \nneed this kind of reform because we need to have support from the \nentire country if we want to pass this bill. Inertia may be the most \npowerful force in the political universe, but after 75 years, the best \ninterests of America's rural economy demand that we correct the abuses \nof the past so we can move forward to ensure a strong safety net for \nour hard-working farmers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be laid aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to respond quickly to the \nSenator from Minnesota who has filed one of two amendments to the issue \nof payment limits in this bill. It is important we understand the \nhistory of payment limits. This has always been a controversial issue \nin every farm bill. This is my third farm bill, and certainly we had \nsignificant reform in the 2002 farm bill over the 1996 farm bill. Here \nwe are again with the same argument being presented, that farmers ought \nnot to be entitled to significant payments from the Federal Government \nin very tough times when prices are low or yields are low, which is \nabsolutely the direct intention of a farm bill.\n  My friend from Minnesota referred to two things I want to agree with. \nThe first is, the 2002 farm bill spent approximately $17 billion less \nthrough the first 5 years than what was originally projected. The \nreason there was less money spent than was projected by the pundits in \n2002 is the fact that the 2002 farm bill was market oriented. We \nprovided farmers and ranchers with tools through utilizing their credit \nmeasures, as well as crop insurance measures, as well as other \nmarketing tools that were incorporated into the 2002 farm bill that \ncaused prices to not necessarily rise, but when supply rose, demand was \nthere to meet that supply. Therefore, the ultimate amount of money \ncoming from Washington into the hands of farmers and ranchers was $17 \nbillion over 5 years less than what was projected.\n  How does that impact payment limits? It has a direct impact on the \npayment limit issue because that simply is a part of the reason that an \nadditional amount of money within that $17 million was not spent. We \nmade significant reforms in the 2002 farm bill to ensure, with every \nprecaution we could\n\n[[Page S15017]]\n\npossibly take, that payments going from Washington to any State in the \nUnion went into the pockets of farmers. We did everything we could to \nensure that. But in spite of trying to do that, there were abuses and I \nacknowledge that. There are always going to be abuses. This doesn't \napply to just farm programs. It unfortunately applies to about every \nFederal program.\n  I see my friend from Arkansas on the Senate floor. She and I have \nworked diligently over the last several months to try to make \nadditional reforms to the payment limit issue from the 2002 farm bill \ninto this farm bill. Once again, we have made significant reforms. We \nhave reduced that AGI limit down to $1 million in 2009 and $750,000 for \neach year after that. So somebody who is a hobby farmer who has a high \nincome that, in our opinion, does not deserve payments is not going to \nget those payments. Somebody who gets dirt under their fingernails and, \nfrankly, if they make more than $750,000 a year, it means they have \nworked hard as a farmer to generate that kind of income on an \noperation. I assure you, if they make $750,000 this year, they could \nlose every bit of that next year.\n  So to say we ought to take a farmer who makes $750,000 in 1 year, \nwhere he has gambled all of his life's savings to invest in his crop, \nwhich undoubtedly would have been millions and millions of dollars for \nhim to generate that kind of income, that we are going to strip him of \nany entitlement to payments in the next year, when he may lose \neverything he has saved up all of his life, I don't think is looking \nout for the best interests of farmers and ranchers from an overall \nstandpoint.\n  We did make changes in the bill this time on payment limits. We \nreduced the $360,000 cap down to $100,000. We eliminated the three-\nentity rule. If you had told me 10 years ago that in 2007 we were going \nto be eliminating the three-entity rule in the payment limit provision, \nI would have told you that you were as crazy. If you told me that 5 \nyears ago, I would have said say there is no way we would eliminate the \nthree-entity rule. That has kind of been a standard under the payment \nlimit provision. But we have decided it is in the best interest of \nagriculture that it be eliminated.\n  We worked very hard to make sure we try to be fair to farmers and try \nto encourage family farmers to continue. The main reason we have always \nhad the three-entity rule is to allow for the children of farmers to \nbegin operating as farmers without having to worry about the \nsignificant capital investment that their parents have had to make over \nthe years because they simply cannot do it. A young farmer simply \ncannot make that investment.\n  Well, we have eliminated that three-entity rule that has been very \nadvantageous to young farmers. We are replacing it with some other \nmeasures that will allow young farmers to get into the business with \ntheir parents and come back to that family farm, which I think all of \nus would like to encourage.\n  My family happens to be the beneficiary of that exact situation--not \nmy immediate family but my son-in-law. I am very excited about the fact \nthat he is back in his family farming operation.\n  We did add a $2.5 million AGI test to the 2002 farm bill in response \nto media criticism that high-income individuals were receiving \nconservation and commodity program payments. We sought to ensure that \nbenefits were denied to wealthy individuals who did not rely on farming \nfor their livelihood but that they remain available to farmers and \nranchers so long as--and I emphasize this: so long as--75 percent of \ntheir income is derived from farming, ranching, or forestry. In the \nbill reported out by the Senate Agriculture Committee, there is a \nprovision that reduces the income level for determining program \neligibility by 70 percent over a period of 2 years. By 2010, if income \nexceeds $750,000--down from the current level of $2.5 million--the \nindividual is not eligible for payments unless two-thirds of that \nindividual's income is derived from farming, ranching, or forestry.\n  Through a deliberate and balanced approach, the Agriculture Committee \nbrought reform to the AGI means test by further targeting program \nbenefits to those individuals who depend on farming for their \nlivelihood. Even though the committee has approached this matter with \ncaution, there are simply no reliable statistics that determine the \nactual impact of the new AGI level.\n  Further modifications of the AGI means test beyond those approved by \nthe committee would be risky and very disruptive to the American \nfarmer. Specific concerns with an even more restrictive AGI means test \nwould include the following:\n  An overly restrictive AGI ceiling disregards the financial reality of \ncommercially viable farms. The Senator from Minnesota mentioned that \nAGI is basically the net profit, that it covers all payments for fuel \nand nitrogen and equipment. That does cover the cost of fuel and \nnitrogen and all the labor and all the other input costs. But out of \nAGI no equipment payments are covered, no land payments are covered, no \ninterest payments are covered, no payments for the purchase of any \nadditional real estate are covered.\n  So $750,000 is a lot of money--there is no question about it--but \nhere you have an individual who has invested millions of dollars into \ntheir farming operation, who has generated $750,000 of AGI, and without \nlooking at the books of that individual, I can tell you from my almost \n40 years of experience in agriculture that individual has either a \ncotton picker that costs $250,000 they have to pay for, a corn combine \nthat costs $200,000 they have to pay for, a couple of tractors that \nprobably cost in the range of $100,000 they have to pay for. They have \nland rent--well, rent would be deducted. They have land payments that \nhave to be made. So to say that somebody who has that kind of income \njust ought to be severely penalized because they are a big farmer is \nnot the way farm bills have ever operated, and I do not think it is the \nway this farm bill needs to operate. Do we need to make sure farm \npayments go the farmers? You bet we do. We are doing everything we can \nto see if we cannot make sure that happens.\n  Secondly, a problem with the AGI test is that if the exclusion for \npeople who depend on farming and ranching is ended, then it indicates \nthat the purpose behind the means test has changed from excluding \nmillionaires who happen to own a farm to specifically targeting farmers \nand ranchers. Thirdly, an unreasonable AGI means test creates \nuncertainty for growers and their lenders by creating a ping-pong \neffect of being eligible 1 year and being ineligible the next, making \nit difficult or impossible for lenders to measure with any degree of \ncertainty the future cash flow of thousands of farm and ranch families \nin order to make both short- and long-term lending decisions.\n  I have already discussed that in some detail, and I will not go into \nthat any further, but that is a critical aspect of this when you have \nfolks who are gambling all of their life savings that the Good Lord is \ngoing to provide them with enough rain and that the prices are going to \nbe there at the end of the day to be able to justify the annual \ninvestment they have just made.\n  Again, proponents of an AGI means test state: Of all schedule F \nfilers, only 1.2 percent--or 25,000--had an AGI of $200,000 or more and \nreceived farm program payments. This statistic fails to reflect the \nfact that most operations that could be most directly impacted by the \nAGI means test do not file schedule F tax returns. Therefore, this \nstatistic seriously underestimates the number of producers and, perhaps \nmore importantly, the share of acres or production that would be left \nunprotected. Furthermore, those percentages are deceptive because the \npopulation of schedule F filers is not limited to producers currently \neligible for title I program benefits.\n\n  Next, building on the information provided by the Internal Revenue \nService, a recent study by USDA's Economic Research Service used survey \ndata to estimate the impact of the AGI means test on producers \norganized as partnerships and corporations. The study estimates that \n2.5 percent of farm partnerships and 9.7 percent of farm corporations \ncould be subject to the proposed cap. Furthermore, the ERS estimates \nthat 9.3 percent and 8.5 percent of cotton and rice farms, \nrespectively, would exceed the AGI limit. It is important to note that \nthese impacts are estimates based on a small sample of producers and \nnot based on actual IRS data.\n\n[[Page S15018]]\n\n  An unreasonable AGI means test would make U.S. farm policy \nunpredictable, inequitable, and punitive for thousands of American farm \nand ranch families, especially tenant and beginning farmers and \nranchers, as well as lenders, landowners, Main Street businesses, and \nrural communities.\n  One statistic you will hear me talk about again during the course of \nthis debate comes from a study done by the College of Agriculture in my \nhome State at the University of Georgia, where, according to the \nresearch recently produced in a study, it was determined that $1.05 in \ntaxes--taxes--is returned to the Federal Government for every $1 of \nagricultural farm payments that have been made across America. That is \na pretty significant statistic when you think about what happens on \nMain Street rural America as a result of farm payments that are made.\n  An overly restrictive AGI rule would make it difficult or impossible \nfor farm and ranch families to lease land where their eligibility for \nany 1 year may be in doubt and force a change to cash rent, shifting \nall risk to the tenant as opposed to a share rent that allows the \nlandlord to share in the production risks. If a landlord wants to help \nout a young farmer, under this amendment they simply would not be able \nto do so because they are not going to take that risk. They would be \nfoolish to take that risk.\n  Further tightening of the AGI rule severely inhibits ordinary \ncommercial activity involving the sale of land and other assets, which \nwould jeopardize benefit eligibility. AGI rules clamp down on spouses \nwho take off-farm jobs to help provide family income, especially in \nyears where little or no take-home pay is generated from the farm or \nranch, to provide health insurance for the family, or simply to \ncontinue a profession, such as teaching.\n  Lastly, estimates of the impacts of an AGI means test focus on the \npercentage of producers who will be affected. However, these estimates \ndo not address the true impact of the means test because they fail to \naddress the percentage of acres or production that will be affected. \nFor example, the Census of Agriculture indicates that the largest 10 \npercent of cotton and rice producers account for 30 percent to 50 \npercent of cotton and rice production in many States.\n  I would dare say, the statistic, again, you will hear as we continue \nfurther debate on this amendment--as well as the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment--is that about 80 percent of production agriculture in the \nUnited States is generated by approximately 20 percent of America's \nfarmers and ranchers. So who should get the biggest benefit of \nagricultural programs that are available to farmers? Is it the 20 \npercent that take the least risk, have the least chance of suffering a \nsignificant loss, or should it be those farmers who are willing to take \nthe risk, invest all of their life savings on an annual basis in their \noperation, with the idea they will have that safety net underneath \ntheir operation in the event they suffer a disaster as a result of \nweather, a disaster as a result of price, or a disaster as a result of \ninsect infestation or some other disease infestation that might occur?\n  So this amendment simply is not realistic when it comes to American \nagriculture production for either a small farmer or a large farmer \nbecause if you take an AGI test and you look at how much money that \nfarmer--be it a small farmer or large farmer--has to pay for land they \nhope they will own one day, for equipment, and the other deductions \nthat have to come out of that AGI, all of a sudden there is an entirely \ndifferent picture out there that is actual and is not imagined.\n  So I am opposed to this amendment. At the proper time, I am sure we \nwill talk more about it. We will look forward to additional debate and \nfor an ultimate vote on this amendment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, if I could briefly respond to Senator \nChambliss. I see my colleague from Idaho is here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as Senator Chambliss said, we will be \ndiscussing this more in the week to come. I think Senator Chambliss and \nI agree that the last farm bill was successful for our country. People \ndo not often realize when you read some of these reports in the paper \nthat it came in $17 billion under budget. That money went back to the \nGovernment.\n  Also, we had a lot of success with that bill. I do not think that \nsuccess stemmed from the fact that some of the scandals were occurring, \nwith a million dollars going to Beverly Hills 90210 and some of these \nother places.\n  I appreciate the efforts we have made in the committee toward reform. \nAs Senator Chambliss mentioned, getting rid of the three-entity rule \nwas a very important step, also making some movement on the part-time \nfarmers. To go to $750,000 for the income limit for part-time farmers \nis a very important step. What I am trying to do with this amendment, \nand my colleagues who support it are trying to do, is simply take a \nstep further because we believe this money should be more targeted to \nfamily farmers.\n  Mr. President, as you know, as we discussed, this amendment does \nexclude expenses. When you are looking at the number $750,000 for full-\ntime farmers, we are talking there about profit. Even for a large farm, \ndeducting all their expenses, $750,000 would be a very good year. So I \nbelieve if you look at this as a whole, people have to understand we \nare talking about profits and not expenses. The same with the part-time \nfarmers. The definitions we use in this bill are similar to the ones \nthat, in fact, the committee used to define expenses. So if it is good \nenough to define expenses for an agreed-upon committee standard at \n$750,000 for part-time farmers, then I believe if you look at going \ndown to $250,000 in profits for part time, $750,000 for full time, the \nexpense definition should be the same.\n\n  I also wanted to respond to the remarks about the USDA study on the \nAGI limits. My colleagues should understand that was based on the \nadministration's proposal--that study, the President's proposal--which \nactually put part-time and full-time farmers at the same number, which \nwas $200,000. Clearly, we have worked with our farmers, talked to them \nacross the country. This amendment is different. It differentiates \nbetween the part-time farmer and the full-time farmer, understanding \nthat they are in different positions. I would also note the USDA study \nfound no regional bias in those who would be affected by this AGI \nlimit.\n  So I believe as we go forward we have to keep in mind that those of \nus who support this amendment from States such as Minnesota and \nIllinois support a strong farm bill. We believe we have to have a \nstrong safety net for our farmers, but the money shouldn't be going to \nBeverly Hills 90210 and it shouldn't be going to art collectors in San \nFrancisco and it shouldn't be going to investment bankers in New York \nor to real estate developers in Florida. It should be targeted in a \nreasonable way to those who actually farm and to those part-time \nfarmers who make a reasonable income, not to people who are making $1 \nmillion, $2 million, $3 million, $4 million a year. That is what this \nis about: making sure the safety net is there for those who need it.\n  By the way, if you have a large farm that has a bad year, and your \nprofits go down, they could well qualify for the subsidies under that \nscenario. That is what we are talking about.\n  I wish to also add that the House bill that came off the House Floor \ndoes have some income limits. It has $1 million for a full-time farmer, \n$500,000 for a part-time farmer. We have no income limits for a full-\ntime farmer in the existing Senate bill--no income limits at all. For a \npart-time farmer, our limits at $750,000 are significantly higher than \nthe House bill.\n  So what my colleagues and I are trying to do with this bill is to get \nit in line so that it shows some actual reform of income limits--\nslightly lower than the House but still in the ballpark--so that we are \nactually doing some reform and not just giving lip service to it.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss and the \nreforms we have made so far. I think we need to go a step further so we \ntarget the money on those family farmers and not urban \nmultimillionaires.\n  Thank you very, Mr. President. I look forward to this debate as we go \nforward.\n\n[[Page S15019]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, does the Ranking Republican of the \nAgriculture Committee want to introduce an amendment on this side \nbefore I speak? I understand he has an amendment he would like to \nintroduce and set aside before I speak.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3711 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  On behalf of Senator Lugar, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3711.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3711.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, November 15, \n2007, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate have been waiting \nnow for well over a month for this document, S. 2302, to come to the \nfloor and begin what is a right and responsible approach toward \nlegislating: offering it up to amendments, allowing Senators to work \ntheir will under the rules of the Senate, and to complete it on time. \nThe Democratic leader thought he could short-circuit that, that he \ncould what we call ``load up the tree'' and not allow these kinds of \namendments, only to find out in the end that wasn't about to happen; \nthat both Democrats and Republicans alike would not allow the rules of \nthe Senate to be thwarted and to deny the responsibility of each and \nevery Senator, if they choose, to offer an amendment.\n\n  Later on in the course of this debate next week, I and Senator \nDomenici and Senator Thune will be offering an amendment that relates \nto RFS--renewable fuels standard. It is with that in mind that I come \nto the floor today to talk about a farm bill in a substantially \ndifferent context.\n  We believe, and we have always felt, that agricultural policy was \ncritical for America--for American farmers, yes, but for America's \nconsumers of food and food products, most importantly.\n  There is no doubt the average consumer in America today spends less \non high quality food than any other consumer in the world. America's \nfood supermarkets are full of food. There are no shortages. There is \ngreat abundance. There is phenomenal variety. Without question, our \nfood supply is the safest in the world. I believe, in large part, that \nis as a result of a combination of two things happening: the phenomenal \ncapability of America's free and independent farmers, as well as a \ngovernment that has been consistently willing, down through the \ndecades, down through the Depression and the droughts and the \nhurricanes and the hail storms and all of that, to work with its \nfarmers to ensure that they could stay on the land and produce. But \nrarely in the course of all of these decades of farm policy have we \nthought in the context that we are beginning to think today, which is \nthat America's farmers can become, or are becoming, one of America's \nlargest suppliers of energy. It is not a new phenomenon; it is a \nrapidly growing diversity in the American agricultural portfolio that \nis doing what we have wanted done for a long time, but simply because \nof a combination of program and price in the market didn't see happen.\n  So for a few moments this afternoon I would like to talk about the \nfarm bill but in the context of energy and energy supply. Farmers, we \nhave always believed, and know, if you have been one--and I have--are \nlarge consumers of energy. It takes a lot of diesel to plow a field, to \nrun a combine, to run a corn dryer. It takes a lot of natural gas to \nproduce nitrogen and phosphates and all of the necessary supplies and \ninput costs that the Senator from Georgia was speaking to and about a \nfew moments ago. America's agricultural producers are very large \nconsumers of energy. But it has only been in the last decade that they \nhave begun to become large consumer producers of energy. As that has \nhappened and as we have changed and shifted policy in this country to \nincentivize and reward that production, we have watched that production \ngrow very rapidly. We are now producing around 8 billion gallons of \nethanol annually.\n  We encouraged it in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, and America's farmers \nwent to the task of building the ethanol distilleries and beginning to \nsupply the market as we allowed ethanol to enter the market at ever-\nhigher volumes.\n  Now, an old farmer told me not long ago: You know, this is nothing \nnew for American agriculture. Before we had tractors, farmers supplied \nall of their fuel for their farming. I hadn't put it in that context. I \ngrew up on a farm and a ranch where one side of a barn once housed--I \nam talking a horse farm--once housed teams of horses that pulled the \nplow, that pulled the harvesters, and did all of that, and it was \nenergy from our farm that fed the horse that produced the energy of the \nhorse. We were not importers of energy to our farm. We were producers \nof energy. But that was 90 years ago. Then, American farming changed \ndramatically, and we became increasingly more productive. We began \nproducing our own energy, and we started consuming it from outside \nsources, and it became gasoline and diesel. It isn't that we will see a \nreversal, but we are seeing a phenomenal new opportunity of production, \nand that is in combination a result of farm policy. This bill is a good \nfarm bill, and the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Iowa need \nto be congratulated for the cooperative effort in which they have \nworked to produce it. It will be, if you will, in part, one of the \ndirectives of American agriculture for the next 5 years, when it is \npassed.\n  What is important now is to try to look down the road and talk about \na role for America that we must increasingly play if we are going to \ncontinue to be the strong power we are for ourselves and our citizens, \nbut also for the world. What has happened from that time when horses \nonce pulled the plow until now with that big tractor out there with \nhundreds of horses under the hood, if you will, pulling multiple plows, \nis that we began to become a nation of energy importers. Since I have \nbeen in Congress over the last 27 years, we went from 30 percent to 40 \npercent to 50 percent to 60 percent dependent on foreign countries \nproducing our energy for us. I did say countries. I didn't say \ncompanies because the bulk of the oil in the world is owned by \ngovernments, not companies, and almost every one of those governments \ntoday is less than concerned and, in many instances, hostile to \nAmerica.\n  So it seems only fitting to me that as we shape public policy in this \ncountry, we do so in a way that begins to move America toward energy \nindependence. The American farmer, more than ever before, can become \nthat producer of energy and help in that equation of energy \nindependence in a way that even a decade ago we didn't think possible \nat all. With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the \nexpansion of entry of ethanol into the market, we saw that market begin \nto take off and we saw production of ethanol begin to take off. We saw \nthe distortion that always occurs in a market when a new demand begins \nto occur for a commodity that isn't overly abundant. In that case, it \nwas corn, and we saw our dairy farmers and our feeders of beef cattle \nand hog farmers begin to be concerned about the high price and the high \ncost of that import because corn had been shifted from the feedlot to \nthe distillery to produce ethanol. We are continuing to encourage that.\n  One of the things we will do with a renewable fuels standard in the \nfarm bill is begin to shift that equation to stabilize the use of the \ninputs to produce ethanol. Right now, ethanol is produced by corn \nalmost exclusively in this country, and many of us believe with the new \nscience that is coming, with the new loans and guarantees that\n\n[[Page S15020]]\n\nare coming out of the Energy Department because of the Energy Policy \nAct we passed in 2005, we will begin to see a shift toward a \ncombination of ethanol fuels, both corn-based and cellulosic-based. \nCellulose, fiber, not only could it be the grain of the corn itself \nproducing, but it could become the ear of the corn and the stock of the \ncorn and grasses and other kinds of fibers where cellulose is dominant \nbut could become a major producer.\n  In the Energy Act the Senate passed this year that went to the \nHouse--and the House largely destroyed it by trying to use it as a \ntaxing mechanism more than a production mechanism--we had placed in it \na renewable fuels standard that did the combination of things I am \ntalking about. We said we could take corn up to about 15 billion \ngallons a year, and we could take cellulose-produced ethanol up to \nabout 15 billion gallons a year by the year 2020, and by the year 2022 \nwe would add another 6 billion gallons of cellulose-based ethanol as \nthat science, as that technology began to be increasingly more \nefficient and refined.\n  Here is a reason why we would want to do that. Right now, corn-based \nethanol only reduces the output of CO2 into the environment \nby about 19 percent, compared with conventional fossil fuel. It is a \nhelp, but it is not where we want to be if we want a clean world out \ninto the future. I know a lot of farmers and I have always said in my \nlife that farmers are probably the finest environmentalists in the \nworld because they are phenomenal stewards of the land, and they want \nto make sure the land is viable and the water around it is sustained. \nThey want to produce a better quality product.\n  What we are suggesting is that we increasingly shift the equation in \nAmerica agriculture, in its participation, in the production of energy, \nto make us more energy independent and help us find new and cleaner \nsources. In the end, when we shift this production portfolio of ethanol \nfrom corn-based to cellulosic, in the outyears--25 or 30 years out--\ncellulosic-based ethanol fuel will be 86 percent cleaner. That is what \nwe want. That is what we ought to ask for.\n  That is why, for the first time, at least in my time in the Congress, \nAmerica's farm bill, America's agricultural policy, is, in part, an \nenergy policy because agriculture is looking at not only its input \ncosts of energy but its opportunity to produce energy. There are a lot \nof other things I could talk about as it relates to taking biomass and \nanimal waste and converting them into energy. All of that is starting \nto happen. But the big production--the production that makes the \ndifference, the production that makes America and America's energy \nconsumers more independent from a Venezuela or from the Mideast--is \nthis right here: ethanol, both corn-based and cellulosic. That is what \nwe are about. That is what we have to be about as a country.\n  There is every reason for the American consumer to say: Why can't we \nbe energy independent? We should be. But our policies have not taken us \nthere. In part, it is because I think we didn't think we could get \nthere but largely because there was all kinds of bias out there in the \nwhole energy arena. The bias is quite obvious. We all like big cars, we \nlike our SUVs, and we all like what we like--until we cannot afford \nliking them anymore because the cost of feeding them has gone up \ndramatically. That has helped us a little bit to develop changes.\n  For the first time this year, I introduced a bill, with Senator \nDorgan, to have mandatory CAFE standards. The auto industry was quite \nupset with me. I have always defended them not changing that standard. \nI have been here 27 years and we have not changed the standard in 27 \nyears and they have not changed. I wish to change that standard and \nforce the American marketplace and the American producer to look at \nwhat can happen if they become more realistic in auto consumption \nefficiency. Oh, what a difference a day makes when a car gets another \nmile or two to the gallon nationwide in the consumption of oil. So it \nis a balancing part, a total picture, the big portfolio of production.\n  I will be back to the floor all during 2008 talking about energy \nindependence, talking about drilling offshore, talking about ethanol, \ncellulosic and corn-based ethanol, talking about all the kinds of \nthings America must do to get independent of foreign sources of energy \nand to get clean. My children, who are all adults now and are pretty \nconservative folks, say: Dad, why can't we produce clean energy? Why \ncan't we be energy independent? Why are we allowing a dictator in \nVenezuela to jerk us around?\n  What is wrong with this great country that we cannot do for ourselves \nwhat we have always done for ourselves--stood up and be counted and be \nindependent and strong, and we can. America's farmers now, for the \nfirst time, have a phenomenal role to play beyond putting food on the \nconsumers' shelves, which they have done so beautifully for 200 years. \nNow they have a role to play of putting fuel in the fuel tank. We ought \nto encourage that in every way but balancing the policy, as I think \nthis final bill will do, to make sure we don't distort the markets, \nthat we allow them to grow responsibly, that we allow them to work \ntheir way into a 15-billion-gallon-a-year production of corn-based \nethanol and, by 2026, a 15- to 20-billion-gallon-a-year production of \ncellulosic-based ethanol. It is doable. We know how to do it. We are \nputting programs into place to promote it and advance it.\n  America's auto fleet will adjust to it, and America will be a \nstronger Nation. But more importantly, it will be an independent Nation \nfrom the small countries who have, underneath their geologic \nstrictures, large bodies of oil they now see as tools for diplomacy, \ntools to shape a world, and tools to control this great country called \nAmerica.\n  I will be back next week, along with my colleagues, to make new \nchanges in the farm bill. S. 2302 is a good work product. I am pleased \nthat finally the majority leader of the Senate has said: OK, put it on \nthe floor and let it work its will. By the end of next week, we will \nhave a farm bill. It is about a month late. That could have happened a \nmonth ago. It will happen now. I guess patience counts. Many of us have \nbeen patient. America's farmers need a new farm bill, and I believe the \nSenate Agriculture Committee has done a worthy job in producing it.\n  The RFS that was included in the Senate passed Energy bill this \nsummer, and that was similarly filed as an amendment to the farm bill, \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil and reduces our carbon footprint, \nby emphasizing the importance of developing cellulosic biofuels. The \nRFS is, by definition a clean fuel standard, and the House has offered \nsome additional language which endorses this low carbon fuel approach. \nThis week in the Environment Committee we marked up a climate bill that \nseeks to regulate fuels with a cap on all emissions, including \ntransportation. At the mark-up, Senator Alexander offered an amendment \nthat is now layed on top of having fuels already covered under a ``cap \nand trade'' program by subjecting them also to a low carbon fuels \nstandard. I and other members of the minority strongly opposed this \namendment because it was offered in addition to the cap-and-trade, \nrather than as a substitute, which would have made much more sense, so \nas not to double-regulate the industry. In addition, however, and most \nimportantly it also conflicts and overlaps with what we are now doing \nas part of the Energy bill and the farm bill as it relates the Senate \nRFS language, and certainly raises serious questions of jurisdiction. \nSenator Alexander indicates that he supports a sector approach, as do \nI, and I hope we will be able to move in this direction together.\n  Trading carbon credits between transportation sector fuels and other \nindustry sectors is unprecedented and could lead to high fuel price \nvolatility, supply issues including possible disruptions, and a level \nof market uncertainty that could discourage critically needed \ninvestment in new and innovative technologies. The EU-ETS has not \nincluded transportation fuels in its cap-and-trade program for \nstationary sources for this very reason. The U.S. transportation and \nelectric power sectors are subject to very different national and \ninternational market forces and forms of regulation. Mixing these two \ndissimilar markets under a common cap can lead to unpredictable and \npotentially intractable conflicts in how each market will respond to \nthis untested economic combination.\n\n[[Page S15021]]\n\n  Studies conducted by the Energy Information Agency and the University \nof California on economy-wide cap-and-trade programs show that carbon \nreductions are less cost-effective in the transportation sector as \ncompared to other industry sectors. Mixing transportation fuels with \nother fossil fuels under a common cap simply raises the cost of \ntransportation fuels without a guarantee of significantly decreasing \ntheir carbon emissions, at least until much more cost-effective options \nhave been exhausted for reducing emissions in other sectors. Studies by \nEIA indicate that this will generally not occur until after 2030.\n  There is a better approach for technology development for advanced \ntransportation fuels. Technology development is driving a separate \nlower carbon transportation fuel standard rule that is being developed \nby the administration and expected to be proposed later this year. The \nbill should have a separate approach for transportation fuels that \nrecognizes the confluence of these policies to ensure this sector is \nnot subject to overlapping or conflicting requirements.\n  I am concerned that the fuels amendment offered by Senator Alexander \nduring committee markup conflicts with provisions regarding low carbon \nfuels and the renewable fuels standard that are already included in the \nEnergy bill now being considered by the House and Senate. Cellulosic \nethanol is key and will substantially reduce the carbon content of \nfuels and this is included in the Renewable Fuels provisions. The \nAlexander amendment overlaps, and is conflicting and also raises \nquestions regarding fuels jurisdiction with the Senate Energy \nCommittee. In addition, the amendment develops a low carbon fuel \nstandard that is fundamentally flawed and well beyond the bounds of \ncurrent technology and science. Developing and advancing technology, \nnot mandating a ``wish list,'' is a superior approach to meeting the \nchallenges of providing affordable and clean fuels that American \nconsumers need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. What is the present business of the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chambliss amendment to the \nHarkin substitute is the pending business.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am very proud to come to the floor \nagain to discuss and debate and talk about something that is critically \nimportant to this country, the working families of this country, and to \nthe well-being of the entire world, frankly, and that is the Food and \nEnergy Security Act of 2007.\n  Much has already been said, and I know that as we progress through \nthe rest of this week and next week, there will be much discussion \nabout what is the best way to proceed with the Food and Energy Security \nAct.\n  Having looked back at what we did in 2002, we worked hard to be more \nfocused on how we could do a better job in this country of providing \nthe kinds of support and safety net that producers in our Nation \nneeded, so they could be competitive in the global marketplace but also \nencouraging the appropriate and proper way of production in this \ncountry, as Americans would want to see; not only making sure there is \nan abundant source of food and fiber in this country but that it would \nbe produced in a safe way to the environment, safer to the consumer, \nand that it would be affordable so our farmers would be the most \nefficient they could possibly be. We took a big step in 2002 in \nproducing a bill that moved us very much in that direction.\n  As we look at what we have done in the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nI am very proud of the product that the committee has produced and \nbrought to the floor in Senator Harkin's amendment. A lot of time and \nenergy was put into that committee bill to ensure we maintain the \nenormous blessing in this country that is American agriculture, the \nhard work that goes into American agriculture from hard-working \nfamilies, the farm families, the businesses that support them, the \nrural community that supports them, to be able to produce the most \naffordable, abundant, safest supply of food and fiber in the world. \nThat is what our American farm families do. They do it very proudly, \nthey do it very distinctly, and they do it very differently in each \nregion of this great country.\n  My message today is the same as it has been for weeks and months and \nthe years I have served in both this body and the other. That is, we \nhave an opportunity to reinforce those farm families, to reinforce the \nvalues we feel as Americans, that not only do we want an affordable \nsupply of food and fiber, we want it to be safe for our families and \nfor those we share it with globally, and we want to make sure we are \ndoing that with respect to the environment. Through the years, we have \nexpanded this bill to make sure it is obvious we want to do that in the \nnutrition programs, in the conservation programs, in the rural \ndevelopment portions of the bill, and now in a new energy title we \nstarted in 2002, to show our commitment to American agriculture and \nwhat it does, not just for the farmers, not just for the farm \ncommunity, not just for the children and the families whom we feed in \nthis country but globally, in terms of what we do in feeding these who \nare hungry and also pushing the envelop a little bit each time with our \ncompetitors globally that they, too, will produce in a responsible way \ntoward the environment.\n  Our message today is this is a good bill. This is a good bill that \nhas been produced in the Senate Agriculture Committee, and we need to \npass it.\n  The farm bill does so many good things that I have already discussed \nand about which many of us will continue to talk. Our investments in \nnutrition are tremendous, conservation, rural development, energy \nprograms--they have all been dramatically increased and will benefit \nour country greatly.\n  Take nutrition as an example. I know how important nutrition is in \nour lives from looking at my own children and my own family but \nparticularly in working families, the poorest among us whom we need to \nput first, and we need to make sure we are acting responsibly.\n  I was pleased to see in the committee bill that we provide an \nadditional $5 billion in increases in programs targeted at reducing \nfood insecurity. Can we do better? We are going to work hard each and \nevery year to do better, but that is a great start toward where we can \nbe.\n  With respect to conservation, Chairman Harkin and many other \nMembers--I know my State is a huge user of the conservation programs--\nthe chairman has been a tireless advocate for conservation programs, \nand I am pleased that once again he has produced a bill that assures \nprogress in this area. It ensures we are the best stewards of the land \nthat anyone can be globally and that we will leave our children the \nenvironment they deserve, that we will try each time to do better, but \nin conservation dollars, the 4 billion-plus extra dollars we have put \ninto conservation are meaningful in terms of what we have achieved in \nthis bill.\n  With respect to rural development, broadband is such an incredible \ntool in rural America. Senator Stabenow and I have worked together and \nhad a hearing not too long ago with telecommunication folks from all \nacross the country as to how do we get rural America connected to the \nrest of the world, how do we ensure they are connected, whether it is \nfor the educational benefit, whether it is the economic development \nthey need but making sure they have access.\n  In this bill, through broadband and some of the other rural \ndevelopment programs--we find, unfortunately, that disproportionately \npeople in rural areas are lower income, particularly our seniors--\nnutrition programs that exist but also the delivery mechanism, the \ncommunity programs that deliver those nutritious meals to our seniors, \nmany of those are supported by community development that comes through \nthe rural development section\n\n[[Page S15022]]\n\nof this bill, all very critically important, whether it is economic \ndevelopment, caring for individuals in rural America, health care and \nthe advancement of health care, technologies--a whole host of things we \ndo in rural development.\n  On energy, my colleague, Senator Craig, brought up the issue of \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil and how important it is. It is \ncritical. It is critical we become more dependent on ourselves for the \nenergy we need and we are responsible in how we do that--responsible to \nthe environment, ensuring that the renewable fuels we can invest \nourselves in are the fuels that will take us through the 21st century, \nnot just through the next 5 years.\n  We begin in this energy title of this farm bill to see those \nrenewable fuels that are going to make a difference in lessening our \ndependence on foreign oil and also cleaning up our environment. Look at \nwhat else they do. They provide a secondary market for our producers so \nwe are not as hemmed in and dependent on the global marketplace but \nthat we once again begin to depend on ourselves and that we give those \nsecondary markets to our farmers so they can be competitive, continuing \nto provide a safe, abundant, and affordable source of food and fiber \nbut also at the same time marketing their crops in a way they can also \ndraw from that, whether it is the cellulosic value and others, but an \nenergy source that will make us independent.\n  Most importantly to me as the mother of twin boys, the farm bill does \nsomething I think we should all be very proud of, and that is what I \nmentioned earlier. It ensures us of a safe domestic food supply that is \nthe envy of the world. Yes, we want to share it with the rest of the \nworld, but we also want to make sure our children, our families have \nthe confidence that when they are able to get the products from this \ncountry, grown by the responsible farm families of this Nation, that \nthey can be assured of the safety of those foods.\n  Many of my colleagues and most, if not all, of the media seem to take \na lot of that for granted, unfortunately. One day they are reporting \nabout the dangers our Nation is facing with unsafe foods that are \nentering the country or the atrocities of outsourcing jobs and what \nthat means to working families, and then the next day they are on the \nfloor or on the front page of the paper or in the news on the \ntelevision criticizing farm programs, our agricultural programs that \nallow us to ensure that safe and affordable supply of food for our \nchildren and our families.\n\n  The overall farm bill budget is one-half of 1 percent of the whole \nbudget. But if you look at the portion of this bill that provides the \nsafety net to our producers so they can stay in business, so they can \nstay competitive with the growers all across the globe who don't meet \nthose environmental regulations, who don't meet those safety \nregulations, who are not meeting the kind of regulations we put into \nplace to make those safety assurances, 15 percent of this farm bill--\nonly 15 percent--is what we use in those safety net programs. That is a \nhuge return on our money. That is a small investment to be assured that \nwhen our families go to the store, the grocery store shelves are not \nempty or, when we serve those foods at our table, that we are assured \nof the safety of our children and our families in what we are bringing \nto that table.\n  It is amazing to me as we see, again, all the confusion about the \nunsafe imported foods and what we have there and the same people who \nare worried about that who criticize these farm programs. Yet if we \ndon't provide those safety net programs, there is no way we can keep \nthat production at home unless we block our markets to the imports from \nother countries, which we have done in some commodities. But in the \nsustenance of life, if you go down to the Botanic Gardens, you will see \na display that talks about rice and wheat and these types of grains \nthat are the staple and the sustenance of life.\n  If we can't produce those competitively in this country, we will lose \nourselves to other countries and their production, which again is not \ndone in the safe and reliable way that we do.\n  The level of disparities, in terms of global agricultural trade U.S. \nfarmers face abroad--I know from my standpoint as a region where rice \nis a big crop for us because we are suited to grow rice. It is an \nexpensive crop to grow, but we are suited to do that and our farmers do \nit more efficiently and effectively than any farmers on the globe. Yet \nwe are shut out from trade agreements and markets all across the globe. \nYet our markets are open to them and to their commodities.\n  We are a very diverse nation. Our crops are different in each region \nof our country, and that is something we should be proud of, that our \nNation is so large and so productive and so fruitful that we can \nproduce all those diverse crops from across this land of ours. For that \nreason, we have several different programs to support individual \ncommodity needs. I am very proud of that diversity and I am proud to \nsupport initiatives for farmers all around our country. I fight for the \nones who are important to the farmers and producers in my region, but I \nalso know farmers in other parts of the country are important, too, \nwhether it is the production of milk or sugar or other types of crops \nthat we don't grow as well in our region. But I don't just support \nthose that are programs for me. I support those programs because I \nbelieve that as a team, as one country we must support the programs \nthat produce all of these incredible commodities that we enjoy in this \ncountry.\n  I have also fought hard to ensure that American agriculture gets the \nrespect it deserves in the world marketplace because, as the Budget \nchairman has pointed out with his now very famous charts, the world \nmarket for our farmers isn't free or fair.\n  My message is simple: We should meet our global competition and we \nshould not unilaterally disarm our farmers in the global marketplace. \nWe have worked hard in this bill to bring about reforms people have \nclamored for, but if we want to go in the direction of my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and to unilaterally begin to disarm some \nof our growers, it is not to say we don't want reform--there is \ntremendous reform in this bill--but to say we are not going to look at \nthe diversity of production and how commodities are produced in this \ncountry and we are not going to understand that each of those has to be \na little bit different.\n  She talked about how important it is for these reforms and the \nreforms we have in the bill. That is good. She wants to go one step \nfurther. But we need to stop and think how dangerous is that next step \nand does it throw out hard-working families who have made huge \ninvestments.\n  To farm 1,000 acres of cotton, you have to take out a $5 million \noperating loan. That is a big chunk to sign your name to. If you are a \nhard-working farm family and you don't know what is going to happen \nthis year, you may have lost a good bit last year, you may lose some \nmore next year, you may have a profit this year, but to sign your name \non a $5 million operating loan for a 1,000-acre farm which is not that \nmuch if you are going to try to recoup and make a little money that \nyear is a tough decision to make. Oftentimes, it means sharing your \nrisk with other people. Maybe it is family members. But that is \ncritically important for us to remember in terms of the diversity of \nthis country.\n\n  You know, it is an unfortunate reality that our global agricultural \ncompetition is heavily subsidized--more subsidized, certainly, than we \nare--and their markets are closed to the agricultural goods that my \nState produces particularly. Certainly, we have to negotiate those in \ntrade agreements. But when my commodities are completely shut out of \nthe markets in other countries and yet our markets are open to their \ngoods, I have a huge disadvantage from the very get-go, not to mention \nthe subsidies that might be provided or are provided particularly to \nthe developed countries across the globe.\n  As a result, we have grown our operations in our States because we \ndon't have a lot of those protections in trade to create an economy of \nscale that allows us to be competitive. If we are not careful, with the \ntighter payment limits that are being talked about and certainly the \nAGI limits that the Senator from Minnesota mentions, we are going to \nmake our producers of staple commodities, such as rice, less \ncompetitive internationally. When we put them out of business, they are \nnot going to go to another area of our country. They are not going to \ngo grow their rice in Indiana because the environment is not\n\n[[Page S15023]]\n\nsuited for that. They are probably not even going to go to Maryland to \ngrow their rice. What we are going to do is end up with our markets \nopen, importing that staple commodity from countries that don't \nregulate how it is grown or don't care what types of fertilizers or \nwater sources they use in farming that commodity.\n  Mr. President, I didn't invent global subsidies in agriculture, but I \nam committed--I am very committed--to ensuring that the Senate helps \nour farmers meet the kind of global competition they see. To not do so \nwill simply result in an outsourcing of our food supply and our jobs in \nrural America.\n  Within the WTO negotiations, we have asked our trading partners to \nreduce subsidies and their tariff levels on U.S. agricultural products \nwe are shipping. What we have said is we will come down further and we \nwill come down faster in our subsidies. But the response from the rest \nof the world has been abundantly clear. They have continued to say to \nus: No, thank you, America. We want you to bring yours down, but we are \nnot going to bring ours down. We have to maintain a domestic supply of \nfood. You go right ahead and lower your subsidies, and we are going to \nhang on to ours because it is really important to us.\n  Well, for the first time in the history of this country, a trade \ndeficit in agriculture is being predicted for the next couple of years. \nWe need to stand up and say what those other countries are saying, and \nthat is that it is very important to us as well.\n  Here at home, I have heard some of my colleagues and most media \noutlets say that we need to lower the caps on programs. And we went \naround to talk to folks, after seeing what the 2002 farm bill did, how \nproductive it was in terms of the savings that were realized, which \nSenator Chambliss mentioned. We did what we heard people were looking \nto see happen, and the committee bill lowers the overall caps from \n$360,000 to $100,000 for individuals--$100,000, Mr. President.\n  We also heard that we needed to address the loopholes that allow \nproducers to avoid the caps, and the committee bill eliminates both \nloopholes most frequently cited; that is, the three-entity rule and the \ngeneric certificates--two things people have tried to abuse in the \npast. They were very necessary tools, in many instances, for hard-\nworking farm families who used them correctly, but there was room for \nabuse, and so we eliminated them. We eliminated them because people \nwanted good reform in this bill.\n  I heard we needed transparency, so the committee bill added direct \nattribution, which will track payments directly to an individual \nfarmer, direct attribution so you can follow that payment. But remember \nthat this is only applicable to the commodity programs, the three \ncommodity programs that are most used--obviously, the direct payment, \nthe countercyclical, and the marketing loan. This doesn't include some \nof the other specialized programs we have developed for specialized \ncommodities, such as the Milk Program or the Sugar Program or the \nethanol tax programs and conservation programs, for instance. So we \nhaven't done this across the board; we are just focusing on a few of \nour growers--not a few, probably the majority in terms of grains, but \nthe commodity programs that are the most traditional.\n  We also heard that we needed to disqualify millionaire nonfarmers \nwalking around Fifth Avenue or Hollywood, and again my colleague from \nMinnesota continues to bring those up. So in the committee bill, we \nmoved the adjusted gross income means test from its current level of \n$2.5 million to $750,000 despite the fact that a recent GAO report \nbrings to us the information that this administration isn't policing \nthe current payment limit regulations effectively. I would be willing \nto bet that the millionaire real estate individual whom Senator \nKlobuchar continues to bring up in her debate probably is certainly \ncovered under the existing committee bill but more than likely under \nthe existing law, quite frankly. The problem is we are not seeing those \npayment limits that exist being implemented by this administration. \nWell, what good is it to go ahead and implement even stricter rules if \nwe don't even implement the ones that are existing? And if it is not \nsomething that he is already breaking the law on and the rule should be \nimplemented on--it is probably the Tax Code, for some reason. But the \nfact is, we all want to ensure that hard-working farm families across \nthis country are going to get the support they need, that they are \ngoing to get the safety net they need in whatever the particular crop \nis they grow in a sound way.\n  It is interesting as well that when we talk about the GAO study and \nthe implementation of these restrictions that exist, so many of the \nstories we hear are about individuals, maybe celebrities or what have \nyou, who are maybe getting a conservation payment. Well, they are not \ngoing to be corrected by this amendment because we don't extend this \nAGI test to everybody. They are just targeting it to one specific \ngroup. I would beg to differ that there are a lot of things. Does that \nmean we are going to say to large medical practices: We are going to \ngive you an AGI means test before we are going to allow you to accept \nMedicare payments. If you are over the AGI means test, you are \nineligible for Medicare. I don't think we are going to do that, and we \nare talking about sustenance of life. We are talking about keeping our \nfarmers competitive in the global marketplace.\n\n  My sincere hope is that the committee bill will be seen as what it \nis--a tremendous good-faith effort on my part and a host of other \nmembers in the Senate Agriculture Committee to address concerns and to \nrecognize that this is the most significant reform in the history of \nfarm programs. We have done a tremendous job in dealing with both what \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Grassley wanted to do as well as what \nSenator Klobuchar wants to do in reining in some of those things. You \ncan safely say to anybody that there is more reform in this bill than \nwe have ever seen.\n  Mr. President, I am enormously appreciative of this time we have now \nto debate what the farm bill does for this country and what it does for \nfarm families all across the Nation. I know it is not particularly \nglamorous. I know for a lot of Members it is not a lot of fun to talk \nabout the farm bill. It is not a glamorous something that is intricate \nand detailed in terms of what they can take home and talk about, and \nyet it is intricate and detailed. It is very complicated.\n  The programs we have designed to provide the support for our growers, \nthe safety nets that still meet the kind of guidelines in our trade \nagreements and a whole host of other things are very difficult to \nunderstand. A lot of times, Members don't want to take the time to \nunderstand them. They do not want to understand the differences that \nare affected to all the different regions and all the different \ngrowers, but it is critical. We have come to a critical time in our \nNation's history that we have to recognize how important this bill is.\n  I think many of us on the Agriculture Committee are not there \nnecessarily just because somebody put us there, but we are there \nbecause we asked to be there. We asked to be there because we know how \nimportant it is to our States and we know how important it is to this \ncountry.\n  We, as a country, are fortunate. We are very fortunate to have this \nbounty, and I am not going to let anyone in this Senate Chamber forget \nthat. I may drone on and on, but it is critically important, whether it \ncomes from me as a Senator who represents an agricultural State, \nwhether it is me, a daughter who grew up on a farm in an agricultural \noperation and saw all of the unbelievable dilemmas, whether it was \nweather or trade or farm programs or whatever, all of the things that \nagricultural farm families are up against and that they have no control \nover, or whether it is me as a mother looking into the 21st century and \nknowing how critically important it is not just that our children of \ntoday will have the opportunity to farm or to carry on that legacy but \nthat the children of all American families will have a safe and \nabundant and affordable supply of food.\n  There are multiple reasons for every one of us to get excited about \nthis bill, and I hope we will. So I am hoping that no one in this body \nwill again take for granted this enormous bounty we have, what it does \nfor us, and what it does for foreign lands as well, the peoples all \nacross this globe.\n\n[[Page S15024]]\n\n  I appreciate the time now, and I look forward, as we move ahead, to \nreminding my colleagues that we have done tremendous reform in this \nbill. We have done tremendous reform. Most of it is levied on farmers \nwho come from my region. A lot of that reform is not extended to other \nregions of the country. And that is okay because my farmers are strong, \nand they are proud of who they are and what they do, and they are going \nto be willing to lead the charge in terms of reforms. But I do say that \nas we look at the bill we have produced, it is a good, balanced bill. \nWe have made huge investments in things that are important to us and \nthe values we hold as Americans, and we have made a huge step in terms \nof the reforms that make a difference to many Americans, and we are \ndoing it as efficiently and effectively as we possibly can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Energy Bill Tax Provisions\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the statement of my \ngood friend from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln. I am also very happy we are \non the farm bill. It is a long time coming. We have finally worked it \nout. I do think American farmers and the industry will basically be \nhappy, frankly, when we finally do pass this farm bill, hopefully next \nweek.\n  While we are here, though, I want to address another subject, and \nthat is the tax package in the Energy bill. Not too long ago, a month \nor two ago, when the Energy bill was before the Senate, there was a tax \npackage as part of that Energy bill. It was voted on and did not get \ncloture. There were 58 Senators who voted for it. It was clear that \nSenators were absent, and had they been back here in the Senate, they \nwould have voted for it and we would have invoked cloture on that and \nit would have become part of the Energy bill.\n  The tax title has strong support. When we brought it up in the \nFinance Committee, it passed by a vote of 15 to 5. And again, on the \nfloor, there were at least 58 Senators who voted for it. I am quite \nconfident 60 would have voted for it had they all been present.\n  We are now faced with a larger energy bill which includes CAFE \nrenewal portfolio standards, fuel standards, as well as a tax title, \nand I wish to remind Senators how important this tax title is and how \nimportant it is to the Energy bill. We have an obligation as Senators \nto help make our country as energy independent as we possibly can, for \na whole host of reasons.\n  One, clearly, is for national security. Our future is somewhat in the \nhands of people in other parts of the world--OPEC countries, \nVenezuela--and that is not good. With oil prices today as high as they \nare, that is clearly not very good. We want to be in control of our \ndestiny as Americans as much as possible, and energy is such a key \ncomponent that we should do whatever we can to help make ourselves more \nenergy independent. The CAFE provisions in the bill go a long way in \nthat direction.\n  Some of the other provisions in the bill also help, but the tax \ntitle, I daresay, goes as far as any other part of that bill to help \nmake us energy independent. When that bill was before the Senate some \ntime ago, it was about $32 billion. Again, that would have gotten 60 \nvotes here in the Senate had all Senators been present. We now have \nscaled that back significantly. We cut it back by a third. So it is now \nabout $20 billion. So the tax title that is in the Energy bill is about \none-third less than the tax title that was in the Energy bill months \nago, which, as I mentioned, got almost 60 votes.\n  I would like to remind Senators what some of those provisions are and \nwhy it is so important that we pass the tax title.\n  First of all, it is a minor matter to some, but it is pretty \nsignificant to others; the CAFE provision itself will cost about $2 \nbillion out of the highway trust fund. That is $2 billion fewer dollars \nthat will go into the highway trust fund as a consequence of the CAFE \nstandards. Our highway trust fund is already in trouble. We need to add \nmore to the trust fund if we are going to rebuild our Nation's roads \nand bridges. The tax title now includes about $2 billion to replenish \nlosses to the highway trust fund that would otherwise occur because of \nthe CAFE standards. We have to get that $2 billion back into the \nhighway trust fund to pay for our roads and bridges. That is not well \nknown, but it is part of the tax title. It is important.\n  In addition, there are some renewable provisions, so-called section \n45 credits for electricity from wind, biomass--that is a 4-year \nextension. We need that. I need not tell you the number of times all of \nus have heard from energy people around the country--whether it is \nrenewables, whether it is alternative forms of energy, biodiesel, clean \ncoal, cellulosic--people need lead time, investors need lead time. They \nwant to invest in these technologies. It will make America more \nindependent. But we need to have these provisions in the law so \ninvestors can know what the tax provisions are, what the incentives \nare, and how long they are going to be in place. If we don't pass the \ntax title, we are going to dramatically cut back on investors' \nwillingness to invest in biodiesel, alternative forms of energy, other \nrenewable forms of energy. I mentioned cellulosic--and others.\n  It is imperative those provisions be available so we can help make \nourselves more independent.\n  Commercial solar extension, that is in the tax title. It is an 8-year \nextension of the business solar credit. We all know we need solar \nenergy. Add to that clean renewable energy bonds. What is that? Those \nare basically ways for nonprofits, whether it is counties, co-ops, or \nIndian tribes, also to develop clean renewable energy. The private \nsector can do it, for-profits can because they get a tax deduction. \nThis provision enables nonprofits, that is the counties, \nmunicipalities, co-ops also have that available to them.\n  Residential solar credit--I mentioned the commercial solar extension. \nThere is also a significant residential solar credit in this \nlegislation.\n  Clean coal projects--half of the power we are consuming in America \ntoday is generated by coal. We all know that coal is very important to \ngenerate energy. We all know coal is part of the climate change \nproblem. But we need to have clean coal technologies. This tax title \nhas about $2 billion worth of clean coal technologies, so we can help \nmake ourselves more independent but in a way that is totally compatible \nwith climate change.\n  Cellulosic ethanol--there is a credit in this tax title for \ncellulosic ethanol so we can make fuel from switchgrass, wood chips. \nAgain it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know why that should be \nenacted this year.\n  Biodiesel, renewable diesel--there is a credit there that extends \nthat through 2010.\n  There is the plug-in hybrid credit. We all see these hybrids driving \naround, but there is no way to plug them in to get them recharged. The \nthought is, if we can have plug-in credits so the hybrid cars can be \ndriven into your garage and plugged in, that is going to extend the \nbattery life of those hybrids. That will enable them to get close to \n100 miles a gallon. If we had more cars getting 100 gallons a mile, we \nwould be doing pretty well as we become more independent.\n  The commercial buildings conservation credit helps commercial \nbuildings install conservation provisions to save energy.\n  To add it all up, there is a lot in here. It is extremely important. \nWe have an obligation to help make ourselves more energy independent. \nThese are provisions that do so but also in a way that is compatible \nwith climate change. If we enact this tax title, it will lay the \nfoundation for lots and lots of entrepreneurs, with lots of new ideas, \nto develop all kinds of new ways to develop energy. Let a thousand \nenergy technologies bloom. We are not saying which technology works \nbetter compared to others, but at least let's get these provisions in \nplace so entrepreneurs and developers and investors who want to make a \nbuck--this is the American way--are given an opportunity to make a \nlittle money while producing some energy in the United States. We are \ngoing to accomplish lots of objectives with one provision in this \nEnergy bill.\n  I am working with my colleagues, if they have any objection to this \ntax title, to figure out a way to modify it to make it work. Our goal, \nfrankly, is, together in the Senate, to become more energy independent. \nThis tax title will go a long way to make that happen.\n\n[[Page S15025]]\n\n  I thank my colleague from Montana who is presiding, the only Senator \non the floor but for two others.

Mr. President, this morning, newspapers across America \nreported that the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence \nagencies have destroyed evidence, videotaped evidence of the \ninterrogation of prisoners. It is a startling disclosure. The United \nStates of America, a nation where the rule of law is venerated, has now \nbeen in the business of destroying evidence, evidence of a very \nsensitive nature, evidence which clearly should have been protected for \nlegal and historic purposes.\n  The late historian Arthur Schlesinger said this about this \nadministration's legal defense of torture:\n\n       No position taken has done more damage to the American \n     reputation in the world--ever.\n\n  We have been tested since 9/11 as a nation, tested in our resolve to \nprotect America, but also tested in our commitment to the values we \nhold dear.\n  A time of war and a time of insecurity is a time of the greatest \ntesting. Many Presidents, even great Presidents in the past, have \nfailed that test: President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War \nsuspending habeas; during World War I, serious questions were raised \nabout the patriotism of those who did not agree with our Government; \nduring World War II, under the administration of perhaps our greatest \nmodern President, Franklin Roosevelt, Japanese internment camps that \nbecame a national embarrassment; during the Cold War, our enemies list \nand the McCarthy hearings; all things that we look back on now and \nrealize do not reflect well on the United States and certainly do not \nreflect our values.\n  Now, this administration, this war on terror, this treatment of \nprisoners and detainees, it comes to our attention almost on a weekly \nbasis that, sadly, some have crossed the line. Every week there is a \nnew revelation about how the administration has engaged in activity \nthat is not consistent with American laws or values when it comes to \nthe issue of torture.\n  In this morning's paper, CIA officials disclosed they destroyed \nvideotapes of detainees being subjected to so-called enhanced \ninterrogation techniques. We do not know what those videotapes \nincluded.\n  There was a period of time when the Bush administration had decided \nto cast away the international standards of conduct, the Geneva \nConventions that we have been held to and proudly displayed for \ndecades. This administration redefined torture. Through a memo that has \nnow been made public, we know they reached extremes, which eventually \neven they had to repudiate.\n  The CIA has also reportedly withheld information about these \nvideotapes from a Federal court and from the bipartisan 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Today I am sending a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey \ncalling on him to investigate whether CIA officials who covered up the \nexistence of these videotapes violated the law.\n  In a statement yesterday, GEN Michael Hayden, the CIA Director, \nacknowledged the tapes were destroyed, and stated:\n\n       In 2002, during the initial stage of our terrorist \n     detention program, CIA videotaped interrogations, and \n     destroyed the tapes in 2005.\n\n  The New York Times reported today that:\n\n       The tapes were destroyed in part because officers were \n     concerned that video showing harsh interrogation methods \n     could expose agency officials to legal risks, several \n     officials said.\n\n  Now, the defense of the CIA is that they wanted to protect the \nidentity of those CIA employees who were engaged in the interrogation. \nThat is not a credible defense. We know that it is possible and, in \nfact, easy to cover the identity and faces of those who were involved \non any videotape. Something more was involved.\n  The CIA apparently withheld information about the existence of these \nvideotapes from official proceedings, including the bipartisan \nHamilton-Kean 9/11 Commission and a Federal court. According to Philip \nZelikow, the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission and formerly a \nhigh-ranking official in the Bush administration:\n\n       The Commission did formally request material of this kind \n     from all relevant agencies, and the Commission was assured \n     that we had received all of the material responsive to our \n     request. No tapes were acknowledged or turned over, nor was \n     the commission provided with any transcripts prepared from \n     recordings.\n\n  CIA attorneys told the Federal court hearing the case of Zacarias \nMoussaoui that videotapes of detainee interrogations did not exist. \nThis was a statement by our Government to a court involved a very \nsensitive and important case.\n  The Justice Department has now acknowledged in a letter to the court \nthat this was not true. Courts of America were misled by the Justice \nDepartment about the existence of this evidence.\n  CIA Director Hayden asserts the videotapes were destroyed ``in line \nwith the law.'' But listen to what the Federal obstruction of justice \nstatute says:\n\n       Whoever corruptly alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals \n     a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, \n     with the intent to impair the object's integrity or \n     availability for use in an official proceeding; or otherwise \n     obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or \n     attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n\n  That is what the Federal criminal statute says. It is not my role or \nMr. Hayden's role to determine whether the law was violated. That is \nthe responsibility of the Department of Justice. That is the \nresponsibility of the Attorney General, Michael Mukasey.\n  As Mr. Zelikow said:\n\n       The executive branch and Congress need to decide how much \n     they care about this question. If they want to get to the \n     bottom of it, it's pretty easy for people to dig up the \n     relevant records and answer the questions that either \n     officials of the executive branch or the Congress could pose.\n\n  This is the first real test of Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I \nhope he will do the right thing.\n  What is at stake goes to the heart of the rule of law and justice in \nAmerica. If our Government can destroy evidence, can misrepresent to \nour courts whether that evidence ever existed, if it can attempt to \ncover up wrongdoing, that goes way beyond the standards of justice and \nthe values of America.\n  This disclosure of the destruction of those videotapes goes to the \nheart of who we are as a people. I do not know what was on those tapes. \nIt was clearly something very troubling or they would not have been \ndestroyed. I do not even know if it was incriminating, but we have a \nright to know. In America, everyone is held accountable, including \nofficials at the highest levels of our Government.\n  It is time for this Department of Justice to turn the page from an \nera when we were engaged in a new definition of torture, a new \ndefinition of whether the Geneva Conventions were applicable, and bring \nus back into the rule of law, into those standards of conduct which \nhave made America proud for so many generations.\n  Today I will be sending a letter to Attorney General Mukasey calling \nfor an official investigation of whether there was destruction of \nevidence and obstruction of justice in the destruction of those \nvideotapes on the interrogation of detainees. This is not an issue that \ncan be ignored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15026-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15026-S15027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO REYNALDO P. GLOVER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute \nto a champion of African-American advancement, Reynaldo Glover.\n  A lawyer by training, Glover had a knack for business. In 1994, he \nbecame general counsel of TLC Beatrice International Holdings, later \nknown as TLC-LC, Inc., a multinational food company started by Glover's \nfriend and Harvard Law classmate Reginald Lewis in 1987.\n  Glover soon took over the role of executive vice president, and it \nwas under his leadership that, in 1996, TLC-LC posted sales of $2.2 \nbillion. With operations in more than 30 countries, the company became \nwidely recognized as the Nation's largest African-American-owned \nbusiness.\n  While Reynaldo Glover's accomplishments in the business world are \nunquestionably impressive, he is probably better known for his \npassionate work to provide access to high-quality education to young \nmen and women from low-income families.\n  Glover grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Gary, IN. After high\n\n[[Page S15027]]\n\nschool, he went to Nashville, TN, to attend Fisk University one of the \nNation's pre-eminent historically black universities. A dedicated \nstudent, Glover went on to graduate from Harvard Law School in 1968.\n  Devoted to furthering the advancement of African Americans and other \nracial minorities, Reynaldo Glover become national director of the Law \nStudent Civil Rights Research Council in New York.\n  Later, he came to Chicago to practice law. He served as partner at \nseveral Chicago law firms before joining TLC Beatrice as an attorney \nwith the firm DLA Piper.\n  While in Chicago, Glover also served as chairman of the City Colleges \nof Chicago's Board of Trustees. Established in 1911, the City Colleges \nof Chicago is a system of seven community colleges that provide \neducational opportunities to Chicago students. During his tenure as \nboard chairman, Glover was instrumental in launching a campaign to \nrecruit students from the city's low-income housing developments.\n  In 2003, he was appointed chairman of the Fisk University Board of \nTrustees. He welcomed the opportunity to serve his alma mater and did \nso with great pride. The success he achieved in academia and corporate \nAmerica helped him to serve as a positive example to the students at \nFisk.\n  Reynaldo Glover's life reflected the words of another distinguished \nFisk alum, W.E.B. DuBois, who said, ``Education is the whole system of \nhuman training within and without the schoolhouse walls, which molds \nand develops men.''\n  This Sunday, December 9, Reynaldo Glover's friends and family will \ngather at a memorial service in Chicago to remember and honor his \nremarkable life. His tireless efforts to expand educational \nopportunities for low-income students and to encourage African-American \nachievement will be felt for generations to come.\n  Those who knew him recall him not only with fondness but with great \nadmiration.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, especially his wife \nPamela and children, Reynaldo, Jr., Brian, Jharett Brantley, Ryan, and \nShea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15027-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15027-S15028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DESTRUCTION OF CIA TAPES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the torture debate took another deeply \ntroubling turn yesterday. The Nation learned the CIA had destroyed \nvideotapes of its employees in the act of using torture or other harsh \ninterrogation techniques on detainees.\n  Those tapes were not shown to Congress. They were not shown to any \ncourt. They were not shown to the bipartisan 9-11 Commission. Instead, \nthey were destroyed.\n  What would cause the CIA to take this action? The answer is obvious--\ncover up. The agency was desperate to cover up damning evidence of \ntheir practices. In a letter to agency employees yesterday, CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden claimed that the tapes were a security risk \nbecause they might someday ``leak'' and thereby identify the CIA \nemployees who engaged in these practices.\n  But that excuse won't wash. I am second to no one in wanting to \nprotect the brave men and women of the CIA. But how is it possible that \nthe director of the CIA has so little faith in his own agency?\n  Does the director believe the CIA's buildings are not secure?\n  Would it be beyond the agency's technical expertise to preserve the \ntapes while hiding the identity of its employees?\n  Does the director believe that the CIA's employees cannot be trusted \nnot to leak materials that might harm the agency?\n  Or does he know that the interrogation techniques are so abhorrent \nthat they could not remain unknown much longer?\n  It is particularly difficult to take the director's explanation at \nface value when the news that these CIA tapes were destroyed came the \nvery same week that we learned that as many as 10 million White House \nemails have not been preserved, despite a law that requires their \nretention. At the same time, the President continued to insist that we \ngrant immunity to the phone companies for their role in the illegal \nwiretapping of American citizens.\n  The pattern is unmistakable. The past 6 years, the Bush \nadministration has run roughshod over our ideals and the rule of law. \nFor 4 of those 6 years, the Republican Congress did little to hold the \nadministration accountable. Now, when the new Democratic Congress is \ndemanding answers, the administration is feverishly covering up its \ntracks. We haven't seen anything like this since the 18\\1/2\\-minute gap \nin the tapes of President Richard Nixon.\n  These efforts are wrong, and they must be stopped. I and other \nconcerned Senators will today call upon Attorney General Mukasey to \nimmediately begin an investigation into whether the CIA's handling and \ndestruction of these tapes violated the law.\n  We also must redouble our efforts to make sure that future \ninterrogations by the CIA conform to our laws and values. No part of \nour Government should engage in practices that are so horrific that we \ncannot bear to see them on tape. To that end, I introduced legislation \nto require that all Government agencies, including the CIA, follow the \nstandards of the Army Field Manual. Language that would take that \nimportant step was recently included in the conference report on the \nIntelligence authorization bill, and we must act to adopt it as soon as \npossible.\n  As founder John Adams said, our Nation is ``a Nation of laws, not \nmen.'' That basic principle is at risk today from an administration \nthat is engaging in a coverup--systematically destroying records, \ncommuting sentences, and stonewalling congressional investigations. The \nCIA's role in this coverup is only the latest reminder that Congress \nmust fight harder to prevent this administration from making a mockery \nof the rule of law, and to preserve the right of the American people to \nknow what the Government has been doing in their name.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to express my serious concern over \nthe Central Intelligence Agency's confirmation that videotapes \ndepicting brutal interrogation techniques were destroyed.\n  First, it is important that we note the broader context of this \ndebate. The United States of America is a nation born out of a struggle \nagainst tyranny, and our founding legal document asserts that the rule \nof law applies to all men and women, and all branches and agencies of \ngovernment. We are not a perfect Nation, but our national greatness is \nmarked by our ability to rise above our imperfections through our \nallegiance to our values and to the rule of law. Time and again, \nAmerica has triumphed because of the contrast we draw to tyranny. We \nare a nation that set captives free, shut down torture chambers, and \nextended freedom and international law to more of humanity.\n  Now, we are engaged in a new kind of conflict. And the question that \nwe have faced since September 11, 2001, is how we are going to respond \nto the shadowy, stateless, terrorist enemies of the 21st century.\n  Tragically, the Bush administration has too often chosen to respond \nto this enemy by abandoning our values and ignoring laws that it deems \ninconvenient. So we have seen excessive secrecy, indefinite detention, \nwarrantless wire-tapping, and `enhanced interrogation techniques' like \nsimulated drowning that qualify as torture through any careful measure \nof the law or appeal to human decency. For each of these new policies, \nwe have seen dubious legal reasoning that does not stand up to the \nharsh light of review or the sound judgment of our Constitution.\n  Yesterday, we learned that in November 2005, the CIA destroyed \nvideotapes of its interrogations of two prominent al-Qaida suspects, \nincluding a close Osama bin Laden associate Abu Zubayadah. Media \nreports suggest that these videotapes depict brutal interrogation \ntechniques, and could certainly be relevant to ongoing investigations \nand inquiries. Furthermore, these videotapes were not provided to the \n9/11 Commission, which made a broad set of requests for classified \ndocuments--including interrogation tapes and transcripts--that would \nhave included information about the 9/11 attacks.\n  The CIA has argued that these tapes needed to be destroyed to protect \nthe identities of the interrogators. Our government must go to any \nlength necessary to protect the identities of those\n\n[[Page S15028]]\n\nwho serve in a covert capacity. But the CIA keeps scores of classified \nmaterial--including videotapes--while protecting the identities of its \nagents. This raises serious questions about whether the tapes were \ndestroyed to protect the nature of the interrogation, rather than the \nidentity of the interrogator.\n  This incident deserves further congressional oversight and inquiry--\nneither the CIA nor this interrogation program is immune to our laws. \nThis is yet another chapter in a dark period in our constitutional \nhistory. Now, it is time to turn the page. That is why I was heartened \nto learn that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have reached \nagreement on including a requirement in the Intelligence authorization \nbill that subjects CIA interrogators to the guidelines on interrogation \nincluded in the U.S. Army Field Manual. It would be a grave \ndisappointment--though not surprising--if this important step forward \nwere subject to a veto threat from the President. That must not deter \nthe Congress from moving forward. We have a responsibility to act.\n  We should not have a separate interrogation program whose methods are \nso abhorrent that they cannot stand up to scrutiny. We should not have \nto find ways of ignoring or averting our own laws to defend our \ncountry. Torture does not work. Torture violates our laws. And torture \nsets back the standing and moral leadership that America needs to \ntriumph in this global struggle. Our values and laws are not \ninconvenient obstacles to the defense of our national security--they \ncan and must be a guiding force in our response to terrorism.\n  Today is Pearl Harbor day--a date when our Nation was subjected to a \nterrible surprise attack, and when a generation of Americans answered \nthe call to defend our security and extend the cause of freedom. More \nthan 6 years after 9/11, we are still struggling to define our own \nresponse to our generation's terrible surprise attack. As we defend \nAmerica, let us learn the painful lessons of these last few years, and \nenlist our values and our Constitution in this first great struggle of \nthe 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15028-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL STEM SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleagues \nfrom Illinois and Minnesota, Senators Obama, Durbin, and Coleman, in \nintroducing the National Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, \nSTEM, Scholarship Database Act of 2007, which is intended to address \none of the obstacles that students experience in pursuing undergraduate \nand postbaccalaureate studies in STEM fields.\n  There is growing concern that the United States is not preparing a \nsufficient number of students, teachers, and practitioners in STEM \nfields. An important aspect of U.S. efforts to maintain and improve \neconomic competitiveness is the existence of a capable scientific and \ntechnological workforce.\n  The change from a labor-based manufacturing to a knowledge-based \nmanufacturing and service economy demands certain skills of our \ncitizenry. The National Science Foundation, NSF, projects that in the \nincreasingly changing context for science and technology, a workforce \ntrained in the sciences and engineering is necessary for continued \neconomic growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that science \nand engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4 percent from \n2004 to 2014, compared to a growth of 13 percent in all occupations \nduring the same time period. Furthermore, the current scientific and \nengineering workforce is aging. The NSF reports that the number \nreaching retirement age will increase dramatically over the next two \ndecades.\n  A May 2007 report of the Department of Education states that: There \nis increasing concern about U.S. economic competitiveness, particularly \nthe future ability of the nation's education institutions to produce \ncitizens literate in STEM concepts and to produce future scientists, \nengineers, mathematicians, and technologists. Such experts are needed \nto maintain U.S. preeminence in science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics. While other countries around the world strive to improve \ntheir own education systems and to expand their economies, the U.S. \nwill have to work even harder in the coming years to maintain its \ncompetitive edge.\n  In addition to these statistics, we have anecdotal evidence from \nuniversities across the country and in my home State of Maine. Faculty \nfrom the University of Southern Maine and across the State point to \ndecreasing undergraduate enrollments in STEM fields and an even greater \ndecrease in the number of bachelor and master's degrees conferred in \nthese fields. For many students, the obstacle is not a lack of interest \nbut rather a lack of financial resources.\n  On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed into law Public Law 110-69, \nThe America COMPETES Act, H.R. 2272. The legislation is directed at \nincreasing research investment, improving economic competitiveness, \ndeveloping an innovation infrastructure, and strengthening and \nexpanding science and mathematics programs at all points on the \neducational pipeline. The America COMPETES Act authorizes $33.6 billion \nfor fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 for science, mathematics, \nengineering, and technology programs across the Federal Government. \nThis Federal effort, while laudable, is essentially unknown to the \naverage student interested in pursuing a degree in a STEM field. \nMoreover, it does little to help a rising college freshman today enter \na degree program in aerospace engineering, veterinary medicine, or \ncomputer information systems.\n  A major challenge facing many high school graduates and their \nfamilies is how to afford college. Helping students locate financial \naid might well increase the number of students entering STEM fields. \nFor many first-generation college students, financial assistance may be \navailable but the student may be unaware of the opportunities. As a \nresult of Federal efforts in this area, there is a large array of \nfinancial aid opportunities available in the STEM fields; however, \nthere is no simple way for potential applicants to explore them.\n  The database created in this bill will have a complete list of STEM \nscholarships, fellowships, and other programs of financial assistance \nfrom all public and private sources for postsecondary and postgraduate \nstudy. The American Chemical Society and the National Science Teachers \nAssociation believe this measure will expand and strengthen the STEM \neducation pipeline and help keep our nation competitive in the global \neconomy by aiding capable students who are interested in STEM careers \nin their search for the right scholarship opportunity to support their \nstudies.\n  With less than 6 percent of the world's population, the United States \ncannot expect to dominate science and technology in the future as it \ndid during the second half of the last century when we enjoyed a \nmassively disproportionate share of the world's STEM resources. We must \ninvest more in the resources we do have, encourage those resources to \nproduce economically useful innovations, and organize the STEM \nenterprise by working to make sure that innovations developed here \nproduce prosperity and progress for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15028-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15028-S15029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEMPLE BETH EL IN MIDLAND, MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to pay tribute to \nTemple Beth El on its 50th anniversary, which will continue to be \ncelebrated throughout the year. This small but vibrant Jewish \ncongregation has made an important contribution to the Midland \ncommunity.\n  Since the 1890s, when the first Jewish family settled in this area, \nthere has been a strong Jewish community. By 1955, the Jewish community \nin Midland totaled nearly 50 families. The following year, after having \ncommuted to other cities for religious instruction and observance for \nmany years, the decision was made to establish a local place of \nworship. After much discussion and with guidance from Rabbi Katz of \nSaginaw and the leadership of Ralph Cutler and Leonard Bernstein, the \ncongregation's founding families provided the financial and material \nsupport necessary to design and secure a location\n\n[[Page S15029]]\n\nfor both the temple and for a permanent rabbinical residence.\n  On December 29, 1957, Temple Beth El formally opened its doors at a \ndedication ceremony led by the congregation's first spiritual leader, \nRabbi Marc Samuels, a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary and a \nHolocaust survivor. In attendance were the 52 original member families, \nthe congregation's officers, and many other community leaders. At its \ninception the congregation chose to affiliate itself with the \nconservative Jewish movement. In 2000, in response to the wishes of its \nmembers, the Temple decided to become a reform congregation.\n  I am sure that my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating \nthe leadership, congregants, and the greater Midland community as they \ncontinue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Temple Beth El. Their \nrich history and commitment to service has greatly impacted the small, \nclose-knit Jewish community in Midland. We all look forward to at least \n50 more years of spiritual guidance and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15029-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CURTIS STRANGE\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man who is a close \npersonal friend of mine but more importantly is admired by fans of the \nsport of golf around the world.\n  I wish to highlight the career of professional golfer Curtis Strange, \nwho on November 12, 2007, was formally inducted into the World Golf \nHall of Fame.\n  I first met Curtis as an undergraduate student-athlete at Wake Forest \nUniversity where he earned the prestigious Arnold Palmer Scholarship to \nplay golf.\n  Curtis's college career was nothing short of remarkable. Many even \nconsider the team that Curtis played on at Wake Forest to be the best \ncollegiate golf team in U.S. history. In fact, Golf World called the \n1975 Wake Forest team that featured Curtis Strange, Jay Haas, Bob \nByman, and David Thore as ``the greatest of all-time.''\n  In 1974, Curtis won the Fred Haskins Award that goes to the Nation's \ntop collegiate golfer and was awarded 1st Team All-American honors \nthree years in a row.\n  In 1974 and 1975, Curtis led the Demon Deacon golf team to two, back-\nto-back NCAA titles and earned the individual collegiate title in 1974, \nthe same year he won the World Amateur Cup.\n  Curtis turned professional after his junior year in 1976. Throughout \nhis professional career and particularly in the 1980s, Curtis impressed \nPGA fans with his unmatched skills proving how excellent a golfer he \nreally is, achieving feats that very few other golfers can say they \nhave achieved. For instance, he posted 17 PGA Tour victories including \nback-to-back U.S. Open Championships in 1988 and 1989, becoming the \nfirst to do that since Ben Hogan in 1950-1951. He has been a member of \nfive Ryder Cup Teams--1983, 1985, 1987, 1989 and 1995--and in 2002, he \nwas captain of the Ryder Cup team. And Curtis Strange's impressive \ncareer has not ended. He currently plays on the senior PGA Tour.\n  But perhaps one of the most honorable achievements of Curtis Strange \nwas his gracious gift to Wake Forest University. He recently very \ngenerously established a golf scholarship fund at Wake Forest. This \ngesture should not go unnoticed. It shows that Curtis is the type of \nman who wants to give back to the community that helped him get to \nwhere he is today. He wants others to benefit from his success.\n  Curtis Strange is a good man with a good heart.\n  I congratulate Curtis on his induction into the World Golf Hall of \nFame, I commend him for his outstanding achievements as an athlete, and \nI honor him as a person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15029-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, last night, after months of political \nposturing, the Senate voted to prevent a massive tax burden from \nfalling on 21 million Americans. Without last night's action, millions \nof middle-class Americans would have been impacted by the alternative \nminimum tax, a tax meant to impact only the wealthiest individuals. And \nwhile I believe the legislation we passed was not perfect, I would have \npreferred that we adhere to the pay-go rules that I voted for--it was a \ncompromise I supported.\n  I must express my disappointment at what it took to get us here. \nThere was no disagreement over whether we should prevent middle-class \nfamilies from being hit by the AMT. So why would it take months to get \nthis legislation passed? Sadly, the debate surrounded whether or not we \nshould pass the burden of paying for this fix onto the next generation. \nRepublicans wanted to borrow money to pay for this tax cut, while \nDemocrats argued that we should be more responsible and not leave our \nchildren with the bill.\n  In addition to not offsetting the cost of the AMT fix, the Senate \nfailed to pass a tax extenders package. In October, the House passed \nfully offset legislation that would both fix the AMT and extend certain \ntax provisions that will expire at the end of the year. These \nprovisions--such as the research and development credit, the tuition \ndeduction, and the deduction for teachers' classroom expenses--are \nvital to millions of Americans. The Senate had an opportunity to renew \nthese credits and deductions in a fiscally responsible manner. I hope \nmy colleagues will reconsider in the coming weeks and will pass a tax \nextenders package before we adjourn for the year.\n  Despite all this, we did the right thing in passing an AMT fix. The \nAMT was originally intended to prevent the wealthiest Americans from \navoiding paying any income tax. But due to inflation and various \nchanges in tax law, the AMT had morphed and grown--without last night's \naction, nearly two and a half million families making less than $75,000 \nwould have to pay the AMT. That is well beyond the scope of what \nCongress intended when the AMT was put in place, and I am glad we could \ntake the necessary step to prevent that from happening.\n  I hope my colleagues on the House side will move quickly to get this \nlegislation passed. It is not perfect. Things around here rarely are. \nAnd while this bill is fiscally irresponsible, it is equally \nirresponsible to allow millions of Americans to be hit by a tax that \nwas never intended for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15029-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15029-S15030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING REPRESENTATIVE HENRY HYDE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of \nRepresentative Henry Hyde, who, as we all know, passed away last \nThursday. I believe all those who knew Henry will remember him for his \nsincere moral convictions and his dedication to the country.\n  Representative Hyde was born in Chicago in 1924. He graduated from \nGeorgetown University, where he was a standout on the basketball team \nthat made it all the way to the 1943 National Championship game. He \nwent on to obtain a law degree from Loyola University.\n  Henry was in the Navy during World War II, serving in combat in the \nPhilippines. After the war, he served for more than 20 years in the \nNaval Reserve, eventually obtaining the rank of commander.\n  In 1974, he was elected to the House of Representatives where he \nwould represent the citizens of the Sixth Congressional District of \nIllinois for 22 years. During his time in the House, he became known as \na steadfast proponent of the rights of the unborn, authoring the Hyde \nAmendment, which, to this day, ensures that Federal taxpayer funds are \nnot used in the performance of abortions. He was also a stalwart \nsupporter of our Nation's military and firm believer in the need to \nuphold the rule of law.\n  Henry and I had the distinct privilege of having our chairmanships of \nthe House and Senate Judiciary Committees overlap for a substantial \nperiod of time. We worked together on numerous pieces of legislation \nand I always enjoyed the passion and energy he brought to every issue. \nHenry was a very capable legislator and a man of deep convictions. Last \nmonth, President Bush honored Representative Hyde by awarding him our \nNation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \nDuring the ceremony, which Henry could not attend due to his declining \nhealth, the President described Henry as a ``powerful defender of life, \na leading advocate for\n\n[[Page S15030]]\n\na strong national defense, and an unwavering voice for liberty, \ndemocracy, and free enterprise around the world.''\n  While there were times that Representative Hyde found himself in the \nmiddle of divisive and fiercely partisan debates, I don't think that \nanyone would doubt that he always sought to stand behind his principles \nand to do what he believed was best for our country. I want to express \nmy deepest condolences to Representative Hyde's family and my thanks \nfor his years of service to our great Nation.

I speak on behalf of \nmany citizens of my State who, over the years, had grown to respect \nSenator Mayne's support for American workers and his dedication to the \nState of Utah.\n  Senator Mayne was born in Magna, UT, in 1945. He graduated from \nGranger High School in West Valley City and played football for 2 years \nat Snow College in Ephraim, UT. In the mid-1960s, he got a job working \non the track gang for Kennecott Copper in the Bingham Canyon mine. It \nwas then that Senator Mayne became involved in organized labor.\n  In his early years at Kennecott, he became active in the local \nchapter of the United Steel Workers of America, quickly becoming the \npresident of Local 485. In 1977, he became president of the entire \nchapter and, later that year, at the age of 32, he was named president \nof the AFL-CIO of Utah. He was, at that time, the youngest AFL-CIO \nchapter president in the country.\n  In 1994, Ed was elected to serve in the Utah State senate and was in \nthe midst of his fourth term when he died. Throughout his time in the \nsenate, he remained dedicated to improving the lives of workers and, \nwhile he had strong personal ties to organized labor, he was committed \nto serving both union and nonunion workers alike. He also devoted \nhimself to serving poor people in Utah, working to, among other things, \nmaintain State Medicaid benefits and to protect low-income borrowers \nfrom the exploitation of predatory lenders.\n  Ed Mayne was somewhat of an anomaly in Utah. He was a tried and true \nDemocrat in one of the most Republican States in the country. However, \neven the most conservative Utah Republicans never doubted Ed's \nconvictions, even when we disagreed with his position on certain \nissues. He left an indelible mark on the State of Utah and was a good \nexample for all of us, Republicans and Democrats, who aspire to serve \nthe public.\n  I had known Senator Mayne for his entire career in the Utah State \nsenate. We disagreed with each other on many occasions, but there was \nnever any animosity or hatred, just respect and friendship. We also \nagreed on several things and I cherished the opportunities I had to \ntalk to him about pressing matters facing the State of Utah and sharing \nideas of how to fix them.\n  The sentiments shared at Ed's funeral summarize our relationship very \nwell when the eulogizer mentioned that Ed and I were very close friends \nand we liked each other very much. That is truly the way I felt about \nEd.\n  I express my deepest condolences to Senator Mayne's family and my \nthanks for his years of service to the great State of Utah. I am \ngrateful to have known such an outstanding public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15030-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PASSAGE OF VIRGINIA TECH HOKIE SPIRIT MEMORIAL FUND\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the families who \nlost loved ones and to those who suffered injuries as consequence of \nthe horrific shootings that claimed 32 innocent lives on April 16, \n2007, on the campus of Virginia Tech. Having traveled to Virginia Tech \nthe day after the shootings, I joined with the families and campus \ncommunity in mourning. It is a memory that I carry with me to this day. \nWe all greatly admire the ability of those who lost loved ones, and \nthose who themselves were injured, to come together to support each \nother.\n  In the aftermath of that tragic day, over 20,000 individuals and \ngroups across the country demonstrated their overwhelming support for \nthe victims and their families with generous financial donations that \ntotaled approximately $8.5 million. The Virginia Tech administration \nestablished the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund within the Virginia Tech \nFoundation to accept these charitable contributions. Indeed, all of \nAmerica can take pride in this outpouring of sympathy and support.\n  On October 30, 2007, the University officially distributed these \nfunds to the 79 families and individuals in accordance with the \nprotocols established by the Fund. While no amount of money can truly \ncompensate for the loss of life or limb, these payments provide both \nthe families of the deceased and the injured survivors with some \nfinancial resources to help, in some modest way.\n  Unfortunately, Federal law was not clear as to whether these payments \nare subject to federal taxation. Congress recognized this uncertainty \nand this week expeditiously passed clarifying legislation that I \nsponsored in the Senate along with Senator Webb ensuring that these \npayments are exempt from federal taxation. The House measure was \nintroduced by Representatives Boucher and Goodlatte. Having \noverwhelmingly passed both Houses of Congress, the bill will now be \nsent to the President with every expectation to be signed into law.\n  Passage of this legislation could not have occurred without the \nsupport of several key groups. This October, family members and victims \ncame to Capitol Hill to discuss the tragic day of April 16 and ways we \ncould help prevent such events from taking place in the future. Later, \nI learned of the plans to distribute payments from the Fund to these \nfamilies and victims. The administration of Virginia Tech along with \nsome family members shared with my office in a very solemn and \nrespectful manner the tax uncertainty associated with the Hokie Fund \npayments. These same concerns were echoed by accountants in the \ncommunity who had volunteered their time to assist these families and \nvictims.\n  Having learned of this unfortunate tax predicament, my colleagues and \nI in Congress responded accordingly with swift introduction and \nconsideration of legislation to ensure that we provide assistance to \nthe families and victims in overcoming this horrific tragedy. Members \nand their staffs worked extremely hard to obtain speedy passage of this \nlegislation, and I rise today to thank everyone who made enactment of \nthis legislation possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15030-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING FRANK STILWELL III\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Frank Stilwell III, \na great Ohioan and a great American. Despite losing his eyesight at age \n7, Frank never accepted failure or special treatment. It is this \nunwavering drive that led him from the Kettering Public School District \nnear Dayton, OH, to Georgetown Law School and eventually to the Federal \nCommunications Commission, where he served as a Senior Staff Attorney \nin the Commercial Wireless Division. While at the FCC, Frank worked \nclosely with tribal groups in Alaska to ensure cell phone towers did \nnot blight sacred burial grounds.\n  A longtime amateur radio enthusiast--in his youth he helped found the \nFar Out Amateur Radio Club in Dayton, OH--and an avid reader--often \nborrowing from the audio and Braille collections at the Arlington \nPublic Library in Virginia--Frank was a happy, active, and passionate \nman, which is why his unexpected death last month at the age of 50 is \nso tragic.\n  For me, Frank's passion and drive in the face of adversity is a \nreminder of what we are all capable of, and I hope this life lesson--\nFrank's lesson to us--is not soon forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/07/senate-section/article/S15030-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15030-S15031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6) to reduce \nour Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing in\n\n[[Page S15031]]\n\nclean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, promoting new \nemerging energy technologies, developing greater efficiency, and \ncreating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest \nin alternative energy, and for other purposes; with amendments, in \nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 1:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2085.

A bill to clarify conditions for the interceptions of \ncomputer trespass communications under the USA-PATRIOT Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Computer \nTrespass Clarification Act of 2007, which would amend and clarify \nsection 217 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This bill is virtually identical to \na bill I introduced in the 109th Congress.\n  Section 217 of the Patriot Act addresses the interception of computer \ntrespass communications. This bill would modify existing law to more \naccurately reflect the intent of the provision, and also protect \nagainst invasions of privacy.\n  Section 217 was designed to permit law enforcement to assist computer \nowners who are subject to denial of service attacks or other episodes \nof hacking. The original Department of Justice draft of the bill that \nlater became the Patriot Act included this provision. A section by \nsection analysis provided by the Department on September 19, 2001, \nstated the following:\n\n       Current law may not allow victims of computer trespassing \n     to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring \n     unauthorized attacks as they occur. Because service providers \n     often lack the expertise, equipment, or financial resources \n     required to monitor attacks themselves as permitted under \n     current law, they often have no way to exercise their rights \n     to protect themselves from authorized attackers. Moreover, \n     such attackers can target critical infrastructures and engage \n     in cyberterrorism. To correct this problem, and help to \n     protect national security, the proposed amendments to the \n     wiretap statute would allow victims of computer attacks to \n     authorize persons ``acting under color of law'' to monitor \n     trespassers on their computer systems in a narrow class of \n     cases.\n\n  I strongly supported the goal of giving computer system owners the \nability to call in law enforcement to help defend themselves against \nhacking. Including such a provision in the Patriot Act made a lot of \nsense. Unfortunately, the drafters of the provision made it much \nbroader than necessary, and refused to amend it at the time we debated \nthe bill in 2001. As a result, the law now gives the government the \nauthority to intercept communications by people using computers owned \nby others as long as they have engaged in some unauthorized activity on \nthe computer, and the owner gives permission for the computer to be \nmonitored--all without judicial approval.\n  Only people who have a ``contractual relationship'' with the owner \nallowing the use of a computer are exempt from the definition of a \ncomputer trespasser under section 217 of the Patriot Act. Many people--\nfor example, college students, patrons of libraries, Internet cafes or \nairport business lounges, and guests at hotels--use computers owned by \nothers with permission, but without a contractual relationship. They \ncould end up being the subject of Government snooping if the owner of \nthe computer gives permission to law enforcement.\n  My bill would clarify that a computer trespasser is not someone who \nhas permission to use a computer by the owner or operator of that \ncomputer. It would bring the existing computer trespass provision in \nline with the purpose of section 217 as expressed in the Department of \nJustice's initial explanation of the provision. Section 217 was \nintended to target only a narrow class of people: unauthorized \ncyberhackers. It was not intended to give the government the \nopportunity to engage in widespread surveillance of computer users \nwithout a warrant.\n  Another problem is that unless criminal charges are brought against \nsomeone as a result of such surveillance, there would never be any \nnotice at all that the surveillance has taken place. The computer owner \nauthorizes the surveillance, and the FBI carries it out.\n  There is no warrant, no court proceeding, no opportunity even for the \nsubject of the surveillance to challenge the assertion of the owner \nthat some unauthorized use of the computer has occurred.\n  My bill would modify the computer trespass provision in the following \nadditional ways to protect against abuse, while still maintaining its \nusefulness in cases of denial of service attacks and other forms of \nhacking.\n  First, it would require that the owner or operator of the protected \ncomputer authorizing the interception has been subject to ``an ongoing \npattern of communications activity that threatens the integrity or \noperation of such computer.'' In other words, the owner has to be the \ntarget of some kind of hacking.\n  Second, the bill limits the length of warrantless surveillance to 96 \nhours. This is twice as long as is allowed for an emergency criminal \nwiretap. With four days of surveillance, it should not be difficult for \nthe government to gather sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to obtain a \nwarrant if continued surveillance is necessary.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Attorney General to report \nannually on the use of Section 217 to the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees. Section 217 was originally subject to the sunset provision \nin the Patriot Act and therefore would have expired at the end of 2005. \nHowever, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, which \nbecame law in March 2006, made this provision permanent. Congress needs \nto do more oversight of the use of this provision.\n  The computer trespass provision now in the law as a result of section \n217 of the PATRIOT Act leaves open the potential for significant and \nunnecessary invasions of privacy. The reasonable and modest changes to \nthe provision contained in this bill preserve the usefulness of the \nprovision for investigations of cyberhacking, but reduce the \npossibility of government abuse. I urge my colleagues to support the \nComputer Trespass Clarification Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit authority to delay notice of search \nwarrants; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce in the Senate \nthe Reasonable Notice and Search Act. This bill is nearly identical to \na bill I introduced in the 109th Congress, S. 316. It addresses Section \n213 of the USA PATRIOT Act, a provision passed in the wake of the 9/11 \nattacks that has caused serious concern among Members of Congress and \nthe public. Section 213, sometimes referred to as the ``delayed notice \nsearch provision'' or the ``sneak and peek provision,'' authorizes the \ngovernment in limited circumstances to conduct a search in a criminal \ninvestigation without immediately serving a search warrant on the owner \nor occupant of the premises that have been searched.\n  Prior to the Patriot Act, secret searches for physical evidence were \nperformed in some jurisdictions under the authority of Court of Appeals \ndecisions, but the Supreme Court never definitively ruled whether they \nwere constitutional. Section 213 of the Patriot Act authorized delayed \nnotice warrants in any case in which an ``adverse result'' would occur \nif the warrant was served before the search was executed. ``Adverse \nresult'' was defined as including: endangering the life or physical \nsafety of an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or \ntampering with evidence, intimidation of potential witnesses, or \notherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a \ntrial. This last catchall category could apply in virtually any \ncriminal case. In addition, while some courts had required the service \nof the warrant within a specified period of time, the Patriot Act \nsimply required that the warrant specify that it would be served within \na ``reasonable'' period of time after the search.\n  This provision of the Patriot Act was not limited to terrorism cases. \nIn fact, before the Patriot Act passed, the FBI already had the \nauthority to conduct secret searches of foreign terrorists and spies \nwith no notice at all under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nFurthermore, the Patriot Act ``sneak and peek'' authority was not made \nsubject to any sunset provision. So Section 213 was obviously a \nprovision that the Department of Justice wanted regardless of the \nterrorism threat after 9/11.\n  Perhaps that is why this provision has caused such controversy. In \n2003, by a wide bipartisan margin, the House passed an amendment to the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill offered by then-\nRepresentative Butch Otter from Idaho, a Republican, to stop funding \nfor delayed notice searches authorized under section 213.\n  I first raised concerns about the sneak and peek provision when it \nwas included in the Patriot Act in 2001. I raised concerns during the \nreauthorization process in 2005 and 2006, when changes were made that \nwere, unfortunately, entirely inadequate. The reauthorization \nlegislation did not change the very broad standard for issuing a sneak \nand peak search warrant. It put in place a 30-day time limit for the \ndelayed notice of these warrants and permitted 90-day extensions--time \nperiods that are far too long.\n  So even after the reauthorization process, adequate safeguards are \nstill not in place for these types of searches. I have never argued, \nhowever, and I am not arguing now, that there should be no delayed \nnotice searches at all and that the provision should be repealed. I \nsimply believe that this provision should be modified to protect \nagainst abuse. My bill will do three things to accomplish this.\n  First, my bill would narrow the circumstances in which a delayed \nnotice warrant can be granted to the following: potential loss of life, \nflight from prosecution, destruction or tampering with evidence, or \nintimidation of potential witnesses. I do not include the ``catchall \nprovision'' in section 213, allowing a secret search when serving the \nwarrant would ``seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay a \ntrial,'' because it can too easily be turned into permission to do \nthese searches whenever the government wants.\n  Second, I believe that any delayed notice warrant should provide for \na specific and limited time period within which notice must be given: 7 \ndays. This is consistent with some of the pre-Patriot Act court \ndecisions and will help to bring this provision in closer accord with \nthe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Under my bill, prosecutors \nwill be permitted to seek 21-day extensions if circumstances continue \nto warrant that the subject not be made aware of the search. But the \ndefault should be 1 week, unless a court is convinced that more time \nshould be permitted.\n  Finally, Section 213 should include a sunset provision so that it \nexpires along with the other expanded surveillance provisions in Title \nII of the Patriot Act, at the end of 2009. This will allow Congress to \nreevaluate this authority and whether additional safeguards are needed.\n  These are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut \nthe provision. Rather, they recognize the legitimate concern across the \npolitical spectrum that this provision presents the potential for \nabuse. They also send a message that Fourth Amendment rights have \nmeaning, and potential violations of those rights should be minimized \nif at all possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Recrod, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2435\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO DELAY NOTICE OF SEARCH \n                   WARRANTS.\n\n       Section 3103a of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``may have an adverse \n     result (as defined in section 2705, except if the adverse \n     results consist only of unduly delaying a trial)'' and \n     inserting ``will endanger the life or physical safety of an \n     individual, result in flight from prosecution, result in the \n     destruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under \n     the warrant, or result in intimidation of potential \n     witnesses''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``30 days'' and all that \n     follows and inserting ``7 days after the date of its \n     execution.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``for good cause shown'' \n     and all that follows and inserting ``upon application of the \n     Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an \n     Associate Attorney General, for additional periods of not \n     more than 21 calendar days for each such application, if the \n     court finds, for each such application, reasonable cause to \n     believe that notice of the execution of the warrant will \n     endanger the life or physical safety of an individual, result \n     in flight from prosecution, result in the destruction of or \n     tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant, or \n     result in intimidation of potential witnesses.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.
