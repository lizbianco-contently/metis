Mr. President, it is truly a privilege and pleasure this \nmorning to welcome to the Senate a remarkable individual who opened the \nSenate with a prayer this morning. He has lived an equally remarkable \nlife and today resides in the community of Southington, CT.\n  In the 80 years we have enjoyed the fortune of having the Reverend \nRalph Lord Roy in our midst, he has been an author and columnist, an \nactivist, a teacher, and a radio host, and, of course, a pastor to some \n12 different churches and ministries in New York and for some 36 years \nin Connecticut. At each stop along the way, he has spread the same \nmessage: one of justice and tolerance in the face of fear, resentment, \nanger, and prejudice.\n  In 1961, as part of the Congress of Racial Equality, Reverend Roy was \none of the fabled ``Freedom Fighters'' who traveled to protest \nsegregation policies in the South, for which he was arrested in \nTallahassee.\n  A year later, he led a prayer pilgrimage to Albany, GA, at Martin \nLuther King's personal request. For his peaceful protests there, \npraying for the cause of desegregation, Reverend Roy was also arrested. \nIn leading the largest group of clergy to be arrested in American \nhistory in Albany, GA, Reverend Roy became the first Caucasian \nMethodist minister in our Nation to be imprisoned for standing up for \nthe civil rights of all Americans. The message he and his fellow clergy \nmen and women sent at that moment--some 75 Jewish and Catholic laymen \nand clerics, most of them White, standing peacefully in solidarity with \nDr. Martin Luther King on the sidewalk before the Albany City Hall--\nreverberates to this very day. It echoes in the books and articles that \nReverend Roy has penned on social and faith issues and in his powerful \nand personal accounts of his experiences with the slain civil rights \nleader. It echoes as well in his\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nradio shows and travels across the world. And today, of course, it \nechoes in the Halls of the Senate.\n  A remarkable 80 years, making a significant contribution to the \nimprovement and the betterment of our great country. So it is truly an \nhonor to welcome Reverend Roy from Southington, CT, who has opened our \nSenate session this morning with his wonderful, thoughtful prayer. We \nwish him and his family the very best, and we thank him for his \nwonderful contributions to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5772-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the majority \nleader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada; the Republican leader, Senator \nMitch McConnell of Kentucky; and the respective Members of our two \nparties, but particularly the leadership for their ability to make it \npossible for us to move forward on this very important piece of housing \nlegislation. We have been at this for some time.\n  Every Member in this Chamber, as well as the American people, realize \nthe seriousness of the problem we face as a nation. We have a serious \neconomic crisis in the country, and the heart of that economic crisis \nis the housing crisis. The heart of the housing crisis is the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  Let me begin this discussion by noting that several months ago on two \nprevious occasions we dealt with housing legislation--which I will \npoint out is a part of this larger package today--and at that time we \nwere having about 7,100 foreclosures a day. At least that was the \nnumber of filings of foreclosures when I first announced the level of \nforeclosures that were occurring. The numbers from May have just come \nin. The numbers are now close to 8,500, or 1,500 more than they were \neven 1 month ago. So we are now approaching 9,000 filings of \nforeclosures on a daily basis in our country.\n  In light of these numbers, I hope no one will suggest the problem is \nnot a serious and growing one. We have not even hit July 1 yet when, of \ncourse, we realize the resets on some of these adjustable rate \nmortgages will begin to kick in; and as they do, we are warned by those \nfollowing this issue almost on an hourly basis that the tidal wave of \nforeclosures will increase in the coming months, not decrease.\n  Obviously, with 1.5 million people who have already lost their homes, \nwe are talking about a problem that is now spreading to commercial \nlending, municipal financing, student loans, and even having global \nimplications as well for those who purchased these mortgage-backed \nsecurities. This is not confined to our own country. These were being \npurchased across the globe. So the problem begins with the foreclosure \ncrisis, and yet the effects of it have spread far beyond the individual \nhome, which is obviously the heart of most people's dreams in our \ncountry.\n  So the fact we were able to have our leadership, and Senator Shelby \nwill obviously speak for himself, but both of us, I can say with \nconfidence, are very grateful to Senators Reid and McConnell for making \nit possible for us to move forward on this legislation.\n  I will guarantee that if I were able to write this bill all on my \nown, it would look different. And I promise that Senator Shelby would \nprobably write a different bill himself. But we don't live in a world \nwhere we get to write these things on our own. We serve in a body with \n100 Members, and we have to work closely with others in the Chamber and \nthe other body with 435 Members. We have a White House and an \nadministration with which we have to deal. There are also, obviously, \nprivate interests around the country, from consumer groups and lending \ninstitutions, all having a deep interest in what we are trying to put \ntogether. So it is no easy task to cobble together a piece of \nlegislation that will allow us to deal with this crisis, get us back on \nour feet again, restore some confidence and optimism among the American \npeople so we can see capital begin to flow again, and thus wring \nourselves out of this foreclosure issue and begin to see our economy \ngrow and prosper.\n  That is what brings us to this very moment. I can't begin to express \nmy gratitude to Senator Shelby, who is the former chairman of this \ncommittee, to the members on the Democratic side of the Banking \nCommittee, beginning with Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, along \nwith, of course, the Republican members as well. On two previous \noccasions we have brought forth pieces of legislation that have been \nadopted overwhelmingly by this body with 84 votes on the first bill and \n90 votes on the second.\n  On the matter that will be a part of this bill, which has not been \nconsidered by the full Chamber, it passed our Banking Committee 19 to 2 \nback on May 20. So we come to this day having spent a great deal of \ntime working with our colleagues, listening and working with the \nMembers of the other body, as well as those who bring unique and \nspecial expertise to these very complicated issues. That is what we \nhope in the coming days to be able to complete, send our product to the \nother body, and hope they will endorse and support it, and then send \nthe bill to the President for his signature.\n  With that as background, let me share a few thoughts about what are \nin these bills. As I mentioned already, most of what we are talking \nabout has been voted on overwhelmingly by the Members of this body. On \nApril 10, the Senate passed the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and \npassed it by an overwhelming majority. At that time, I shared my view \nof the legislation, and that it did not quite live up to the title. I \ntold this body we had more work to do to prevent foreclosures in this \ncountry and to strengthen the housing finance system before we could \nsay we had lived up to the name of that bill.\n  I am very happy to report this morning that the Banking Committee of \nthe Senate went back and did that work, and today Senator Shelby and I \nare reporting back to the Senate the Housing and Economic Recovery Act \nof 2008. This legislation incorporates all of the housing provisions of \nH.R. 3221 as it passed the Senate on April 10 by a vote of 84 to 12. It \nalso includes the HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008, which will help at \nleast 400,000 families, we are told, and maybe more, to save their \nhomes from this fate of 8,427 foreclosure filings a day. We need to try \nto put a break on that, if we can, and spare what it does to individual \nhomeowners.\n  The bill creates a new, strong, independent regulator for the housing \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises--the so-called GSEs, Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and the 12 Federal home loan banks. It also establishes a \nnew permanent fund that will help build affordable rental housing for \nlow- and moderate-income families.\n  I will review these titles in more detail momentarily, but first let \nme remind my colleagues why Senator Shelby and I have been working so \nhard on this issue for the past number of months and throughout this \nentire Congress. Quite simply, we are living through the worst housing \nmarket since the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s. Here are the \nfacts, Mr. President.\n  Residential construction in the United States fell by over 30 percent \nin the first quarter of this year. Sales of existing homes fell by 13 \npercent over\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nthe past year. And while the new data for April indicates that sales \nmay have finally picked up slightly, most analysts believe that pickup \nin home sales occurred only because home prices have continued to fall. \nThey call this ``price capitulation,'' which means homeowners finally \ngave up and are dropping prices precipitously at a great loss to their \nfinancial security.\n  The number of new homes that remain unsold continues to rise, \nreaching the highest number in over a quarter of a century. Adding to \nthis number are the increasing number of foreclosed homes.\n  Foreclosures have hit a new all-time record, according to the \nMortgage Banker's Association--MBA. This data shows that almost one in \nevery 11 homes with a mortgage in the country is in default or \nforeclosure, as of the end of March. That is the highest level since \nthe MBA began tracking foreclosures in 1979. Foreclosure rates have \nbeen growing at record levels for some time and last year alone 1.5 \nmillion American homes entered into foreclosure.\n  During each and every day of May, more than 8,400 American families \nentered foreclosure and the projections are that foreclosure rates will \nremain at historic highs for the foreseeable future. In fact, the \ninvestment bank Credit Suisse recently released a report in which they \npredict that 6.5 million homes will fall into foreclosure over the next \n5 years. They state:\n\n       The coming flood of new foreclosures could put 8.4 percent \n     of total homeowners, or 12.7 percent of homeowners with \n     mortgages, out of their homes.\n\n  The scenario that they are describing is one in which one out of \nevery 8 American families with a mortgage would lose their homes. That \nis a chilling prediction.\n  The effect that this is having on our economy cannot be overstated. \nMartin Feldstein, who served as President Reagan's chief economist, \nrecently wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The 10 percent decline in house prices has cut household \n     wealth by more than $2 trillion, reducing consumer spending \n     and increasing the risk of a deep recession.\n\n  That means that American families have lost more than $2 trillion of \nwealth. Losses of that magnitude are staggering. That is almost 20 \npercent of our Nation's annual GDP. Put another way, a national loss of \nwealth of $2 trillion means that a typical family of four will have \nlost over $25,000 of wealth due to the current housing market crisis.\n  This sharp loss in wealth for the average American homeowner comes at \na time when they face record-high prices for the essentials of American \nlife--food, gas, health care, and higher education. So the so-called \nforeclosure crisis is affecting more than those facing foreclosure. It \nis affecting nearly all of us. As one home falls into foreclosure, the \nvalues of countless other homes decline rapidly, if not immediately.\n  Robert Shiller, the widely respected economist, predicted recently \nthat home prices will fall by 30 percent nationally. If that happens, \nthe loss to American families will exceed $6 trillion. That is more \nthan half of our Nation's annual GDP. It would mean that the typical \nfamily of four would have lost approximately $80,000 of wealth. That is \nmore than most American families earn in an entire year.\n  The nationwide implications of this crisis help explain why consumer \nsentiment is at historic lows. Americans' expectations for future \neconomic growth are at the lowest levels in 35 years, since the deep \nrecession of the early 1970s.\n  These negative views about our economic prospects are based on the \nreal experiences of most Americans. The Pew Center recently conducted a \nsurvey on Americans' views on not only the economy as a whole, but on \ntheir personal well being. The Washington Post characterized the Pew \nCenter's findings as:\n\n       Offering the gloomiest assessment of economic well-being in \n     close to half a century, a new survey has found that most \n     Americans say they have not made progress over the past five \n     years as their incomes have stagnated and they have \n     increasingly borrowed money to finance their lifestyles.\n\n  By almost any measure--by any measure, Americans are struggling more \nthan at any time in recent memory. Real median family income has fallen \nthis decade as the costs of gas, health care, and college tuition have \nrisen at levels far outstripping any increases in paychecks. Just to \nkeep pace with these rising costs, Americans have turned to borrowing \nfrom credit cards and their homes. But now, as the crisis in our \ncapital markets begins to threaten sources of liquidity for people, \nsuch as mortgages, student loans and other types of lending, the \nAmerican economy is in a precarious place. That is why we need new \npolicies and new action to prevent this recession from becoming more \nsevere, and to lay the foundation for our recovery.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people to respond to their \nplight and to their pessimism, and to renew their confidence in the \npromise of the American dream.\n  The package Senator Shelby and I bring before the Senate today meets \nthis test. Is it perfect? Hardly. Never is there a piece of legislation \nthat is perfect. Would either of us have done it a bit differently? I \nam confident we would. Are we guaranteeing it will work? Absolutely \nnot. All we know is this is our best judgment, having worked together \nnow for the last year and a half to listen to people at some 50 \ndifferent hearings on a wide range of subject matters. Then we put \ntogether legislation that has enjoyed, I say again with thanks to our \ncolleagues, overwhelming support in this Chamber on a bipartisan basis. \nThat is not something we have done with great frequency, I might point \nout, in recent years. The package is a good one. It is one we think \ncovers many of the issues, if not most of them, with which we are \ngrappling.\n\n  Let me review the major provisions included in this package.\n  First, FHA Modernization. FHA Modernization will help hundreds of \nthousands of homeowners gain access to safer, more affordable loans. \nFHA does not insure the kinds of risky, adjustable rate mortgages that \nso many homeowners were steered into, to their great peril and eventual \nsorrow. I want to point out to my colleagues that the only change from \nthe FHA Modernization provisions passed in April is hat we have \nincreased the maximum loan limit to $625,000, a provision that will \nexpand the reach of this crucial mortgage lifeline to a broader cross-\nsection of the country.\n  Veterans housing provisions--a number of our colleagues included \nimportant improvements to update the loan limits for VA loans; assist \nreturning soldiers avoid rising mortgage rates and foreclosure; and \nexpand housing benefits to disabled veterans.\n  CDBG funds--the bill includes about $3.9 billion in emergency CDBG \nfunds directed to those communities most affected by the foreclosure \ncrisis. These resources will be used to buy foreclosed homes at a \ndiscount, renovate them, and return them to the market. These funds \nwill help turn around neighborhoods decimated by disinvestment by \nbringing in new capital to start rebuilding homes and communities.\n  Counseling Funds--the bill also includes $150 million in additional \nfunds for housing counselors to help keep people out of foreclosure. \nThere are many Members who care about this and were involved and talked \nabout it. This language we have already adopted, but it is in this bill \nas well.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008, another provision in this \nlegislation, creates a new fund at FHA to make loans to distressed \nborrowers to refinance them out of mortgages with payments they cannot \nmake into safe, affordable, 30-year fixed rate loans.\n  Only homeowners--not investors or speculators--will qualify for these \nloans. And the lenders must agree to take steep discounts from the \nexisting outstanding mortgages.\n  Only homeowners who cannot afford their current payments will \nqualify, and, once they take out the new loan, they will have to agree \nto share all newly created equity and future appreciation with FHA to \nhelp defray the Government's cost.\n  We have heard many people voice concerns about this bill, calling it \na taxpayer bailout. Let me assure my colleagues, the Congressional \nBudget Office makes it clear that no taxpayer money will be used to \nfund this program. We pay for this important new program by all or part \nof the first 3 year's funding from the affordable housing fund created \nin the GSE portion of the legislation. Then we have\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\nan additional $2 billion cushion at the Treasury Department, should \nthere be any negative implications.\n  In fact, according to the CBO, this program will make nearly $250 \nmillion for the taxpayers over the next 10 years. In return, we will be \nsaving the American dream for hundreds of thousands of elderly and \nhard-working families; stopping the bleeding in our communities; and \nhelping restore confidence in our capital markets.\n  Finally, this package establishes a new, independent, world class \nregulator for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, \nknown as the housing Government-sponsored enterprises, GSEs. The \nlegislation endows this regulator with broad new authority, equivalent \nto the authority of other Federal financial regulators, to ensure the \nsafe and sound operations of the GSEs. Let me recite the powers \nincluded in this legislation: Establish capital standards; establish \nprudential management standards, including internal controls, audits, \nrisk management, and management of the portfolio; enforce its orders \nthrough cease and desist authority, civil money penalties, and the \nauthority to remove officers and directors; restrict asset growth and \ncapital distributions for undercapitalized institutions; put a \nregulated entity into receivership; and review and approve, subject to \nnotice and comment, new product offerings.\n\n  As we all know, the housing GSEs have played the central role in \nkeeping the mortgage markets functioning. Yet in recent months, like \nmany others in the mortgage industry, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \nlost billions of dollars. It is their very importance that makes it \nimperative that we assure ourselves, and the American people, that the \nGSEs are on solid financial footing so they can continue to serve that \ncrucial function. A strong and of active regulator can help make sure \nthat the GSEs continue to operate in a safe, sound, and effective \nmanner.\n  The new legislation significantly enhances the affordable housing \ncomponent of the GSEs' mission, and expands the number of families \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac can serve by raising the loan limits in \nhigh-cost areas to 150 percent of the comforming loan limit. Currently, \nthis limit would be $625,000.\n  The legislation tightens targeting requirements of the affordable \nhousing goals, and rewrites those goals to ensure that the enterprises \nprovide liquidity to both ownership and rental housing markets for low- \nand very-low income families.\n  Finally, the legislation creates a permanent, new Housing Trust Fund \nand a Capital Magnet Fund, financed by annual contributions from the \nenterprises, which will used for the acquisition or construction of \naffordable rental housing, some ownership housing, and economic \ndevelopment for low-income families and communities.\n  This new affordable housing fund--financed fully by the enterprises--\nwill provide a steady stream of financing to build housing for those \nmost in need. The Capital Magnet Fund requires that each dollar \nleverage at least an additional $10. Together, these programs will \nprovide billions of dollars for new affordable housing in years to \ncome. I want to acknowledge the important contributions of Senator Jack \nReed to this part of the legislation. This is going to be a permanent \nprogram that will make a difference for millions of people in years in \ncome.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Shelby, and his staff, for their \nhard work to reach consensus on this whole package.\n  This is what we are supposed to be doing. This is what we get elected \nto do. We don't get elected to decide exactly what we want to do at the \nexpense of everyone else. It means sitting down and working together to \ncome up with solid ideas that can make a difference in our country. \nToday, 8,427 people are going to start to lose their homes. Tomorrow \nanother 8,427 will have that happen, and that will happen every single \nday until we do something to bring this to a halt. That number has gone \nup by 1,000 families in the last 2 months. We cannot waste another day. \nThere is no other issue which demands our attention and our action more \nthan this one, and any effort to be dilatory and to stop us from saving \nthese people and keeping them in their homes ought to be rejected by \nevery Member of this body.\n  This is a cancer in our society, and it is causing us deep problems. \nWe need to do something about it. Senator Shelby and our staffs and the \nmembers of our committee have worked hard and long to bring this \npackage forward. It enjoys broad-based bipartisan support, as we hoped \nit would. Now we have a chance to complete action on this and to make a \ndifference and to say to the American people: In this Congress, we did \nsomething. We stepped up and tried to make a difference for that great \ndream of home ownership, of raising your family in a decent house, of \nbeing able to provide for your long-term security, of making a \ndifference for your neighborhoods and communities. We are going to do \neverything we can to see to it that these numbers decline, that \nforeclosures at this rate on a daily basis are going to stop in our \ncountry.\n  Again, we say to you, we realize not everyone agrees with what we are \ndoing here.\n  You never can here. I have been here for 27 years. The greatest \nmoments of this body are where people have come together to try and \nmake a difference, not trying to get their own way all the time. You \nare part of a larger body representing a great country. And even though \nyou come from one State and one area of the Nation, we all have a job \nto do, to take care of all of us in this country.\n  While this problem does not affect every citizen of the country, it \nis growing. If we do not do something soon about it, we will be \nindicted by history for not doing it.\n  I thank my great friend from Alabama, who has been a great chairman \nof this subcommittee, been a great member of this committee, and he has \nworked awfully hard to bring us to this moment. I am grateful to Harry \nReid and to Mitch McConnell for making it possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this morning I am pleased to join my \ncolleague, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Chris \nDodd. The Banking Committee has devoted considerable time and effort to \ndeveloping comprehensive and complex housing legislation. The proposed \nlegislation's most significant provisions include a new regulatory \nstructure for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank \nsystem, a new program to help qualified homeowners stay in their homes, \nand reforming the FHA.\n  This legislation creates a new regulator who has the authority and \nthe flexibility to regulate the GSEs appropriately. I am also pleased \nthat the HOPE for Homeowners proposal is paid for; not by taxpayer's \nmoney either. I believe we should do what we can to help struggling \nhomeowners, short of asking the taxpayers to foot the bill.\n  The legislation also provides immediate help to the marketplace by \nreforming the Federal Housing Administration, allowing it to provide \ngreater liquidity and thereby enhancing the options available to \nAmerica's homeowners.\n  It also provides additional funding for foreclosure prevention \ncounseling, which will hopefully help homeowners stay current on their \nmortgages and able to remain in their homes.\n  In order to prevent this situation from repeating itself, the \nlegislation increases the disclosures made to consumers obtaining \nmortgages. I believe that giving consumers more information and a \ngreater ability to understand the choices they are making will help \nthem avoid the pitfalls and bad decisions many underinformed consumers \nmade in the recent past.\n  To better protect our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, this legislation \nextends additional consumer protections and provides those returning \nfrom combat a chance to get back on their feet before they face \nforeclosure of their homes.\n  In an effort to provide communities with the ability to clean up the \ndamage caused by foreclosures that have already occurred, we have also \nincluded funding to allow States and communities to buy up and repair \nforeclosed residences. Attached to this funding is a requirement--here \nI think this is important--that any profit from the sale of properties \nmust be used to buy and repair additional properties. I believe\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nthe reuse of this funding in this manner will maximize the impact of \nthese dollars and minimize the possibility that funds will be wasted or \nprofits inappropriately pocketed by someone.\n  The bill also contains a number of tax-related provisions prepared in \na bipartisan fashion by the chairman and the ranking member and the \nstaffs of the Finance Committee.\n  While there is a large and growing number of homes entering \nforeclosure in this country, we must remember that the vast majority of \nhomeowners are living within their means and making their mortgage \npayment. Therefore, my primary consideration here during negotiations \non this bill has been to protect the American taxpayer. In creating a \nstrong regulator for the GSEs and using an independent funding stream \nto pay for the FHA program, I believe we have met that goal.\n  With crises such as this one we are facing now in this country, I \nbelieve the American people expect us to provide effective and timely \nsolutions the best we can. Chairman Dodd and I have worked together to \ndevelop a package of targeted measures intended to stabilize and \nstrengthen the housing financial markets.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this carefully crafted \ncompromise.\n  I remind my colleagues that this bill came out of the Banking \nCommittee 19 to 2. That is a strong vote for a bipartisan measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  I want to read this list into the Record to give our colleagues some \nsense of the broad support this proposal has developed. Let me quote \nfrom several of our major editorials as well as major economists \nrepresenting the political spectrum in our country. I will share this \nwith you.\n  Alex Pollack, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute:\n\n       This is an appropriate and targeted approach to the \n     downward spiral caused by the deflation of the great housing \n     and mortgage bubble of the 21st century.\n\n  Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton University and the former \nvice chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System:\n\n       I think that the HOPE for Homeowners bill is the most \n     important piece of economic legislation before the Congress \n     today.\n\n  The Miami Herald:\n\n       The Senate represents a bipartisan compromise that deserves \n     wide support.\n\n  The Boston Globe:\n\n       There is no bailout or windfall here. Congress is merely \n     offering a fighting chance for families and credit markets to \n     recover.\n\n  Newsday:\n\n       The Senate program is called Hope for Homeowners. That's \n     just what families facing foreclosure need.\n\n  Fran Grossman, the senior vice president of Shore Bank in Chicago:\n\n       With millions of hard working Americans torn between \n     looking for work and putting gas in the tank or paying their \n     mortgage, we must enact legislation to provide access to the \n     resources that will help families to hold onto the American \n     dream and get our economy moving again.\n\n  Robert Shiller, as I pointed out earlier, supports this legislation. \nHe is highly respected, by the way, as someone who deals with the issue \nof the index dealing with housing values.\n  Again, groups from the American Enterprise Institute to the Consumer \nFederation of America.\n  Alan Fishbein. Let me quote him:\n\n       With foreclosures on the rise a stepped-up Federal lifeline \n     is desperately needed if many hard-pressed families are to \n     save their homes.\n\n  From the Consumer Federation of America to members of the American \nEnterprise Institute, former members of the Federal Reserve Board, \nmembers of the Reagan administration, the Council of Economic Advisers, \nothers, all are advocating--and I am not suggesting dotting every ``i'' \nand crossing every ``t.'' But they have taken this work of Senator \nShelby and 17 of our other colleagues of the 21-member committee, 19 \nout of 21 having gone through all of the hearings, 50 of them over the \nlast year, listening to all sorts of people talking about what needs to \nbe done. It is now the bipartisan overwhelming majority opinion of us \non that committee that this package we offer here is our best step \nforward.\n  Having done the work for a year now, spending the hours that we have \nlistening to people and getting solid advice, this is what we believe, \nas they believe, is the best response America can make at this moment.\n  Remember, this HOPE for Homeowners is voluntary; it does not mandate \nanything. It creates an opportunity for people. We hope they will take \nadvantage of it when this legislation is signed into law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5775-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5775-S5819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House with respect to H.R. 3221, and that the only \namendments in order today be those relating to the subject of housing, \nexcept the amendment I will offer on behalf of Senators Dodd and \nShelby, in my motion to concur in the amendment of the House, striking \nsection 1, and all that follows through the end of title V, and \ninserting certain language to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. 3221, \nand that no other motions, except motions to reconsider and motions to \ntable, be in order during today's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I \nappreciate the leader's sensitivity to some concerns we expressed \nyesterday on the length of this bill and the fact that probably very \nfew, if any, of us have had a chance to read it, as well as his \nsensitivities to a slew of credible media reports that question some of \nthe intents in the bill.\n  We all know the housing crisis is an issue in this country, and we do \nneed to look at what we can do as a Senate to relieve the foreclosures \nand to help Americans stay in their homes. But we need to do it in a \nway the American people trust. We are trying to get through this bill. \nWe know it has been changed since the committee has considered it.\n  I ask the leader if he would consider a modification of his agreement \nthat we be assured that before this bill is finished, we will have an \nopportunity in the minority to offer an amendment that would refer the \nbill to the committee with instructions to report what direct benefits \nCountrywide or other financial institutions would receive from this \nlegislation. Would the leader be willing to modify his agreement to \ninclude that?\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from South Carolina, the distinguished \nSenator, and I remind everyone, that 75 percent of this bill has \nalready been passed and was done by a very big vote.\n  The 25 percent we are working on now--we hope to work on--is work \nthat has been done on a bipartisan basis. And much of it, if not all of \nit, was in total consideration with the White House. So I say to my \nfriend, let's go ahead and we will legislate on this bill today, the \nSenator not objecting. I will be happy to sit down with Senator DeMint \nalone, with the minority leader, anyone else, and talk about the \nconcerns you have, as you have indicated, as to benefits going to \nwhomever they go to, and let us see if we can get from here to there by \napproaching it in that manner.\n  But as I indicated yesterday, this is important legislation. We want \nto make sure there are no problems with any Senators who have other \nconcerns. So, in short, let me say this: My friend loses nothing by \nallowing us to go to the bill as indicated in this consent agreement. \nAnd then any time during the day, I will be happy to meet with him and \nthe other eight Senators, together or alone, who signed that letter, \nand the distinguished Republican leader can suggest whomever, if \nanyone, he wants in on that meeting. I will be happy to work with the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I do not feel qualified as an individual member to make \nthe\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\njudgments that I think the committee could. Our hope was to have an up-\nor-down vote at one point to allow this body to at least decide if we \nshould refer this back to the committee to look at that specific area, \nto make sure there is complete transparency, and to address what \nbenefits some of these companies have.\n  All we want is an up-or-down vote, not necessarily a determination of \nhow the bill should be changed. I certainly cannot determine. We have \nhad one media source say it is $25 billion to Countrywide. We thought \nthe committee had indicated $2.5 billion. Certainly, because of the \nmedia promotion of this, this has become a national issue. So our hope \nis that, again, before the bill is over--not today; it is certainly a \nreasonable request to deal with housing amendments today--but that the \nleader would assure us that before this bill is finished, we would have \nan up-or-down vote on referring it back to committee.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, I can't give him \nassurance that there will be a vote, but I do give assurance that we \nwill sit down and talk with him and do what we can to pacify his \ninterests. What I mean by that is, there may be another way we can get \nfrom where we are today to where he thinks we should go. We will be \nhappy to work with the Senator throughout the day. I give him the \nassurance, without any reservation, that his concern is not untoward, \nand we will be happy to sit down and see if there is a way we can \naccomplish what he wants to accomplish, as I said, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina and the eight other Senators who wrote me the letter.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader's reasonableness. \nI would like to work with him. Again, the goal is not to pacify me but \nto make sure the American people can look on us and know we have had an \nopen and transparent process. I trust the leader and respect him and \nhow he will approach that. For that reason, I will not object to the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from South \nCarolina for allowing us to go forward today. As he knows full well, we \nhave been complaining on this side that we have not been allowed to \nlegislate on frequent occasions lately. The majority leader has \noutlined a way to go forward today that allows us to do what we used to \ndo in the Senate, which is to actually offer amendments related to the \nsubject and vote on them. I believe this is a good way to proceed. I \nthank the majority leader for his accommodation, and I thank my good \nfriend from South Carolina as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the unanimous \nconsent request is agreed to, and it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Chair lays before the Senate a message \nfrom the House with respect to H.R. 3221, which the clerk report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the title of the bill (H.R. 3221) entitled ``An act \n     to move the United States toward greater energy independence \n     and security, developing innovative new technologies, \n     reducing carbon emissions, creating green jobs, protecting \n     consumers, increasing clean renewable energy production, and \n     modernizing our energy infrastructure, and to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives for \n     the production of renewable energy and energy conservation,'' \n     do pass with amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4983\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the amendment of the \nHouse, striking section 1 and all that follows to the end of title V, \nand inserting certain language, to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. \n3221 with the amendment at the desk. Basically, so everyone knows what \nthis is, it is the bipartisan Dodd-Shelby amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dodd, for \n     himself and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 4983 \n     to the House amendment striking section 1 through title V and \n     inserting certain language to H.R. 3221.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let the games begin. We are open for \nbusiness. If Members have amendments they would like to raise, Senator \nShelby and I are here, and we would like to move along. I know there \nare Members who have plans they would like to do later this week, \nperhaps for the weekend, but if we can move quickly, who knows what \nmight happen, since we have done two-thirds of the bill already with \noverwhelming votes, with a couple modest changes in it. We have \nincreased loan limits in a couple of areas. We invite our colleagues to \ncome over. If they want any questions answered about this, we have \nstaff here as well as members of the committee. We are prepared to \nentertain amendments and move forward on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Change In Oregon's Forests\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am honoring a commitment and \nsubmitting for public review a proposal to protect old-growth forests \nand to aggressively move to restore, through thinning, the millions of \nacres of at-risk forests across the State of Oregon.\n  The novelist Ellen Glasgow once remarked:\n\n       The only difference between a rut and a grave is their \n     dimensions.\n\n  We find ourselves today in a decades-old rut that threatens our \nforests and our lives like never before. It is time for change for \nOregon forests, and that change can only begin with new ideas--ideas \nthat depart radically from recent decades of forest mismanagement, old-\ngrowth destruction, catastrophic fire, and political gamesmanship.\n  We must break this cycle of endless fighting, of old, unwinnable \nbattles in the woods that now endanger our forests and communities \nalike. We must make the preparations now to move forward, under new \nnational leadership in 2009, to restore our treasured and endangered \nforests with sustainable, ecologically beneficial restoration thinning \nwhile permanently protecting the few remaining old-growth forests we \nhave left.\n  We ought to be creating new and sustainable jobs in forestry for now \nand for the future and finally achieve the economic and ecological \npromise of the Northwest Forest Plan. It is my view that it is critical \nto change the mindset of Federal land management bureaucracies by \nrequiring large-scale efforts to address the obscene backlog of at-risk \nforests and by restoring the tools and the public trust required to \naccomplish these jobs. In short, we must change the way the Federal \nGovernment manages forests, and especially Oregon's forests.\n  I am hopeful my proposal--driven by science and the will of the \npeople of Oregon to end the destruction of old growth and to restore \nour at-risk forests through sustainable thinning--can help begin a new \ndialog that leads to change that is so desperately needed.\n  So I invite all Oregonians to review my proposal and to share their \nthoughts at my Web site: www.wyden.senate.gov. My staff and I will \nreview those comments and seek to improve upon it before it is formally \nintroduced as legislation in the Senate.\n  Our forests are the foundation of our natural, historical, and \nsociological culture. Unfortunately, decades of scientifically unsound \nforest management have created dangerous risks that now threaten our \nforests and our cultural identity.\n  Instead of making progress on the huge backlog of priority management \nprojects that could restore our forests, Presidentially imposed \npolitical agendas have taken precedence, for well over a decade now, \nover commonsense opportunities to move forward to an\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\necologically sound, economically advantageous, and sustainable forest \nfuture.\n  Scientifically unsupportable agendas and the resulting cycle of \nmistrust, litigation, and institutional paralysis now threaten vast \ntracts of Oregon's forest land and especially what remains of Oregon's \nancient forests.\n  The Federal Government owns more than half of my State. That probably \nis a little bit different than it is in Rhode Island, but it is the \ncase, and most of it is forest land. Due to decades of poorly designed, \neven-aged management and fire suppression, we have millions of acres of \nchoked, second-growth forest at an unacceptably high risk for disease, \ncatastrophic fires, and insect infestation. Fire, disease, and \ninfestation certainly don't respect geographic boundaries, but they \nsure present a severe risk to private landowners and communities alike.\n  In 2008, at our Oregon Economic Summit in Portland, I announced that \nI will begin work on a proposal to address the bureaucratic and \npolitical roadblocks that prevent restoring millions of acres of \nchoked, second-growth plantations in moist west side forests and the \nmany at-risk dry forests, particularly found in the eastern and \nsouthern part of my State. I said I would work to avoid a return of the \ncounterproductive and senseless forest battles of the past several \ndecades--battles fought over logging in old growth and environmentally \nsensitive forests, areas which tend to be far more fire resistant and \nplay a critical role in water quality and species protection.\n  Today, I am honoring the commitment I made to the people of Oregon, \nand I intend to use my chairmanship of the Senate Subcommittee on \nPublic Lands and Forests to attempt to bring my home State the changes \nthat our forests so desperately need.\n  The guiding premise of my proposal is to direct and help the Federal \nland agencies move forward quickly with local input on what should be \nthe most critical, least controversial objectives to restoring our \nFederal forests in Oregon and to move those agencies away from \npractices that have been widely discredited and are not supported by \nthe public.\n  In short, my proposal expedites restoration of Oregon's forests by \nthinning the millions of acres of choked plantations and dry, at-risk \nforests that pose a risk to lives, forests, and property. It also \nattempts to begin the task of restoring public trust in Federal land \nmanagement agencies by permanently ending the commercial logging of \nOregon's old growth forests. Forest Service and BLM managers in my \nState would be given new direction based on the principles of \nrestoration forestry. Overstocked stands that I have been referring to \nand stands unhealthy due to a lack of age or species diversity would \nbecome the focus of this proposal. The managers would be instructed to \navoid all old growth and inventoried roadless areas and incorporate a \ncomprehensive aquatic conservation strategy into all projects. \nActivities conducted under this new management direction would receive \nexpedited administrative procedures and limits on administrative \nappeals because they would then be focusing on critical priorities in \nthe noncontroversial areas.\n  This proposal further works to restore the trust of the public in our \nFederal land agencies by giving those agencies an incentive to pursue \nnew, sustainable forest management directives and to create the first \never automatic, independent review of the agencies' forest management \nactions, as well as new openness, transparency, and accountability for \nthe actions by these agencies.\n  The overwhelming body of scientific evidence assigns a negative \necological value to the cutting down of Oregon's remaining old growth \nforests. Science has demonstrated time and time again that old and \nmature trees play an indispensable role in preserving water quality for \ncommunities, preserving critical wildlife habitat, and storing the \ncarbon gases that contribute to global warming. Further, the evidence \nshows that those older trees are far more resistant to fire than \nyounger trees. Equally important, after the disappearance of over 90 \npercent of Oregon's old growth, the people of my State no longer \nsupport the cutting of what little old growth remains on our public \nlands.\n  In the drier forests found predominantly, but not exclusively, on the \neast side of Oregon, the old growth picture is a bit more complicated \ndue to decades of questionable management. Many scientists and \nenvironmentalists agree that more active forest management will have to \nbe pursued quickly on the east side forests if there is going to be a \ngenuine effort to save the native older trees and restore a healthy, \ndiverse, and more fire-resistant mix to forests currently under a \nrelentless and devastating assault by fire, disease, and insects.\n  For these reasons, I propose a permanent protection from logging for \nall remaining old growth and mature trees in Oregon's Federal forests. \nIn the mostly west side ``moist'' forests, no tree currently 120 years \nor older would be allowed to be cut ever again for commercial purposes. \nIn the drier forests, no tree currently 150 years or older would be \nallowed to ever again be cut for commercial purposes. The decades-old \ndebate over the fate of old growth in Oregon would finally come to an \nend.\n  This is a crisis which cries out for action across the millions of \nacres of choked, at-risk forests in our State, and reasonable people on \nboth sides of the forestry issue need to come together so that we get \nfresh policies and Oregon doesn't suffer foolishly and needlessly lose \nmore forests, property, and lives.\n  What I propose today is to shift the focus of our Federal land \nagencies off of logging old growth and other environmentally sensitive \nareas and on to addressing the horrific backlog of desperately needed \nrestoration thinning in the Federal forests. This involves harvesting \nground and ladder fuels in areas that ought to be considered \nnoncontroversial, fuels that currently endanger old growth in other \nhealthy forests--Federal, State, and private alike--as well as \nendangering human and animal life. The new required management focus \nwill also allow for the economic potential of the Northwest Forest Plan \nto be secured.\n  This proposal envisions that in many cases it is going to be possible \nto achieve the goals I have set out by bringing about collaboration \nfrom timber industry groups and environmental leaders. I have already \nseen great collaborative successes like this in the Siuslaw, Colville, \nand other national forests, with the help of organizations such as \nOregon Wild, the Nature Conservancy, and K-S Wild. My proposal creates \nincentives for these partnerships, but due to the enormous and \ndangerous backlog of work, it is my view that collaborative efforts \nsuch as these must be stepped up; they must come at an accelerated \npace.\n\n  Unfortunately, history has shown that it is not possible to rely just \non good will, and that is especially the case if you don't find a way \nto discourage the cycle of endless administrative appeals and \nlitigation that has produced Federal agency inertia and undermined even \nthe most commonsense management efforts in our forests.\n  Under my proposal, each Oregon Federal forest and BLM district would \nbe empowered to create a landscape-level restoration project of up to \n25,000 acres designed by local collaboration organizations. If \ncollaboration is not achieved, the land agency would be allowed to go \nforward but on a smaller scale of up to 10,000 acres.\n  One of the reasons there have been endless appeals and litigation is \nthat over the past several decades, the level of public trust of \nFederal public land agencies has fallen to such unhealthy levels that \nit is impossible to conduct even routine and commonsense forest \nmanagement projects. An era of mistrust of these agencies and the \naccompanying legacy of public protests, appeals, and litigation have \nproduced what I consider to be an institutional paralysis in these land \nagencies, and it must be reversed. To begin to restore public trust and \nempower the land agencies to move forward aggressively, I believe the \nproposal I offer today will bring an unprecedented level of scrutiny, \ntransparency, and accountability to the forest projects that are \nconducted under the new authorities I propose.\n  I borrow in this regard from a model that has been used by fisheries \nregulated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency that employ \nobservers to monitor the bycatch of fish.\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\nUnder my proposal, independent forest observers hired and managed by \nthe independent inspectors general of the Agriculture and Interior \nDepartments, who will monitor all of the projects that are conducted \nunder the proposal I offer today to make sure the prohibitions against \ncutting old growth and mature trees, and cutting trees in roadless \nareas--that those protections are strictly observed. The forest \nobserver reports will be made available to the public online, and \nFederal forests found violating the Federal protections would lose \ntheir ability to provide expedited project authorities for several \nyears as a penalty.\n  Finally, for the sake of our environment, economy, and our way of \nlife, my hope is that an approach such as I offer today is going to \nmake it possible to create thousands of new jobs and restore the health \nof our forests. The only way to produce this kind of change is to put \nnew ideas forward, bold ideas that break out of the old rut that has \nproduced so much institutional paralysis, and move to an approach that \nprotects our forests, protects our communities, and protects a new \nopportunity to create family wage employment.\n  I am certain there are many additional issues Oregonians are going to \nwant to consider and suggestions they will have to improve this \nproposal. I wish to make it clear that starting today, with this \nproposal online, I invite and welcome the people of Oregon to weigh in \nso that it will be possible, at the end of their opportunity to be \nheard and offer their suggestions, to go forward with a concrete, \nspecific proposal to break bold, new ground with respect to forestry \nand provide the changes the public so desperately desires.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to ask \nfor unanimous consent to speak as in morning business and to lock in an \norder, but I wish to say, while we are on the housing bill, that I will \nbe coming and offering again a slim-downed amendment that had been \ndeclared not germane to the housing bill before, in order to promote \npeople to be able to stay in their homes by withdrawing from their \n401(k) savings plan without paying the 10-percent penalty. I will be \noffering that amendment. We are getting it scored again by the \nCongressional Budget Office. We think its impact will be much less, and \nI will be conferring with the chairman and the ranking member of the \ncommittee as we approach that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be followed by the Senator from New Hampshire for 10 minutes as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I intend to speak on the \nbill, and I presume it will be for about 10 minutes, but I am not sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                             Energy Prices\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have quite a brouhaha that \nwas stirred up in my State of Florida when the President and Senator \nMcCain both announced their position--a changed position for Senator \nMcCain--that all of the offshore lands on the continental United States \nbe drilled for oil and gas. Presently, most of those offshore lands are \nunder a Presidential moratorium until the year 2012, save for the Gulf \nof Mexico off the west coast of Florida, which is under statutory \nprohibition to drill until the year 2022. It has caused quite a \nbrouhaha because both Senator McCain and the President have said that \nif you want to lower the $4 price of gas that people are hurting under, \nwhat you have to do is drill.\n  But what they have neglected to say is that there are 65 million \nacres, onshore and offshore, which have already been leased, that the \noil companies have not drilled. So if you want to drill as if that were \nthe answer to lowering gas prices--which it is not, and I will tell you \nwhy in just a minute--you have plenty of land and submerged land in \nwhich to drill. So why don't you drill?\n  It is being used as a red herring to get everybody off of what we \nought to do, which is eliminate our addiction to oil and start going to \nalternative sources, which is ultimately the solution.\n  Let's take the President's and Senator McCain's point of view that \nyou are going to lower gas prices by drilling. As a matter of fact, the \nPresident's own administration has said--the Energy Information \nAdministration, in their annual report last year, has said--that \ndrilling in the offshore of the continental United States will not have \nany affect on gas prices until after the year 2030. That is 22 years \ninto the future. So the internal documents that have just emerged in \nthe Bush administration belie the very same thing that the President \nand Senator McCain were trying to do.\n  What are they trying to do? The administration is trying to give away \nthe store before they leave town. They are trying to help the oil \ncompanies. How do they do it? The value of an oil company is, in part, \ndetermined by how many reserves of oil and gas they own. Therefore, if \nthey have additional acres of leases that have not been produced both \nonshore and offshore, which is considered a reserve--and that is \ncertainly a value--and that is listed as an asset on the books of the \noil companies, and the greater amount of land they can have that has \nsome proven oil and gas deposits, the greater their asset value even \nthough it is not being drilled and not produced, which is the very \nreason they say we ought to drill. But, of course, that is belied by \nthe fact that they already have 65 million acres they have not drilled.\n  By the way, 31 million acres of that is in the Gulf of Mexico. This \nSenator has fought for years. I first started this fight in 1982 as a \nyoung Congressman over in the House of Representatives, when a \nSecretary of the Interior, named James Watt, wanted to drill off the \nentire east coast of the United States, from Cape Hatteras, NC, all the \nway south to Fort Pierce, FL. I have been fighting this since then.\n  Why? Clearly, there is an economic reason in our State. We have a \n$65-billion-a-year tourism industry that depends on pristine beaches. \nClearly, there is an environmental reason, which is that the bays and \nestuaries are necessary for so much of the spawning of the marine life \nin both the Atlantic and the gulf. But the other reason is that almost \nthe entire Gulf of Mexico off of Florida--that area which is prohibited \nin statute, which Senator Martinez and I were able to pass 2 years \nago--that area is the largest testing and training area for the U.S. \nmilitary in the world. It is where we train our pilots in live-fire \nexercises. It is where we have joint sea and air and, combined with \nEglin Air Force Base, land operations. It is where some of the most \nsophisticated weapons systems that have to be shot for hundreds of \nmiles are tested.\n  We have a letter from the Secretary of Defense that says drilling for \noil and gas would be incompatible with the use of the U.S. military, \nand that is the main testing and training area for the U.S. military in \nthe world. As a matter of fact, it was that very excuse that I used \nback in 1982, as a young Congressman, facing down the Secretary of the \nInterior, James Watt, when he wanted to drill off the east coast of \nFlorida in the Atlantic because one thing they omitted to find was, how \ncan you have oil rigs out there off the east coast of Florida, where we \nare dropping solid rocket boosters in the launch of a space shuttle and \nthe first stages of the expendable booster rockets coming out of the \nCape Canaveral Air Force Station in all of our space launches? You \nsimply can't. Thus, that was the reason I was able to defeat it back in \nthe 1980s. And here we are, still carrying these arguments on.\n  Mr. President, no, this is not the answer. The answer, if you want to \ndrill, is to go on and drill. You have the leased land, on land and \nsubmerged land. The real answer to the question of $4 gas or $140-a-\nbarrel oil at the end of the day is to wean ourselves from total \ndependence upon that oil with alternative fuels so that we start having \nalternative fuels, such as ethanol, made from things that we don't eat, \nsynthetic fuel made from coal. How do you think Germany fueled its war \nmachine during World War II when they\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nwere embargoed on oil? They made synthetic fuel from their coal \nreserve. The United States has 300 years of coal reserves. Using our \nyankee ingenuity and research and development to develop new engines, \nnew technology, and new fuels--did you see where Honda came out that \nthey are going to produce the first mass-produced hydrogen engine car? \nThis is the beginning of the change of weaning ourselves from total \ndependence on oil.\n  In the meantime, what can we do about oil which last week spiked $11 \nper barrel in 1 day and has gone all the way up to $140 a barrel? What \nis it? Is it just the tightness of supply and demand in the world \nmarket? That is part of it. But an ExxonMobil executive, 2 months ago, \ntestified to Congress that supply and demand would say that oil is $55 \na barrel. So what is the difference between $55 a barrel and what it \nsold for last week at $140? The biggest difference is an unregulated \ncommodities trading market that allows speculators, who are not going \nto use the oil, who are just bidding on the contracts--and they keep \nbidding that price up and up and up.\n  We did one thing about that last night when we passed the farm bill \nbecause in the farm bill was a part that partially started to \nreregulate those commodities markets. But it wasn't enough. You need to \ncome in and put energy commodities clearly back in the regulation by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If you do that, then they \nwill require those bidding on oil contracts for future delivery of oil \nto say they actually are going to use most of that oil instead of just \nspeculating on the price and driving it up and up.\n  It is true the weakness of the U.S. dollar plays into this a little \nbit, and something we can do about that is balance the budget and \nstrengthen the dollar because oil is traded in U.S. dollars. The \nweakness of the dollar, compared to other currencies of the world, \nmakes the stronger currencies bid up the price of oil in dollars. But \nthe main reason is speculation. We simply have to be realistic, with \ncommon sense, as to what we are going to do about $4 gas from which our \npeople are hurting so much.\n  Sometimes I have been a lonely voice because it is easy and seductive \nto say, with $4 gas, we ought to drill. But I hope I have demonstrated \nto the Senate that the problem is much more complicated and that we \ncannot simply drill our way out of the problem.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am seeking recognition on the bill in \nmorning business, but first I will comment on the oil issue. I am \nrising primarily to speak to the bill, which has been brought to the \nfloor by the Senators from Connecticut and Alabama--and I congratulate \nthem--at a time when there hasn't been a lot of effort to do business \nin a cooperative way to produce positive events for our Nation or \nGovernment. They have done it, and they deserve a tremendous amount of \npraise for that. I have not had a chance to read the whole bill, but I \nhave listened to what they are planning to do. We have worked with \ntheir staffs. Up until a couple of weeks ago, we were working \nreasonably close, and Senator Shelby has been a force for progress. In \nmy opinion, they appear to be on the right track. I want to get into \nthe specifics of why I feel that way in a second.\n\n\n                        Offshore Oil Exploration\n\n  First, I wish to talk about the oil issue, about whether or not we \nexplore offshore. The proposal we have seen for energy that has been \nbrought to the floor so far, primarily by the other side, has been to \ndo three basic things. One is to litigate; sue the oil cartels. If you \nare the Saudis, and America gives American attorneys a new right to sue \nyou, or if you are the Emirates States or some other oil-producing \nnation, you are going to be affronted by the fact that the United \nStates would suddenly turn to its legal community and say: You can sue \nthese other nations. I suspect my reaction, were I running a government \nof one of those countries that had oil reserves, would be to say, A, we \ndon't need you, we don't need to sell you this oil; or, B, reinvest in \nyour economy with the proceeds from purchasing this oil.\n  Our economy, to a large degree, is dependent upon people being \nwilling to invest in it, both domestically and also internationally. \nObviously, the petrodollars that are floating around the world because \nof the price of oil are a significant part of the investment capital in \nthis world, and we are shipping overseas massive amounts of our capital \nto purchase oil. That is one of the biggest problems with the fact that \nwe are buying all this foreign oil at ridiculously high prices.\n  We should not take an action that essentially would be cutting off \nour nose to spite our face by saying: We are going to sue you if you \ndon't do what we want relative to our laws and relative to cartels. \nTheir laws don't bar cartels. They don't have to invest in the United \nStates. I suspect they would limit their investment through their \nsovereign funds in the United States were we to take that action. That \nwould not produce more energy for us.\n  The second proposal is to take a percentage of the profits of our \ndomestic oil companies because, I guess we believe that as a Congress \nwe can spend those profits better than those domestic oil companies. \nFirst off, those domestic oil companies don't make up the majority of \nproducers in this world. In fact, only 6 percent of the proven reserves \nin the world are controlled by publicly held companies. The rest are \ncontrolled by companies that are managed by governments, the Saudi \ncompany being the biggest. But you have Venezuelan companies, Chinese \ncompanies, and the Russians, and you have a series of nations, of \ncourse, that have control over their supply. So supply is not \ncontrolled by these private companies. And their profit, if we take it \nas a government, is not going to give us the capacity to produce more \noil. We are going to take that money as a Congress and spend it on \nwhatever interest group we think is important today. We will probably \nspend it on some program to help out people who are trying to buy their \nenergy. But that is not going to produce more oil. That is not going to \nproduce more exploration.\n\n  Remember, these companies are owned by Americans, for the most part. \nThey are owned by Americans through pension funds. People who work for \nunions own these companies, people who work in businesses own these \ncompanies, people who have a job and have a 401(k) own these companies. \nThe profits flow back to two different actions: One, exploration; or \ntwo, dividends--dividends running to American citizens, most of whom \nare retired, or many of whom are retired. So to simply say, well, their \nprofits are too high and we are going to grab them as a government and \nspend that money because we can spend that money more efficiently and \nbetter than those companies--because they are evil, they are oil \ncompanies--is, again, cutting off our nose to spite our face.\n  It won't produce more exploration. It will produce less. It will take \nfrom Americans who have invested in those companies through their \npension funds and their dividends. That makes no sense.\n  The things that make sense are: More conservation, more renewables--\nboth of which I strongly support--and also more exploration in the \nUnited States. Produce more American energy--clean energy, hopefully. \nOne way to do that, of course, is to expand nuclear power. But another \nway is to look for reserves where we have reserves, and where we can \nlook for them in an environmentally sound way. One way is to take a \nlook at oil shale. That is a great opportunity. We have more oil \nreserves in oil shale, three times more in oil reserves in oil shale, \nthan Saudi Arabia has in plain oil. We have over 2 trillion barrels of \nreserves in oil shale, and we are not using it. We are not using it \nbecause it is on public lands and we have been barred by the activists \nand the environmental communities from using that oil. Remember, the \nway you produce that oil is underground. You don't produce it \naboveground. So there is no destruction of the surface area of the \nground.\n  Secondly, there is the fact that we have proven we know how to drill. \nWe know how to explore in the ocean. The greatest example of that was \nKatrina. Here is the largest hurricane to hit the American shore in \nhistory, as far as damage is concerned--it wiped out one of our great \ncities, New Orleans, then came right up the Gulf of Mexico--and\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nnot a barrel of oil was spilled, even though the Gulf of Mexico is \nfilled with drilling rigs. Why is that? Because we know what we are \ndoing. We have the technology to drill and to produce from the Outer \nContinental Shelf in an environmentally sound and safe way, even in the \nface of a force 5 hurricane.\n  So of all that has been proposed here and that makes sense is let's \nlook for other places where we can produce oil, American oil, off our \nshores, if States agree to it. That is the caveat: If a State agrees to \nit. Now, if Florida doesn't want to do it, that is their choice. \nLouisiana does want to do it, Mississippi does want to do it, Alabama \ndoes want to do it. Virginia wants to do it, but Virginia is barred \nfrom doing it because we have a Federal law saying even if Virginia \nwants to do it, they can't do it. That makes no sense.\n  Why should we be buying oil from people who hate us, who want to \ndestroy our civilization and do us in, when we can produce it off of \nStates, where the States agree, where the people of those States agree \nthey are willing to explore because they know it can be done in an \nenvironmentally safe and sound way? That makes no sense.\n  I am sorry to get off on that tangent, but I had to, because this is \na topic of current concern and the Senator from Florida raised a number \nof issues on this question.\n  To return to the issue at hand, however, the bill brought to the \nfloor by Senators Dodd and Shelby, whom I just finished praising for \ntheir excellent effort here--as a conservative, it is not my \ninclination to have the Government step into the marketplace. In fact, \nthat is anathema to me in most instances, and I am fairly resistant to \nit. I think I have as good a record on trying to keep the Government \nout of unnecessary interference in the marketplace as anyone else \naround here, and certainly have a very conservative fiscal record. But \nI have an experience here which I think lends some knowledge on what is \nhappening and what we need to do.\n  I was Governor of the State of New Hampshire in the late 1980s and \nearly 1990s when we went through a massive real estate bubble meltdown. \nIt was incredibly destructive to the Southwest and to New England. The \nSouthwest's was caused by a large amount of fraud, regrettably, and in \nNew England it was caused by excessive speculation, especially in \ncommercial real estate development. As a result of that, we had seven \nmajor banks in New Hampshire in late 1989 and five of them went \nbankrupt. The other two would have gone under, except they were owned \nby larger banks from outside of New Hampshire that were able to come in \nand give them the capital to sustain themselves. Numerous other smaller \nbanks, community banks, went under. Lending contracted, people's home \nvalues, as a result of the bubble bursting, dropped by between 30 and \n50 percent. It was a horrific time for our citizenry in New England, \nand it was an incredibly difficult time economically.\n  How did we get out of this? There were a lot of things done, but one \nof the key things that was done was the Resolution Trust Corporation. \nThe leadership of the FDIC at that time, led by Bill Seidman, and the \nFederal Government came in and intervened. It essentially came in \nunderneath the failed banks and said they would be there to backstop \nthe deposits and liquidate the assets so they became marketable again \nand so the economy could move forward.\n\n  When you have a contraction such as that, which is what we are seeing \nin our market today as a result of the subprime meltdown in States such \nas Florida, Arizona, and California--and it is spreading, regrettably, \nto some instruments that weren't subprime--when you have a meltdown \nsuch as that, what happens is the banking and the lending industry of \nthe Nation start to have to rebuild their capital quickly because they \nare taking huge losses. And the only place a bank can rebuild its \ncapital is by calling in essentially good loans. So even though \nsomebody might have a good idea and know how to make a business work \nand have a real estate proposal which makes sense and is going to have \na positive cashflow, it is extremely difficult for them to get a loan--\nextremely difficult--because the banks are trying to build their \ncapital and they are not lending. That is what we are seeing today. We \nare seeing that type of contraction.\n  On top of that, of course, we have the meltdown. We have the major \ninvestment house of Bear Stearns, which was reacted to appropriately by \nthe Federal Reserve, by opening the window so other investment houses \nwould be able to have resources, but we still have this serious issue \nof liquidity. That is what it all comes down to. It comes down to the \nability of the lender to be able to take the loan and sell it and move \nit in the marketplace so they can actually lend some more money by \ntaking money in and by selling the loans which they have on their \nbooks. That is what it comes down to. What we have today is a market \nthat is contracting because they do not have that capacity. The lenders \ndo not have that capacity.\n  That being the case, what is the role of the Federal Government? I am \nhesitant to have the Federal Government step into this, beyond what it \nhas already done, but I think setting up a backstop is appropriate, and \nthat is essentially what the bill that is brought to us by Senators \nDodd and Shelby does today.\n  First, I congratulate them for the regulatory reform they put in for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, very important reform. But going to the \npart which is the essence of the bill beyond the reform, which is very \nimportant, the question of expanding FHA authority to basically become \na backstop for these mortgages and basically a force for making these \nmortgages liquid is the key element of this bill.\n  As I understand it--and, again, I haven't been able to read the whole \nbill--the way it basically works is for these loans, for the FHA to \nstep in and insure refinanced mortgages, the loans first have to be \nwritten down to 90 percent of the market value of the house; second, \nthe home has to be owner occupied, so it is not a speculative home; and \nthird, all the secondary liens that might be on the property have to be \ncleared so it is basically the single underlying primary first mortgage \nthat is being underwritten. That is the proposal as I understand it.\n  The possible effect of this, in my opinion, will be that the lenders, \nthe banks specifically, the people who have made these insured \nmortgages, may be able to move these mortgages off their books, unlike \nmortgages which are not moving right now, in a way which will free up \nthe marketplace and allow them to relend money to other people who want \nto buy a home.\n  Equally important, of course, is that the homeowners, who find \nthemselves caught in this subprime web of having taken on a mortgage \nwhich they couldn't afford because the adjustment in the ARM went up so \nquickly and so radically in an unexpected way, will be able to stay in \ntheir home and make their payments, if they have the capacity to do \nthat. That should be our goal. Our goal shouldn't be to have \nforeclosures occurring all across this country. Our goal should be to \nkeep the homeowners in their homes, those who do have the wherewithal \nto pay for their mortgages, as long as their mortgage is properly \npriced. That is what this bill will accomplish in many ways.\n  What is the cost of this bill? That is of primary concern for me, and \nI know it is a primary concern for Senator Shelby, because he is \nprobably even more of a skinflint than I am around here.\n  CBO is saying the ability of people to take advantage of this may be \nlimited because of the fact you have to clear all the second liens off \nthe home, so there may not be as much use of it as one might think. But \nI think there will be more use of this option than CBO thinks, because \nthe lender and the borrower will see it as an opportunity for the \nborrower to stay in the home and for the lender to get the loan and \nmove it off the books so they can get more liquidity and rebuild their \ncapital.\n  I think that will be the outcome of this language, should it go into \nplace: A lot of homes will be saved.\n  Secondly, as I understand it, a lot of the money to support this is \ngoing to come out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I may be wrong about \nthat, but I think that is the way it works. That is appropriate, \nbecause Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have an unfair playing field here. \nThey get a tilted rate benefit because of the fact they are perceived \nas being backed up by the Federal Government, even though they\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\naren't. So this will level the playing field a little bit, and it will \ntake resources which aren't coming into the Treasury anyway to support \nit.\n  Thirdly, and I think this is probably the most important part, the \neconomic slowdown we are in today I believe will be relieved to some \ndegree because there will be a mechanism in place. It is not a magic \nwand. It is not the absolute full response to the problem. In fact, \nthere is only one end of the pyramid that needs to be built here. But \nit is a response which will help the economy recover quicker and with \nmore energy.\n  I opposed the original stimulus package we passed, and I opposed the \nhousing bill that was on the floor earlier this year because I didn't \nthink either one was going to do a heck of a lot to help the economy \nmove forward. This bill, however, if it is in the form that I think it \nis in, does something to accomplish that goal. It will help the economy \nbecause it will free up the market. It will make the market more \nliquid, which is what we need, and it will also give people the \ncapacity to avoid foreclosure, which is very important to the mindset \nand the psychology of the economy.\n  I do think this will be part of the effort to raise the economy of \nthis country as we continue in this rather significant--and I do not \nthink we are out of the woods yet--severe slowdown in the area, \nespecially, of the financial industries.\n  Again, I hope I understand the bill. I am not sure I fully understand \nit. I wouldn't claim I do. But I think I understand its concept, its \npurpose, and I agree with its concept and its purpose, and I \ncongratulate the leadership of the Banking Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the leaders of this effort, my good \nfriends, Senators Dodd and Shelby, for their hard work and their \nefforts to address the housing crisis and the need to reform regulatory \noversight of the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae, Freddie \nMack, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and reforming FHA.\n  These are clearly needed. They are long overdue. I am happy to \nsupport them.\n  In addition, there is clearly a role and a need for the Government to \naddress the current housing crisis. I have supported and led various \nefforts in the SAFE Act--Security Against Foreclosure and Education \nAct--that I introduced in March. That had additional housing \ncounseling, improved disclosure and transparency in the home-buying \nprocess, and strong enforcement actions against predatory lending. \nThese were essentially included in the bipartisan measure this Senate \npassed early in April. But I have grave concerns about some aspects of \nH.R. 3221, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. I filed three \namendments to that bill today that I hope we will be able to discuss \nthoroughly and act upon.\n  It is a fundamental principle that the Congress does not create \nprograms that perpetuate or reward the behavior that led to the housing \ncrisis or damage the key agencies that play a key role in stabilizing \nthe housing market. Unfortunately, this legislation before us today \ngoes against that principle.\n  Specifically, I am gravely concerned about the proposed expansion of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development's--HUD--Federal Housing \nAdministration--FHA--contained in this bill. The proposed creation of a \nnew FHA program called the HOPE for Homeowners loan program would allow \ncertain at-risk borrowers to refinance their mortgages and authorize \nFHA to guarantee up to $300 billion in new loans. The program would \nallow lenders and borrowers to refinance voluntarily their mortgage \nloans into a new FHA-insured loan at a significantly reduced loan level \nwith lenders agreeing to write off these reductions as losses.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's review of the HOPE for \nHomeowners loan program, about 400,000 loans would voluntarily \nparticipate in this program, which would require about $68 billion in \nloan commitment authority. CBO projects that about 2.2 million \nborrowers of subprime and alt-A loans will face foreclosure proceedings \nduring the next three years. Based on a comparison of these numbers, \nthe expected reach of this program will be significantly limited in \nassisting of homeowners who are expected to face foreclosure. While I \nwould like to keep as many homeowners in their homes as possible, this \nstrategy is more likely to result in a huge bailout for lenders while \nprotecting a very limited number of homeowners. In particular, CBO \nestimates that under this program, ``mortgage holders would have an \nincentive to direct their highest-risk loans to the program.'' For a \nmodest write-off, lenders who were, in a number of cases, either \nfraudulent or negligent in their treatment of borrowers, will be able \nto clear out many of their problem loans. At the same time, CBO \nestimates that the cumulative default rate for the HOPE program would \nbe 35 percent--meaning that one out of every three loans refinanced \nwould fail. Frankly, creating a new Federal program that takes on the \nworst of the worst subprime loans, which will hurt FHA is extremely \ntroubling.\n  The Senate bill pays for to the new FHA HOPE program from GSE \nassessments. This offset potentially avoids the need for funds from the \nTreasury to cover the losses as required under the Federal Credit \nReform Act. However, whether the costs for the HOPE program would be \npaid by proceeds from the GSEs or from direct appropriations, it does \nnot change the nature of this program--it is a bailout.\n  As a former member of the Senate Banking Committee and current \nlongtime member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with \njurisdiction over FHA, I have held a strong and long-time interest on \nhousing and finance issues. A major lesson learned from my work on both \nthe authorizing and appropriating committees is that FHA is \nsignificantly limited in managing and implementing its loan activities \ndue to longstanding management and resource challenges. Let me \nemphasize that point. FHA is significantly limited in managing and \nimplementing its loan activities due to long standing management and \nresource challenges. They do not have the people and the people are not \nadequate to the task in too many cases. FHA's challenges have been \nwell-documented by the HUD Inspector General and Government \nAccountability Office for several years, which has been heard through \nnumerous congressional hearings. All my colleagues who wish access to \nthat information can have it.\n  It also is troubling to me that we are burdening FHA at a time when \nthey are playing a growing role in assisting distressed homeowners. I \nhave heard that FHA's market share has grown tremendously from about 2 \npercent to as high as 8 percent. To add 400,000 of the worst of the \nworst new loans to FHA's portfolio at this time is potentially creating \na perfect storm for failure. Any collapse in FHA will be borne by the \nAmerican taxpayer and future appropriations bills, potentially at the \nexpense of other housing programs.\n  It is my belief that the FHA HOPE proposal takes the Government and \nthe taxpayers down a dangerous and risky path, which may worsen the \nhousing problem for borrowers it aims to address. Further, when taking \ninto account the longstanding management and financial challenges of \nFHA, the expectations being created by the new FHA HOPE program are \nunrealistic.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4985 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n  For those reasons I offer an amendment, No. 4985, to strike title IV \nof division A, which establishes the HOPE program. I recognize this \nprogram is a part of a delicate compromise, but it is too troubling and \nrisky for the American taxpayer. Therefore, I call up amendment No. \n4985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4985 to amendment No. 4983.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to the HOPE for Homeowners \n                                Program)\n\n       Strike title IV of division A.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I unanimous consent to set that amendment\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\naside so I may offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4987 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n  Mr. BOND. The next amendment I offer, No. 4987, was designed to \nprotect potential home buyers with additional mortgage loan disclosure \nrequirements. I explained and discussed this amendment with the two \nleaders of the Banking Committee when we had the previous measure on \nthe floor. I think the disclosure requirements were widely agreed to on \nboth sides of the aisle, but due to the procedural situation at the \ntime it was not accepted. This amendment would protect consumers \nconsidering complicated and potentially unaffordable mortgage loan \nterms by requiring a clear and simple disclosure of payments and \ninterest rates for adjustable rate loans with so-called teaser rates. \nThese teaser loans, with interest rates and payments that jump up to \nunaffordable levels, played a large role in our current subprime \nmortgage crisis.\n  Many potential borrowers either did not understand what they were \ngetting into or were falsely assured everything would be OK.\n  As part of bringing relief to families and neighborhoods suffering \nthrough the housing crisis, I wish to ensure we do not face another \ncrisis in the future because we did not correct the problem.\n  I have spent a good bit of time in Missouri, talking with homeowners \nfacing foreclosure. The local government agencies, mayors, councilmen, \naldermen, the advocacy groups, and the very effective counseling \nprograms such as NeighborWorks and others who are assisting homeowners \nand are working on counseling those in foreclosure, but they also came \nback and unanimously said we have to have better information for the \npotential buyer before they get into it. Making sure potential buyers \nknow the costs and do not fall into a trap that can lead to a disaster \nfor them and serious impacts on the communities is very important.\n  If you have ever taken out a mortgage loan to buy or refinance a home \nor get a home equity line of credit, you are confronted with piles and \npiles of paperwork and legal jargon. I have had the pleasure of getting \nthree new loans in the last 5 years from a local banker who doesn't do \nsubprime. Each time I have gone through the disclosure requirements on \nclosing. There is a stack of paper, several inches thick, that is \nwritten in legal jargon.\n  I used to be a lawyer. While I can read those documents, I can assure \nyou they are not easy to understand for somebody who is not an expert \nin the area. I assume I am similar to most homeowners who cannot read \nthrough all the legal gobbledygook and wouldn't find it particularly \nedifying if they did.\n  When low-income homeowners who have fallen into problems responded to \nmy question about why they didn't ask questions, they were met with: \n``Don't worry about that,'' or ``We'll fix that later.'' I can assure \nyou, those things do not get fixed quietly after you sign the papers.\n  Congress passed the original Truth in Lending Act and applied it to \nmortgage loans. We knew then most people do not take the time or have \nthe ability to read and understand the fine print of mortgage loan \ndocuments. However, the protections in the Truth in Lending Act were \nwritten long ago and are now woefully outdated. They were written when \nmost everyone took a 30-year fixed loan. There are many more loan tools \nto help people share in the dream of home ownership. There are \nadjustable rate mortgages; adjustable rate mortgages with initial fixed \nterms, sometimes called teasers; prepayment penalties and refinancing \noptions, quicker and easier than ever before but not fully understood.\n  More choices are a good thing, but uneducated consumers who do not \nunderstand the choices and therefore do not understand what they are \ncommitting to is a bad thing.\n  I mentioned on the floor at length the story of Willie Clay, of \nKansas City, MO.\n  Willie Clay is a Vietnam war paratrooper living largely on disability \npayments. Willie lives in a working-class Kansas City neighborhood of \nmodest ranch homes called Ruskin Heights.\n  Willie refinanced his mortgage in 2004 for a total of $101,000. As \nyou can see from the size of that loan, Willie is a man of modest \nmeans. He was not a speculator gambling on the housing market. He was \nnot an investor buying a vacation rental home.\n  Like so many other Americans, Willie was just looking for a little \nextra money to pay-off his medical bills, car loan and some credit \ncards. Willie agreed to a subprime adjustable rate loan with an initial \nfixed rate of 8.2 percent.\n  For several years, everything went fine for Willie. He made his \npayments and honored his agreement. Then last October, the initial \nfixed rate ended and the loan reset to a variable rate. His new \ninterest rate became 11.2 percent, and then was set to rise again in \nMarch to 12.2 percent, with more rises coming.\n  Willie told the Star, ``If the rate goes up again, I can't afford \nit.'' Willie and his wife Ina would have to give up their home and move \ninto an apartment. Willie now admits that he never fully understood how \nan adjustable rate worked when he agreed to the new loan.\n  ``I didn't have the education to understand it,'' Willie said, ``and \nthey didn't explain it to me. I thought if the interest [rate] went \ndown, your payment went down. If the interest rate went up, your \npayment stayed the same.''\n  Willie was now facing mortgage payments 50 percent higher than when \nhe started. Willie was also trapped in his loan because of a $2,500 \nprepayment penalty. This is not just a family crisis. Willie's entire \nneighborhood suffered through this housing crisis. At one time, there \nwere more than 500 foreclosures in his Zip Code alone.\n  On Willie's block, there were several empty houses. Foreclosed homes \nare driving property values down for everyone. It becomes a self-\nperpetuating downward spiral. That is why we need to help these people.\n  My amendment will apply to adjustable rate mortgages with an initial \nfixed or ``teaser'' rate. This is the kind of loan Mr. Clay had and \nmillions of other Americans have. For these types of loans with \nteasers, lenders or brokers will be required to provide in large, \nprominent type the loan's fixed interest rate, the initial fixed \npayment, and the date on which the fixed rate will expire. The lender \nor broker will also need to provide an estimate of what the payment \nwill be when the loan resets from its initial teaser rate to a floating \nadjustable rate. For many subprime borrowers, this jump could be quite \nlarge, and the borrowers need to be aware of it.\n  We would also require lenders to disclose that there is no guarantee \nthat the loan can be refinanced before the initial fixed rate expires. \nThat caught a lot of borrowers who knew the terms of their loan could \ngo up after the teaser rate expired, potentially to unaffordable \nlevels. But any concern they had that they could not afford their loan \nin the future was put to rest by personal assurances by a broker that \nthere would be no problem refinancing the loan before the teaser rate \nexpired. For many, this turned out to be true, but when the credit \nmarket seized up and the loan standards were raised, they were caught \nin an impossible situation. This amendment requires a disclosure that \nthere is no guarantee that the borrower will be able to refinance a \nloan before the teaser rate expires.\n  The amendment also requires the disclosure of any prepayment penalty, \nthe amount, and the expiration date. This prepayment penalty caught \nfamilies like the Clays, trapping them in a bad situation. While \nprepayment penalties can be good, giving certainty to the lender, who \ncan in turn provide a lower interest rate, people need to be aware of \nwhat they are getting into.\n  That is the theme of the entire amendment. It does not block \nadjustable rates, it does not block initial fixed rates. It allows \nprepayment penalties. These advances in the mortgage business have been \ngood for consumers, but it just requires full disclosure. Brokers and \nlenders did not do enough to disclose to and educate consumers.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4987 to protect potential home \nbuyers with additional requirements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4987 to amendment No. 4983.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4987) is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To enhance mortgage loan disclosure requirements with \n  additional safeguards for adjustable rate mortgages with an initial \n        fixed rate and loans that contain a prepayment penalty)\n\n       On page 522, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) If the loan is an adjustable rate mortgage that \n     includes an initial fixed interest rate--\n\n       ``(I) state in conspicuous type size and format the \n     following phrase: This loan is an adjustable rate mortgage \n     with an initial fixed interest rate. Your initial fixed \n     interest rate is AAA with a monthly payment of BBB until CCC. \n     After that date, the interest rate on your loan will `reset' \n     to an adjustable rate and both your interest rate and payment \n     could go higher on that date and in the future. For example, \n     if your initial fixed rate ended today, your new adjustable \n     interest rate would be DDD and your new payment EEE. If \n     interest rates are one percent higher than they are today or \n     at some point in the future, your new payment would be FFF. \n     There is no guarantee you will be able to refinance your loan \n     to a lower interest rate and payment before your initial \n     fixed interest rate ends.;\n       ``(II) the blank AAA in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the initial fixed interest rate;\n       ``(III) the blank BBB in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the payment amount under the initial fixed interest \n     rate;\n       ``(IV) the blank CCC in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the loan reset date;\n       ``(V) the blank DDD in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the adjustable rate as if the initial rate expired on \n     the date of disclosure under subparagraph (B);\n       ``(VI) the blank EEE in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the payment under the adjustable rate as if the initial \n     rate expired on the date of disclosure under subparagraph \n     (B); and\n       ``(VII) the blank FFF in subparagraph (I) to be filled in \n     with the payment under the adjustable rate as if index rate \n     on which the adjustable rate was one percent higher than of \n     the date of disclosure under subparagraph (B).\n\n       ``(iv) If the loan contains a prepayment penalty--\n\n       ``(I) state in conspicuous type and format the following \n     phrase: This loan contains a prepayment penalty.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4986 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n  Mr. BOND. This final amendment limits the responsibility of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac for housing entities that receive funding from the \nAffordable Housing Trust Fund created under the bill. The amendment \nprohibits the trust fund to be used for soft program costs to ensure \nthat any of these funds be used for bricks and mortar.\n  It is very simple. I can read the whole thing. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac shall not be responsible for any payments \n     either directly or indirectly to other housing entities under \n     the Affordable Housing programs unless these GSEs voluntarily \n     provide funding. None of these funds shall be used for soft \n     program costs, including staff costs.\n\n  In essence, it is a very simple amendment. My concern is that, \nregardless of what one thinks about the GSEs, it is, I believe, \nunprecedented for Congress to step in and say: You are a partially \nprivately owned, shareholder-owned entity, and you shall be paying a \ntax that we determine to a group of other entities over which you have \nno control.\n  People may like or dislike or want to reform the GSEs. But there are \na lot of other GSEs. Are we going to go around and start telling Sallie \nMae, for example: You have to fund various of these education programs.\n  There are other quasi-governmental agencies that I think would be \nvery much concerned if Congress started the practice of taking these \nentities and telling them where they have to spend their funds. This is \na backdoor way of avoiding the honest and straightforward provision of \neither raising the money through taxes or providing other revenue of \nthe Federal Government.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider all three of these amendments. I \nlook forward to discussing them when the time is appropriate. I thank \nthe manager for allowing me to raise these.\n  I call up Amendment No. 4986.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4986 to amendment No. 4983.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

None of thee funds shall be \n     used for soft program costs, including staff costs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say, first of all, I will be very brief. I know my \ncolleague from Iowa wants to be heard on the bill. I wish to say to \nSenator Bond that what we will do is try to figure out a way to handle \nthese in order, all three of them in one or in order, or whether we \nwill go back and forth. But we will keep him posted.\n  I do not how long my colleague from Iowa wants to be heard on the \nbill. I wish to respond to the Senator from Missouri on the issues. I \npresume my colleague from Alabama may want to do so as well. We will \ntry to take them in the order the Senator offered them. We will keep \nhim posted on how we will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I \nknow there is no time limit, but I don't think I am going to take more \nthan 15 minutes and maybe less than that. It is kind of a rough guess, \nbut I do not intend to take a lot of time.\n  I wish to start by thanking Chairman Baucus for his courtesy and hard \nwork in the legislative effort that is part of this banking bill, the \npart that came out of the Finance Committee, the part of the bill that \nis hopefully going to help the mortgage problem through amendments to \nthe Tax Code. Our goal in the Finance Committee was to develop a \nbipartisan tax package that responded to the needs of Americans and, in \nparticular, the housing market. We have done so. I wish to take this \nopportunity to thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby because they have \nworked very closely with us in making sure our Finance Committee part \nof this bill can, in fact, be a part of the bill that is before the \nSenate.\n  Everybody knows Americans are struggling to keep their homes and, \nwith that, their jobs. Economic conditions are very uncertain. In \nuncertain times, it is appropriate that Congress develop tax policy \naddressing the housing problem and try to bring a little more certainty \nto the economic lives of our citizens. After all, the housing problem \nis at the root of our current economic turmoil.\n  Last year, we responded to the call for help. Congress enacted the \nMortgage Debt Relief Act of 2007, which was signed into law by the \nPresident. This law excludes from income discharges of indebtedness \nincurred by taxpayers to acquire homes. It also extends the tax \ndeduction for mortgage insurance premiums.\n  Earlier this year, Congress acted quickly on a stimulus package that \ndelivered additional relief to the American taxpayers. That stimulus \npackage is just now taking effect as taxpayers have received these \nrebate checks, because they are necessary to give the economy a much \nneeded boost.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate acted on a bipartisan tax relief \npackage that\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nwas based on the joint efforts of Finance Committee Democrats and \nRepublicans--in other words, almost by unanimity, a bipartisan bill. \nThe package before us as part of this housing bill is a blend of the \nSenate package and a House package passed a little while ago by the \nother body. We have carefully balanced this tax relief package being \nconsidered today on the floor, hopefully balanced it enough that it \nwill not run into problems when it gets back to the House because \ncertain House tax policy leaders have agreed to it.\n  It addresses the housing downturn but is limited so as to ensure that \nit helps the problem and does not create new problems. Too often, we in \nCongress have to be certain we do not do things too good, that we \ncreate more problems than we solve. We are mindful that any relief that \nbenefits one sector of the public does so at the expense of another \nsector. The other sector, then, is the taxpaying population that \ncarefully manages their family's budget, especially as it relates to \nhousing costs because of the American dream of owning your own home.\n  Taxpayers bear the burden of a bailout of these risky mortgages that \nwent south, so it is very important that we have a compassionate view \nthat recognizes that taxpayers pay the ultimate tab. As we proceed to \nthis bill, we need to keep in mind that very worthwhile principle. We \nneed to address the housing downturn, but we need to show restraint and \nwe need to limit the relief so that it eases the problem and does not \nsimply create new problems. We need to be considerate of many Americans \nwho work hard to save and buy homes and who will ultimately pay the \nprice of this relief.\n  Once again, the Senate is stepping up to the plate. The tax relief \npackage that is before us helps encourage home ownership but also \nprovides targeted relief to homeowners who are looking to work out of \nthis rough patch they are in when they face foreclosure or nearly face \nit.\n  The centerpiece of this bill is a temporary $8,000 tax credit to help \nfirst-time home buyers buy homes, including homes that are in \nforeclosure. There is a glut of homes on the market. The glut is \ndepressing home values. It is important that this excess inventory is \nmoved so that we help retain home values of others who are not in \nforeclosure or have been foreclosed on.\n  On that point, I think it is necessary for all of us to show praise \nand respect for the efforts of Senator Isakson from Georgia for \ndoggedly pursuing this proposal. He has a very important and \nunderstanding background as a realtor and homebuilder. He helped us \nshape the proposal.\n  The bill also increases the cap for mortgage revenue bonds to give \npeople with distressed loans additional options for refinancing. I wish \nto make it clear that this is not a bailout for homeowners. Instead, \nthis is a provision which helps enable people to keep their homes and \nto pay their mortgages. We can thank the leadership of Senators Smith \nand Kerry for this important provision.\n  Chairman Baucus has championed the nonitemizer deduction for part of \nthe real property tax paid. It is in this bill. Senator Kyl wanted \nassurances that State and local tax authorities would not pocket this \nnew tax benefit with higher property tax assessments. This proposal is \ndesigned to ensure that property tax payers, not State and local \ngovernments, receive the direct benefit of this deduction.\n  This bill contains a set of reforms to the low-income housing credit. \nSenator Cantwell led this effort.\n  A key additional reform benefits low- and middle-income military \npersonnel who need housing near bases where they are stationed. Senator \nPat Roberts, a former marine, looked out for our men and women in \nuniform. Senator Roberts needs a thank-you for that. With Senator \nRoberts' proposal, soldiers and their families in Fort Riley, KS, and \nother bases that have seen recent increases in population will have \neasier access to low-income housing.\n  This bill liberalizes the ability of the Federal Home Loan Banks to \nprovide assistance to colleges and universities affected by the \nsubprime mortgage crisis. The Home Loan Bank officials in my home State \nof Iowa suggested this proposal, and I was glad to pursue it and glad \nit is included.\n  Senator Harkin, this Senator, and other Members from the Midwest have \nwitnessed the terrible weather that hit our States recently.\n  We have seen the damage that has been done to our communities large \nand small, urban and rural in our home States. It is a devastating \nflood. Unfortunately, the damage goes on as I speak, only a little \nfurther downstream. All the hurt has not been calculated at this point. \nOnce again, I have to thank Chairman Baucus for pledging to help us in \nthe Midwest. Senator Baucus came to me and offered that help. That is \nsomething the people of Iowa and the Midwest appreciate. Having the \nchairman of a very important committee in the Senate on your side is \nimportant. We will not forget that.\n  In this bill, we have a proposal specifically targeted to help people \nwho have lost their homes to the floods. The proposal is contained in \nthe mortgage revenue bond package. It is patterned after a proposal \nadopted over a decade ago to deal with floods from the mid-1990s.\n  The proposal would waive the first-time home buyer requirement and \nlift the individual income limits. With this policy in effect, States \nsuch as Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Maine will be \nable to offer low-interest loans to families who have lost their homes \nto the flood. With the proceeds from these loans, families will be able \nto purchase replacement homes. The elements of the low-income housing \nreforms will also help disaster-devastated communities.\n  While I was thanking Senator Baucus, I suppose I ought to extend that \nbeyond Senator Baucus to several other Senators. I better not name them \nbecause several have come up, and I will forget somebody. But they have \ncome up to show their understanding of how serious it is in the Midwest \nand have offered their help. Some of these Senators in previous years \nhave gone through the same destructive natural disasters the Midwest is \ngoing through at this very minute. I have informed Chairman Baucus and \nthe leadership on both sides that the coalition of member States \naffected by these floods and tornadoes will refine more tax proposals \nin the future. We will aim to assist displaced persons and rebuild the \nbusinesses and communities affected. We will seek to offer them to this \nbill once it is open for amendment.\n  I spoke in recent days on the issue of revenue-raising offsets to tax \nrelief. I rebutted the claims of Democratic lobbyists who were \nsurprisingly cited in some press reports as credible sources for the \nSenate Republican conference. The Democratic lobbyists claimed that \nSenate Republicans would oppose all revenue-raising offsets. Some \ndescribed our position in terms of ``theology.'' I corrected these \nassertions and pointed back to Senate floor debates on this point late \nlast year. For some reason, those statements in the Congressional \nRecord have been ignored, and Democratic lobbyists' views were \nsubstituted. The correct position is as I restate it now. I ask some \nfolks to pay close attention so we don't get misunderstood.\n  Principle No. 1, if a revenue-raising proposal makes good policy \nsense, Senate Republicans will support it. Principle No. 2, the revenue \nraised should be used for new tax relief. Principle No. 3, the revenue \nraised should not be required for extending current law tax relief. I \nhave explained the reasons behind that principle. Suffice it to say \nthat we on this side don't believe in sliding down a slippery slope of \nguaranteeing higher taxes and higher spending. Spending drives current \nand future deficits.\n  This bill confirms the Senate Republican conference principles on the \nuse of revenue-raising offsets. This bill contains new tax policy. This \nnew tax policy is offset with revenue raisers that a bipartisan \nmajority in the Senate consider improved tax policy. The main one would \nput in place a reporting regime on credit card payments to merchants. \nIt is a Treasury tax gap proposal. The other significant revenue raiser \nwould clarify the home sale exclusion rules for second homes, usually \nwhere vacation residences are involved. The revenue losses related to \ndisaster assistance, however, are not offset. That accounting is \nconsistent with the\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\nbipartisan congressional practice on emergency spending and tax relief.\n  It has long been said that the American dream is to own your own \nhome. Unfortunately, the subprime mortgage crisis has turned that dream \ninto a nightmare for many Americans. The bipartisan tax relief \nprovisions from the Senate Finance Committee that have been worked out \nin a bipartisan way--and, I believe, in a bicameral way through Senator \nBaucus--are in this bill. They aim to restore that American dream. We \ndo it in a very responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4984 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n  Mrs. DOLE.

These are all second-degree amendments to \nthe Reid amendment. At some point, I will want to bring closure to \nthese amendments so we can deal with them. Senator Isakson may have an \namendment. I would like to get to a point where we can manage those \namendments, debate them, and then ask the leadership for an appropriate \ntime to have a series of maybe three or four or five votes, depending \nupon what is necessary.\n  I yield the floor to the request for a time sequence of speakers, if \nI may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, following my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Casey be recognized to speak for 12 minutes, \nSenator Isakson be recognized to speak for 10 minutes and, following \nSenator Isakson, Senator Sanders be recognized to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Confucius said:\n\n       The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the \n     home.\n\n  Today we are here to protect the strength of our Nation. We are here \nto help keep families in their homes.\n  The tax provisions in the amendment before us are meant to stabilize \nthe housing market and boost our economy. They are designed to provide \ntemporary, targeted, and timely tax relief for the housing market.\n  In 2007, 1 percent of all homes were in default. That is more than \n1.2 million homes. The Nation's 2007 foreclosure rate was 2\\1/2\\ times \nwhat it was in 2005.\n  In my home State of Montana, the 2007 foreclosure rate was up almost \n30 percent from 2006 and more than 50 percent from 2005.\n  And the number of foreclosures continues to grow. Nationwide in May, \nthe number of homes receiving a foreclosure-related notice was up 7 \npercent from the month before, and up 48 percent from a year before. \nThis means that 1 in every 483 American households received a \nforeclosure notice last month. That is a record high.\n  Behind every foreclosed property, there is a family. There is a \nfamily losing its home, and there is a family losing a piece of its \nfuture.\n  Our Nation's current economic weakness is largely a result of the \nweak housing market. More than 5 million households now owe more on \ntheir mortgage than their house is worth. That is about 1 out of every \n10 home mortgages. As home prices continue to fall, these numbers will \nonly get worse.\n  This amendment is a response. It would provide tax relief for \nhomeowners, for home buyers, and for homebuilders.\n  It would provide an additional $11 billion of mortgage revenue bonds \nso that State housing agencies can immediately respond to the housing \ndownturn. This would help homeowners avoid foreclosures, and it would \nincrease first-time home purchases.\n  Mortgage revenue bonds are tax-exempt bonds issued by State and local \nhousing finance agencies. The bonds help those agencies to provide \nmortgages for home buyers at below-market rates of interest.\n  The virtual collapse of the subprime and affordable mortgage markets \nhas increased the demand for mortgages financed through mortgage \nrevenue bonds. Increasing the cap on mortgage revenue bonds and \nproviding States the option to refinance subprime mortgages can allow \nState housing agencies to immediately respond to homes at risk of \nforeclosure.\n  And additional mortgage revenue bonds can also help clear out the \nglut of homes on the market. Additional mortgage revenue bonds can lead \nto more first-time home purchases.\n  The amendment also would provide broad-based tax relief by expanding \nthe number of people who may deduct property taxes. Currently, \nhomeowners are allowed to deduct local real estate property taxes from \ntheir Federal tax returns only if they itemize. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, more than 28 million taxpayers pay property \ntaxes, but do not itemize.\n  This proposal would allow these 28 million taxpayers to deduct the \namount of their property taxes, up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 \nfor married filers. They could take this deduction even if they did not \nitemize their deductions.\n  This change would benefit low-income individuals. It would benefit \nthose who have already paid off their mortgages and thus don't have \nthat reason to itemize. It would benefit young families just starting \nout, and it would benefit senior citizens.\n  The Congressional Research Service estimates that nearly 130,000 \nproperty taxpayers could benefit in my home State of Montana alone.\n  Listings of distressed properties dominate the real estate market. In \nthe first quarter of this year, one out of every four home sales was a \ndistressed sale. The papers are full of foreclosures and vacant new \nhomes.\n  As of April 2008, there were more than 456,000 newly constructed \nhomes for sale on the market. That is more than 10 months worth of \nsupply. And according to the National Association of Realtors, 4\\1/2\\ \nmillion existing homes are for sale on the market.\n  To help reduce the excess inventory of foreclosed, vacant, and \nexisting homes, the amendment includes a one-time home buyer credit of \n$8,000.\n  The credit would apply to first-time home buyers. It would begin to \nphase\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\nout for home buyers with incomes of $75,000 for individuals and \n$150,000 for joint filers. The purchase of the home would have to be on \nor prior to April 1, 2009. And the credit would be repaid over 15 years \nat zero percent interest.\n  The short-term nature of this credit is critical. It would help to \nprovide immediate stimulus to put homebuilders, and the housing \nindustry, back on track, but it would also avoid oversubsidizing the \nhousing industry.\n  The amendment would also make critical improvements to the Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit program. This program is the engine that drives low-\nincome rental housing in America. But it is long overdue for a tuneup.\n  The amendment would increase the total number of credits available by \n10 percent per State. And the amendment would broaden the investor \nclass by allowing the credit to be taken against the AMT.\n  The State housing finance agencies are good stewards of this Federal \nprogram, and the amendment would give these agencies more discretion to \nallocate credit dollars to projects that the State deems a high \npriority.\n  These tuneups would help to make this engine run more smoothly, and \nthey would lead to an increase in affordable rental housing across the \ncountry.\n  The amendment would also allow taxpayers to choose to take a refund \nof AMT or R credits in lieu of bonus depreciation deductions. \nCompanies without Federal tax liability cannot use the tax deductions. \nBut under this amendment, they could take advantage of a refund, and \nthey could use that funding invest in capital assets. That would create \nand maintain jobs.\n  These proposals would be fully paid for by responsible offsets. As \nmuch as possible, we should avoid increasing our national debt and our \nreliance on foreign creditors.\n  The amendment includes a House-passed proposal to close a loophole \ninvolving the sale of second homes. It would apply to houses that are \nused both as a principal residence and for other purposes. An example \nwould be a principal residence that also was used as rental property.\n  Under current law, an owner can exclude income from the sale of that \nsecond home. The owner just needs to have lived in the home for 2 out \nof the last 5 years.\n  The proposal would limit the gain that the owner could exclude from \nincome when the owner sells the residence. The idea behind the proposal \nis that a personal-income exclusion should be limited to the personal \nuse of the residence.\n  A second pay-for would require information reporting on credit card \ntransactions. It would also apply to many online transactions. Merchant \nbanks that settle credit and debit card sales would report annual gross \npayments to the businesses making the sales and to the IRS. Third-party \nnetworks that facilitate electronic transactions would do the same.\n  In response to concerns about possible burdens this proposal could \nput on small e-business sellers, the proposal contains a de minimis \nexception. The exception excludes from the reporting requirements \noperations with aggregate sales of $10,000 or less a year. The \nexception would also exclude a volume of 200 transactions or fewer.\n  The proposal gives ample time to banks and others so they can program \ntheir systems and verify the information they need from sellers before \nissuing the information documents.\n  This proposal does not raise taxes on anyone. These information \nreports would just cause people to file more accurate returns.\n  The administration has included this proposal in its annual budget \nfor the last 3 years. Earlier this year, Senator Grassley and I \nreleased a bipartisan staff draft of the proposal for public comment. \nWorking together with the House, we have taken these comments into \naccount to develop a proposal that reflects industry practices and will \nimprove tax compliance.\n  The amendment also enhances several IRS penalties. These penalties \nencourage the filing of timely and accurate tax and information \nreporting returns. These filings are the cornerstones of effective tax \nadministration and voluntary tax compliance.\n  A lot of irresponsible actions led to the current housing crisis. But \nnow a lot of responsible homeowners, home buyers, and homebuilders are \ncaught up in the mess, and they cannot afford to wait any longer for \nour help.\n  The tax provisions in this amendment would go a long way to address \nthe housing downturn and the economic weaknesses in our country. So I \nsay, let's help these folks. Let's help them keep their homes and \nthereby help them sustain the economic strength of this Nation. And \nlet's adopt this housing amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the state of \nthe American economy in the midst of our current housing crisis, and, \nof course, the legislation that is before the Congress today and the \nneed for action in this Congress, in this Senate, not just for Wall \nStreet firms but for Main Street families and small businesses.\n  A little over a month ago, the Senate Banking Committee held a field \nhearing in Philadelphia--I think the first of its kind since this \nCongress began and this Senate convened last year. Chairman Dodd \nchaired the hearing, convened it, and I was with him that day.\n  One of the witnesses was a subprime borrower. Her name is Yajaira \nCruz-Rivera. In 2005, she and her husband purchased a home. She was \ntold by her broker she would get a fixed-rate loan. She made out a \nfamily budget, and she was told she was getting a fixed-rate payment of \n$925 per month. She told her broker she did not want anything with \ntricks in it that would change her payment, and that is what she was \ntold she was signing.\n  I would like to read some of her testimony of what happened next. \nThese are her words:\n\n       Just 10 days later we received a letter in the mail stating \n     that a mistake had been made at closing. The interest rate we \n     were given was not going to be 7% but rather 10.95%. Our \n     payments would not be $925 but rather $1200. We considered \n     backing out then, but we had already moved into [our] home. \n     Our children were settling in, to pack everything back up was \n     something we could not do. We had already put so much money \n     out. Fred and I--\n\n  Fred is her husband--\n\n     Fred and I decided that although we would struggle, we would \n     make it.\n\n  All of the evidence presented to the Banking Committee in hearings \nstretching back over a year indicates that many of the homeowners who \nfind themselves in trouble started with a story just like Ms. Cruz-\nRivera's story. This is not simply a problem in some cities.\n  A leading research institution in Pennsylvania, the Keystone Research \nCenter, found nine counties in Pennsylvania where subprime mortgages \nmake up 35 percent of all mortgages--35 percent. One of those nine is \nPhiladelphia. The other eight counties in this Keystone Research Center \nsurvey are the following counties--Cameron, Clearfield, Fayette, \nForest, Jefferson, Monroe, Venango, and Warren.\n  All of those counties outside of Philadelphia that I just mentioned \nare rural counties for the most part. So this is not just a problem in \ncities and urban areas. It is a major problem in rural counties in \nPennsylvania and across the country.\n  More than 1 million homes are now in foreclosure--a new national \nrecord, unfortunately. Over 8,400 homes are entering foreclosure every \nday--8,400. Unless we act, an estimated 3 million homes will enter \nforeclosure this year, and 2 million homes will be foreclosed upon in \nthat time.\n  We know the job losses: 324,000 jobs lost already this year. We know \nthe data from the economists. One economist, Robert Shiller, has \nestimated that the subprime and foreclosure crisis could cost American \nhomeowners $6 trillion in lost household wealth--a record. That is \n$80,000 per homeowner. At the same time, the average American family \nincome is just $50,000 a year. We know the adverse impact it has had on \nstudent loans. There is problem after problem resulting from the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  So what do we do? We should pass the legislation on which Senator \nDodd has worked so hard, working with the ranking member, Senator \nShelby.\n  Let's quickly go through the legislation.\n  No. 1, government-sponsored enterprise reform legislation to give an \neffective regulator for the GSEs; No. 2,\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\nthe HOPE for Homeowners Act would establish a new initiative at the FHA \nto prevent foreclosures; No. 3, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act, \ncreating a Federal registry and establishing minimum national standards \nfor brokers and lenders; No. 4, the Foreclosure Prevention Act, \nproviding assistance and counseling so needed in this crisis; No. 5, \nthe Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008, providing tax benefits for \nhomeowners, home buyers, and homebuilders aimed at providing housing \nmarket recovery.\n  Unfortunately, there are some Senators in this Chamber who do not \nseem to see the need for action on this crisis. I want to show a chart \nwhich summarizes the principles of this basic legislation. It is very \nimportant to highlight these. There is a lot of rhetoric that is \nmisleading.\n  Basic principles: Here is what happens with this legislation. No. 1, \nit creates new equity for homeowners. We have to do that. No. 2, there \nis no bailout for investors or lenders. We have heard a lot of that \ntalk here. It is not true. This is not a bailout. This is a way to dig \nour economy out of a huge hole. No. 3, borrowers do not receive a \nwindfall. They have a stake in this, and they have to sacrifice as \nwell. It is not any kind of a windfall for borrowers. Finally, and \nmaybe most importantly for people who are following this debate, this \nis not taxpayer money we are talking about.\n\n  OK. So this is a very responsible plan. I want to return to the story \nI started of Ms. Cruz-Rivera. She had asked for and was told, as I \nmentioned before, she was receiving a fixed-rate mortgage with no \ngimmicks and no tricks. Then, 10 days after closing, she found out her \ninterest rate would not be 7 percent but 10.95 percent. The payment \nwould go, as said before, from $925 to $1,200.\n  The story does not end there, unfortunately for her. She and her \nhusband sat down, and they decided to tough it out, to try to work \ntheir way through this adverse news they got. Here is what she said. I \nam quoting her again:\n\n       Then, in 2007, the unthinkable happened. Our rate adjusted \n     upward and our new payment was now $1,671 a month. A home we \n     thought we were getting for $925 a month in 2005 is costing \n     us nearly double that today.\n\n  She is talking about her husband again. She said:\n\n       My husband works 16 hour days, 6 days a week, but still we \n     are not able to keep up with the payment.\n       We explored refinancing but now our credit is damaged and \n     on top of that we have a repayment penalty; if we do \n     refinance we have to pay GMAC a huge fee upfront. We have \n     been trapped into a terrible loan by greedy, predatory and \n     fraudulent lending practices.\n\n  So that is the reality of what we are talking about. We are not \ntalking about bailouts. We are not talking about going easy on people. \nWe are talking about helping people who, in many cases, were deceived \ndeliberately by players in the market who were unregulated and getting \naway with murder--almost literally.\n  People know the acronym ACORN, the Association of Community \nOrganizations for Reform Now. They are helping people such as Ms. Cruz-\nRivera. They are helping a lot of other people. We hear a lot of talk \nin this body and across the way in the House, the other body, about \nmoral hazard. People talk about that issue all the time--that some \npeople should have known better, and you can fill in the blank about \nthat.\n  It is not often we hear economists talking enough about morality when \nit comes to this issue. In fact, the situation we find ourselves in \ntoday is a direct result of parts of this industry--not all, but parts \nof this industry--trying to maximize profit without any regard to any \nsense of morality or standards.\n  So I find it ironic that the greed that some of us have been talking \nabout is not included in that definition of ``moral hazard.'' But there \nare solutions out there.\n  I will conclude with this: The city of Philadelphia recently \nannounced a program that will specifically target borrowers who cannot \nafford payments on adjustable-rate mortgages and are in danger of \nforeclosure. Any property scheduled for sale by the city of \nPhiladelphia right now by the local sheriff's office will be referred \nto officials who will in turn negotiate with lenders in an attempt to \nrestructure the loan so the borrower can afford the monthly payments.\n  I commend the city and especially Mayor Nutter, the mayor of \nPhiladelphia, for his leadership on this and many other housing issues. \nIt is critically important we remember there is, in this nightmare for \nso many families, solution-oriented thinking out there in addition to \nthe important legislation we have before us.\n  The time has come for the Senate to finally act--to act, not just to \ntalk but to act on this issue--to put a floor under the housing market. \nIt is time at long last for the Congress, and especially for the \nSenate, to finally act, but also in the process of acting, to help \nfamilies stay in their homes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise, first of all, to commend \nSenator Dodd, Senator Shelby, Senator Grassley, and Senator Baucus on a \npiece of legislation that is important, and which I will vote for.\n  I am going to talk for a few minutes about some suggestions for the \nmanagers of this bill to think about as we get toward a final managers' \namendment at the end of this debate because there are a couple \ntechnical changes that could make a significant difference.\n  But, first of all, I want to make sure one thing is said. We hear a \nlot about bailing out lenders and lenders being bad guys. Let me tell \nyou something. The people who originated these loans loaned money that \nwas raised on Wall Street by investment bankers and underwritten by \nMoody's and Standard & Poors. Moody's and Standard & Poors underwrote \nsecurities that were bought around the world by investors, that paid a \nhigh dividend but were on very risky subprime credit. That is where the \nfault lies--Moody's and Standard & Poors and on the investment banking \ncommunity.\n  As a parenthetical suggestion, I hope Wall Street is listening \nbecause what is happening in the commodities market is the same guys \ndoing the same thing again. If you look at the rapid price of all \ncommodities, they are going up because of a huge influx in the \ncommodities market. The only position-limited people in the commodities \nmarket are investment bankers. They are creating paper and they are \ntrading paper and they are getting the Yale endowment fund, the \nPrinceton endowment fund, and teachers' pension funds going into these \nas if they are investments, and they are not investments. They are a \nhedge in commodities.\n  So that is just a little early warning shot. If we will look closely \nat this, I think we can find the culprit to the subprime may actually \nbe a significant contributor to what is going on in commodities.\n  But, again, to Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, Senator Baucus, and \nSenator Grassley, thank you very much for what is basically a fine \npiece of legislation. I urge you to look at the effective date of the \ntax credit that is included. As I read the bill, it includes the \noriginal dates from 2 months ago, which means the tax credit, when it \ngoes into effect, will end at the end of April next year, which will be \nless than a year. May and June are the prime buying months in real \nestate. What we are trying to do is induce a decline in the inventory \nof houses on the market. I know it was not intended, but I think the \nmanagers should take a look at that.\n  Secondly, I know there is a difference between the House and the \nSenate with regard to the effective date over the GSE regulator for \nFreddie and Fannie. One side wants it immediate; one side wants it in 6 \nmonths. We do not need to have this bill go down because they cannot \nget their act together. So I hope they will work to find common ground \non the effective date. On the FHA refinance program--Senator Casey is \nprecisely correct. This is not a bailout for the lenders. This program \nallows for the refinancing of a troubled subprime loan whose payoff \namount is more than the value of the house because of the decline in \nthe marketplace. For it to be refinanced it requires the lender to take \nthe hit between the amount owed and the market value. So the loss the \nlender is going to have to be recognize in a foreclosure will, in \neffect, have to be recognized in a refinance, but the homeowner stays \nin the house and the values in the neighborhood stabilize. We\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nare doing a good job, in my opinion, of putting an end to what is a \ndesperate downward spiraling in the housing market which is affecting \nthe economy because most Americans consider their equity their line of \ncredit for their consumer spending. With that equity vanishing because \nof increased inventories, increased foreclosures, and increased vacant \nhouses, we have a very big problem.\n\n  So I wish to commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. Some of this is \ntechnical, but it needs to be said. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae saved \nthe American housing market in the early 1990s when the savings and \nloans collapsed. There was no liquidity in America for mortgages. Had \nwe not created those government-sponsored entities and allowed them to \nsecuritize mortgage paper and operate to provide the liquidity in the \nmarkets, there would be no mortgages for the American people, and we \nwould have a disaster on our hands.\n  I appreciate the final language addressing two of the three concerns \nI had with the GSEs. No. 1, I am glad the House and Senate could agree \non loan limits for both conforming and nonconforming jumbo loans. If we \nhad not done that, we would have provided liquidity for mortgages that \nwe didn't need to finance or refinance and not enough liquidity for \nmortgages that are needed in the marketplace, particularly in high-cost \nareas around the country.\n  Secondly, I appreciate the provision for the ability of Fannie Mae to \nportfolio jumbo loans because if they couldn't do that, there would be \nno liquidity. But I still question whether the language in the bill as \nit stands now directs more securitization and less portfolio. If you \nhave too much securitization but don't have the opportunity for \nliquidity to be provided by letting these entities carry that on their \nbalance sheet, then the effect is you say you are doing something, but, \nin fact, you don't provide liquidity. But I do appreciate very much the \nmanagers of the bill making those changes.\n  Lastly, with regard to the housing tax credit, I appreciate what \nSenator Grassley said, and I appreciate the kindness of Senator Dodd in \nthe original debate by incorporating in the Senate bill substantially \nthe amendment that I offered on the floor when this bill first came to \nthe Congress. I was around in the real estate business back in 1974 \nwhen America had a similar crisis to the one we have today. The \nCongress of the United States passed a $2,000 tax credit to buyers who \nbought a standing vacant house in America. Within a year, we absorbed \nsubstantially all of the standing inventory in the country and \nrevitalized the housing market, revitalized equities and values, and we \ncame out of what was a very substantial real estate-induced recession.\n  I would have preferred some of the terms that I had in my amendment \nover some of the terms that the House changed them to with this tax \ncredit, but it still accomplishes its purpose. It is a tax credit of \n$8,000 to a first-time homebuyer with income limits of $150,000 for a \ncouple and $75,000 for an individual to go into the marketplace and buy \nand occupy--not as an investor but to occupy as an owner--standing \ninventory, new or resale, in the United States of America. That is \ngoing to be a big help to put a little fuel and energy and inertia \nbehind a real estate market that is stagnant.\n  So I thank Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, Senator Grassley, Senator \nBaucus, and particularly the Finance Committee staff who were so \ncooperative in working on this concept. I think we are going to see it \nprove to make a marked difference. If that end date of April 30 is \nchanged in the final amendment to the end of June of next year, we will \nincorporate 2 more months where it can have an incentive effect. It \nwould not affect the scoring because the scoring was done as if it was \ndone in a 12-month calendar year.\n  So to Chairman Dodd and to Ranking Member Shelby and Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley this is a very important piece of legislation. \nAmerica has a serious problem. This doesn't bail anybody out, but it \nincentivizes buyers to come back to the marketplace. It provides \nliquidity to refinance loans that are underwater. It motivates, \ninspires, and provides liquidity in the marketplace through Freddie and \nFannie that does not exist right now. Failure of the Congress to act, \nin my judgment, is going to cause us to have a protracted and \ndevastating economic decline resting solely on the fact of the decline \nin the values of homes in America, the increase in the number of \nforeclosures, and the lack of liquidity in the lending market.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this legislation. I hope the \nPresident will sign it. Again, I thank the Members of the Senate who \nworked so hard to provide good, substantial legislation to the housing \nmarket in the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of the Senator from Vermont, that I have 7 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, every American understands that we now \nhave a national crisis in terms of the outrageously high price that we \nare paying for energy. In Vermont and all over this country, workers \nare wondering how they can afford to fill their gas tanks. Truckers \nusing diesel are going out of business. Senior citizens and others are \nworried with dread what happens to them next winter when the cost of \nhome heating oil is off the roof. As a result of high oil and gas \nprices, the cost of food and other products is also rising, and our \nentire economy--and, in fact, the world economy--is suffering.\n  The question that millions of people are now asking is pretty simple. \nThey want to know what this Congress can do now--not in 10 years or in \n20 years but now--to lower the outrageously high price of oil and gas. \nFurther, they want to know what we can do long term to make sure our \ncountry is energy independent; that we don't continue to import huge \namounts of oil from the Middle East or elsewhere. They want to know \nwhat we are going to do in the midst of all of this to address the \ncrisis of global warming and the droughts and the severe weather \ndisturbances and the floods that we are seeing as a result of global \nwarming.\n  Lastly, they want to know in the midst of all of this, long term, how \ndo we make sure that the cost of energy is affordable. These are the \nissues the Congress has to address.\n  But let's be very clear. These issues will not be debated in an \nintellectual realm where we are just trading ideas. This debate is \ngoing to be clouded by the enormous power and money of special \ninterests.\n  Since 1998, the oil and gas industry has spent over $600 million on \nlobbying--$600 million on lobbying--and since 1990, they have made over \n$213 million in campaign contributions. So they are extremely powerful. \nThey have an unlimited supply of cash. They are using that power and \nthat money to influence this debate. Anybody who doesn't understand \nthat is very naive, indeed.\n  If we are serious about lowering oil and gas prices today in a \nsignificant way, it seems to me we have to address two fundamental \nissues. First, the reality is that the American people are getting sick \nand tired of paying over $4 for a gallon of gas at exactly the same \ntime as the major oil companies are making record-breaking profits and \nproviding their CEOs with outrageous compensation packages. Enough is \nenough. The greed of the oil industry apparently has no end, which is \nwhy Congress must impose a windfall profits tax and use some of that \nmoney to give back to people through rebate checks.\n  In the last 2 years alone, ExxonMobil has made more profits than any \ncorporation in the history of the world, making over $40 billion last \nyear alone. But ExxonMobil is not alone. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, \nShell, and BP have also been making out like bandits. Last year, BP, \nfor example, announced a 63-percent increase in their profits for the \nfirst quarter of this year. As a matter of fact, the five largest oil \ncompanies in this country have made over $600 billion in profits since \nGeorge W. Bush has been President, while working people are paying $4, \n$4.20 for a gallon of gas. That is unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\n  What have they been doing with these huge profits? One of the things \nthey have been doing is to make sure that the CEOs of their companies \nare extremely well compensated. In 2005, Lee Raymond, the former CEO of \nExxonMobil, received a total retirement package of over $398 million. \nPeople in Vermont and around America are wondering how they are going \nto stay warm next winter. The former CEO of ExxonMobil receives a \nretirement package of $398 million.\n  In 2006, Ray Irani, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum--the largest oil \nproducer in Texas--received over $400 million in total compensation. \nThat is going on all over the industry: the heads of these corporations \nwho are making record-breaking profits receiving huge compensation \npackages.\n  The situation is so absurd and the greed is so outrageous that oil \ncompany executives are not only giving themselves huge compensation \npackages in their lifetimes, but they have also created a situation, if \nyou can believe it, where they have carved out huge corporate payouts \nto their heirs if they die while they are on the job. It never ends.\n  Let's be clear. Oil companies have a right to make a profit, but they \ndo not have a right to rip off the American people.\n  Some of my Republican friends claim that big oil needs to keep these \nhuge windfall profits so they can increase production and build more \nrefineries. They are going to take this money and they are going to use \nit to create more oil for the benefit of the American people. That \nparticular argument does not hold water. Big oil companies have been \nmaking windfall profits for over 7 long years, and they are not using \nthese profits to build more refineries or to expand production. \nInstead, they are using this money to buy back their own stock, \nincrease dividends to their shareholders, and, as I just mentioned, pay \noutrageous compensation packages to their CEOs.\n  Since 2005, the five largest oil companies have made $345 billion in \nprofits, but they have spent over $250 billion out of the $345 billion \nbuying back stock and paying dividends to their shareholders. That is \nwhere their profits are going, not investing in future oil production. \nLast year, ExxonMobil spent 850 percent more buying back its own stock \nthan it did on capital expenditures in the United States.\n  Here is my final point on that issue: The $38 billion in windfall \nprofits that ExxonMobil gave back to shareholders last year could have \nbeen used to reduce gas prices at the pump throughout the United States \nby 27 cents a gallon for the entire year.\n  Dealing with the greed of the oil companies is one immediate issue \nthat we have to address. The second one deals with the growing reality \nthat Wall Street investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan \nStanley, and J.P. Morgan Chase, and greedy hedge fund managers are \ndriving up the price of oil in the unregulated energy futures market. \nThere are estimates that a number of committees in the Senate have \nheard from different experts who testified that the price of a barrel \nof oil today is 25 to 50 percent higher than it should be because of \nexcessive manipulation of oil futures markets and excessive \nspeculation. This is an issue that must be dealt with.\n  Some people say: Well, we don't know anything about this. This has \nnever happened before. Wrong. As I think most Americans understand and \nremember, manipulation of energy markets is nothing new. It is recent \nhistory. Everybody remembers that in 2000 and 2001, Enron successfully \nmanipulated the energy markets on the west coast, driving up prices by \n300 percent. During the midst of that controversy, they were saying: \nOh, it is not us, it is supply and demand. It was them, and some of \nthose guys are now in jail for the fraud they committed on the people \nof this country. That was Enron. But it is not just Enron.\n  In 2004, energy price manipulators moved to the propane market. That \nyear, the CFTC found that BP artificially increased propane prices by \npurchasing enormous quantities of propane and withholding the fuel to \ndrive prices higher. BP was fined $303 million for manipulating propane \nprices. Again, this is not a new concept; that is what they do.\n  In 2006, energy price manipulators moved to the natural gas market \nwhen Federal regulators discovered that the Amaranth hedge fund was \nresponsible for artificially driving up natural gas prices. Amaranth \ncornered the natural gas markets by controlling as much as 75 percent \nof all of the natural gas futures contracts in a single month. Amaranth \neventually went out of business, went bankrupt, and the price of \nnatural gas went down. So if you are looking at Enron, BP, Amaranth, \nwhy would anybody be shocked that today there are financial \ninstitutions manipulating the oil markets as we see it?\n\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the authority and the \nresponsibility to prevent fraud, manipulation, and excessive \nspeculation in U.S. commodity markets. Unfortunately, this authority \nand responsibility has largely been abdicated through the use of over-\nthe-counter energy derivatives that are largely unregulated and by \nforeign boards of trade that have received no-action letters from the \nCFTC to operate terminals inside the United States, trading U.S. \ncommodities to U.S. investors free from regulatory oversight.\n  That is an issue we must deal with and we must deal with now. If we \nare serious about lowering oil and gas prices today, we have to deal \nwith the greed of the oil companies and with the speculators. Long \nterm, of course, we have to move this country away from foreign oil, \naway from fossil fuel, to energy efficiency, to sustainable energy, and \nthe potential there is enormous. That will help us deal with greenhouse \ngas emissions, in terms of global warming and, in the process, we can \ncreate millions of good-paying jobs.\n  Let me conclude by saying that if this Congress, in the very short \nterm, does not deal with these issues, there are going to be people who \nare going to go cold this winter, not only in the Northeast but all \nover the Northern tier of this country. That is why I am going to do my \nbest in this bill, and/or as soon as possible, to bring forth an \namendment to substantially increase funding for LIHEAP.\n  The National Governors Association supports over $5 billion for \nLIHEAP. They are exactly right because, as the price of home heating \noil and other fuels explodes, we are going to simply need to \nsubstantially increase funding for LIHEAP if we are going to make sure \npeople don't go cold this winter. I look forward to working on this \nissue in a bipartisan manner.\n  Bottom line: Short term, going after the oil companies and dealing \nwith speculation. Long term, we need to transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuels to sustainable energy. We must substantially \nincrease funding for LIHEAP.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                     GAO Sustains Boeing's Protest\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued \nits ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the largest defense contracts \nin history: the Air Force's decision to choose the European company \nAirbus to supply the next generation of aerial refueling tankers.\n  In that ruling, the GAO agreed with Boeing that there were \nfundamental flaws in the process from the very beginning. GAO's \nattorneys found the Air Force made a number of significant errors that \nunfairly misled Boeing and favored Airbus.\n  They recommended that the Air Force reopen the contract, get new \nproposals, and make a decision that corrects the errors GAO found.\n  Madam President, to me, that decision was not a surprise. Air Force \nand Pentagon officials have told me, time and time again, that they \nfollowed the law and this contract would stand up to review.\n  But since the very beginning, it has been very clear that Airbus \ntankers did not meet the Air Force's needs--no matter what its public \nrelations campaign has said.\n  Even though the Air Force claimed it had selected the cheaper plane \nand made no mistakes, we learned last week it had made a critical error \nwhen calculating the operating costs of the two tankers. The Air Force \nis now acknowledging the Airbus plane actually costs tens of millions \nof dollars more.\n  Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Gates forced out the top two Air \nForce leaders--Secretary Michael Wynne and\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\nhis Chief of Staff, GEN Michael Moseley. By doing that, he expressed a \nserious lack of confidence in their leadership and lack of oversight. \nAll along, the Pentagon has refused to answer even basic questions \nabout this contract.\n  I, and the many others who have raised concerns about the Air Force's \ndecision, now expect a thorough and honest response from the Pentagon \nto the GAO's decision.\n  But as I have said all along, the GAO ruling answers only one \noverarching question that has been raised in this process and that is \nwhether the Air Force followed the letter of the law when it chose \nAirbus for the contract. That means that even if it was obvious that \nAirbus's plane was wrong for the war fighter and for the taxpayer, it \ncould not push for answers.\n  That is Congress's job, and we in Congress, who represent the \nAmerican taxpayers, have to continue to press for real answers to those \nhard questions. We in Congress need to know why the Air Force chose a \nplane that is bigger and less efficient than it asked for--one that \ncannot use hundreds of our runways, ramps, and hangars, and one that \nwill cost billions of dollars more in fuel and maintenance.\n  We in Congress need to know whether our Government should buy a plane \nthat even the Air Force says is less survivable, less able to keep our \nwar fighters safe. We in Congress need to know what the effect on our \neconomy and our national security will be if we turn this technology, \nwhich is vital to this Nation, over to a company that is owned by \nforeign governments.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative is so concerned about the subsidies \nAirbus receives that they have brought a case against the EU before the \nWorld Trade Organization. We need to know why in the world we would \naccuse Europe of unfair trade practices and then turn around and hand \nAirbus a major piece of our defense industry. We need to know why our \nGovernment would hand them the contract now.\n  In May, employers cut 49,000 jobs in the United States. It was the \nlargest 1-month jump in unemployment in 22 years. Yet the \nadministration, right in the middle of this, wants to send 44,000 U.S. \njobs overseas, when we are hemorrhaging jobs here at home.\n  On the day in February that the Air Force first announced it awarded \nthis plane to Airbus, I was out on the 767 line, in Everett, with our \nBoeing workers. I will never forget the shock and disappointment in \ntheir eyes. One woman came up to me and said:\n\n       I can't believe this. My son is currently flying these \n     tankers over in Iraq, serving our country. I want to build \n     those planes with my taxpayer dollars to make sure he is safe \n     and we know what is in that plane.\n\n  Yesterday's GAO study proved she was right and she is vindicated. We \nnow have the right process to move forward on this and make a good \ndecision not only for that mom but for American taxpayers and for \nAmerica's security for the future.\n  For months now, I have been saying this process was flawed. I have \nbeen saying we should not hand over billions of dollars and thousands \nof jobs and that Boeing should build those tankers. The GAO's decision \nbacked up all my concerns. The process was flawed. Now we need to know \nwhy. We should not be buying more expensive planes built in France. \nThat seems obvious. With a level playing field, Boeing builds the best \ntankers at the best price.\n  By reevaluating this deal with the proper criteria that GAO outlined, \nI am confident the Air Force will, in the end, agree with me and award \nthis contract to Boeing--I hope in short order. I hope our airmen and \nairwomen will soon have the best possible plane to carry out their \nmissions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin briefly by thanking our \ncolleagues who have come and spoken on the bill already this morning. I \nthank Senator Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, a member of Senator Shelby's \nand my committee, the Banking Committee, for his remarks. I also thank \nJudd Gregg, of New Hampshire, who, while not a member of the committee, \nhas followed our work very closely and has been intimately involved \nwith the committee over the last number of months as we were developing \nthe Homeowners Act, an idea he brought to the table. He brings a good \nhistorical perspective--going back to the Resolution Trust Corporation \nand dealing with another housing crisis and how well that idea worked; \nand while we are not exactly duplicating it, he has knowledge of how \nthat worked and an understanding of the basic idea behind the bill that \nwe have authored over the last several months, which is very helpful.\n  I know Senator Shelby and I are grateful, as are other members of the \ncommittee, for having a nonmember of the committee understand the issue \nas well as he does. His support of what we are trying to do is very \nhelpful.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley as well. Senator Shelby \nand I are not dealing with the tax-writing provisions of this bill and \nthey have been helpful and cooperative and, obviously, their ideas are \na strong complement to what we are trying to achieve--with mortgage \nrevenue bonds and tax incentives for those who acquire foreclosed \nproperties, and the like, are very helpful. They have disregarded \nearlier provisions included in the tax proposals and, candidly, I think \nthose ideas being kept out of this bill is healthy. I don't dwell on \nit. Frankly, I think their appraisal of the various ideas is very \nconstructive. We thank the tax-writing committee, the Finance \nCommittee, which has done a good job in complementing what we are \ntrying to do.\n  Senator Johnny Isakson, of Georgia, deserves a great deal of credit. \nHe brought up the idea of trying to create some incentives for those \nwho might purchase foreclosed properties. In his previous life, he \nworked in this area, and he has a firm knowledge of it. So his \ncooperation on that, as well as other aspects of the bill, his \nenforcement and support of this legislation and his intention to back \nit is a further indication of the effort we have made on a bipartisan \nbasis to make this a good bill, not just because it has bipartisan \nsupport, but I think that is indicative of the kind of effort that has \nbeen made that brings us to this moment.\n  I note that in this morning's local newspaper, the Washington Post, \nthe leading headline is, ``DC Region's Foreclosure Rate Soars.'' It \nsays that although communities have felt the effects of the housing \ncrisis for months, the report reveals that foreclosures in the \nWashington region have been increasing at a surprisingly quick pace, \noutstripping those of most metropolitan areas. It points out that while \nforeclosures were practically nonexistent in Washington 18 months ago, \nit is now very prevalent and way above the national average.\n  I point that out because that is unique here. It makes a point. As I \nshowed earlier this morning, with the graph we put up, we have the \nnumbers now for May on the foreclosure rates. Over 8,400 people are \ngoing to foreclosure every single day in America. That number was below \n8,000, in the mid-7,500 area, only a few weeks ago.\n  For those who would suggest that we ought to wait this out, or see \nwhat happens down the road, explain that to the 8,000 families today \nwho may lose their homes, the 8,000 tomorrow and the 8,000 the \nfollowing day and the day after that and all next week, as we grapple \nwith this bill, where as many as 50,000 or 60,000 families will be \nadversely affected while we debate whether this is a perfect bill. My \npatience is thin. We have worked so hard on this. So for those who \nsuggest it is a bailout for a lender--I have heard a lot of arguments, \nand when you have people losing homes every day, neighborhoods being \ndestroyed because of it, including financial aid for students, \nmunicipal finance, commercial lending, and the global implications and \ntrying to put a bill together that will bring some confidence back to \nthe marketplace, and to suggest this is a bailout for some bank--it is \nanything but that. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Senator Shelby \nand I have had 50 hearings since last March on this subject matter--\nalmost exclusively on this subject matter--and we have had these \nindividuals before our committees explaining to us why they were giving \nout adjustable rate mortgages to people on fixed incomes, knowing very \nwell these people could never, ever pay the final fully indexed price \nof those properties. Yet they did it, day in and day out, knowing full \nwell what the implications would be.\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\n  The very companies they claim are being bailed out are exactly the \nones that were engaging in that, and the last thing we are doing is \nproviding any kind of support and assistance for them. We are trying to \nsee to it that we restore some semblance of confidence in this area and \nwe are planning to keep as many people in their homes as we can.\n  Have we written a miracle? Absolutely not. Will this work? I hope so. \nDo I have an assurance it will? No. All I know is it is our best \njudgment, based on the wonderful, competent people who don't bring an \nideological perspective to this--from the American Heritage Foundation \nto the Consumer Federation of America and groups in between. They have \nsaid this is the best idea we could come up with to address this issue. \nThey would also be the ones to tell you there is no assurance it is \ngoing to work. It is a voluntary program. We don't mandate anything \nhere; we are just creating the opportunity.\n  I say to my colleagues that history is somewhat of a teacher in all \nof this. Back in the last period when we had a housing crisis of this \nmagnitude, back in the 1920s and 1930s, another Congress did it \ndifferently. In that case, the Federal Government actually purchased \ndistressed mortgages. Senator Shelby and I are not suggesting anything \nsuch as that. We are talking about an insurance program. It is a \nvoluntary program that creates a new, temporary program. It ends in a \nfew years. It is merely an effort to step in here and try to make a \ndifference in all of this.\n  I will go back over some of the specifics of this--the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act--as well as the issue dealing with the affordable \nhousing provision and how we managed to do this without a tax increase. \nWe have a wonderful symmetry of liquidity being strengthened, a \nregulator being imposed on these GSEs, and a source of revenue coming \nfrom that which can also assist in another area of needed housing.\n  We think this has a rather good sense of balance.\n  But again, I am very grateful to the Finance Committee, Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, and to the Members who have spoken out, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, this morning, those who have come \ntogether and said this is a good bill deserving of our support. We hope \nthe rest of our colleagues, as they come forward with these amendments, \nwill be so inclined to stand with us and support this bill, and urge \nthe White House to sign it into law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I commend the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, for his work on this package of legislation. \nIt is a package. It is dealing with the reform of the government-\nsponsored enterprises, GSEs, which desperately need to have a strong \nregulator because they play such a huge role, probably the primary role \nby a long shot right now, in our housing industry. They need to be \nproperly regulated because they are a government-sponsored enterprise, \nand that is part of the legislation I have pushed.\n  Senator Dodd and I have worked together. He is pushing the housing \nlegislation, but I agree with him. If there were any inkling of a \nbailout for anybody here, we wouldn't be a part of it in any way, and \nno one would in the Senate. So that is a red herring. But this will \ngive some hope and opportunity for some people to probably save their \nhomes who otherwise wouldn't be able to.\n  We need to pass this legislation now. If we could get this \nlegislation to the President's desk, and he would sign it, which I hope \nhe would by the 4th of July, by the end of next week, this would be a \nsignificant feat on our part. I hope we can do it.\n  I also want to take a moment, as Senator Dodd did, and commend other \nSenators for their work. Senator Isakson knows a lot about housing. He \ngrew up in housing. He has been very successful at it, and he brings \nthat experience and knowledge to this body in the Senate. The housing \ntax credit, not to bail out anybody but to help people save their \nhomes, was I believe originated by him. He is pushing this provision, \nand we commend him for helping us on this.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Judd \nGregg, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, now the ranking \nmember. He knows a lot about all the problems in this country. He is \nvery insightful. He sees this legislation, overall, as a good package \nand a good piece of legislation.\n  I hope we will be able today and tomorrow to pass this legislation, \nif the Senate is willing, and go to the next step, because there are a \nlot of people who will possibly be able to save their homes because of \nthis.\n  Will this save everything in America? No. But it will be a good first \nstep and it will be profound, meaningful legislation, and so I commend \nit to the Senate this afternoon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 energy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, over the course of the last several days I \nhave refrained from speaking on the floor about energy. But I have \nwatched the floor very closely as I have seen kind of an interesting \nduel going on. An advocate of drilling, I found it fascinating that \nsome on the other side of the aisle were saying that if we opened our \nouter continental reserves and drilled them, it would simply make no \ndifference to the current state of play in the oil market or the price \nof gas at the pump. I find it not only interesting that that kind of \nconclusion is being drawn, but I also find it phenomenally naive that \nkind of statement can be made.\n  It is my opinion, and I think the opinion of a good many, that we are \nin a classic supply-and-demand situation in the Nation and therefore \nthe world's oil markets. There is alleged speculation. There is alleged \nmanipulation. I don't know whether any of that is true, but I do know \nthe facts of what we live with and have lived with for the last several \nyears.\n  There have been many of us in Congress who said there would be a day \nof reckoning if we continued to consume oil at a greater rate than we \nwere producing and refining and bringing it to the marketplace. I \nbelieve it is very possible that day of reckoning is at hand. The world \nmarket in which we acquire our oil, the world market in which gas is \nrefined from oil, is just that--a world market. It is not a domestic \nmarket. It doesn't happen down the street, only to be supplied on that \nstreet. It happens in the Middle East, it happens in Latin America, it \nhappens in Canada, and it happens in this country. It all comes \ntogether in a world market, and we compete at the local gas pump for \nthe price of the world market.\n  Here is a perfect example of the reality in which we live as \nAmerica's consumers. I do not deny--in fact, I sympathize with and I am \nfrustrated for America's consumers who today are facing $4 and $4.45 \nand $4.50 gas. It is taking a huge bite out of their back pocket, and \nthey are not ready for it. They have not been eased into it. They \nshould not have had to even be worried about easing into it because it \nshould not have happened. But the Congress of the United States for the \nlast 20 years has been in a perfect and absolute state of denial.\n  Energy was inexpensive compared to the rest of the world, and we \ncould put this known reserve off, we could put this off, we could worry \nabout that tomorrow because we didn't have to worry about it today. We \ncould be environmental purists because it was easy to do.\n  Here is what was happening in America. The supply through the 1970s \nand 1980s and 1990s was dramatically dropping, but the demand was \ncontinuing to go up at an unprecedented rate. In fact, after the oil \nshock of the 1970s, when we adjusted some CAFE standards and we did a \nfew other things, our\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\neconomy took off. As our economy took off, by definition we became ever \nincreasingly larger consumers of oil, of hydrocarbons. It is that which \nlubricates the economy of our Nation. If we are going to be 25 percent \nof the world economy, guess what, we consume 25 percent of the world's \nenergy. But we were not producing 25 percent of the world's energy. We, \nby this time, had begun to develop a huge dependency on other places in \nthe world, all while we were having this phenomenal luxury of saying \nyou don't have to drill in ANWR or Alaska, it may have 15 or 20 billion \nbarrels, but we don't know, we can't touch it. We don't have to drill \noff the coast, we don't have to worry about oil shale. We don't have to \nworry about anything. We can be green and talk about the environment \nand deny the reality of the marketplace and grow increasingly more \ndependent on somebody else.\n  Here is an interesting chart. It is a chart I found in a book I am \nreading now that I recommend all Senators read. It is called ``A \nThousand Barrels A Second.'' Think of that. That is the title of the \nbook, but it is a title of reality. The reality is that the world in \nwhich we consume energy and from which we buy energy today consumes \n1,000 barrels of oil a second. Do the math: 86.5 million barrels of oil \na day. That is what the world marketplace is, and we consume 20-plus \npercent of it.\n  Here is what was happening from the 1970s on when we were in an oil \nshock. We looked at ourselves, we adjusted ourselves a little bit, and \nwe began to try to figure other ways.\n  Oil production from 1970 to the year 2005, as demonstrated by the \ndark blue--as you notice, it was going up progressively. But something \nelse was happening that allowed for adjustments in the market. This \ngreen area was the extra capacity the market was not consuming. So when \nthere were bumps in the market, there was extra capacity. It didn't \nhappen to be in the United States. It predominantly was in the Middle \nEast and with the OPEC nations, but it was extra capacity.\n  Here we are in 2005. What had happened? China had come into the \neconomy. India had come into the economy. They were beginning to \nconsume at rates we did not expect. While they were consuming and \nbuying out of the world's markets, the world's capacity was continuing \nto drop as it relates to consumption.\n  This is not necessarily a lecture in economics, but it is a lecture \nin supply and demand. For any Senator to deny the reality of the \nmarketplace is either naive or politically incorrect. The marketplace \nis working in a way that none of us likes today, and our constituents \nare feeling it in their back pockets, and they are picking up the phone \nand calling their Senator and saying: Do something about it.\n  We are trying to figure out a way to politically dance that line. \nThere is very little we can do about it tomorrow. There is a lot we can \ndo about it in 2 to 5 years if we let the world begin to produce again. \nBut we have not made that choice yet.\n  The President is talking about it. Other people are talking about it \nat this moment. They are talking about going into the known reserves. \nBut here is also a reality of what has happened. See this declining \nline right here? Any time you drill into an oilfield, any time you \nbegin to lift crude oil out of that field, you begin to deplete the \nfield. An average oilfield in the world depletes at 5 percent to 7 \npercent a year. That is the historic natural level that the industry \nwill tell you--you get a depletion rate. If you are depleting at 5 \npercent to 7 percent a year and the world demand growth is going up at \nabout 1.5 percent, you have a problem if you are not producing more oil \nto the marketplace. That is where we are today as a world consumer of \noil. We are not producing the increased volume necessary to fit the \ngrowth of the marketplace. It is really quite simple. We as country are \nproducing increasingly less.\n\n  We have 80 billion barrels of reserve out there, we think. At least \nwe know we have 25 or 30 billion barrels of known reserve in ANWR and \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. If we do the new geology, maybe we have \n80, maybe we have 120. We don't know it, but we believe it is there. \nWhat is the value of drilling it; it is going to take 3 to 5 years? You \nbet it is going to take 3 to 5 years or more. The problem is today. \nYes, we should have thought about it 3 to 5 years ago, but we were all \nrunning to look green, running to talk about the environment, wanting \nto do things we didn't want to do, but we did it because it was good \npolitics. And we were denying the marketplace.\n  Here is the reality we got ourselves in. We don't control the \nmarketplace anymore. Other nations of the world do control the \nmarketplace. The Saudis control it, and on down the line. Eighty \npercent of the world's supply of oil out there is controlled by other \nnations, not companies--not ExxonMobil, not Chevron, not Marathon; they \ncontrol way less than 10 percent of the total reserves. The rest of the \nworld is now telling America where to go; that is, you go to the market \nand you buy off the market and we are not going to give you any margin. \nAt the same time, we are denying ourselves production in the \nmarketplace.\n  Here is what happened. It is a reality that all of us have to face. \nOh, we said no California, Oregon, and Washington; we said no down the \neast coast because it was politically the right thing to do; we said no \nup around Florida; we said no up here in ANWR in Alaska; and we believe \nthere may be as many as 80 billion barrels of oil. What does 80 billion \nbarrels mean if you can develop it? It means maybe a couple of million \nbarrels a day into the U.S. market and into the world market.\n  What does that mean? I believe--and I think the market believes--the \ntrue value of oil today based on today's consumption levels is maybe \n$85 or $90 a barrel. But that extra margin on top, that $40 of margin \nsitting on top that produces $130 or $140 of oil today, is speculation. \nIt is speculation based on a futures market that says in the future, \nbecause America is not producing and the world is not producing to that \ndecline chart, because we are not adding that extra 5 or 6 percent a \nyear, out here in 2010 and 2015 that is going to be the real price. We \nhave to secure that for our consumer. So we are going to bet on the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, 2 billion barrels into the U.S. market, now or 5 years \nfrom now, what does it do to the price of oil today? Some futures \nspeculators, some people who buy in the futures market say that if this \ncountry commits itself to drilling, if this country commits itself to \ndevelopment in the 2-year to 5-year period, the market will begin to \nadjust and come down. Why? Because of the belief that we are going to \nfind it out there, we are going to add it to the pool, and we are going \nto develop that margin of protection, again, that the market \nhistorically had against an ever-growing market.\n  Is this the answer for 30 years from now? Of course, it is not. I \nhave said and others are saying that it is a bridge to the future. It \nis the reality of where we are today because electric cars are not \nprevalent in the market. It is a reality of where we are today because \nhydrogen fuel cells are not in the market. But they are coming. It is a \nreality of where we are today because we are not producing enough \nethanol, both corn-based and cellulosic. There is a huge new wave of \ntechnology coming, but it is 3 years out, it is 10 years out, it is 15 \nyears out. What do we do in between? Do we simply turn to our consumers \nand say: Buck up; pay for the oil. Pay for the gas. Pay $5. There is \nnothing we can do about it.\n  Don't let your politician tell you that, because there is something \nwe can do about it. We can bring on our known reserves. We can open \nthem up to the market. We can let the bidding process go forward, and \nwe can tell the world market that America is going to be producing \nagain, in a timeframe of 3 to 5 years. As a result of that, the \nspeculation will begin to move out of the market because there will be \na sense of reality returning to what has been there through the 1970s \nand the 1980s and the 1990s, and that is additional supply to offset \nthe depletion in the oilfield itself and the demand for about a 1-\npercent or 1.5-percent growth in the market as these new technologies \nbegin to take hold.\n  Last year, Senator Dorgan and I passed a provision that we called the \nDOES Act which said, let's get the scientists out there, use the new \ngeology and find out where the oil is.\n  Oh, no, we cannot do that. We might find it. And if we find it, we \nmight want to drill it. And if we want to drill it, that is not green, \nthat is not environmentally sound. Even if, as we\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nknow, today's technologies allow us that kind of environmental \nprotection, it was not politically popular to do.\n  We passed it out of the Senate. Thank you, Senators, for helping us. \nIt was lost in a conference with the House. You see, even a year ago, \nCongress was in a state of denial, of denial of the reality of the \nmarketplace, of a reality of depletion, of where we were and where we \nare going to go. So our consumers today are paying more than they have \never paid for energy. They are not happy, and they have every reason to \nbe angry at a Congress that for 10 years at least, or 20, has been in a \nstate of denial, not recognizing the reality of a market that would \ncome home to rest on the price of oil. But it has. And it is today.\n  I am thinking if there are questions today whether we ought to drill \nin our known reserves and use all of our environmental tools to be \nsound, and some are still holding back at $4.50, what do you do at $5 a \ngallon? What do you do when the consumers' frustration turns from anger \nto fear? Because, you see, fear is a whole new emotion. What if they \nbegin to fear they can no longer afford the home they have, or their \nfood budgets, or the structure and security of their family? What \nhappens when they still have to have energy to move to work, and it is \ngoing to cost them more than they have ever dreamed of paying in their \nlives? I think fear will turn politics in the direction of a \nmarketplace, in the reality of what we can do, whether it is 2 years \nout or 5 years out.\n  So to the American consumer who is angry today, and may become \nfearful tomorrow, e-mail your Congressman, e-mail your Senator, call \nthem. Tell them: Let's get this country back into production. Do it in \nan environmentally sound way, do it clean, do it right, but do it. Put \nyour money into new technologies. Invest for the future, because oil is \nnot going to be there, and the oil that will be there 10 years from now \nis going to be a lot more costly, because we have pumped all of the \neasy, we have reached all of the low-hanging fruit, and that which \ncomes tomorrow will be more expensive because it is deeper, or it is in \na sensitive area where we have to be more careful than we have been in \nthe past.\n  Because we are always going to need some oil, we hope only for \ntransportation, we can do it with electric cars, we can do it with \nplug-ins, we can do it with all the right kinds of things that begin to \nturn us away from an oil market.\n  For those who said Congress has not done anything in that area, we \nhave done some things. We passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2007. There was not production of oil in it. Many \nof us tried to get it in, but we were denied because it was not \n``politically green correct.'' But then again, gas was $2, and now it \nis $4, or it is $4.50; it may soon be $5, because the world has \nawakened to the reality of supply and demand and need. They are going \nto wrestle for it, and they will wrestle in the marketplace. Those who \ncan pay the highest price are going to get the fuel.\n  But to the average consumers, middle-class Americans, that will \nbecome a great frustration, as it should. They need to make sure they \nhave a Congress that is willing to face the reality of the moment, and \nsay, let us produce. Let us get this country back into production. Let \nus look at our offshores. Let us look at ANWR. Let us look at where we \nknow the oil is, while we work to find out if there is anymore \nsomewhere else. Let's encourage production here at home, so that not \nonly can we enter the market with more oil, but we can be more secure, \nbecause this is a question of security, whether it is security in the \nhome, or whether it is security as a nation.\n  Politically, this Congress for the last two decades has been doing \nthe wrong thing when it came to petroleum and energy security. We grew \nincreasingly dependent on foreign nations, and as we did, we not only \nput our Nation at risk, we have now put the energy-consuming American \nfamily at risk. We should not be a part of that. We are here to \nfacilitate the possible so the marketplace can do what it can and does \nvery well. Right now the marketplace is squeezing and squeezing hard \nand competing for the last remaining oil until more oil comes in \nproduction.\n  Here is the last thought of a simple equation. If demand is going up \n1.5 percent a year worldwide, and depletion in the existing producing \nfields is going down at 7 to 8 percent a year, and you are not finding \nand bringing anymore on line, then the price goes up as the supply goes \ndown. But if you find a little more to add, about 5 percent more \nannualized, you offset the difference and price stabilizes. That is the \nway the market works. We do not have control of that as politicians; we \ncan only control access to future supply. That is what we ought to be \nabout as a Senate and as a country.\n  So e-mail your Senator, write your Congressman, tell them to get \ngoing. Let's get this great country of ours back into the business of \nproduction so the supply and demand in the marketplace stabilizes and \nthe American consumer can begin to become comfortable with where we are \nheaded in energy policy and their pocketbook.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the apologists for the oil industry tell us \na lot of things in the Chamber. I hear people in the White House, I \nhear elected officials, I hear people who have been particularly \nfriendly to the oil industry, campaign contributions, commentators in \nthe media, who tell us a lot of things about why the price of gas has \ngone up, triple, basically, since President Bush has taken office; \ntriple since the Iraq war began.\n  The apologists for the oil industry have ascribed no blame to Wall \nStreet speculators. They say the oil industry itself is blameless. They \nsay it is all about the environment, it is all about something most \npeople do not understand.\n  What they say specifically when they ask a few questions, is: \nWouldn't increasing offshore drilling lower gas prices? Wouldn't \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge lower gas prices? They say: Why can't we \nbuild more refineries in the United States? Let's for a moment talk \nabout some of those questions they raise.\n  First, President Bush's own Energy Department has said that increased \ndrilling offshore would have, in its words, ``no significant impact on \ngas prices until the year 2030.'' So if we began to drill offshore all \nthe places that some of my friends across the aisle say we should \ndrill, it would make no appreciable difference in the price of gas \nuntil 2030, if even then.\n\n  Since President Bush has been in office, the Federal Government has \nnearly tripled the number of permits given to big oil companies to \ndrill for more oil. They have tripled the number of permits. Yet what \nhas happened to gas prices? It has gone from $1.50 to over $4, from $30 \na barrel at the beginning of the Iraq war to $130, $140 a barrel now. \nBig oil companies are not drilling for oil in 75 percent of the land \nthe Federal Government has leased to them, both onshore and offshore.\n  Then they say: Wouldn't drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge lower gas prices? The President's own Energy Department, again a \nPresident of the United States who came out of the oil industry, a Vice \nPresident of the United States whose office is across the aisle here, \nwho came out of the oil industry, the President's own Energy \nDepartment, full of oil company executives and allies and friends, said \na couple of years ago: Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nwould only reduce gasoline prices by a penny per gallon, and only 20 \nyears from now when drilling is at its peak.\n  Again, it is one of those arguments they make because they do not \nwant to blame the oil industry, they do not want to blame the \nspeculators on Wall Street who have way more to do with this price jump \nthan anything else.\n  They say: Why can't we build more refineries in the United States? \nWell, big oil companies are reducing refinery capacity not because of \nthe Federal Government, they are doing it to increase their profits. An \ninternal memo from Chevron in 1995 said: If the United States petroleum \nindustry does not reduce its refining capacity, does not cut down its \nrefining capacity, it will never see any substantial increase in \nprofits.\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\n  In other words, it is in the oil companies' interests to not increase \nrefining capacity. They have the permits to do it. There are no \nenvironmental rules stopping them from doing it. They have the permits \nto do it. It is in their interest to keep refining capacity to refine \nless so with supply and demand the price goes up. Don't think they \nhaven't thought through that.\n  The largest five oil refineries in the United States now control over \nhalf of domestic oil refinery capacity up from one-third only 10 years \nago. This consolidation makes it easier for them to lessen supply, to \nwithhold supplies in order to drive up prices.\n  If you have looked at oil prices in the last 10 or 20 years, a spike \nin oil prices always comes as a result of some other incident. It comes \nfrom perhaps a fire at a refinery, an outage of a pipeline, Hurricane \nKatrina, some international incident that causes a disruption in oil \nsupply. That is normally over the years when we have seen a spike in \noil prices, of gasoline prices at the pump when something such as that \nhas happened.\n  None of that has happened in the last couple of years. But it is not \none spike, it is not two, it is spike after spike after spike, prices \ngoing again from about $30 a barrel when the President took office, the \noil company President, to $130, $140 today; $1.30, $1.40 at the gas \npump, now up to over $5, as we know.\n  Pointing fingers in the end gets us nowhere, and saying someone is \nright, somebody is wrong. The issue is what are we going to do about \nthis. One of the things we should do is to impose a windfall profits \ntax on oil companies to stop them from gouging consumers at the pump. \nThe Bush Justice Department ought to begin looking at price-fixing \nissues much more aggressively than they ever have.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission needs to be more involved in \nrooting out the speculators who may very well be doing Enron-type \nspeculating to push up the price of oil.\n  The last time a windfall profits tax was in effect in 1981 to 1988, \ngas prices were reduced by 45 cents a gallon, oil prices declined by \n$20 a barrel, and it generated $89 billion in revenue.\n  Most importantly, longer term we need to transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. That is clearly the \nwave of the future. We need to get started sooner rather than later. We \non this side of the aisle have tried to take money from the Bush energy \nbill, some of the subsidies and tax breaks, and use that money to go \ninto alternative energy research and development and do all of the \nthings we need to do.\n  In closing, over the past 7 years, Enron, BP, and Amaranth were \ncaught redhanded manipulating the price of electricity, propane, and \nnatural gas. Each time they said supply and demand was to blame. Each \nteam the pundits were proven wrong. Excessive speculation, \nmanipulation, and greed were the cause.\n  The head of OPEC said: The price has nothing to do with a shortage of \noil. There is a lot of oil on the market. It is because of speculation. \nBart Chilton, one of the Commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, said speculation is driving up oil prices as much as 30 \npercent. We have work to do. It is clear that rather than defending the \noil industry and defending Wall Street speculation, it is time this \nCongress took action, that the President finally decided to be on the \nside of the driving public and of businesses that are hurt, truckers \nand others who are hurt so badly by this, as food prices go up, and all \nof the other things that happen from high energy prices. It is time the \nPresident and the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission came down on the side of the public interest and began to do \nthe right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks and potential remarks from the Democratic side \nthat the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Unanimous-Consent Request--Medicare 18-Month Extension\n\n  Mr. KYL. Over the last week on our side, we have listened to some of \nour colleagues suggest that Republicans have obstructed action on \nimportant matters here. I want to ensure that with respect to \nprotecting our seniors through the service of the Medicare physicians \nwho take care of them, that we are able to meet a deadline on the \nstatute which expires at the end of this month to ensure they continue \nto be paid.\n  One of my colleagues yesterday said Senate Republicans had refused to \ngive Senate Democrats the opportunity to ensure quality health care for \nAmerican seniors. Yet following those remarks, the minority leader \npropounded two unanimous consent agreements which would have permitted \nus to move forward to consider two bills that would preserve Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to care.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am just about done propounding my request, but I am happy \nto yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Arizona how he voted on the motion \nfor cloture to bring to the floor the Medicare changes which he is now \nsupporting.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to my colleague that \nour proposal is to move forward with a bipartisan approach rather than \nthe partisan approach which, of course, I opposed. In that regard, I, \ntherefore, suggest that we simply extend existing law, which this \nSenate overwhelmingly supported just 6 months ago, for another 18 \nmonths, a proposal that had been made by the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee that would allow us to solve this problem not in a \npartisan way but in a bipartisan way.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a Senate bill which I will send to the desk. \nIt is a clean 18-month extension of the December Medicare bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I conclude with a brief remark?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I wish to express disappointment. Again, we are trying to \nsimply allow the Senate to move forward, in a bipartisan way, to \nresolve a problem we all need to resolve. This would extend the \nexisting law for another 18 months, something that had been, in fact, \nproposed by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I am \ndisappointed we are not able to do this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes on this \nissue and then yield the floor to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are trying to bring this Medicare issue \nto the floor for debate. Nine Republicans joined Democrats and said: \nLet's do it. But it wasn't enough. We are asking to bring it forward \nfor debate. If you have a better idea, put it on the floor and let's \nvote on it. But for the Republicans to consistently file these \nfilibusters and object to bringing these measures forward to even \ndebate them, and now it is a take it or leave it. The Senator from \nArizona has filed, just like the minority leader did yesterday, this \npolitical get-well card which says: We will make a unanimous consent \nrequest so we are on the record wanting this. Get on the record and \nvote for bringing it to the floor for debate. Don't be afraid of a \ndebate. Don't be afraid of an amendment. If you have a good idea, put \nit forward. Let's see if it wins or loses.\n  Seventy-seven, one after another, and this one is to stop a cut in \nreimbursement for doctors providing help through Medicare. These \ndoctors need that help. That is why we wanted to bring it to the floor. \nI beg the Republican side, for goodness sakes, let's act like a Senate. \nLet's debate. Let's deliberate. Let's vote on amendments. Let's earn \nour pay one week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                             Boeing Protest\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to discuss the Government Accountability Office \ndecision to sustain the Boeing protest of\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nthe KC-X tanker award, which I have followed closely. The Northrop \nGrumman/EADS proposal would have resulted in a fabulous new \nconstruction facility in my home State and would have created thousands \nof jobs within the United States. I confess that I am disappointed by \nthe decision. I do think it is important that we continue to follow \nthis process and to recognize the appropriate roles of the different \nGovernment actors involved.\n  It is, of course, not the GAO's job to pick aircraft for the Air \nForce. GAO used to be called the Government Accounting Office. Now it \nis the Government Accountability Office. It is fundamentally the \naccounting arm of our Government. As they said themselves when they \nmade this decision in which they found flaws in the process for making \nthis selection:\n\n       Our decision should not be read to reflect a view as to the \n     merits of the firms' respective aircraft. Judgments about \n     which offeror will most successfully meet governmental needs \n     is largely reserved for the procuring agencies, subject only \n     to such statutory and regulatory requirements as full and \n     open competition and fairness to potential offerors.\n\n  In other words, it is the job of the war fighters, the people who \nwill use this aircraft, the U.S. Air Force and those who benefit from \nthe U.S. Air Force refueling capability, it is for them to make a \ndecision about which aircraft best meets their needs. The GAO has to \nmake sure that all appropriate processes and procedures are followed in \ndoing this. Both the Air Force and DOD have been unequivocal in their \nstatements that they believe the Northrop/EADS aircraft is a superior \naircraft for their needs. As Air Force Assistant Secretary Sue Payton \nsaid upon announcement of the decision:\n\n       Northrop Grumman clearly provided the best value to the \n     government when you take a look at, in accordance with the \n     RFP, the five factors that were important to this decision: \n     in mission capability, in proposal risk, in the area of past \n     performance, in cost price, and in something we call an \n     integrated fleet aerial refueling rating.\n\n  They had a complex but serious evaluation procedure that they \nutilized. Last Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Geoffrey Morrell said the \nselection of the Northrop KC-45 ``provided our war fighters with the \nmost capable aircraft and the taxpayer [with] the most cost-effective \nsolution to this very real need of replacing the tanker fleet.''\n  The GAO found procedural flaws, according to their analysis, but they \nhave not overturned this fundamental conclusion, the evaluation made by \nthe Air Force personnel. The people who actually have to fly tankers \nand those who utilize them to refuel at high altitudes and high speeds \nover the Atlantic, over the Middle East, or wherever in the world, \nstill favored and chose the KC-45.\n  Still, it is important for the Air Force to consider the GAO's \nobjections and to take them into account. They have 60 days to do so. \nHowever, the GAO also acknowledged it is the Air Force's decision about \nwhat final action they are to take. They have not, as some suggested, \nbeen ordered to start over again.\n  My colleague, Senator Cantwell, whom I recognize represents the State \nof Washington where this work would be done if Boeing were the winner, \nhad this to say:\n\n       The Air Force will have no choice but to rebid this \n     project.\n\n  That is not true. That is not an accurate statement, frankly. We need \nto be sure about how we think about this as we go forward. Even more \ninaccurately, some of our colleagues have suggested that the GAO's \ndecision means the award should be given to Boeing. Senator Brownback's \npress release, my good friend from Kansas, who would love to get some \nof the work in his home State, said that as a result of yesterday's \nannouncement:\n\n       This contract should be overturned and awarded to Boeing.\n\n  That is not right. They didn't order that at all. There is no basis \nfor that whatsoever.\n  Congressman Norm Dicks, of Washington, who until recently was telling \npeople he didn't care what the GAO had to say, issued a press release \nyesterday touting the GAO decision and declaring as a result of it:\n\n       I believe the Air Force should set aside the agreement it \n     improperly reached with EADS/Northrop Grumman and we should \n     proceed expeditiously to build the best aircraft--the Boeing \n     KC-767--here at home.\n\n  ``At home'' meaning in his home State of Washington, not in my home \nState of Alabama.\n  That is a misreading completely of the GAO's decision and \ndemonstrates a misunderstanding of GAO's role. They analyzed the \nprocess. They found some errors, they said. They said nothing about \ngiving any award to the other competitor, Boeing. The military still \nadheres to its belief, as they noted, as to the superior aircraft.\n  Some of my colleagues also seem to misunderstand Congress's role in \nthis, or at least to interpret their responsibility to the American \nmilitary differently than I do. Senator Murray announced yesterday:\n\n       It is Congress's job to determine whether major defense \n     purchases meet the needs of our war fighters and deserve \n     taxpayer funding.\n\n  I tell you, I am a lawyer. I know our Presiding Officer is. \nSchoolteachers, accountants, veterinarians are not equipped or able, \nnor do we have the responsibility and the intense interest, to make \nthese kind of decisions that the U.S. Air Force does. They have a long \nhistory of aircraft purchasing and managing. They know something about \nwhat it is like to refuel in the air, why an aircraft that can fly \nfurther and carry far more fuel may be a superior aircraft to one that \ndoes not. This is not a political decision to be made by people who \nspend a few hours looking at it and think they now are capable to \nreverse the decision made by the one agency in our Government that will \nhave to live with the result. I believe it is the brave men and women \nof the Air Force who fly these planes and depend on them who should be \nmaking the decisions about their needs and what they think is best. We \nneed to protect that. If they change their mind after this, so be it. \nBut I hope and believe strongly this Congress should encourage the Air \nForce to consider the objections raised by GAO, to fairly evaluate \nthem, and then to select, without political influence, the best \naircraft for the men and women in uniform. That is the way we will \nserve our country. To politicize this process would be dead wrong, and \nI object to it. There has been too much of it.\n  Great progress was made when some of my colleagues including Senator \nMcCain objected when the Appropriations Committee slipped language into \nan appropriations bill that leased 100 aircraft, $23 billion, sole \nsource from Boeing. There had been no hearings. It was a sole-source \ncontract for about $235 million per aircraft to just lease 100 of these \naircraft. As a result of these questions that were raised, eventually, \none of the top procurement officials, a civilian in the Air Force, went \nto jail. Members of the leadership of Boeing resigned and \ninvestigations were conducted. It was quite a scandal. It was wrong, \nand it was corrupt. When that was discovered, people went to jail. So \nwhat did Congress do then? Congress, in my committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, had hearings about it. We discussed it. It was \nraised in the Airland Subcommittee, a subcommittee of which I was a \nmember and that I at one point chaired. We directed and required that \nthe Air Force conduct a competitive bid process for this contract. No \nmore sole-source. You pick the best aircraft in the world to serve our \nmen and women. That is what we directed--no ifs, ands, or buts, no \nqualifications. Not one amendment was offered to object. Everybody knew \nat the time there were two major aircraft-producing companies--only \ntwo--that could compete: Boeing and the Northrop Grumman-EADS team. So \nwe ordered a bid.\n\n  We have all kinds of joint operations--the Joint Strike Fighter, \nwhere parts come from European and American sources. We and our \nEuropean allies have come together to make the Joint Strike Fighter.\n  So we said we are going to bid this. The question came up during the \ndebate: Well, is this just a joke? Is this just a game? Is it going to \nbe a real, fair bid? Will everybody get a fair chance?\n  I remember I asked them: Is this going to be a political decision? \nAren't you required to do it on the merits? They assured me they would \ndo it on the merits.\n  As part of the bidding process, the Air Force produced and released a \nrequest for proposal. It is a detailed\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nstatement of what the Air Force is looking for. They request the \nbidders--in this case, there were just two--to respond to that request \nfor proposal. They also allowed the bidders an opportunity to make \nsuggestions and criticisms about the proposal. Otherwise, it would go \nout as proposed by the Air Force.\n  The Boeing team made no official or formal objections, no written \ncomplaints about the details of that proposal. They did not request \ncertain WTO provisions that might tilt the scales away from what is the \nbest aircraft or not the best aircraft. They agreed to proceed under \nthat process.\n  The Air Force believed they had the most open process in their \nhistory of any major contract of this kind. They were required to \nfollow their procedures, and it is easy to make a mistake. So maybe \nthey made some mistakes. Maybe they have a perfectly good explanation \nfor some of the criticism GAO has raised. But that is where we are \ntoday. They found some procedural flaws. But I have to tell you, the \nGAO did not say it was time for a bunch of politicians, a bunch of \nlawyers, accountants, prosecutors, schoolteachers, to start picking \nwhich is the best plane available to the Air Force. We should not be \nsubstituting our judgments for those of the military.\n  So I am sorry we did not get a firm confirmation on this process. I \nfully acknowledge the Air Force will need to review the complaints that \nhave been made. I hope they will move forward with the process quickly \nbecause it is a critical need. This Nation is really 8 or 9 years \nbehind our timeline to get started with producing the aircraft. It is \nthe No. 1 procurement priority for the U.S. Air Force. Many of the \nplanes are 50 years old. I saw one being refurbished with a serial \nnumber of 1960 not long ago. The cost of operating these aircraft is \nrising.\n  I hope we can work through this process and make sure each bidder has \na fair opportunity to bid. It is critically important that the Air \nForce treat all bidders fairly, that politics not interfere with the \nprocess, and that they select the best aircraft for the military.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to get back to the issue before us, \nthe housing crisis. I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for working so \nhard to reach compromise.\n  Here is where we are. I believe if you look at this recession many of \nour States are in--and there is an argument as to whether we are in \nthis recession nationally--we know where it is coming from. The housing \ncrisis is certainly a root cause. The speculation in the futures \nmarket, in oil, is definitely a root cause. We need to address both of \nthose issues. That is why on this side of the aisle we had a very good \npackage of bills to go after the speculators, to go after the \nmanipulators of gas prices.\n  We will keep coming back until our colleagues recognize they can talk \nabout drilling off the coast in pristine areas all they want--the truth \nis, the American people will see through that. Even if we were to do \nit--and I think it would be a disaster for our economy because those \nareas are dependent on a pristine coast--you are not going to see any \nimpact on gas prices until 2030.\n  So what we need to do on the gas-price front is to confront the \npeople who are speculating. We have heard numbers of up to about a \nthird of the price of a barrel of oil being associated with the \nspeculation. I also signed on to a letter. I thank Senator Frank \nLautenberg for his leadership. Eleven of us signed it, saying to the \nPresident that he should file a complaint with the World Trade \nOrganization against OPEC for withholding supply. So there is a lot we \ncan do. The President today could call for a quick investigation \nthrough the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, on collusion and so on. \nBut that is not happening. So at least we are, today, doing something \nvery important, which is coming together, hopefully, to pass a bill \nthat will deal with this housing crisis.\n  Look, I know I have talked to Senators Dodd and Shelby. In my State, \nwe have a big problem. I am going to show you a little later with a \nchart where we are with foreclosures. So, of course, I would have liked \nto have seen even a stronger bill. But I know how hard it was for \nSenators Dodd and Shelby. Each had his own ideas of what had to be \ndone. They came together, and I support what they have done.\n  I stood before the Senate about 2 months ago when we took up an \nearlier version of the bill, and I spoke about how California had more \nthan triple the number of foreclosure filings in 2007 than in 2006. I \nam very sad to report that the situation is even worse today. I want to \nshare with you what we see.\n  Foreclosure filings in California have skyrocketed over the last 41 \nmonths, rising from under 6,000 in January 2005 to 72,000 foreclosure \nfilings in May--the highest monthly number yet and nearly double the \nnumber of a year ago. Last month alone, 1 in every 183 California \nhouseholds received a foreclosure filing--a rate that was 2.6 times the \nnational average. Imagine, 1 in every 183 California households \nreceived a foreclosure filing--2.6 times the national average. As you \ncan see--and this will go to the next chart; and I say to Senator Dodd, \nI hope you have a minute to check this out--7 of the top 10 and 11 of \nthe top 20 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure activity in \nthe country are in California. This is where we are in California. Mr. \nPresident, 11 of the top 20 metropolitan areas with the most \nforeclosure filings in May are in my State. You see Stockton is No. 1, \nMerced is No. 3, and Modesto is No. 4--and it goes on.\n\n  This bill takes some important steps to address the crisis. It \nprovides funds to purchase and maintain foreclosed homes, to prevent \nthe cycle of blight from further lowering home values. It provides $4 \nbillion for neighborhood stabilization through community development \nblock grants for localities.\n  As a former county supervisor--that goes back a ways, but I well \nremember that the health of the neighborhoods depended on the \nhomeowners. When the homeowners disappear because they cannot sell \ntheir home or they foreclosed on a home, the whole neighborhood begins \nto wither. This is a problem. So I believe this $4 billion that will go \nto revitalize our neighborhoods and stabilize them is very important.\n  It provides $150 million in additional funding for housing \ncounselors. I held many open meetings throughout my State on this \ncrisis, and the crying need was for housing counselors because somebody \nhas to find out with whom they have their mortgage. Maybe it has \nchanged four times. Maybe the mortgage was securitized. They do not \nhave anyone to contact. We need these counselors to be on their side.\n  That funding in this bill will help as many as 250,000 more families \nwork with their mortgage servicer or lender to find a way to keep their \nhome. I know when you get people around the table who really know what \nis happening, we can solve a lot of these problems.\n  Third, the bill creates the HOPE for Homeowners Act, which authorizes \n$300 billion in FHA-backed loans to help families stay in their homes--\nat no cost to American taxpayers because of the way this will work.\n  These are all vital steps.\n  My big concern goes to the issue of the Nation's high-cost areas, of \nwhich California is one. We see there is a permanent increase in the \nloan limits for Fannie, Freddie, and FHA, but they are not as high as \nwhat was in the stimulus package. Although it is $625,000--it is a step \nin the right direction--we really should go back to the $729,000 we had \nunder the economic stimulus package.\n  The loan limit for participation in the HOPE for Homeowners Program \nis set at $550,000. Given the concentration of foreclosures in high-\ncost areas, a higher loan limit for this program is essential.\n  I know this was an issue for Senator Shelby, but I want to point out \nthat in his State, I think the average price of a home is about \n$130,000--the average median home price--$130,000. That is way under \nother areas, particularly areas such as Florida, California, and \nNevada.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe States that would benefit from the higher loan limit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\n               States Benefiting From Higher Loan Limits\n\n       Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \n     District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho.\n       Massachussetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Hampshire, \n     New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon.\n       Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, \n     Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are 28 States here. Believe me when \nI say, if we stick with the lower limits, a lot of people are not going \nto get the benefit. We are talking really about 97 million Americans \nwho would be adversely impacted by the fact that we did not have a \nhigher limit here. In California, 21 million people--more than half the \nState's population--live in 1 of 14 counties that have a median price \nso high, they do qualify for the higher $729,000 loan limits.\n  So I say to my friend, Senator Shelby, please remember that borrowers \nin his State will have access to affordable mortgages, for loans well \nover 300 percent above the median home price. So Senator Shelby's State \nis taken care of. But the States on this list, including California, \nConnecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, and Massachusetts--I could read \nthis list--they are going to be in trouble with these lower limits.\n  Again, my State has 11 of the top 20 metropolitan areas in the \ncountry with the most foreclosure filings. Going back to this chart, I \nwant to show Senator Dodd what has happened here. We just keep going up \nin foreclosures. Now 1 in every 183 households has received a \nforeclosure notice in California. This is very serious. That is just in \nMay.\n  This is why I am so pleased, I say to Senator Dodd, you and Senator \nShelby were able to get as far as you did get. And you did get pretty \nfar. You are doing some very important work here.\n  The dream of home ownership exists in every corner of America. I will \ntell my colleagues, I grew up in a family who never owned a home. We \ndidn't own a home when I was growing up. We couldn't do it. But when I \ngot married and I was able to save the money and get my first home, it \nwas a moment I will never forget, the first day in that home, and I \nowned it for 40 years. I literally kissed the walls when I moved in. I \nraised my kids there. That home provided the stability for our family, \nand it provided the wherewithal for us to be able to get funds, \nrefinance the house, fix it up. It grew along with our family. It was a \nwonderful investment for us. I want that for all Americans.\n\n  I don't want to help people who speculated. This bill doesn't do \nthat. This has to be a home owner. I don't want to help people who \nthought they would make a quick buck. That is not what this bill is \nabout. This bill is about preserving home ownership, helping \ncommunities.\n  I have to say, I know there is a lot of politics that is being \nplayed. This is a political year. But we have to set aside our partisan \ndifferences. There are Republicans who are having trouble staying in \ntheir homes, and there are Democrats who are having trouble staying in \ntheir homes. So we need to set aside our differences.\n  In this bill we also help with the low-income housing tax credit. So \nthe changes in this bill are long overdue, and they are critically \nneeded now. So no bill is perfect for any one of us. Each of us would \nhave written it better for our own State. I indicated why it needs to \nbe made stronger for my State. But am I going to support it? Yes, I am, \nbecause certainly it is moving in the right direction.\n  I thank Senator Dodd again for the work he has put into this bill. We \nneed it so badly in our State. I know how hard it was for him. I am \nhappy to yield to him for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. I wish to thank our colleague from California. She is \nabsolutely correct. Arizona, Nevada, Florida--there are States that are \nbeing affected, but no State is paying the price as much as California. \nIt is the epicenter of this problem for many reasons.\n  Earlier this morning, I highlighted the growing problem, as the \nSenator from California has done with her charts. We are now averaging \non a daily basis, I say to my colleague from California, 8,427 \nforeclosure filings in the country every single day. That is up \nalmost--somewhere in the area of 1,000 more than it was 2 months ago \nwhen it was up to 7,500 or in that range. Now we are getting close to \n9,000 every day for foreclosure filings.\n  The estimates are that when you get the resets that will be occurring \non these adjustable rate mortgages coming in July or shortly after \nJuly, we will face another tidal wave of foreclosures coming. So the \nSenator's numbers, as bad as they are today, will be worse, quite \ncandidly. So every day we wait, every day there is a delay, it is going \nto cost us dearly.\n  I can't guarantee our bill is going to solve every problem. All I can \ntell my colleagues is what we have done is listen to very good people. \nWe have held 50 different hearings over the last number of months \nlistening to people from the American Heritage Foundation, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and they all have come to this conclusion. So \nwhen people start telling me this is written for some special interest, \nbelieve me, if you have been to the 50 hearings and listened to people \ntalk about this idea--one that we actually tried once before; a very \nsimilar idea back in the early part of the 20th century during the \nGreat Depression is the last time we had a crisis such as this and it \nworked, and it made a difference in the lives of people and families.\n  I listened to the Senator's personal story, which is very moving. But \nwhat a difference there is today in our country that we have been able \nto make housing and home ownership available to so many more people and \nto watch it happen, and now watch this fall apart and what it does to \nneighborhoods and families and communities. There is nothing more \nstabilizing than the idea of having an equity interest in where you \nlive.\n  So this is an issue that has far broader implications than just \nhousing, but it is at the heart of who we are and the dreams that \npeople have in this country. So it is very important we get this done. \nI thank the Senator immensely for her comments, as well as the data \nwhich she is supplying to reinforce this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this list of 20 States--and I see my \nfriend from Florida is going to speak--of course, is included in here. \nThese are the States. It is 28 States--27 plus DC, to be exact--where \nwe have very high-cost housing. We are very grateful that Senator \nShelby agreed to go over $600,000. Believe me, we need a little more \nboost. But we have to do this. We have to get it done.\n  I guess the reason I wanted to speak today is to not only thank \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby for bridging the partisan divide, but \nto say we cannot play politics with this subject matter. This isn't \nabout some ideological issue; this is about people being thrown out of \ntheir castles--their home--and thrown into the moat, and it is about \ncommunities that then begin to wither. It is about local governments \nthat begin to struggle. It is about crime rates that begin to go up. It \nis about dreams that are dashed and consumer confidence that goes down \nthe tubes at a time when we are fighting off a broad recession and \nunemployment.\n  So I just hope--I don't know where this will lead. We haven't had \nmuch success in the past couple of weeks getting anything done around \nhere. But I am hopeful that because all of us are hit by this that we \nwill set aside the politics in this political year, we will leave it at \nthe door, and for a few shining moments come together and get this \nthing going because I have read this bill. Would I have written it \nbetter? Yes. Would Senator Dodd have changed it? Yes. Would Senator \nMartinez? Absolutely. All of us would have done it our way. Senator \nSalazar would have done it his way.\n  We, Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby, have done some important things \nin this bill, and some things that are very straightforward. What \nimpresses me the most is that they did build on the success of a \nprogram that America used years ago and wound up not costing any money. \nWe actually make some money for the taxpayers. So this is a tried-and-\ntrue idea, and we need to try it again, just getting those counselors \nout there to sit down with the parties and find a person to talk to.\n  I was just saying while Senator Dodd was in the cloakroom that I had \nfive hearings myself around the State, and my staff did, and one of the \nbiggest problems was that some people couldn't find out who to talk to. \nSo when you have a counselor who has\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\nthat expertise, one out of two times, they told us, they solved the \nproblem. So thank you again. I will be supporting this bill.\n  I would just say to my colleagues who aren't here, but to any within \nthe sound of my voice, any amendments that will further this and make \nthis a better bill, great. But if they are nasty, ``let's try to score \npolitical points'' amendments, I hope we will all have the courage to \nsay no to those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks by our colleague from Florida, Senator \nMartinez, Senator Schumer be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her comments and concern. I wish to add my thanks on \nbehalf of my constituents in the State of Florida to Chairman Dodd and \nto Senator Shelby for being the architects of this very fine bill that \nattempts to put a floor on what is a downward spiral that we are seeing \nof home prices and ever-increasing foreclosures.\n  The National Association of Homebuilders tells us that every week \nanother 47,000 homeowners are going into foreclosure. That is a tragic \nfigure, as the Senator from California was saying. I can recall during \nthe past decade when each and every day we could see increasing numbers \nof Americans who were becoming homeowners, increasing percentages, \nparticularly among minority families--African American and Hispanic \nfamilies--who were tasting and grasping that dream of home ownership, \nand now we are seeing that dream erode and dissipate. If we can do \nsomething, if we can respond, then we must.\n  This bill attempts to do that in a very measured way--in an imperfect \nway, but in a way that I think moves us forward and allows the American \nhomeowner to begin to feel a sense that they are getting a floor under \nthem, and it allows the housing economy, which is so important to a \nState such as Florida--we begin to feel as if we are getting a little \nfooting going.\n  There are some tragic stories of how we got here. There are a number \nof things that have happened in the lending world that highlight the \nproblem. In one situation, a gentleman from Ruskin, FL, was approved \nfor a $280,000 home despite the fact that he was making $12.50 an hour \nwith a lumber company in Bradenton. Without his knowledge, the mortgage \noriginator listed his annual income at $60,000 a year in order for him \nto qualify for the loan. Five months later, after moving into his new \nhome, he defaulted on his subprime mortgage, depleted his savings, and \nnow has a black mark on his credit and no home. His story is just one \nof many.\n  These stories are all over the country. There may be some parts of \nAmerica that are untouched by this crisis, but I will tell my \ncolleagues that Florida has been hit, and Florida has been hit hard. \nThat is why I am so grateful this bill is finally on the Senate floor \nand that we are moving forward to act on it.\n  I agree with the Senator from California. We need to put partisanship \naside and ideology aside. This is about getting something good done for \nthe American people. If someone thinks they can make the bill better, \nthat is why we have an open amendment process with amendments that are \ngermane to housing, and that is how we should keep it. Let's hear your \nideas.\n  Knowingly filling in false information is a crime, and it brings to \nlight some of the flaws that we have had in our financial system, in \nour mortgage system. So this bill represents a good-faith, bipartisan \neffort to address this ongoing crisis.\n  There is help for America's struggling homeowners, there is reform of \nmajor Federal programs, and there are new ideas to help ensure that we \ndon't find ourselves in a similar situation somewhere in the future. So \nI wish to thank Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, as well as Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley for working together on a package that I hope will \nhave strong bipartisan support from the Members of the Senate.\n  One of the most important provisions to me in this package is \nregulatory reform of the government-sponsored enterprises. These are \nlittle-known entities--I came to know them in depth while I was at \nHUD--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. They \nplay an immense and critical role in our Nation's housing finance \nindustry. They have to be strengthened. They have to be safeguarded. \nThey are a treasure.\n  One of the questions that I always would be asked when visiting with \nforeign dignitaries as HUD Secretary was, How do you set up the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises? How can we replicate them in our \ncountry? So they are a national treasure, but all is not well.\n  It is important to note that when they have reached the point where \nthey are financing more than 80 percent of all mortgages in the United \nStates, which is up from 40 percent a year ago, and when we see that \nfrom time to time there has been some trouble in these entities, it is \ntime for us to have a stronger and more forceful regulator.\n  GSEs have been a key to the stability and the liquidity of the \nmortgage market, but they are stretched. Both Fannie and Freddie \ncontinue to have financial and operational issues that heighten the \nneed for strengthened oversight. As GSEs take on more risk, as Congress \nhas allowed them to do, we have an obligation--and by the way, I \nbelieve it was appropriate to do that, but now we have an obligation \nsince we did that to ensure they continue to fulfill their public \nmission in a safe and sound manner. GSEs have an obligation of more \nthan $6 trillion in debt and securities. If their risks are not managed \nproperly, or if market movements turn dramatically against them, the \nFederal Government could face a very serious situation. So we owe it to \nthe American taxpayer--our constituents--who would be on the line in \nthe event of a failure, to enact meaningful, comprehensive reform \nlegislation.\n  A strengthened regulator is in everyone's best interests: The \nadministration, the Congress, Wall Street, investors worldwide, and, \nmost importantly, the American home buyer. I believe by strengthening \nthis regulator that we will create a greater level of confidence in \ninvestors at a time when more capital and more liquidity is needed in \nthese troubled financial times.\n  The importance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the housing financial \nsystem is simply undeniable. Real reform is necessary to ensure that \nthe public understands these two companies can continue to make low-\ncost mortgage financing available to low- and moderate-income families. \nBut we also have to do more than help temper the current situation. We \nhave to ensure we don't find ourselves back here facing the same issues \nagain in the future that we are facing today.\n  That is why Senator Dodd and Senator Feinstein and I have worked hard \non an amendment which was accepted in committee--the Safe Mortgage \nLicensing Act--that addresses the loose patchwork of State regulation \nof residential mortgage loan originators. Our amendment is included in \nthe provisions of title V, which is included in this package. It would \nhelp eliminate bad actors from the mortgage business.\n  I should say most mortgage brokers are decent, honorable people \ntrying to do a good job each and every day, but there have been some \nbad players and bad actors in this arena. The act would create a \nnational registry database and require brokers and lenders to meet \nminimum national standards which ensure that they are professional, \ncompetent, and trustworthy. Strong licensing standards for mortgage \nbrokers and lenders are an important part of protecting consumers and \nrestoring confidence in the marketplace.\n  There is another important component of this package, and that is the \nreform of the Federal Housing Administration, or the FHA. Congress \ncreated FHA in 1934 to help spur the housing market and increase home \nownership. It was in another time when we were in a troubled financial \nsituation.\n  It was after the Great Depression. It was one of the vehicles that \nmoved America, particularly after the Second World War, into an \nownership society. Instead of governmental loans or subsidies, \nborrowers purchased FHA mortgage insurance. Since the insurance \nmitigates a lender's risk, a lender can offer competitive mortgage \nterms to\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nborrowers who may have thin or imperfect credit, or little cash on \nhand.\n  Over the past 72 years, FHA has been a mortgage industry leader, \nhelping over 34 million Americans become homeowners at no cost to the \ntaxpayers.\n  I should add, in my own family, as an immigrant family, when my \nparents had only been here a little over 2 years, we grasped the \nAmerican dream and owned our first home in America. It was insured and \nfinanced with an FHA-insured loan. I had no idea what it was at that \ntime. All I knew was that it was an FHA loan that allowed us, with a \nvery small downpayment, to get a 30-year fixed mortgage so we could \nbegin to live the American dream. That is the historic role FHA has \nplayed throughout our Nation's history since 1934. It can play that \nrole again today.\n  Prior to the FHA program, home buyers were required to have \ndownpayments of as much as 50 percent of the purchase price. That is \nstill true in many parts of the world today. In those places where \nownership is still a distant dream, that is what it takes.\n  Financing consisted of 5-year interest-only mortgages. FHA made the \nlow downpayment, 30-year fixed rate, self-amortizing loan the standard \nproduct in the United States. Unfortunately, in recent years, while the \nmortgage industry adapted to changes in the marketplace, FHA stayed the \nsame, leaving a large number of home buyers with no option but higher \ncost, higher risk mortgages.\n  I remember when I was at HUD, each and every statistic we would get \nwould show an ever-dwindling market share for FHA of all the mortgages \nbeing originated. For many minority and low-income first-time home \nbuyers, the private market provided access to mortgage financing, but \ntoo often at excessive costs. We know today that the dream of home \nownership has turned into a nightmare for too many Americans.\n  I have no doubt that many of the individuals in financial trouble \ntoday could have received lower cost loans with the help of the FHA, \nespecially if the program had the flexibility to change with the \nmarketplace.\n  The FHA reform provision included in this package will make much \nneeded programmatic improvements, allow FHA to insure larger loans, and \ngive FHA more pricing flexibility. These reforms will empower FHA to \nreach more families needing help--first-time home buyers, minorities, \nand those with low and moderate income.\n  With this legislation, we have built an even better program that \ncomplements conventional mortgage products and allows FHA to continue \nto serve hard-working, creditworthy Americans. This housing bill will \ngo a long way in helping those suffering in the short term, and ensure \nour housing economy regains its strength in the long term.\n  Some of the detractors have said this FHA program will be some sort \nof a bailout to one mortgage company or another. The fact is this is a \nprogram here to help individuals. We should not get distracted with \nside issues. The fact is this program is inclined to help those \nfamilies while, at the same time, working with the financial \ninstitutions. What we have today is--if we could create a situation \nwhere the home buyer could refinance, and where the bank doesn't have \nto go through with foreclosure--the bank doesn't want a house, they \nwant a payment. They don't want to foreclose on the homeowner. If we \ncould do all of this by using FHA, wouldn't that be a good thing? And \nthen the bonus or the dessert on top of that good deal is the fact that \nwe can now do this by utilizing the resources of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac as a backup, creating this fund that will be there to help home \nbuyers in the future. Today, in this moment, it is going to be there to \nsafeguard and backstop the FHA program, to ensure that the taxpayers \nare not on the hook, but that homeowners are given a second chance to \nhave a mortgage they can now afford, with the financial institutions \ntaking a haircut. They will be taking a loss. This is no bailout. They \nwill take a loss. Then the home buyer will have a mortgage that is more \nin keeping with today's market prices. This is a win-win situation that \nI am delighted we have been able to see come through in this housing \nbill.\n  I conclude by extending my thanks to Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member \nShelby. I particularly thank the chairman for his courtesies throughout \nthe process in that I have been given an opportunity to make an impact \non a couple of issues relating to mortgage brokers, and so forth. I \nlook forward to being of help in any way I can in the process of making \nthis bill become a reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I return that compliment. To have a former \nSecretary of HUD as a member of the Banking Committee is a pretty good \nasset. When we talk about these issues, to have someone who ran that \nagency and knows these programs as intimately as Senator Mel Martinez \nhas been a great asset for the committee in developing this product. I \nwill say this publicly. I am deeply grateful to him. Senator Shelby is, \nas well, as are all of the members of the committee.\n  We have had an active and involved committee. The 21 members of the \ncommittee have been deeply engaged in this debate over the last year \nand a half, or more, as we have had some 50 hearings--most of which \nhave been related to the subject matter--to gather the best information \nand advice we could get in developing the product we have here. The \nSenator from Florida has been a key element in doing that.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I have heard in \nrecent days that this bill hasn't been seen, read, and that somehow \nthere is mystery surrounding this bill. It has been through the \ncommittee process. There have been a number of hearings, as the \nchairman has discussed, on each of the components of this bill. We have \nhad great testimony from all of the financial minds in this country. It \nis a bill that passed committee with a bipartisan vote of 19 to 2. \nThere is no real mystery here. I realize minor changes have been made \nin the last couple of days. This is an open process. I hope we are not \nsidetracked with side issues having nothing to do with what is at \nstake--America's families who are hurting.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Senator Schumer was, by consent, supposed to \nfollow Senator Martinez, but the Senator had to attend another meeting. \nLet me ask my colleague, how long is my colleague from New Hampshire \ngoing to be?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Four minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4999 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that my \namendment No. 4999 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment deals with affordable \nhousing. This is a very large and complex piece of legislation. I know \nthe members of the Banking Committee and the chairman and ranking \nmember worked hard on this legislation. It deals with a number of \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that the Senator from Florida spoke \nabout--the housing trust fund, tax credits to try to deal with housing \ninventories, and the affordability of housing.\n  I offer this amendment that addresses affordable housing in a \nslightly different venue, and that is the affordable housing supported \nand provided by housing authorities all over America.\n  My amendment reaches out to those housing authorities to help them do \ntheir job better, by reducing the amount of paperwork they have to deal \nwith in doing their job of providing affordable and safe housing to \npeople across America. We look especially at the smallest of the \nhousing authorities, the ones that don't have enormous staff, or \nsupport groups, or an employment base to help deal with all of the \nFederal regulations we put on them.\n  This amendment says to the smallest housing authorities in the \ncountry, those with 750 or fewer housing units or vouchers that they \nmanage, if you do a good job and are among the highest performers, not \ntroubled, get the job done, perform well, and pass all of the HUD \naudits, you won't have to be required to submit a formal plan every \nsingle year. You still have to provide a 5-year plan, and you still \nhave to meet all of the civil rights laws in compliance under HUD. But \nwe take away that administrative burden of having to put together a \nplan every single year. That makes a difference and enables them to \nfocus on their mission, reduce costs and their overhead, but at the \nsame time leaves in place the core requirements that they continue to \nfulfill that mission effectively and comply with all of the \nrequirements of HUD.\n  This is something that is strongly supported by the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. I worked closely \nwith them in crafting this language, and I worked closely with the \nstaff on the Banking Committee in crafting this language. They provided \na good number of recommendations and suggestions.\n  Unfortunately, we have not had many vehicles dealing with housing to \ncome before the Senate. That is why I think it is especially \nappropriate that we try to address this and take care of it now, before \nthe Senate is consumed by other issues in the months ahead. We have a \ngreat opportunity to take a common sense step that is supported by \nhousing authorities across the country.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, yesterday I was here on the floor and I \nshared with my colleagues news about work that Senator Voinovich and I \nand others have done to reduce the diesel emissions that come from the \napproximately 11 million diesel engines across the country, causing \ntens of thousands of premature deaths from asthma and cancer and other \ndiseases because of those emissions. I talked about how a number of us \nworking together, Democrats and Republicans, in the Senate and in the \nHouse, cobbled together legislation that would have a positive affect \nin reducing the health threats from these emissions.\n  Today we bring up for consideration another piece of legislation. It \nis not designed to save lives, but it is designed to make the quality \nof life better for people in this country, to make sure people who \nmight otherwise not have a decent place to live, might lose their home \nin which they now live, or they might have a chance to retain that \nhome, or maybe to obtain a home they never otherwise would have had.\n  One of the things I like especially about this legislation is it was \ndeveloped in the same bipartisan way that Senator Voinovich and I \nworked on the Diesel Emission Reductions Act. We have legislation here \nthat the chairman of the committee, Senator Shelby, their staffs, and \nour staffs have worked on for months to bring to fruition. Also, it \ninvolves the great and important input of the administration, the \nFederal Reserve, and other bank regulators.\n  If you go back about 2 months ago, in April of this year, the Senate \npassed what we call the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. At the \ntime, I spoke on the floor about how that legislation was, as I \ndescribed it, the third act of a four-act play that would hopefully \nbegin to bring economic recovery following this mortgage meltdown.\n  From time to time in this country, our economy goes through a bubble \nof one sort or the other. Before another one happens, we have to go \nmaybe 10 years. We experienced the telecom bubble during which the \nmarket soared, and not for any good reason--maybe irrational \nexuberance. Eventually, the values plummeted down to something more \nreasonable. We went through the housing bubble, where the housing has \ngone up, and it is hard to explain it as anything but irrational \nexuberance. That bubble has now collapsed, and we are looking for the \nbottom and for the market to stabilize property values. We are trying \nto make sure we get to the bottom quickly, that we maintain the banking \nsystem, that we help neighborhoods where there are foreclosed homes, \nwhich creates a blight in the community, and to try to ensure that \npeople in an upside-down mortgage situation, where the cost of the \nmortgage is higher than the value of the home, don't walk away from \ntheir homes and create a further blight in their communities.\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\n  I have a couple of charts I want to show, you if I may. This refers \nto the four-act play. Act I stars the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke and \nthe folks he works with. Act II, the stimulus package we took up and \ndebated here earlier this year; act III, the Foreclosure Prevention Act \nthat we passed about 2 months ago here in the Senate by a very wide \nmargin; and act IV is legislation that has been reported out of the \nBanking Committee, I want to say by about an 18-to-2 vote a month or so \nago, under the leadership of Senators Dodd and Shelby. Among other \nthings, that provides for a strong, independent regulator for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, which are heavily involved in making it possible \nfor people to become homeowners, and also addresses the issue we are \nhaving now where the mortgage of a home is greater than the value of \nthe home for which the mortgage is held. So that is the four-act play, \nand I want to maybe talk about each of those and a couple of them in \nmore detail.\n\n  I have been around for a while. In talking about act I, I have never \nseen the Federal Reserve do the kinds of extraordinary things they have \ndone this year to help us avoid a recession, or if we are to have one, \nto make sure it is shallow: dramatic moves in reducing the Fed's fund \nrate; encouraging or taking away the stigma for financial institutions, \ncommercial banks, as well as noncommercial banks, investment banks, to \nuse the discount window; serving as the marriage maker, if you will, \nbetween JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns as it was about to go down to \nensure it didn't fail--just a whole series of extraordinary things--\nswapping out mortgage-backed securities that banks are holding that are \nhighly illiquid and exchanging in place highly liquid U.S. Treasuries. \nThose are all things the Fed has done. We have seen them do one or two \nof those during the course of an economic cycle, but to see all four or \nfive steps within a span of a couple of months is extraordinary, and I \ngive them high marks for what they have done in act I.\n  Act II was the action taken by the Congress to pass the economic \nstimulus package earlier this year. While the economic stimulus package \nwas not perfect, probably not the one the Presiding Officer or I would \nhave designed, it was, to its credit, targeted, it was timely, and it \nis temporary. Right now, it is helping to bolster our economy, and we \nexpect it to add maybe 1 to 1\\1/2\\ percentage points to our gross \ndomestic product.\n  Act III was the Foreclosure Prevention Act that we passed back in \nApril by an overwhelming majority. I think it passed something like 84 \nto 12. That bill included a number of important provisions, including \nmaking sure more counselors are available to help folks who are sliding \ninto a tough spot, maybe thinking about walking away from their homes, \ngoing into foreclosure and losing their homes. We said: We are going to \nmake sure, by allocating $100 million, there are enough trained \ncounselors out there to truly respond to people who need help. So that \nwas part of that legislation. In that legislation, we also helped local \ncommunities deal with properties that were foreclosed on or abandoned.\n  We took the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, which has been \naround for 75 years, and we made it relevant, if you will, for the 21st \ncentury. If you go back 5 or 6 years, something like 15 to 20 percent \nof mortgages in this country were FHA guaranteed. FHA was created to \nhelp first-time home buyers become homeowners and to help folks who had \nmarginal credit strength become homeowners as well. In the last year or \nso, we didn't have 15 or 20 percent of the mortgages being FHA \nguaranteed or insured mortgages but maybe 5 percent. What has happened \nin recent years is people who would maybe at one time have used FHA to \nbecome a homeowner instead ended up relying on these exotic adjustable \nrate mortgages--maybe no downpayment, low interest, or teaser rates to \nbegin with and which balloon up to much higher rates which are hard to \nget out of, and they then get stuck there and it is difficult to \nrefinance out of. We want to make sure people don't buy their homes \nwith those kinds of financing vehicles and they go back to the plain-\nvanilla or FHA insured mortgages, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in many \ninstances. The legislation we passed 2 months ago does just that for \nthe FHA.\n  Act IV is our effort that is currently underway here today to \npermanently overhaul the regulation of our government-sponsored \nenterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are heavily involved--\nand I will explain in a minute just how they are heavily involved--in \nmaking it possible for people to own their homes. At the same time, we \nwant to help homeowners be able to refinance into affordable FHA \nmortgages as they are running into difficulties in their own lives.\n  I think the bill that is before us today, the Housing Economic \nRecovery Act, truly is a comprehensive effort to address our Nation's \nhousing problems.\n  For many years, unscrupulous lenders paid no attention--I shouldn't \nsay for many years--in recent years, unscrupulous lenders have paid \nlittle or no attention to a potential homeowner's credit history for \nmaking their mortgage loans. Home buyers--both knowingly and \nunknowingly--were given mortgages they could never realistically expect \nto repay. One might ask why. The answer in part lies in the fact that \nthe financial sector has become increasingly complicated. Today, a \nmortgage is made, really, in the blink of an eye. The mortgage is \nbundled with others and sliced into tiny pieces known as ``tranches.'' \nWall Street readily buys these mortgages, bundles them together as \nmortgage-backed securities, and sells them to investors around the \nworld. As long as home prices continued to rise, there was very little \nrisk to the lender, and for years home prices have continued to rise--\nuntil now.\n  In the past, homeowners could always refinance their home and sell it \nfor a profit and pay off their debt. When home prices began to lag, \nthough, a vicious cycle began to emerge, and many of these so-called \nsubprime customers have defaulted on their loans, and homes prices, as \nwe know, have fallen drastically over the last year in many places \naround the country, eliminating the option to sell for a profit. As a \nresult, the financial institutions and investors are losing billions of \ndollars and the private secondary mortgage market is in shambles.\n  Communities are also hurt by home foreclosures. Houses that have been \nabandoned attract crime and further drive down the home values in their \nneighborhoods. Homeowners trying to refinance are now finding \nthemselves in an upside-down situation where they owe more than their \nhouse is worth. Foreclosure is now more than possible, it is probable \nfor a lot of those homeowners. We have seen hundreds of thousands of \npeople in this country in recent months literally just walk away from \ntheir homes. In fact, there is a company called Just Walk Away, \ndesigned to actually help people walk away from their home and leave it \nin foreclosure.\n  In February of this year, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing \non the state of our Nation's economy, and there were a number of \nwitnesses there--Secretary Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, \nand Securities and Exchange Commissioner Cox. All gave testimony on the \nproblems facing our economy because of this housing crisis.\n  At that hearing, I asked Treasury Secretary Paulson to list the \nadministration's top legislative priorities for dealing with the \nhousing crisis, and the Secretary's response was unequivocal. He was \nvery clear and very direct in his response, and this chart really \nsummarizes it.\n  He said, first of all, the administration wants housing authorities \naround the country to be able to issue tax- exempt revenue bonds, not \njust for first-time home buyers or for multifamily housing but to issue \ntax-exempt revenue bonds to raise money to help people in desperate \nsituations refinance out of a subprime mortgage and get into something \nthat is better suited for them.\n  The second thing he said is: We want FHA to be modernized and \nstreamlined and brought into the 21st century so it is relevant again \nand can help people with questionable credit or maybe people who are \nfist-time home buyers.\n  The last thing he said is: We need to overhaul the way we regulate \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with a strong, independent regulator, much \nas our banks have strong, independent regulators. We need that kind of \nregulator\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and for the Federal Home Loan Banks.\n  The next thing I wish to do, if I can, is to look at this chart.\n  One of the other elements of the legislation we passed back on April \n10, which was bundled together with the legislation I just described \nfrom the last chart, was to move FHA into the 21st century and provide \n$150 million for mortgage counseling.\n  We have probably seen on television commercials that say: Having \ntrouble on your home, facing foreclosure, whatever, or facing \nbankruptcy? Call this number. You always wonder: Is that the number of \na scoundrel, somebody unscrupulous, or somebody who will really help \nthe person who is in distress? We are providing through this \nlegislation about $150 million for someone to actually be there to help \nwhen the phone rings. At the other end of the line will be someone who \nis a trained housing counselor who can answer questions and help a \nperson avoid foreclosure and possibly losing their home.\n  Finally, we provide in this legislation something like $4 billion for \nCDBG, community development block grants, so that State and local \ngovernments, city governments, can help take properties in foreclosure \nthat are really decaying in a neighborhood and damaging the value of \nthe whole community--we want counties and cities to actually buy those \nproperties, fix them up, and get them sold and back into the \nmarketplace so they can get a homeowner in that home.\n  The last thing I wish to mention is that this housing package we are \npassing goes even further and creates a new voluntary program within \nFHA to help those folks who are in an upside-down mortgage situation \nwhere they owe more than the house is worth. What our legislation calls \nfor is something we call HOPE for Homeowners, where a number of people \nare asked to take a financial haircut--not a real haircut but a \nfinancial haircut--where homeowners are willing to take a little \nfinancial haircut and the lenders and investors as well voluntarily \ntake a financial haircut. In return, the homeowner agrees to stay in \nthe home and then share the appreciation in value, when the value of \nthe home rebounds, with the FHA.\n  This program is not intended to bail out investors or borrowers. Let \nme be clear: The Federal Government should not be in the business of \nrewarding bad behavior. We don't want to do that, and this legislation \ndoes not do that. The goal of this program, the HOPE for Homeowners \nProgram, is to help families who can stay in their homes to stay in \ntheir homes rather than give up and walk away. We are not going to get \nrich doing this, but hopefully they will still have a roof over their \nheads and a little bit of equity in the home they have purchased.\n  The last thing I want to mention is in terms of regulation of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. They are involved \nin raising trillions of dollars to finance home mortgages--trillions of \ndollars. We have strong, independent regulators of financial \ninstitutions, thrifts, credit unions, and large bank holding companies, \nand for the most part they are not nearly as large as Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't have a strong and \nindependent regulator. They need one, and with this legislation, they \nare going to get one. The new regulator will have the power to \nestablish capital standards to manage the portfolio of these entities--\nthese behemoths--to review and approve, subject to notice and comment, \nnew product offerings.\n  For the last few years, I have worked tirelessly with many of my \ncolleagues, including Chuck Schumer--who is sitting right behind me--\nSenator Mel Martinez, and others, to establish a new world-class \nregulator for the housing GSEs. We have come close a couple of times, \nbut each time we had to let a few differences stand in the way of our \nprogress. Today, we actually made progress and put in place a strong, \nindependent regulator as we face an uncertain future.\n  The last thing I wish to mention--and I know I said that once before, \nbut the last thing I especially like about what we do, in addition to \nproviding a strong, independent regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, is we require them to establish and to begin contributing into an \naffordable housing fund.\n  Some of you know that we have these 12 Federal Home Loan Banks around \nthe country. They raise money that can be used by banks in housing and \nbusiness to help finance housing construction and purchases. Every one \nof the Federal Home Loan Banks has a requirement under the law to \ncommit to donate 10 percent of their net income into an affordable \nhousing fund. That filters back into the community, and it leverages a \nlot more money to help first-time home buyers and multifamily housing. \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't have that requirement to contribute to \na housing fund. With this legislation we are passing this week, Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac will have that requirement. The amount of money \nthat it will generate in a year, probably a couple years down the road, \na half billion dollars a year--twice as much as is generated by the \naffordable housing fund by the Federal Home Loan Banks. That will be a \nwonderful tool for us to use in our communities.\n  I think that is pretty much what I wanted to say. I know my friend \nSenator Schumer is behind me and anxious to say his piece too. So I \nwill just close by saying that with respect to the cost of the bill, I \nam concerned about paying for things, making sure if something is worth \ndoing, we pay for it. The tax provisions in this bill are not \ncompletely offset. Mostly they are, but they are not completely offset. \nI think there is a shortfall of about $2 billion. We are supposed to be \nliving under the pay-go rules we adopted and put in place in the Senate \nlast year--emphasis on ``supposed to.'' In a tax package such as this \none, where the intent was to pay for the new home-buyer credits and \nother matters, we should have stuck to our principles and found the \nnecessary offsets to pay for these tax breaks or simply scaled them \nback. Unfortunately, we fell short in that regard. Certainly I don't \nblame the chairman, who knows what we ought to do and need to do, as do \nI. That is simply not the jurisdiction of our committee. In the whole \npackage, I suppose that is the one disappointment I have, and my hope \nis we will come back and fix that later.\n  Overall, though, this is great legislation. This is great \nlegislation. This will mean real progress in a responsible way, and our \nchairman deserves great credit, as does Senator Shelby and our staffs.\n  I say to my friend Senator Dodd that I spoke to the majority staff, \nthe Democratic staff, yesterday in the cloakroom. I sit on the Commerce \nCommittee, among other committees, and we have great staff there, \nespecially at the committee level, and I want to say that this year our \nmajority staff and I think our minority staff have really showed what \nthey are made of, and we will all benefit from that as a nation. So my \nhat is off to you, our leader, and to our the staffs.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, in April, the United States Senate \npassed the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. At that time, I spoke \nright here on the Senate floor about how that legislation was the third \nact in a four-act play that will begin to bring economic recovery \nfollowing the mortgage meltdown.\n  Act I was the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to keep interest \nrates low and provide liquidity to the markets.\n  Act II was the action taken by Congress earlier this year to pass the \neconomic stimulus package. While our economic stimulus package was not \nperfect, it was targeted, timely and temporary, and right now is \nhelping to bolster our economy.\n  Act III was the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 that just passed \nin April by an overwhelming majority of 84 to 12. This bill included \nimportant provisions to provide counseling to Americans facing \nforeclosure; to help local communities deal with properties in their \nneighborhoods that are abandoned or foreclosed; and to reform the \nFederal Housing Administration so that more Americans have access to \naffordable, safe, government-backed loans.\n  Act IV is our effort currently underway here to permanently reform \nthe regulator of the government sponsored enterprises--Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac--and to create a program that will help homeowners \nrefinance into a safe, affordable FHA mortgage.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n  The bill that is before us today, the Housing and Economic Recovery \nAct, is truly a comprehensive effort to address our nation's housing \nproblems.\n  For many years, unscrupulous lenders paid no attention to a potential \nhomeowner's credit history when making their mortgage loans. \nHomebuyers--both knowingly and unknowingly--were given mortgages they \ncould never repay.\n  Why?\n  The answer, in part, lies in the fact that the financial sector has \nbecome increasingly complicated. Today, a mortgage loan is made in the \nblink of an eye. The mortgage is bundled up with others and sliced up \ninto tiny pieces--known as tranches. Wall Street readily buys these \nmortgages, bundles them together as mortgage backed securities and \nsells them to investors around the world.\n  As home prices continued to rise, there was very little risk to the \nlender. The homeowner could always refinance their home or sell for a \nprofit, paying off the debt.\n  When home prices began to lag, however, a vicious cycle began to \nemerge. Most of these so-called subprime customers have defaulted on \ntheir loans and home prices have fallen drastically over the past year, \neliminating the option to sell for profit. As a result, financial \ninstitutions and investors are losing billions of dollars and the \nprivate, secondary mortgage market is in shambles.\n  Communities are also hurt by home foreclosures. Houses that have been \nabandoned attract crime and further drive down the home values in the \nneighborhood. Homeowners trying to refinance now find themselves \n``upside down''--owing more than the home is worth. Foreclosure is now \nmore than possible, it is probable for many homeowners.\n  In fact, there are companies that now specialize in teaching \nhomeowners how to just walk away from their home.\n  In February of this year, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing \non the state of the Nation's economy. Treasury Secretary Paulson, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Securities and \nExchange Commissioner Cox gave testimony on the problems facing our \neconomy because of the housing crisis.\n\n  At that hearing, I asked Secretary Paulson to list the \nadministration's top legislative priorities for dealing with this \nhousing crisis. The Secretary's response was unequivocal:\n  Congress must allow communities to issue more mortgage revenue bonds, \nmodernize the Federal Housing Administration and give the government \nsponsored enterprises a new regulator.\n  I am pleased that this bill before us today addresses each and every \none of the administration's priorities.\n  First of all, we would allow the issuance of an additional $10 \nbillion in mortgage revenue bonds to be used not only for first-time \nhomebuyers and low-income housing, but also to help homeowners \nrefinance out of a subprime mortgage.\n  This bill also contains the FHA modernization provision, passed in \nthe Foreclosure Prevention Act, earlier this year.\n  This bill brings the FHA into the 21st century by expanding the \nmaximum FHA loan limit from $360,000 to as much as $625,000 in high-\ncost areas. This bill also streamlines and automates the process to \napply for an FHA loan, making it easier for American families to have \naccess to safe government guaranteed loans.\n  Along with these steps, the bill includes $150 million for housing \ncounselors across the country, and almost $4 billion in community \ndevelopment block grants to go to communities hardest hit by the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act goes even further to create a \nnew voluntary program within FHA to help homeowners in ``upside down'' \nmortgages to refinance into a safe, affordable FHA mortgage.\n  Under the new Hope for Homeowners program, lenders agree to take a \nloss and allow a homeowner to refinance into a new loan. In return, the \nhomeowner agrees to share any future appreciation with the FHA.\n  This program is not intended to help bail out investors or borrowers. \nLet me be clear: The Federal Government should not be in the business \nof rewarding bad behavior.\n  The goal of this program is to help families who can stay in their \nhomes, remain in their homes rather than give up and walk away.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act also provides assistance to the \nsecondary mortgage market by reforming the regulator for the government \nsponsored enterprises--often called GSEs--which are made up of Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks.\n  Today, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are regulated for safety and \nsoundness by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development is the mission regulator.\n  Since its creation, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight has lacked the same regulatory powers and authorities of the \nother banking regulators. This bill provides the new regulator with all \nof the tools needed to ensure that the enterprises and the Federal Home \nLoan Banks operate in a safe and sound manner that is consistent with \ntheir statutory mission.\n\n  The new regulator will have the power to: establish capital \nstandards; manage the portfolio; review and approve--subject to notice \nand comment--new product offerings.\n  For the last few years, I have worked tirelessly to establish a new \nworld class regulator for the housing GSEs. We have come close several \ntimes, but each time we would let a few differences stand in the way of \nprogress.\n  In addition to creating a new world class regulator, this bill also \ncreates an affordable housing trust fund. This fund will generate \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year to be used to create safe and \naffordable housing for those most in need.\n  The Federal Home Loan Banks already set aside 10 percent of their \nprofits to go to affordable housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will \nnow also contribute a small amount of each new business deal to create \nthis new trust fund.\n  Both Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have done a very good job \nreaching a compromise on this bill. I know it is not easy. And like \nmost compromises, this one is not exactly perfect.\n  If I could, I would just like to take a minute or two to express some \nconcerns I have about the final product. First is an issue many of us \nhave raised, and that applies to the enactment date in the bill for the \nnew GSE regulator. Under this legislation, the director of the Office \nof Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight would have all the supervisory \npowers immediately after the bill is signed into law.\n  Under the GSE bill the House passed, we would allow 6 months before \nthe new regulatory agency is created. To me, a 6-month cooling off \nperiod, in order to give the new agency time to transition, makes \nsense.\n  Also, it can be argued that there is a bias against the GSEs holding \nmortgages on their portfolio. While we want to make sure that the GSEs \nare not taking on undue risk, we should also be mindful that current \nmarket conditions require the GSEs to take a more active role in \nensuring liquidity in the market. Today, they can only do that by \npurchasing mortgages and holding them in their portfolios.\n  Another concern that I have is the cost of this bill. The tax \nprovisions in this bill are not completely offset and there is a \nshortfall of approximately $2.4 billion. We are supposed to be living \nunder pay-go principles in the Senate. Emphasis on ``supposed to be.'' \nOn a tax package such as this one, where the intent was there to pay \nfor the new homebuyer credit and other matters, we should have stuck to \nour principles and found the necessary offsets to pay for these tax \nbreaks or simply scale them back. Unfortunately, we fell short.\n  Having said all that, I believe that, overall, this legislation will \nhelp to bring stability to our economy and make the changes to our \nregulatory structure to ensure a healthy housing sector for the future. \nI have worked hard for years on elements in this final housing \nlegislation and I am hopeful they will become law soon.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he leaves the floor--I will \nrecognize Senator Kohl and Senator Schumer. Senator Schumer is on the \nfloor. We heard from Senator Martinez and others.\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n  This doesn't happen miraculously. Senator Carper has been deeply \ninvolved and committed to these issues for a long time. There was a \nwhile when I couldn't see him without ``GSE'' being the first thing out \nof his mouth.\n  I thank him for his persistence over the months when we developed \nthis final product, and I thank him immensely for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4988 to Amendment No. 4983\n\n (Purpose: To protect the property and security of homeowners who are \n                  subject to foreclosure proceedings)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside and call up amendment No. 4988.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] for himself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4988 to amendment No. 4983.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today I rise to briefly discuss my \namendment No. 4988, which is cosponsored by Senators Collins, Lincoln \nand Mikulski.\n  In February, I held a revealing hearing in the Aging Committee that \nuncovered the ways scam artists prey on homeowners in financial and \nemotional distress. These scams are a consequence of the mortgage \ncrisis that is plaguing our country--and my amendment attacks this \ngrowing problem.\n  For most people, their home is their greatest asset. When a homeowner \nfalls behind in their mortgage payments, it is a great emotional \nstrain. Scam artists prey on an owner's desperation and give them a \nfalse sense of security, claiming they can help ``save their home.'' \nThe types of scams vary, but the end result is that the homeowner is \nleft in a more desperate situation than before.\n  There are three types of prevalent scams. The first is ``phantom \nhelp,'' where the ``rescuer'' claims that they will call the \nhomeowner's lender and renegotiate the loan for a fee. Often the \nhomeowner will pay the fee--but the ``rescuer'' will abandon the \nhomeowner without any intervention. The second is a ``rent-to-own'' \nscheme which is set up to fail. A homeowner will sign over the title of \nthe house and make monthly payments to the scammer in order to help \nrebuild their credit. However, the monthly payments are extremely high \nand often result in the homeowner violating the contract and being \nevicted. Finally, a homeowner may be tricked into unknowingly signing \nover the title of their house and power of attorney to the scammer and \nthe scammer will then sell the house to a third party. The scam artist \nmight give the homeowner a small amount of money, but often only a \nfraction of the actual selling price.\n  As you can see, these scams are well crafted and extremely \ncomplicated. Catie Doyle, the chief attorney for Legal Aid Society of \nMilwaukee, testified before the Special Committee on Aging, describing \nthe difficulties and problems lawyers are facing when trying to help \nvictims of these scams. One major problem she pointed out was that \nlawyers have to piece together both State and Federal laws to untangle \nthese scams.\n  The amendment I am offering will remedy Ms. Doyle's concerns. While \nthere are some States that have foreclosure rescue scam laws or are in \nthe process of enacting them, many homeowners still go unprotected from \nthese predators. This legislation will require that all contracts \nbetween a foreclosure consultant and a homeowner be in writing and \nfully disclose the nature of the services and the exact cost. \nAdditionally, the bill prohibits upfront fees from being collected and \nprohibits a ``consultant'' from obtaining the power of attorney from a \nhomeowner.\n  I have a letter of support from a variety of consumer groups \nincluding the Center of Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, the National Fair \nHousing Council, National Consumer Law Center and the National Council \nof La Raza.\n  The foreclosure crisis is devastating homeowners and communities \nacross the country. Most communities across the country are \nexperiencing both the primary and secondary effects. It is important \nthat we address fraud at the front end of the lending process, as well \nas for those who face foreclosure. I hope that we can work together to \nmove this amendment forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in support of this much-needed \nlegislation. I find it difficult to believe that with our economic \ncrisis, the President issued a veto threat today. I would like to \nexplain why the bill is good, why it is needed; there are some changes \nI would like to see made; and then talk a little bit about the \nPresident's veto threat.\n  First, I commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for working so long \nand hard on this bill. This is not an easy bill, particularly when you \nhave so many different concerns and considerations. I know how hard the \nchairman worked on this bill. I know how hard Senator Shelby did. They \nwere wide apart in what they believed in. They came together in the \nmiddle with a compromise that is a very good step forward.\n  There are parts of this bill that are extremely important. The \nforeclosure counseling--this is something I have been championing for a \nlong time. We need counselors. For about half of those who are about to \ngo into foreclosure, or will be delayed in their payments, a mortgage \ncounselor could be the difference between them saving their home and \nlosing it; between the neighborhood going down the drain or staying \ndecent; even between our economy going into a deep recession or on the \nedges of one--the way it is now.\n  We need these counselors. They are not expensive. They do a world of \ngood. They take the place of the banker who used to be on the scene \nwhen banks held mortgages. The CDBG money is extremely important. We \nhave communities in Queens and Long Island and particularly in upstate, \nplaces such as Buffalo and Rochester and Syracuse, where neighborhoods \nhave a tough go. You get a few foreclosed homes that are abandoned and \nthen vandals come in and rip out the plumbing and the electric parts. \nThen drug dealers come in and make these a haven for crime. One \nforeclosed home can have the whole neighborhood go down the drain.\n  In the suburbs, a foreclosed home may not have those consequences, \nbut it certainly can mean a difference in the values of the home on the \nsurrounding block or the surrounding area going up or going down. For \nso many Americans, their home is their little piece of the rock; it is \nall they have. They put all their sweat equity in it. For no fault of \ntheir own, because somebody else lost their home on their street or in \ntheir neighborhood, they should not have to lose value. CDBG will help \ndeal with that.\n  We also have in this bill mortgage revenue bonds. I am very proud of \nthe way these have been crafted. It is $11 billion to refinance \nsubprime loans for struggling borrowers. There is a recycling \nprovision. It is very important to my State, where we use our mortgage \nrevenue bonds very quickly because there is so much need.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Act--again, it is not going to save \neverybody. But for the people who are underwater but not so deeply \nunderwater, this is a lifesaver. It basically says to them: You can \nrefinance your mortgage at a lower rate. It says to the mortgagor, you \nare going to get repaid, not everything but at least most of what you \nput in. It is not a panacea. In my point of view, it would be a lot \nbetter to have the bankruptcy provision here as a club to get the \nlenders into these, to use these provisions. But it sure does a lot \nmore good than not doing anything at all.\n  Of course, there is FHA modernization, which we have been seeking for \na long time--GSE modernization and reform which creates, for the first \ntime, a world-class regulator. We are going to need Fannie and Freddie \nin future years. We have to have them both be safe and sound and \nflexible. They\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nshould not be just private government agencies and only do the same \nthing banks do but with the Government imprimatur. On the other hand, \nthey cannot, because the Government is behind them, do anything they \nwant, be reckless or lose their capital.\n  The reform creates the right balance. I am proud of the reform. It \nraises capital requirements, it puts a regulator in who can go in and \nlook over their shoulder--which they need. But at the same time, by and \nlarge, it preserves the flexibility that Fannie and Freddie need to \nfill the hole between the private sector and what the Government does--\nand they do it well.\n  In addition, we are going to need Fannie and Freddie to be strong \nbecause right now they finance about 80 percent of the mortgages in \nthis country. We are going to need them to be strong to help us get out \nof this crisis. To veto this bill when we need them so badly is \nalmost--it edges toward irresponsibility.\n  Finally, the Affordable Housing Fund--to help those who cannot on \ntheir own achieve the dream of owning a home but who struggle so \nmightily to get there. My colleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, has \ndone a masterful job, persistent, knowing when, and cut his deal at \njust the right time.\n  It is a good bill. I have two concerns where I agree with the House, \nfrankly. I say to my good colleague from Alabama, who I know has \ndifferences on these, that the House--and many of us on this side of \nthe aisle--are of a different mind than he. I hope we can compromise \nthis quickly.\n  First, the effective date. It is unheralded, when you have a major \nchange in the law with a new regulator, to say the effective date is \nimmediate. You need time. More important, I am worried that because \nthis regulator, while he is great on safety and soundness, doesn't like \nFannie and Freddie very much and will go too far in the regulations and \ntie Fannie and Freddie's hands for a very long time way on into the \nfuture, with unintended consequences of which we are not aware. To give \nthe new powers to the new agency overnight, with no time to establish \nitself or prepare, particularly when you have someone who would be in \ncharge who does not--at least share my views on how Fannie and Freddie \nought to function, is a bad idea.\n  I hope when we meet with the House--I have spoken with Chairman Frank \nand he agrees with our side--I hope he, Senator Shelby, will realize \nhow strongly some of us feel.\n  Second is the idea of Fannie being able to securitize. There is \nlanguage on the portfolio regulation that could unnecessarily restrict \nthe portfolio business of the GSEs by creating a bias toward \nsecuritization. If Fannie and Freddie want to hold some of these \nmortgages, they should--particularly now, when the securities market is \neither nonexistent or weak and fragile and in some places hard to find. \nI hope we can address this issue as well. I do not understand why we \nwould not allow Fannie and Freddie to hold mortgages; why we put such \nan impetus on them to securitize when the security market is weak.\n\n  If this provision stays in the bill as is--there is a debate. I know \nsome believe it has more flexibility in it than I do. But, if--if, if, \nif--I am right, it could actually handcuff Fannie and Freddie in their \nrole of rescuing us out of this housing crisis at a time when they are \nvery much needed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4984\n\n  Finally, I wish to take a moment to address an amendment filed by my \ncolleague from North Carolina. While I respect her intentions, I oppose \nthe Dole amendment, which would unravel the strong agreement the New \nYork attorney general reached with the GSEs on appraisal standards. \nInflated appraisals are one of the prime causes of the housing crisis. \nTo allow banks to own appraisers without anyone looking over their \nshoulder is a built-in conflict of interest. We should not do that. I \nhope we will not.\n  Finally, on the President's veto message--this President is further \nand further removed from the economic realities of this Nation. To veto \nthis bill at a time when housing is at the nub of our economic crisis--\nat a time when housing prices are declining, at a time when \nforeclosures are increasing--makes no sense whatsoever. It seems the \nPresident is on a different economic planet than most Americans \nbecause, even if you do not hold a mortgage, even if you fully paid \nyour mortgage, you are being hurt by this economy where foreclosures \nare rampant and housing prices plummet. The ripple is outward--people \nbuy less, people vacation less, people have less money and feel less \nfree with it. The vise of high energy prices and declining home values \ncripples our economy.\n  Here we have a bill passed 19 to 2 out of the Banking Committee, \nbroad bipartisan support, and out of the blue the President issues a \nveto threat. What is going on here? Which economy is he looking at? It \nis appalling. In his veto message, there is language and there are \nthings that contradict what his own Secretary of Treasury has said \nabout portfolio loan limits.\n  I think the veto message indicates the ambivalence within the \nadministration because it is not as strident and even as forthright as \nmany are. But, unfortunately, the ideologues won out. The ideologues \nsay: No government involvement. Let everyone learn their lesson even if \nthe economy, people's savings, their whole lives, and their home goes \ndown the drain.\n  What kind of thing is that? Maybe that was the predominant thinking \nin 1893 but certainly not in the America of 2008.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they want to know one of the reasons the \nPresident is so unpopular and why so many Americans think the country \nis headed in the wrong direction, it is because he threatens to veto a \nmodest bipartisan piece of legislation such as the one Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby have put together.\n  It defies understanding. I have always believed when ideologues run \nthe show on the far right or far left, we lose. In this case, with this \nveto message, it feels as though the ideologues have started running \nthe show, and homeowners, neighborhoods, communities, and our country's \neconomy will suffer from that wrongly held belief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, let me begin by saying that I am \ndelighted we are on the floor of the Senate today addressing this \nquestion of housing. I congratulate the chairman, Senator Dodd, on a \nlong effort over several months to be able to try to get the response \nthe Senate ought to be providing to what is an obvious crisis in the \ncountry.\n  I think a lot of people in the country have to be scratching their \nheads and wondering where the Congress has been on this matter, where \nWashington has been, and where the administration has been. I know it \nis particularly frustrating to the chairman and to many of us. Way back \nin January, I recall going to the White House for a meeting on the \nquestion of a stimulus package and saying to the President: Mr. \nPresident, the obvious crisis is in housing, and you cannot address it \nand stem the hemorrhaging with respect to the American economy unless \nyou deal with the cause, which is the subprime crisis.\n  I remember Secretary Paulson was there, Vice President Cheney, and \nothers. Heads nodded in a kind of consent. Then the President proceeded \nto go to the State of the Union Message and call in his State of the \nUnion Message for the mortgage revenue bond proposal.\n  Still, here we are now in June, and we do not have an adequate \nresponse at the Federal level to the housing crisis from the Congress. \nWe have had some responses by lowering interest rates. But, the fact \nis, you pick up the paper and see there were record levels of mortgages \nin foreclosure in the Washington area and in other parts of the \ncountry. As we all know, when that happens to a community, it is not \njust a few houses, it is not just the families directly impacted by \nvirtue of foreclosures, it is the entire community. When a street has a \ngroup of foreclosures on it, the housing values all around start to go \ndown. The local pharmacy gets hurt, the gas station gets hurt, the 7-\nEleven gets hurt, the police wind up having to patrol more because they \nhave more homes that are then on the market. The real estate market \nbecomes glutted.\n  So the downstream implications are gigantic. In Boston, Mayor Menino \nand\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nI sponsored an afternoon in Roxbury where families were invited to come \nin. We finally got them to be able to sit down with a human being. They \nhad been telephoning and going through 10 or 15, ``push 5,'' ``push \n3,'' ``push 2,''. A consecutive series of pushing buttons and they were \nexasperated because they could not talk to someone to get answers for \ntheir individual situations.\n  So we got the 10 biggest lenders to come in and sat them down with \nthese people over the course of a day. During the time that I was \nthere, I actually had people come up to me with huge smiles on their \nfaces and saying: Thank you. I just cut a new deal. I am staying in my \nhome. They were able to go from a 13-percent interest rate--think of \nthat, 13 percent. I would like to know what CEO of a company in America \nwas paying 13 percent on a mortgage, or 9 percent on a mortgage. But \nhere were these hard-working Americans paying $5,000 a month for their \nhome, who had put money back into their home. The equity loan they took \non their home, in too many cases sort of pushed on them, they put into \nrewiring or roofing, putting a new boiler in, raising the equity in \ntheir home. Then all of a sudden their interest rates started to go up, \noften by circumstances beyond their control. One woman I met and talked \nto held down two jobs and was buying her mortgage on the basis of the \ntwo jobs that she held down. But then she got sick and she was not able \nto hold onto the two jobs. Because she got sick all of a sudden, she \nwas threatened with foreclosure.\n  She offered to buy the home at the rate they were going to sell the \nhome after it was foreclosed on. She could afford to do that and could \nafford to pay for the mortgage at a discounted rate. They refused to \nsell it to her. They refused to allow her to stay in it.\n  Extraordinary circumstances of stubbornness or bullheadedness--I do \nnot know what principle was being applied. But in the process, a lot of \naverage folks are getting squeezed and hurt, I mean seriously hurt, as \na result.\n\n  Equally important, it has continued the process of depressing the \nmarket and driving it downward. So I am glad we are here. I hope we can \nget it done because it is long overdue, long overdue. But we cannot \nallow the acute crisis in foreclosures to also cloud the other \nopportunities that are presented in this bill.\n  GSE reform, the FHA reform, the Foreclosure Protection Act, there is \na provision in here for veterans, which I have sponsored. I think all \nof those are important components of this bill. But there is also \nanother part of the housing crisis, and it is being addressed in this \nlegislation; that is, the ongoing and deepening shortage of affordable \nrental housing in our country.\n  So I was very pleased the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund was \nincluded in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, and that would \nproduce about 1.5 million affordable rental housing units for our \npoorest families over the next decade.\n  As the original author of this legislation, I know what it is going \nto be able to do. I had the privilege of serving on the Banking \nCommittee and serving as chairman of the Housing Subcommittee. I worked \nwith some of the staff who are still here--Jonathan Miller and others--\nwho helped pull this together in an effort to create a trust fund that \nwill help us provide funding.\n  That is why I strongly oppose the Bond amendment to make \ncontributions to the trust fund by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nvoluntary. I think the Bond amendment to make these contributions \nvoluntary is the wrong amendment and would have a very damaging impact \non our ability to be able to deal with rental housing and the rental \nhousing crisis.\n  Let me explain why. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already have \nrequirements to assist low- and moderate-income families to obtain \ncritical housing. What we do in this bill is take excess funding that \nis produced in housing. It is not often you have a program that is \nproducing excess funding, and then there is still need in that \nparticular sector. So you can actually take the excess and put it back \ninto that sector to address the need. We create that excess through \nGSEs. What we do is take the excess and put it into a revolving fund to \nproduce rental housing. In September of 2000, I first introduced this \nlegislation. Last year, along with Senator Snowe, on a bipartisan \nbasis, we again introduced the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund \nto address the very question of a severe shortage of housing by \nestablishing a rental housing production program. We now have 23 \nbipartisan cosponsors.\n  Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives last year \nwith a bipartisan vote of 264 to 148. With the work of Senator Jack \nReed on the Banking Committee, of Chairman Dodd, and of Ranking Member \nShelby, they have helped to bring this bill to the Senate floor at this \ncritical moment by including it in the Housing and Economic Recovery \nAct.\n  Frankly, it does not make sense in terms of our economic interests, \nour housing crisis interests, our family interests, to now suddenly \nmake voluntary something that has the ability to be able to address \nsuch a critical need.\n  The Affordable Housing Trust Fund would create a production program \nthat will ensure 1.5 million new rental units are built over the next \n10 years for extremely low-income families and working families.\n  The goal is obviously to create long-term, affordable, mixed-income \ndevelopments in the areas with the greatest opportunities for those \nlow-income families. It has been endorsed by more than 5,700 community \norganizations led by the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, \nincluding the National Association of Realtors, the National \nAssociation of Home Builders, the Children's Defense Fund, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National Coalition for Homeless, and many \nothers.\n  The funding from the trust fund can be used for construction, \nrehabilitation, acquisition, preservation incentives, and operating \nassistance to ease the affordable housing crisis. Funds can also be \nused for downpayment and for closing costs assistance by first time \nhome buyers.\n  Since 2006, the American housing construction industry has shed \n457,000 jobs. The construction of fewer homes means fewer new kitchens, \nfewer new basements for manufacturers to place their appliances and \nother products. The loss of manufacturing jobs follows from those fewer \npurchases and placements of appliances.\n  Job losses combine with slumping home sales to depress consumer \nconfidence, and that causes a slowdown in spending, and then you \nultimately shrink the economy.\n  This is not a small impact. Passing the trust fund will help create \nthousands of jobs in housing construction across the Nation, and it \nwill help to turn our country around. This is what a real stimulus \npackage ought to do, create jobs for the long term not pass out checks \nthat burn up in the short term. It will help signal to businesses \nacross the Nation to produce jobs that are critical to our economic \nsecurity.\n  So voting for the Bond amendment will, in fact, reduce our ability to \naddress the current crisis in the economy and reduce the creation of \nnew jobs. Because of the lack of affordable housing, an awful lot of \nfamilies are forced to live in substandard living conditions. Do you \nknow what that does? That puts a lot of children at risk in America. \nChildren living in substandard housing are more likely to experience \nviolence, hunger, lead poisoning, or to suffer from asthma. They are \nthen more likely to have difficulties learning and more likely to fall \nbehind in school. Our Nation's children depend on access to affordable \nrental housing.\n\n  One other thing people don't often think about, if you don't have \naffordable housing or you have insecurity in your housing, you also \nhave a downstream impact on schools. Because kids who have to move from \nhome to home are kids who are more likely to get yanked out of a \nschool. Classes are disrupted and the school is then disrupted. We have \na much longer term interest, in terms of our workforce development as \nwell as the stability of our communities, to make certain that we have \naffordable housing available. The trust fund will produce 1.5 million \nunits of affordable housing to provide children in America with a \nbetter quality of life. The Bond amendment would make that entirely \nvoluntary. If it is voluntary, it is not going to happen today for low-\nincome families.\n  Long-term changes in the housing market have dramatically limited the\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\navailability of affordable rental housing across the country. It has \nseverely increased the cost of rental housing that remains. In 2005, a \nrecord 37.3 million households paid more than 30 percent of their \nincome on housing costs, according to the Nation's Housing 2007 Report \nfrom the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard University. \nApproximately 17 million families paid more than half of their income, \n50 percent of their income, on housing costs. The trust fund would \nproduce rental housing and help lower the cost of housing. This is \nespecially important for families, those 17 million and 37 million \nfamilies with high housing expenditures. Adopting the Bond amendment \nwill mean that many more children and their families will live in \nsubstandard housing or will become homeless. They are children who are \nultimately less likely to do well in school, if they even stay in \nschool. I believe that is unacceptable.\n  I hope colleagues will oppose the Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will try and propound a unanimous \nconsent request one more time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at or about 4:30 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the following amendments in the order \nlisted, and that prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that after the first \nvote in the sequence, the vote time for the second vote be 10 minutes, \nwith no intervening amendments in order: Bond amendment No. 4986 and \nthe Bond amendment No. 4985. Further, that time be allocated as \nfollows: Senator Dole has requested 5 minutes to talk about a proposal \nshe is offering; Senator Bond for 10 minutes; Senator Shelby for 10 \nminutes; and myself for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4984\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, on March 3, 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac signed agreements with the attorney general of New York to adopt a \nHome Valuation Protection Code, which was crafted by the attorney \ngeneral's office and approved by OFHEO, in consultation with the \nenterprises and other market entities. The code establishes \nrequirements governing appraisal selection, solicitation, compensation, \nconflicts of interest and corporate independence, among other things.\n  The code's concept of appraiser independence and accuracy should be \nendorsed because these concepts are important to a safe and sound \nprocess that is properly structured, regardless of whether lenders use \nthird-party, affiliated, or in-house staff appraisers. However, the \ncode leans heavily towards inconsistent and potentially \ncounterproductive regulation of the lending industry. Lenders would \nessentially be required to be regulated by the New York attorney \ngeneral or suffer serious impairment of liquidity. In addition, the \nrole of the New York attorney general in promulgating the code is \nmisplaced and an attempted exercise of one State's regulatory authority \nover federally and other State-regulated lenders.\n  My amendment would require the Director of OFHEO to issue a \nregulation establishing appraisal standards for mortgages purchased or \nguaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It would ensure that \nmortgages purchased or secured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are \ncollateralized by properties subject to fair and accurate appraisals, \nwhich is necessary to maintain the integrity of the mortgage process, \nimprove the safety and soundness of the enterprises, and reduce the \npotential for mortgage fraud. Additionally, this amendment will also \nensure the establishment of a common set of appraisal standards \ngoverning mortgage lenders that are federally supervised and regulated. \nThis includes requiring the process controls necessary to ensure \nindependence, avoid improper influences, and avoid overvaluation.\n  In May, when the Banking Committee approved this bill we are now \ndiscussing, I agreed to discuss this amendment and asked that Chairman \nDodd and Ranking Member Shelby to work to include this important \nprovision once our committee product reached the Senate floor. At the \ntime, I appreciated how both the chairman and ranking member made \nfavorable remarks as to the intentions of my amendment and a \nwillingness to work with me on this, and I hope that they will now \nhonor this commitment.\n  I understand the managers are working on a time certain to vote on my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4986, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, to clarify, amendment No. 4986 relates to \nthe affordable housing trust fund. I have a minor modification. I have \nasked both sides if they would accept it. I ask unanimous consent to so \nmodify the amendment, and I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which amendment is the proposed \nmodification?\n  Mr. BOND. Amendment No. 4986.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I haven't had a chance to \nlook at it. I would have to take a minute to look at what he is \nproposing.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, then I will withdraw my request until my \ncolleague has had an opportunity to look at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BOND. Let me explain briefly that we added one sentence to a two-\nsentence amendment saying, in essence, that it will not affect the \nGSEs, existing affordable housing programs. Those are programs already \nin effect. There was some question about whether they would be \naffected. The amendment makes clear what was implied. I expect that one \nwill find no change in it. In any event, that is not the point. The \npoint is to remove the tax the Banking Committee provided, which is a \ntax on GSEs which, without any input or other involvement, would pay \nsupport for a whole range of groups. There are many groups, such as \nACORN and others who build low-income housing. Who knows, it might even \nbe Habitat for Humanity. But they would be able to use these funds to \nprovide soft costs to support the programs and other related costs.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be able to continue to use their \nexisting affordable housing program that they administer, that they \nwere set up to do, and not have their funds taken away to fund another \nprogram over which they have no control, no responsibility. There is \nabsolutely no reason to tax these entities to support housing groups \nwhich may or may not be responsible or capable of administering good \nhousing programs. There will also be additional economic risks to \nFannie and Freddie, depending on the use of these funds and the quality \nof the groups which receive these funds.\n  More critical is the unprecedented approach that requires the GSEs to \npay a tax for something for which they have no responsibility.\n  Let me be clear, the GSEs have a mission. They have a very important \nmission. When we initially talked about this program, we talked about \ngiving them more authority to go in and help in these situations. \nStatements made on the other side that we are going to cut off all \nfunding and all assistance to homeowners in distress are absolutely \nirresponsible and totally without basis. We provided and I believe this \nbody adopted some good ideas--I will speak about those in a minute--in \nprevious bills on how we deal with the housing crisis. But right now \nwhat we are saying is, let's stop this.\n  This is saying to the GSEs, you may have some excess left over after \nyou have carried out your affordable housing mission. We want to come \nin and take it away from you and spend it someplace else. Let's be \nclear, this is not saying to the entities that we want you to do your \nmission. We are saying we are going to take away money that you put \ninto your mission. We are saying, forget your mission. We are going to \ntake some of your revenue raised in\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\npart from capital markets where private sector shareholders have their \nretirement funds, their annuities, or their investments in those \ncompanies, hoping and expecting to share in the revenue. That may be \npension funds, retirement funds, endowment funds that are counting on \ngetting some of that revenue. Oh, excuse me, even though the GSE has \ncarried out the mission that we asked of it and generated some \n``excess'' revenue that might be distributed to those people who put up \ncapital in the GSEs, we are going to take it away.\n  How long before this body decides to go to other GSEs, such as Sallie \nMae, and say: We have a better idea. We are going to take any revenue \nyou make and we are going to put it someplace else? Or to utilities and \nsay: You are regulated, and you may have some excess money left over \nthat you wish to return to your shareholders, but since you are \nregulated, since you have a government franchise to provide utility \nservice, we are going to take some of your revenue and put it \nelsewhere? To me that is an unconscionable grab. It offers a precedent \nthat is very dangerous for this body, to be taking funds from one \nentity and transferring it to another entity by fiat. It is \ndiscriminatory, and it has the potential to have a significant impact \non the people who have put their money into these funds.\n  I ask again if my colleagues have had an opportunity to review the \nmodification as sent forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DODD. Are you going to resubmit the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is at the desk.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, as I understand what my \ncolleague from Missouri is suggesting is that the existing affordable \nhousing program under the GSE, that whatever language is there that \nwould have affected that is taken out by this modification.\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. There is no intent to correct that.\n  Mr. DODD. But the modification corrects that.\n  Mr. BOND. That is the purpose of the modification.\n  Mr. DODD. The underlying amendment would object to the proposed \naddition to the affordable housing program authored by Senator Reid in \nthe bill. That still is the substance of the amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       Insert the following at the appropriate place:\n       Sec. xxx.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac shall not be responsible or any payments \n     either directly or indirectly to other Housing entities under \n     the Affordable Housing program unless these GSEs voluntarily \n     provide funding. The GSEs will continue to administer their \n     affordable housing program. None of these funds in the bill \n     shall be used for soft program costs, including staff costs.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me take a few minutes, if I may, \nbecause I have yet to really address these two amendments and also the \none I know our colleague from North Carolina is going to propose or is \nin the process of proposing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4985\n\n  Madam President, let me deal, first of all, with the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program. I raised earlier this morning--and I will do it \nagain, if necessary--that 8,427 people as of today will file for \nforeclosure. That number was for every day in the month of May. That is \nin excess of the numbers back in April and even back in March. But they \nare growing. So every single day we delay moving on this, we have, on \naverage, again, some 8,000 to 9,000 people in our country who are \nentering the foreclosure process and losing their homes, and 1.5 \nmillion people have already. We have been told and warned by those who \nacknowledge and follow these issues that this is a crisis that is not \nshrinking; it is growing. It is growing by the hour, let alone by the \nday.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Act that Senator Shelby and I and 17 others \nof our committee have fashioned together--very similar to what the \nother body has done--is designed specifically to offer some relief to \nthese people facing foreclosure. Both lenders and borrowers will take \nwhat is called a ``haircut.'' It will be painful. It will not be easy. \nIt is voluntary. It is temporary. But it offers some hope that we can \nput the brakes on this ever-escalating problem of foreclosures in our \ncountry.\n  It is not only affecting homeowners, which is obviously bad enough, \nit is affecting commercial loans, student loans, municipal finance. The \nglobal implications are obvious to anyone who has paid any attention to \nthe issue. So this idea, which is central to this bill, is critical.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri would eliminate \nthis program altogether, despite all the recommendations from the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, the Consumer Federation of America, \nother lending institutions, the Federal Reserve members. In fact, the \npresent Chairman of the Federal Reserve, while not endorsing the bill, \nhas called for this kind of action.\n  Quite simply, we are living through one of the worst housing market \ncrises since the Great Depression. Almost 1 in every 11 homes with a \nmortgage in this country is in default or foreclosure as of the end of \nMarch. This is the highest level since the Mortgage Bankers Association \nbegan collecting data in 1979. Foreclosure rates have grown and grown \nat record levels for some time, and last year about 1.5 million, as I \nhave said, have already gone into that status.\n  This foreclosure crisis hurts everyone, as we all know. As Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently stated:\n\n       [H]igh rates of delinquency and foreclosure can have \n     substantial spillover effects on the housing market, the \n     financial markets, and the broader economy. Therefore, doing \n     what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in \n     the interest of lenders and borrowers. It is in everybody's \n     interest.\n\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Program is built on a concept raised by \nChairman Bernanke:\n\n       The best solution may be a write down of principal or other \n     permanent modification of the loan by the servicer, perhaps \n     combined with a refinancing by the Federal Housing \n     Administration or another lender.\n\n  That is also from Chairman Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Bank.\n  Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com recently wrote:\n\n       Unless policymakers soon become more creative and \n     aggressive, the risks are rising that the current recession \n     will be more severe and the ultimate recovery more \n     disappointing than anyone currently anticipates.\n\n  The evidence is overwhelming. The recommendations come from across \nthe political spectrum. This is absolutely critical at this pivotal \nmoment on this economic issue. Senator Kerry earlier talked about that \nat the heart of our economic crisis is the housing crisis, and the \nheart of the housing crisis is the foreclosure crisis. Were the Bond \namendment to be adopted, the very bipartisan effort we have spent \nmonths working on to achieve here would be lost.\n  I urge my colleagues, as they have heard from our colleagues--Senator \nGregg of New Hampshire, Senator Martinez, Senator Isakson; and on our \nside, Senator Boxer, Senator Schumer, and Senator Casey; and, \nobviously, Senator Shelby and myself--across the spectrum here--we \nrecognize this idea may not solve every problem, but if we can keep \n400,000 to 500,000 people in their homes, that is a step forward in the \nright direction to help Americans facing these kinds of crises. I urge \nmy colleagues, at the appropriate moment, when this matter is before \nus, to say, respectfully, to my friend from Missouri that we reject \nthis amendment and will keep this very critical element of this very \nimportant housing bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4986, as Modified\n\n  Madam President, the second proposal by Senator Bond also, in my \nview, should be rejected. We have modified the amendment, so any \npossible inference he would be striking the existing program has been \ntaken out of this bill. I applaud him for that, and I thank him for \nthat. But the problem still persists.\n  As Senator Kerry of Massachusetts just pointed out, this problem with \naffordable housing is growing. It is staggering in its proportions. \nOver 3.5 million people in our country, including\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n1.3 million children, experience homelessness each year. For most of \nthese families, all that is needed is affordable housing.\n  The gap between rental costs and wages of low-income people is \nsignificant. To give you some idea as to the housing assistance \nnecessary for many working Americans, a person has to earn over $17 an \nhour just to afford the average fair market rental without forgoing \nother basic needs. That is three times the current minimum wage.\n  There are 7.4 million disabled Americans on SSI. SSI benefits are \nlower than the average fair market rent. Rental costs are more than 100 \npercent of their SSI benefits. Without housing assistance, these people \nwho are disabled in our country cannot afford housing. That is a fact.\n  The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University found in \ntheir report, ``The State of the Nation's Housing 2007,'' that in just \n1 year, the number of severely cost-burdened households--those that pay \nmore than half of their income toward rent--jumps by 2.1 million to a \ntotal of 17 million. This is one in seven U.S. households in the \ncountry affected.\n  The data goes on and on. This is a very important element of this \nmatter: affordable, decent shelter.\n  Harry Truman, in a bipartisan effort, in the late 1940s--60 years \nago--called upon Americans. John Sparkman of Alabama was ``Mr. \nHousing'' back in the 1950s and 1960s. This was never a partisan issue: \ndecent, affordable shelter for Americans--all Americans.\n  We heard our colleagues today: Senator Martinez talking about his \nfamily getting that first home when they arrived in this country. \nSenator Boxer grew up her entire life never owning their own home, and \nshe was able to buy one as a young mother, and they stayed there for 40 \nyears to raise their family.\n  Madam President, 17 million people in our country today deserve \ndecent shelter. You should not have to strip every bit of income you \nhave to try to afford it. So what Jack Reed has put together here is \ndecency--common decency. In our moment of difficulty, if we cannot do \nsomething to provide affordable shelter and to ask that funding flow \ncome out of these government-sponsored enterprises, which have been so \nlucrative, for them to share in that wealth, to make it possible for \nworking families in this country to have a decent place to live--I do \nnot think that is too much to ask in this hour of need.\n  We heard our colleagues across the spectrum politically support this \nprogram, and having a vote of 19 to 2 in our committee, with Democrats \nand Republicans coming together at a moment such as this to say: We \nhear you. We care about what you are going through. We have designed a \nprogram not by increasing taxes but by asking existing institutions to \nshare, to see to it all Americans can enjoy that affordable and decent \nshelter they deserve as Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject that amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I regret that I, too, must oppose the \namendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, amendment No. 4986. \nSenator Bond's amendment would specifically undermine the goal of \nprotecting the American taxpayer from the costs of the HOPE Program.\n  I have often said--and I will repeat once again--that we should do \nwhatever we can to help people stay in their homes short of sticking \ntaxpayers with the tab.\n  The Banking Committee has worked long and hard for months on this \nissue and has found a way to accommodate a wide range of goals and \nconcerns with this legislation.\n  The affordable housing fund and the funding mechanism--which is \nimportant here--for the HOPE Program are two of the most critical \nelements that allowed us to reach a bipartisan agreement. Eliminating \neither one of these now would simply unwind the entire bill, would \ndestroy the whole bill, and neither I nor Senator Dodd nor a lot of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle can support that.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing the first Bond \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4985\n\n  Madam President, I would like to speak for a minute on the Bond \namendment No. 4985, the second amendment.\n  While I am sympathetic to and share many of Senator Bond's concerns \nregarding FHA's longtime management problems and resource constraints, \nI cannot support this amendment.\n  The proposed HOPE for Homeowners Program establishes a new board to \noversee the implementation of this program. Included on this board, in \naddition to HUD, are the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury \nDepartment. It is our intention that the expertise and experience of \nthis board will compensate for FHA's longstanding management problems.\n  Additionally, the bill would provide--this is important--at no cost \nto the taxpayer, funding for additional resources, particularly in the \nform of increased staff, to manage and implement the proposed HOPE \nProgram.\n  While I agree with Senator Bond that depending solely on existing FHA \nresources, the HOPE Program would be unworkable, I believe the \nincreased resources and board oversight provided in this legislation \nsufficiently address those concerns.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this second Bond amendment, too.\n  Mr. SANDERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will address my colleague from Vermont \nthrough the Chair. As I understand it, we have heard from the Members \nwho want to be heard on the amendments. Unless there is an objection, I \nknow my colleague wants to take a few minutes to propose an amendment; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I want to set aside the pending \namendment and send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DODD. The only danger is, of course, we would have to get back on \nthe matter before us to vote on the underlying amendments that we \nagreed, by unanimous consent, to do at or about 4:30.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will be very brief. I do not need more than 2 or 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. There is an objection being voiced.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Then I would like to talk about the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, we will have a couple votes fairly \nquickly, and then I will be here to entertain my colleague's proposal.\n  Mr. SANDERS. At which time I will be able to offer the amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, will my colleague from Connecticut \nyield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The amendment we discussed earlier when I made my \nremarks regarding the effective dates on the tax credit is here. I do \nnot think there is an objection. At some point in time, can I be \nrecognized to call it up?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly. I will again make the same recommendation I have \nmade to our colleague from Vermont. If the Senator from Georgia will \nwait a few minutes, we will be glad to take--in fact, I invite, as my \ncolleague from Alabama does, any other amendments besides those we have \nheard about here that people want to raise. We are anxious to do \nbusiness. We are going to have a couple votes, but obviously there may \nbe some other thoughts people have on the subject matter. Certainly, I \nwill be here to entertain that amendment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, again, I do not know if other Members wish \nto be heard on the pending matters; that is, the two Bond amendments, \nwhich are the subject of the pending votes.\n  Does my colleague from Vermont wish to be heard on the pending \namendments?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes. I wish to raise an issue. And it is my intention at \nthe appropriate time to offer an amendment which I hope we can get a \nvote on because this is an amendment of huge consequence; that is, with \nthe price of heating fuel soaring, if we do not significantly expand \nLIHEAP funding, there are going to be people who will go cold, people \nwho will die this winter.\n  We have heard about a number of national emergencies out there. I am \ncertainly sensitive to the crisis taking place in Iowa and as to the \nremnants of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. But I want Members of this \nbody to understand that if we do not substantially\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nincrease LIHEAP funding, there will be people in the northern tier of \nthis country who will go cold this winter because they cannot afford to \npay the outrageously high prices of home heating fuels that they are \ngoing to be asked to pay.\n  At the appropriate time, I will bring forth an amendment to increase \nfunding by $2.53 billion for fiscal year 2008. Madam President, the \nNortheast Coalition of Governors has made that request and that is the \nnumber I am going to be bringing forth.\n\n  I wish to have printed in the Record the letter that was written by \nthe Coalition of Northeastern Governors which is demanding that we have \nat least $5.1 billion--which is what, as I understand, the authorized \nlevel is--that that be, in fact, appropriated.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Coalition of\n\n\n                                       Northeastern Governors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2008.\n     Hon. David Obey,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jerry Lewis\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Walsh,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n         Services, and Education, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Lewis and Ranking Member \n     Walsh: As the Subcommittee begins consideration of the FY2009 \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     appropriations bill, the Coalition of Northeastern Governors \n     (CONEG) urges you to support funding the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) at the $5.1 billion level \n     authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We recognize the \n     considerable fiscal challenges that face the Appropriations \n     Committee this year and we deeply appreciate the \n     Subcommittee's continued, strong support for the LIHEAP \n     program. However, increased LIHEAP funds are urgently needed \n     in the face of continually rising energy prices (particularly \n     for delivered fuels) and the increasing number of households \n     in arrears to energy utilities. Funding the LIHEAP block \n     grant program at the $5.1 billion level, and providing it in \n     a manner that will ensure additional funding to all states, \n     will help restore some of the purchasing power of the program \n     and enable states across the nation to provide meaningful \n     assistance to citizens struggling to pay unaffordable home \n     energy bills.\n       The low-income households targeted by the LIHEAP program \n     are hit particularly hard by soaring energy prices, \n     especially home energy prices. An increasing number of \n     households are in arrears to energy utilities. For the \n     households who depend upon delivered fuels such as heating \n     oil and propane, the outlook is particularly troubling since \n     they lack the benefit any utility assistance program. These \n     households are concentrated in the Northeast, where almost 32 \n     percent of LIHEAP recipient households rely upon delivered \n     fuels, compared to 12 percent nationally or approximately 4 \n     percent in many warm weather states. Even before the price of \n     crude oil reached its recent record level, EIA estimated hat \n     households heating primarily with home heating oil will pay \n     approximately $2,000 to heat their homes this year. Without \n     an adequate LIHEAP benefit that can meet the minimum livery \n     requirement, these households face the prospect that a dealer \n     will not make a delivery or will require a surcharge, further \n     reducing the purchasing power of LIHEAP assistance.\n       The demand for this highly effective program continues to \n     increase even as the purchasing power of the LIHEAP dollar \n     plummets, and the average LIHEAP benefit decreases. If \n     federal funding remains level or declines as home energy \n     prices continue to rise, states face the difficult decision \n     of serving fewer households or reducing the level of already \n     stretched benefits. States in the Northeast have already \n     incorporated various administrative cost-savings to deliver \n     the maximum program dollars to households in need. In spite \n     of these efforts to stretch federal and state LIHEAP funds, \n     the need for the program is far too great.\n       Increased, predictable and timely federal funding is vital \n     for LIHEAP to assist the nation's vulnerable, low-income \n     households faced with exorbitant home energy bills. With an \n     appropriation at the $5.1 billion authorized level, \n     distributed to ensure that additional funding is provided to \n     all states, the program can offer meaningful assistance to \n     more households in need, lessen the need for emergency crisis \n     relief, and make optimum use of leveraging and other cost-\n     effective programs.\n       On behalf of all the CONEG Governors, we urge you to \n     support funding for LIHEAP at the $5.1 billion level in the \n     FY2009 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     appropriations bill.\n           Regards,\n     Jim Douglas,\n       Chair, Governor of Vermont.\n     David A. Paterson,\n       Vice-Chair, Governor of New York.\n     John Lynch,\n       Lead Governor for LIHEAP, Governor of New Hampshire.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. So at the appropriate time, I will be down here to \noffer--I wish to check with my colleague from Connecticut. Is there \ngoing to be any problem with me getting a vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Well, there could be. I can't say that is not going to be \nthe case. But getting a vote, that is certainly a possibility. Let me \ntalk with others and see what the intention would be.\n  Mr. SANDERS. OK. I think this vote is long overdue, and it is \nsomething the American people want to see.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me inquire, as I understand, the \nSenator from Missouri has 8 additional minutes remaining on the UC?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Alabama has 10 minutes remaining, and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has 3 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, as a cosponsor of the amendment No. \n4985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, to begin, I think I should make some \ngeneral comments about my concern and about my ability to work with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee on affordable housing programs. \nWe have worked a long time on these programs together, and he and I, \ntogether, pushed for $180 million for counseling for families facing \nforeclosure. We have gotten that passed. I have been out and talked \nwith the people who are victims, the people who are helping them, the \nlocal officials, and that is working.\n  Based on what I learned from talking to the people who are suffering \nfrom this foreclosure epidemic and from the real problems in the \nsubprime market caused by predatory lending, which the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, and I tried to get HUD to stop a few years ago, \nwe came up with a solution. That solution I offered on the floor: the \nSecurity Against Foreclosure and Education Act, the SAFE Act, most of \nwhich was incorporated in the housing bill we passed in April. I \nbelieve those things went at this problem in the right way. We \nunderstand there is a problem.\n  What I am saying is I fear that taxing GSEs or taking money, \nexpropriating money from GSEs and setting up this HOPE Now Program is a \nfalse hope because FHA can't manage it, and they are likely to have a \ntremendous impact, No. 1, potentially on the housing budget coming out \nof the taxpayers' pockets. We don't have enough money to pay for all \nthe things we need to do for public and assisted housing.\n  The SAFE Act said reform FHASecure so it could work for somebody who \nhad missed a payment or two, lower the GSE's capital requirement so \nthey could lower this capital housing program; also, provide $10 \nbillion of authorization for State housing finance agencies to raise \nadditional funds to refinance these mortgages which are in default. \nThat, I believe, is the best way to do it. That is why I am very much \nconcerned that we are going down the wrong road, trying to put a burden \non the FHA to do something they are not up to. I am afraid the HOPE \nProgram is a false hope for 130,000 families who will enter the program \nand then default and face foreclosure.\n  The hope is the FHA will somehow be able to dispose properly of those \n130,000 homes while they are trying to manage their portfolio. \nExperience shows that will not work. No matter what kind of board you \nset up, FHA cannot take on all those additional responsibilities. This \nprogram is far more likely to result in a huge bailout for lenders, \nwhile protecting a very limited number of homeowners.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--hear this: the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that under this program, mortgage holders would have \nan incentive to direct their highest risk loans to the program. They \nestimate the cumulative default rate of the HOPE Program would be 35 \npercent--one out of three--worst of the worst loans and\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nFHA would get them. Where would they get them? From companies that have \nbeen a part of the problem.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, Countrywide issued $167 \nbillion--Countrywide Financial, $167 billion. They had 11 percent of \nthe subprime market and now, according to the Wall Street Journal, they \nhave $30 billion of it, either in their own foreclosures or for those \nthey have offered a guarantee. So there is $30 billion of bad loans on \nwhich Countrywide is at risk, and this program could be used to \nrefinance all those programs.\n  If a lender or a holder was facing foreclosure and knew he had to go \nto foreclosure, it calculates the cost of foreclosure and takes some of \nthat off the value of the home and refinances that value and hands it \noff to FHA, and FHA gets stuck--gets stuck with it. The FHA has shown \nthey cannot manage and implement the existing loan activities. You can \nread the lengthy IG reports, the GAO reports. Anybody who has looked at \nthe FHA said they can't handle the job now. They have expanded from 2 \npercent to 6 percent of the market, and they can't even handle that \nadditional level now.\n  The head of the FHA said this could be a tremendous burden on his \nagency and potentially on the taxpayers. If FHA is ultimately held at \nrisk for these, they could be in a position where money that would \notherwise go to support Section 8 vouchers or public housing operating \nor capital subsidies would have to be diverted to FHA to pay back the \nworst of the worst loans--according to CBO--the worst of the worst \nloans that would be pawned off on the FHA.\n  Nobody cares more than I about dealing with and providing as much \nhelp as possible to those people who are unfortunately facing \nforeclosure, perhaps because of lack of information or even \nmisinformation that was given them about the loans into which they \nentered and the change in the market which caught them unaware, such as \nthe situation I discussed earlier today of Mr. Willie Clay, the Vietnam \nveteran who found his mortgage rate readjusting 50 percent higher, \nwhich would throw him out of the house. He had an 8.2 percent rate and \nit was going to go up to over 12 percent. He needs help. These people \nneed help. But bailing--let us bail out the people who are in trouble \nthrough the housing--State housing finance agencies or FHASecure; don't \nhave FHA set up to take the fall with the worst of the worst loans from \nlenders, some of whom may have been ones who put us in the problem.\n  I urge the support of my two amendments and I yield the floor and \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I know Senator Shelby had some time \nremaining. I don't know if he intends to use it. He may not.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 2 minutes remaining \nand the Republican side has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield 1 minute, at this point, to the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to use this minute to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up----\n  Mr. DODD. I would have to object. There is an objection being raised.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Then, since I have had my say, I wish to defer my 1 \nminute to Senator Corker without calling up an amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I feel as though I have a very generous \nallotment, and I appreciate that. I wish to speak on the Isakson \namendment.\n  Johnny Isakson, from Georgia, has tremendous experience in the area \nof housing, and I think he brought to this body a great proposal that \nis part of the bill we are now debating and that is the $8,000 first-\ntime home buyer credit. One of the flaws in the bill today, as it sits, \nis the fact that this credit begins on April 1, so people who have \nalready bought loans would be participating. I think the purpose of \nthis amendment that he so wisely crafted and has brought forward was \nactually to stimulate new home buyer housing, not to reward people who \nhave already taken action. So his amendment that I am supporting and \ncosponsoring would actually establish as the date of enactment the time \nthat that 1-year time clock would begin. It only makes sense that the \npurpose of this provision in the bill, this compromise bill, is to \nstimulate home buying, not to reward people who have already done so.\n  I hope the manager of the amendment might accept this amendment. If \nnot, I hope we will be able to call this amendment up in the very near \nfuture after this vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have 2 minutes or 3 minutes remaining, \nand I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I come to speak against the proposal by \nSenator Bond which would significantly--in fact, catastrophically--\nundercut the affordable housing program we have included in this \nlegislation, with the support of Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member \nShelby.\n  This legislation is necessary. Even before we had a foreclosure \ncrisis, hundreds of thousands of Americans--millions--did not have \ndecent, affordable housing. So this is not something that is a \ntemporary fix to the mortgage crisis; this is long-term solution aimed \nat addressing a long-term problem of not having enough affordable \nhousing in this country. It is absolutely necessary.\n  The Bond amendment would essentially say: Well, yes, you can have a \nhousing trust fund, but we are not going to fund it because the funding \nmechanism comes from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Oh, by the way, you \ncan create a home ownership protection program, but the first 3 years \nof affordable housing trust fund monies won't be available to help pay \nfor it, which was how we dealt with the objection of Senator Shelby and \nmany others that we not use public funds to help with the foreclosure \nproblem.\n  This is a way in which we can accommodate many objectives: helping \npeople facing foreclosure without using public funds and in the long \nterm creating a permanent, affordable housing trust fund. There is no \nplace in this country--none of my colleagues have places--where the \nconstituents are not coming up and saying we need help with affordable \nhousing. The rent is going up. We can't afford it. We are on the \nstreet. Please help us. That problem will not expire when this \nforeclosure crisis is over.\n  Let me also say I think it is entirely appropriate that Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac participate. They were chartered originally as quasi \npublic entities. They have--we have given them and we continue to give \nthem--affordable housing responsibilities. That is part of their \nmission, part of their mandate. Some would say: Well, listen, if that \nis the case, let them decide what they want to do. We spent years \ncreating this affordable housing program. One of the criticisms of this \nprogram was that if you gave Fannie and Freddie control of the money or \nrequired them to spend in a certain way, it would become politicized. \nThey would pick winners and losers not based upon needs in certain \nparts of the country but based on political advantage. That was a \ncriticism that was advanced most strenuously by my Republican \ncolleagues. So we have created an affordable housing program, part of \nwhich is lodged at Treasury and part of which is lodged at HUD.\n  If the Bond amendment is adopted, we are giving up the last chance we \nhave for an affordable housing trust fund in this country, the last \nmajor chance. I urge opposition.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4986, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bond amendment No. 4986, as \nmodified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCaskill (when her name was called).

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \neach, evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me briefly say to my colleagues that \nthis is the second Bond amendment. This amendment would eliminate the \nHOPE for Homeowners Act, almost the centerpiece of this legislation. \nThis is an idea that was recommended to us by a broad spectrum of \npeople on the economic agenda here dealing with the issue of how we \nkeep people in their homes. This idea has been endorsed by the American \nEnterprise Institute, the Consumer Federation of America, and many \nother groups and organizations that have suggested this idea could \npossibly keep as many as 400,000 to 500,000 people in their homes.\n  Every day in the month of May, 8,427 people filed for foreclosure. \nEvery single day. Every day, over 8,000 people are filing for \nforeclosure in our country. Every day that goes on and we fail to take \na step to do what we can to see that we can keep people in their homes \nand get our economy back on its feet, a day is lost and it endangers \nour economy even further.\n  The Bond amendment strips this bill, the HOPE for Homeowners Act, \nwhich we passed 19 to 2 out of the Banking Committee. We have had \nextensive hearings on it. It is a bipartisan proposal that we hope will \nmake a difference in our country. What better step could we take this \nevening than to reject this amendment and endorse the idea that we are \ngoing to do everything we can to keep homeowners in their home?\n  I will make a point of order, Madam President, after Senator Bond has \nspoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, a couple of months ago, we passed a good \nbill to say we would authorize $10 million for State housing finance \nagencies to help refinance homes where the owners were facing \nforeclosure. A good approach. This is a disastrous approach. CBO has \nsaid that the lenders--the people, some of whom made some of the bad \nloans in the first place--will dump the worst of their worst loans on \nFHA.\n  Last week, FHA, floundering under existing portfolio losses, \nannounced $4.6 billion in losses, 22 percent of their reserves, raising \nquestions about their ability to maintain solvency. FHA can't do it. \nThirty-five percent of the loans under the HOPE for Homeowners have \nbeen bad. The defaults would hurt the FHA. This provision would allow \nlenders such as Countrywide Financial, which had 11 percent of the \nsubprime market, and according to the papers has $30 billion of the \nworst loans, to dump those on the FHA.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008. This is the pay-go point \nof order.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable points of \norder of the Congressional Budget Act with respect to the amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act in relation to the Bond amendment No. 4985. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, my good friend, the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, asked if he could speak for 2 or 3 minutes on an \nunrelated matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask permission to speak for 3 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Iowa Floods\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I come to the floor today to give my colleagues an \nupdate on the devastating floods in Iowa, but you can also say a lot of \nthe Midwest. The President is seeing the floods for the first time \ntoday. I appreciate Senator Harkin being there with him.\n  Senator Harkin and I are working closely together to make sure every \nbase is covered in Iowa. We traveled throughout Iowa last weekend. We \nare meeting regularly to sort through everything that needs to happen. \nToday, we are covered, with him in Iowa with the President and me in \nthe Senate to work for disaster recovery provisions in this very \nhousing bill. The President has already named 55 of our 99 counties as \nFederal disaster areas.\n  More need to be named. I think he will see today the need to continue \nthese declarations. During our tours through several communities last \nweek, and hopefully again this weekend, we were pleased to see a great \ndeal of coordination between FEMA, SBA, and our local officials. It \nsounded as though they were all talking with one voice, which is \ncomforting to Iowans looking for guidance and support and, \nparticularly, it looks a lot different than during Katrina, when it \nseemed like that was not particularly the case.\n  Today, many people are starting to get back in their homes and \nbusinesses. North of Iowa City, receding waters are bringing further \nheartache as residents salvage what they can and then throw away what \nwas destroyed by the floodwaters. Those are the lucky ones. There are \nmany who are determining whether they can salvage the house let alone \nwhat is inside.\n  Small communities downriver, such as Oakville and Columbus Junction, \nare completely submerged. Farms lost everything, including equipment, \ncrops, livestock. The cities of Burlington and Keokuk are holding their \nbreath to get through without devastation such as we have seen in Iowa \nCity and Cedar Rapids.\n  Despite all this, Iowans continue to show their resiliency and heart. \nI was on C-SPAN's call-in program called ``Washington Journal'' earlier \nthis week. People from all over the country called to say how proud \nthey were of the way people in the Midwest, and particularly they were \nreferring to Iowans, were pulling together and working to get through \nthis disaster.\n  Of course, Senator Harkin and I could not agree more. Volunteers \ncontinue to be at the forefront of our efforts. Local churches have \nmade heroic efforts. The Salvation Army and Red Cross have been in Iowa \nsince the beginning. I cannot say enough about the local officials, \nincluding law enforcement, fire departments, and the Iowa National \nGuard.\n  I would like to extend my thank-yous to all my colleagues who have \ncome forth showing their support. I think I can speak for both Senator \nHarkin and myself in saying we have had people in private coming up to \nus on the Senate floor. Having that happen is very gratifying.\n  Many of you have had similar events occurring in your own States and \nunderstand the pain we feel once again in Iowa. Our constituents are \ngoing to need the Federal Government's help. Senator Harkin and I have \nbeen meeting often and have also put together a coalition of Midwest \nSenators whose States were also hit.\n  I thank all my colleagues for giving our constituents the help they \nneed as we continue down this road.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not tend to object. May I have 4 \nminutes following Senator Webb?\n  Mr. DODD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                GI Bill\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to speak actually in conjunction with \nthe senior Senator. It is fine with me if he wants to follow me for 4 \nminutes. I wish to speak for a bit about the announcement from the \nWhite House today to the effect that the President has agreed he will \nnot veto the GI bill we have worked on so hard for the last 17 months; \nthat he is willing to accept this legislation.\n  I wish to say how grateful I am to all the veterans groups that over \nthe last 17 months worked so hard to get the right bill. This bill will \nbe reported back to us, I am told, in the exact form we sent it over, \nwith the vote of 75 to 22 not long ago.\n  There was another provision Senator Warner and I had worked on as a \nseparate amendment regarding transferability that will be put in this \nbill in a slightly different form.\n  But there was some mischaracterization in terms of how the White \nHouse portrayed this transferability provision. I think it goes to the \nheart of some work Senator Warner has done over many years, and I think \nit deserves to be clarified in this body.\n  The announcement by the White House was to the effect that this \ntransferability provision would be a new provision. In fact, Senator \nWarner and a number of Senators on our side of the aisle enacted this \nas law 6 years ago. We have heard from people on the other side, from \nthe administration, from people in the Pentagon, that there was a \npriority 1 item out of the Pentagon.\n  But it has been in law, at the discretion of service Secretaries for \n6 years. So we are willing to accept this provision as it comes over.\n  We are enormously grateful the President said he will not veto this \nbill because, quite frankly, it has been almost 7 years since 9/11. The \noperational tempo of the people who have been serving has gone up. They \ndeserve a wartime GI bill. They are going to get it. I wish to express, \nagain, my appreciation to all the members of this body--we had 58 \nsponsors, including 11 from the Republican party--and to all the \nveterans groups who helped make this possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Webb. He and I have known each other for a very long time. When \nI was Secretary of the Navy, he was a young captain, just back from \nVietnam, serving on my staff.\n  When he came to the Senate, he indicated his top priority was to get \na revision of the existing framework of laws governing the GI bill \nbecause he felt very strongly, based on his long and heroic service to \nthis country in uniform that we owed this generation everything that \nprevious generations had received by virtue of educational benefits.\n  I said several times on this floor, acknowledging with the greatest \nhumility and thankfulness in my heart for two periods of military \nservice I had of no great significance, but, nevertheless, enabled me \nto have a GI bill from a short service at the end of World War II and \nfor service during the Korean war.\n  One GI bill got me a bachelor's degree, the second a law degree. I \nfelt, just as Senator Webb, this generation deserves no less than that. \nBut his fortitude, his determination, his perseverance has led to this \nlegislation. I wished to acknowledge that and the support we received \nin this body and the support we received from the various \norganizations, veterans organizations all across America.\n  I will cite some historic memorabilia on this subject. In May of \n2001, I was the only Republican on the Armed Services Committee to join \na number of other Democrats on the committee in cosponsoring the bill \nby Max Cleland of Georgia. Those of us who knew Max Cleland remembered \nthat he came to the floor of the Senate, despite his serious wounds he \nhad received and disability from that conflict, as the hardest fighting \nSenator for veterans and military people.\n\n  I was proud to join him. But nothing happened to that bill. It lost \nits way. So then, in 2002, as chairman of the committee, I went back \nand picked up on what this legislation had laid as the\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nfoundation. In the fiscal year 2002 National Defense Act, subtitle E, \nsection 654, is the historical precedent for transferability.\n  So I wish to thank the members of the Armed Services Committee who \nhave worked this issue for many years. When it came time to have \nSenator Webb's bill go in, we talked about transferability, but we \nrecognized it was already law.\n  In the course of the deliberations on his bill, it seemed to me \nimportant that we update the 2002 law, which we did. I put in an \namendment, amendment No. 4800, on May 20, 2008, which brought \ntransferability in the old statute up to date.\n  Subsequently, we have not had any official cooperation of support \nfrom the Department of Defense, but unofficially there was some advice \nthat came to us. We incorporated that advice, and that advice now \nreshaped my amendment on May 20. That, hopefully, will become the law \nof the land when that bill comes from the House to the Senate floor. I \ncertainly urge all colleagues to join in that.\n  But again, I say to Senator Webb, I salute him for his work on this \nlegislation, his long and hard service to the country. This will stand \nas a hallmark for his initiative. I was pleased to join him along the \nway. I think all of us in this Chamber thank him for the leadership he \nhas given.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to one of my dearest \nfriends in this body, Senator John Warner, and to Jim Webb, who did a \ngreat job of this. All of us are grateful for the tremendous work they \nhave done. Needless to say, millions of veterans deeply appreciate \ntheir commitment to this. I am not surprised that these two Virginians \nwill be leading the charge in this. I thank them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I can add a word. When the Armed \nServices Committee passed, in 2002, the legislation initiating \ntransferability, it was against the wishes of the Department of \nDefense. But, nevertheless, our committee, as it has many times, stood \nits ground and put it into law.\n  It was not utilized by the Department of Defense, except in one or \ntwo cases by the Department of the Army. The other military departments \ndid not use it. So the concept of transferability has been around for a \nlong time. It is not brand new as indicated by some interpretation of \nthis press release from the White House today.\n  It has been around a long time, and it received no support from the \nBush administration in 2002, when it went on the lawbooks. It was not \nutilized by the departments. So, today, they announced, from the White \nHouse, it is rather interesting, the sentence reads:\n\n       The President is pleased that Congress answered his call to \n     ensure that military families soon will be able to transfer \n     their unused education benefits to their spouse or children.\n\n  That has been the law of the land, in one form or another. That has \nbeen the effort of this Congress. That has been the effort of this \nArmed Services Committee, of which I am proud to be a member for many \nyears, 6 or 7 total.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I wish to give my thanks to our colleagues. Well done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent request that we \nare going to make when I get the paper.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Bunning motion to refer now be in \norder with respect to the House message regarding H.R. 3221; that there \nbe 30 minutes for debate with respect to the motion; that the time be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that no amendments be \nin order to the motion; that the motion be subject to an affirmative \n60-vote threshold; that it achieves that threshold, that it be agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider by laid on the table; that if it does \nnot achieve that threshold, that it be withdrawn and there be no \nfurther motions to refer in order during the pendency of this House \nmessage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] moves to refer the \n     message from the House on H.R. 3221 to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate with \n     instructions to assess the potential financial benefits the \n     legislation could provide to Countrywide Financial \n     Corporation and other lenders, as well as mortgages \n     originated by Countrywide Financial Corporation and other \n     lenders that are held by third parties.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I make this motion to refer the House \nmessage on the housing bill to the Banking Committee so the Senate can \nhave all the facts about who will benefit from this legislation before \nwe go forward. As anyone who has looked at the 631 pages of the \nsubstitute text can tell, this is a very serious piece of legislation. \nHundreds of billions of dollars are on the line under the various parts \nof this bill. One part of this bill alone is a $300 billion refinancing \nprogram for problem mortgages. That part of the bill will open the door \nof the FHA to borrowers who have defaulted on their mortgages. I \nquestion the wisdom of that program. But for the moment, I want to \nfocus on who will benefit rather than the losses the taxpayers will \nface.\n  The supporters of this bill say borrowers will benefit and lenders \nmust take a loss on the loan before it can be refinanced. But that is \nnot the whole truth. Lenders are already facing losses on these loans, \nso moving a loan into the program puts an end to the bleeding, and the \nFHA assumes the risk of all future losses. What that means is the \nlenders and others who hold mortgages are going to dump their worst \n$300 billion of mortgages on the FHA, without requiring so much as a \nthank-you to the taxpayers. If we are going to give such a large gift \nto the big banks and the investment houses, we should at least know to \nwhom we are sending it.\n  Some of the lenders who are blamed for creating this housing crisis \nstand to benefit the most. For example, I read in the morning Wall \nStreet Journal that one lender, Countrywide Financial, could benefit to \nthe tune of $25 billion. That is a large gift from Congress to a \nprivate company, especially one that has been identified by some as the \nleader of the mortgage madness and has written more than 10 percent of \nthe total of the most risky loans.\n  Does that make sense to anybody? Does that make sense to my fellow \nSenators? I don't think so.\n  Some may question that $25 billion figure. The truth is, no one in \nthis Senate knows what the real number is. That is my point. The \nAmerican people deserve to know who is going to benefit from this bill \nbefore we pass it. That is why I make this motion to refer the bill to \nthe Banking Committee so that the committee can assess which banks and \nlenders will benefit and by how much. I make this motion with the full \nknowledge that it is going to take 59 fellow Senators to realize that \nthe 631 pages of this substitute have just appeared before us \nyesterday. I continue to press my motion.\n  I now yield to my good friend from South Carolina, Senator DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I \nappreciate his willingness to offer this motion and bring some of our \nconcerns to the attention of the Senate. I would like to make clear \nthat it is not our intent to question the integrity of any Member of \nthe Senate. But I believe every American has the right, given the \nsituation surrounding this bill, to question the judgment of any \nSenator who votes for it at this time.\n  I know Senator Shelby, the ranking member, has worked for years on \npart of this bill that is very important, and that we all support, GSE \nreform, getting a Federal regulator who can help keep some \naccountability in a system that has gotten out of control. I know if \nthat was the only part of this bill that was being offered, he would be \nproud to support it. But we also know politics is the art of \ncompromise, and we had to put a package together, I assume, that was \nneeded in order to get the real reform through.\n  I think the package that came together is clearly problematic. A \ncloud\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\nsurrounds this bill. We have seen it in the media all over the country, \nquestioning the amount of money we spend, who benefits from it, and the \nfact that we are potentially unloading hundreds of billions of dollars \nof bad loans on to the American taxpayers' shoulders.\n  I appreciate Senator Shelby and his work, but I have to object to \nthis bill. The purpose of referring it back to the committee is not to \nstop the bill indefinitely but to get a careful review of who benefits \nfrom this bill. I have received different reports since it began.\n  First, I heard that Countrywide, one of the lenders involved that has \nhad so many allegations against it, could potentially get $2.5 billion. \nThen the Wall Street Journal says it is $25 billion. As we look at \nthis, the bill is designed to essentially encourage a lot of these \nmortgage companies to unload their riskiest loans on to the taxpayer. \nWe are told, because they have to accept some reduction in the value of \nthat loan, that they are going to be discouraged from doing it. In \nfact, we know if you take the riskiest loans, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has already told us that 35 percent of these loans will default \nagain. In other words, we basically know that 35 percent of these loans \nare going to fall back on the shoulders of the American taxpayer \nbecause this bill includes a guarantee.\n  We also know some of the voluntary programs, such as the Hope Now \nProgram facilitated by the administration, are working. They have \nprevented over 1.5 million foreclosures. We need to do things like that \nthat would help avoid foreclosures, help people stay in their homes. \nBut this bill has come together in such a way as to raise questions all \nover the country that we need to answer before we move ahead.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his willingness to stand \nfor this. I encourage those who even support the bill to accept that we \nneed to say: Wait a minute; let's look at this again. Let's look at the \nconcerns that are being expressed all over the country. Then, let's \ntake up the bill again at the right time.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I reiterate the fact that since we have \nthe 631-page substitute, we have had no CBO scoring on this bill. It \nwould only make sense to me to refer it back to the Committee on \nBanking so that CBO can work their magic and come up with the numbers \nso we know who is benefiting and who is not benefiting from the many \npages in this bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, within the hour, the Senate rejected two \namendments offered by the Senator from Missouri. The first one, which \nwould basically gut this program, the vote was 77 to 11. The second \nBond amendment was also rejected, 69 to 21. That indicates that there \nis a lot of bipartisan support for this bill on which we have worked \nfor years in the Banking Committee. The current Presiding Officer knows \nthese issues well. He represents the State of Florida and knows about \nhousing. He knows about mortgages and, as an attorney at one time, I am \nsure he dealt in that area.\n  In this bill there is no special treatment, I say to my good \nfriends--and I have a lot of respect for Senators Bunning and DeMint--\nno special treatment for any lender or homeowner. All lenders will have \nto take a significant loss, more than a little haircut, if they choose \nto participate. This is a voluntary program. All homeowners will have \nto share any equity gains. This is not a bailout, I assure my \ncolleagues. The Presiding Officer knows I wouldn't support a bailout.\n  I voted against the stimulus bill that was here earlier in the year, \nas some of my colleagues did. But there are some good things in this \nbill, and I want to talk a few minutes about them. While the \nlegislation would authorize FHA to provide up to $300 billion in loan \nguarantees under the new program over the 2009-2011 period, CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimates that FHA would use only $68 \nbillion of that--that is a lot of money still--loan commitment \nauthority through 2011 to implement the program. CBO estimates that \nenacting this legislation would increase direct spending by $729 \nmillion over the 2009-2018 period. That amount includes $684 million \nfor the estimated subsidy cost of loan guarantees and $45 million in \nadministrative costs.\n  Taxpayers will not bear these costs. Maybe that was the original \nproposal, but in the Banking Committee, we worked out a formula to let \nthe GSEs, the affordable housing program, do this for 3 years because \nwe didn't want the taxpayers doing this. Taxpayers will not bear these \ncosts. During the 2009-2011 period, a portion of the GSEs' assessments \nwould be used to pay the cost of this new program. These assessments \nwould be used to reimburse the Treasury for the cost of the whole \nprogram up to an estimated $960 million total for those years.\n  Use of the new loan program is contingent upon the voluntary \nparticipation of both lenders and borrowers. As a result, demand for \nthis program to refinance qualifying mortgages would depend on how many \nlenders and borrowers would perceive the new program as their best \noption in the marketplace.\n  It is important to note that mortgage lenders and borrowers will give \nup something in order to take advantage of this program. The current \nmortgage holder, whoever it is, must agree to a loan refinancing \nprogram that brings the loan-to-value ratio on the new FHA-insured loan \nto no greater than 90 percent of the property's current appraised \nvalue, not what it was at one time. In addition to forgiving a portion \nof the debt on the existing loan, the current mortgage holder will have \nto pay 3 percent of the original insured loan amount to FHA. The \nexisting mortgage holder might also cover some portion of the \norigination fees for the new loan. In effect, the existing mortgage \nholder would take at least a 13-percent writedown--it might be 50 \npercent; we don't know--of the existing mortgage. That probably, in a \nlot of cases, would be better than foreclosure. What I am driving at \nis, we are not worried about the lenders. I am not. I am worried about \nthe homeowners. I know the Presiding Officer is. The amount could be \nhigher depending on the amount of the origination fee paid and the \nability of the borrower to pay a mortgage. Thus, the current mortgage \nholder will receive no more than 87 percent of the property's current \nvalue, after the 3-percent premium is taken into account. I know this \nis complicated, but this is the way mortgages work.\n\n  Borrowers will have to agree to the equity-sharing provisions \nrequired under this program and determine whether forgoing some future \nprofits on their homes is an acceptable arrangement. This is a \nvoluntary program.\n  CBO, again, estimates that fewer than 40 percent of the 1.1 million--\nat this time--eligible loans would be refinanced under the new program. \nBut if they are, it is going to help a lot of people who are deserving. \nFollowing a reduction in the principal amount of those loans to make \nthem affordable, CBO further estimates that approximately 400,000 loans \nwould be guaranteed under this legislation, with an average loan amount \nof $170,000. This 40-percent participation reflects the number of \nexpected foreclosures, the impact of second liens, administrative \nchallenges, and anticipated participation by mortgage holders and \nborrowers.\n  Many borrowers who would otherwise be eligible for this program will \nnot participate because servicers will not be able to contact some \nborrowers, as we know. Even with the assistance of this program, some \nborrowers will not be able to avoid foreclosure because they have \nexperienced a significant event, such as job loss, illness, divorce, or \ndeath. In other words, they would not qualify.\n  The average subsidy rate for those guarantees would be 1 percent. \nThis estimated subsidy rate assumes that the cumulative claims rate--\nthat is, the default--for the program would be about 35 percent and \nthat recoveries on defaulted mortgages would be about 60 percent of the \noutstanding loan amount.\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say again, in this legislation there is no \nspecial treatment for any lender or homeowner. This is a voluntary \nprogram. All lenders--all lenders--will take a significant loss. There \nis no mention of any bank, mortgage broker, mortgage banker, or anybody \nelse--Countrywide or anybody--in this bill. If there were, I would not \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise against this motion for several \nreasons.\n  First, on the specific issue, I do not think there has been a Member \nof this Chamber who has been more of a scourge against Countrywide than \nthe senior Senator from New York. I do not like their practices. I do \nnot like what they have done. I have criticized them publicly \nrepeatedly. I have even asked Bank of America to make sure Countrywide \nemployees--high-ups--are not hired when the company takes over. So I do \nnot like Countrywide. I think many of us in this Chamber may not, given \nwhat we know they have done.\n  But I do not know of a single special interest provision, as my good \nfriend from Alabama has stated, in this bill that applies to \nCountrywide. It is a general proposal supported by wide numbers of \npeople on all sides--on the lending side, on the borrower side. Many of \nthe groups that represent the poorest people in America support these \nprovisions. So did my colleagues. Of the 10 Republican members of the \nBanking Committee, 8 supported this bill.\n  Furthermore, this bill is not one of those that are concocted in the \ndark of night and put on the floor 3 hours later. The provisions in the \nbill have been public for weeks. Not a single one of my colleagues has \ncome up and is able to point to any special interest provision that \nnames any specific lender, that benefits them differently than all the \nother lenders around.\n  If there is something we ought to do about Countrywide, we can hold \nhearings. If there is something we ought to do about the practices \nCountrywide and other lenders used, we should reform them. The chairman \nof this committee has been in the lead in trying to make those kinds of \nreforms. I know because a lot of the legislation he did we worked on \ntogether.\n  So there is no reason to believe--there is not a scintilla of \nevidence--there is a special interest provision here. We all know what \nis going on here. We ought to resist it on both sides of the aisle. I \nwant to particularly salute my colleague from Alabama for standing up \nand saying that.\n  The second thing I want to say is this: This is beyond petty \npolitics. We have a nation heading into recession. Thousands of people \nlose their homes every single day. Will the provisions of this bill--\nintroduced by Senators Dodd and Shelby and supported by the Banking \nCommittee, 19 to 2--will they save every one of them? Absolutely not. \nWill they save a good number of them? You bet.\n  Will they bring back devastated neighborhoods that have foreclosure \nsigns on all the houses? And innocent homeowners who happen to have a \nhouse next to them, who paid their mortgages off 10 years ago and are \nsuffering today because the value of their homes is going down, will \nthis bill help them? You bet it will, with the CDBG provisions.\n  Will this bill enable Fannie and Freddie--which we are going to need \nin the next few years more than ever because they back or securitize or \nhold 80 percent of the new mortgages in this country; it is the only \nway to get the housing business back on its feet; and this bill wisely \nstrengthens the regulation of Fannie and Freddie and strengthens their \ncapital requirements but at the same time enables them to move forward \nat a time when we need them more than ever before--will this bill do \nthat? You bet.\n  Should we be holding this bill up now when we desperately need it, \nwhen not a single provision--not a single provision--in this bill can \nbe pointed to as narrow, special interest, or favoring any single \ninstitution or individual?\n  The argument is conclusive. It is not a close one. This is not one of \nthose--by the way, one other reason. We finally have a bipartisan bill \non something important. It does not happen very much these days, to the \nregret of most of us here, whether we be Republican or Democrat. We \nfinally have one because of the hard work of the senior Senator from \nConnecticut and the senior Senator from Alabama.\n  Therefore, I urge that this motion be defeated and that we move on \nand pass this bill tonight so we can get to the business of fixing the \nhousing crisis and, furthermore, trying to make sure the recession we \nhave is as shallow as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like permission to speak briefly \nin rebuttal for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 22 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want everybody to see this bill--631 \npages. This is the substitute bill out of the Banking Committee. This \nbill never came through the Banking Committee. This is a substitute \nbill. No one saw this bill until 5 p.m. last night--631 pages.\n  My good friend from New York has made many good points about the bill \nthat we did discuss in the Banking Committee, and you know about it. \nBut this is a brandnew substitute that has new provisions, and no one \nhas had a chance to go through them.\n  I am saying that this bill ought to be sent back to the Banking \nCommittee and examined to make sure all those wonderful things the \nSenator from New York has said are true. That is the reason for my \nmotion to refer.\n  I yield all of my time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield time to my colleague from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  There is 1 minute 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the CBO has scored the Banking portion of \nthis bill so that not a penny of taxpayer dollars will be spent. This \nis not a bailout by taxpayers dollars. Second, the bill in no way \nbenefits lenders. Lenders have to take a haircut, as Senator Shelby \npointed out very clearly. Also, this bill is really an amalgamation of \nprovisions, many of which have passed the Senate before, that have been \ndiscussed extensively in the Banking Committee. That are the result of \nnumerous hearings.\n  This is not the case where we have created something completely new, \ncompletely out of whole cloth. There might be changes, but I think it \nis quite easy for committee staffs and individual Members to deal with \nthese changes and if there are objections, to make amendments.\n  This motion is to kill this bill. As Senator Schumer pointed out, \nwhat we are losing here is help for hundreds of thousands of \nhomeowners--not financial institutions. What we are losing here is a \nstronger regulatory structure to govern Fannie and Freddie. I have sat \non the committee for years listening to people say: We have to get \nregulatory reform, GSA reform. We cannot let these institutions--Fannie \nand Freddie--operate without strengthened oversight. That is precisely \nwhat this legislation does.\n  So this legislation is about helping homeowners, regulating Fannie \nand Freddie, and has nothing to do with bailing out companies.\n  Countrywide is mentioned in this motion to recommit. Countrywide was \ntrading a year ago at $38.89. It closed today at $4.83. It is subject \nto an acquisition by Bank of America. The market has penalized \nCountrywide. Bank of America will acquire it. By the time this \nlegislation is effective, Countrywide very well might not exist as an \nentity in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, give me the time situation on this half-hour \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important piece of legislation. \nThere is not a place in America that has not felt the burden of the \nsubprime lending crisis. It has spilled over into everything we do in \nAmerica today.\n  In Nevada, where we have had a boom for 20 years, that boom is not \nthere now. People were buying homes because we had such growth coming \ninto the community. We have 5,000 to 10,000 people moving to Las Vegas \neven now. But this has hurt the entire economy of my State.\n  We have already passed 75 percent of this legislation overwhelmingly. \nThis is a good piece of legislation. Twenty-five percent--an important \npart of this legislation--has been worked on for 2 months, at least, in \ngreat detail by two of the most experienced Senators we have--Senators \nwho know how to deal with the House because they both served in the \nHouse, Senators who have been chairmen of committees in the past and \nnow.\n  Senators Bunning and DeMint have a right to offer this--and that is \nwhy we are here--but I think they are headed in the wrong direction. I \nask my colleagues to understand that everything in this bill is \ntransparent. There is nothing that is not transparent in nature.\n  We have to also understand that, for example, one of the programs \nthis motion attempts, perhaps, to suggest--and others would have to \nmake a better determination than I--but suggest that the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program created in this bill through the bipartisan work of \nSenators Dodd and Shelby is a taxpayer-paid bailout to lenders. One of \nthe people who have been involved in this provision of the bill for a \nlong period of time has been the Secretary of the Treasury, who, by the \nway, is a breath of fresh air for the administration. I have great \nrespect for Secretary Paulson. So there could be nothing further from \nthe truth that this is a taxpayer-paid bailout.\n\n  First, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program will actually result in a net gain for taxpayers of \na quarter of a billion dollars--$250 million.\n  Second, lenders aren't getting bailed out under this program; lenders \nmust choose to participate. The program is voluntary. Secretary Paulson \nhas talked to me personally about this. He likes it because it is \nvoluntary.\n  Third, lenders who voluntarily participate in this program will have \nto take a loss. These lenders will have to agree to accept a new loan \nat a reduced principal amount to replace an existing loan they have \nmade to a borrower. So if lenders participate, they will lose money, \nbelying the notion that this program is a bailout.\n  Some of our friends in the Senate claim this motion is not intended \nto question the integrity of colleagues, and I hope they are right. \nWhether that is true or not, regrettably, the effect of this motion is \nto delay the Senate in providing relief to American families, a \nstruggling housing market, and our economy.\n  As he knows, Senator Bunning is somebody whom I admire greatly \nbecause the fact is, I wanted to be a baseball player, not a Senator. I \nhave great respect and admiration for him. Every chance I get--and I \nthink I get on his nerves a lot of times because I continually ask him \nabout his ball games and who was his favorite catcher and all that kind \nof stuff. So the fact that I oppose this motion doesn't take away from \nmy respect for the Senator from Kentucky, a member of the Baseball Hall \nof Fame.\n  I disagree with Senator DeMint quite often, but I know his heart is \nin the right place.

So we will be around.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also remind everybody that it is obvious \nwe are going to have a lot of work to do next week. We are going to \nhave to have a vote Tuesday morning. It has been longstanding that \nthere will be no votes on Monday. There will be business conducted here \non Monday, but we are going to have a vote on Tuesday before the \ncaucuses, and maybe more than one vote before the caucuses.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is time \ncontrolled by the manager of the bill at this point?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there is no time agreement, so it is a \nmatter of recognition.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill in general.\n  Let me first congratulate and recognize Chairman Dodd for the \nincredible job he has done, along with the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Shelby, in bringing to the floor this much needed \neffort for so many Americans, as well as the country in general. So \nfar, by the nature of the bipartisan votes we have seen, we are moving \nforward in the right direction.\n  The crisis in the housing market in this country continues to get \nworse. One in 11 American mortgages is past due or in foreclosure. That \nis a devastating number, and it is still rising--rising fast, as \nunemployment spikes and home prices fall.\n  American families are losing their most valuable assets, bedrocks in \ntheir lives, pillars that support their communities. And when those \npillars fall, communities come crashing down. All in all, we have \nexperienced the worst quarter for American homeowners in nearly three \ndecades, and it only stands to get worse.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, over the next 2 years we expect more \nthan 57,000 homes to be lost to foreclosure. That means 57,000 families \nwho will have to hand over the keys to their homes. Families will be \nforced to say goodbye to the place where they are nurtured and \ncomforted, the place where they live through the good and the bad, the \nplace they come home to every night. In the words of families who know \nwhat it feels like to lose their home, they feel like they have lost \neverything.\n  Nationwide, the number of foreclosures that is going to happen if we \ndon't act is unfathomable. With almost 8,500 foreclosure filings each \nday--and additional resets coming in July--what I said a year ago this \npast March, that we were going to have a tsunami of foreclosures--\nthough some in the administration said that was an overexaggeration--\nwell, we have not even seen the crest of that tsunami. Unfortunately, \nthat storm is only going to get worse. So we have come together to take \na stand for homeowners; not just for those facing foreclosure, but for \ntheir neighbors on their streets, their entire communities, and for \ngenerations of home buyers in the future. Today, Senators on both sides \nof the aisle have come together to support legislation to help \nsuffering homeowners and to set the housing market back on an even \nkeel.\n  This Chamber has come to understand this crisis is truly a threat to \nall of us, to all our communities. Whether you live in the North, the \nSouth, the East, or the West, whether it is a city in Ohio watching \ncrime rates go up after a string of foreclosures, an entire county in \nFlorida experiencing an economic drought after its residents move away, \nor a single family in New Jersey in danger of being forced out onto the \nstreet, everyone stands to lose from those foreclosures.\n  Lenders report losing tens of thousands of dollars on each \nforeclosure, and neighbors see the value of their homes dropping pretty \ndramatically. When we see that 49,000 Americans lost their jobs a month \nago, when we see weak earnings reports from businesses, wild swings in \nthe stock market, and the collapse of a major firm on Wall Street, we \ncan see this housing crisis is truly shaking the entire economy to its \ncore.\n  I am hopeful that this coming week finally there will be a glimmer of \nhope for homeowners who have been left to fight the battle alone. It is \nclear that Members on both sides of the aisle know it is time to act, \nand it is clear what our goal has to be: Helping families keep their \nhomes.\n  This Housing and Economic Recovery Act we have before us takes some \nimportant steps to that end. It strengthens and modernizes the \nregulation of the housing government-sponsored enterprises--Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. It modernizes the Federal \nHousing Administration and creates the HOPE for Homeowners program, \nwhich will prevent over 400,000 foreclosures.\n  The bill also contains language that I championed to improve \nfinancial education and housing counseling. I believe this is an \nimportant step forward for improving financial education and arming \nhomeowners with the tools to protect themselves.\n  Because of Senator Jack Reed, this bill includes an affordable \nhousing fund to create affordable housing for millions of American \nfamilies.\n  The bill also contains a new tax deduction for property taxes, relief \nthat could be provided to many across the country but nearly half a \nmillion people in my home State of New Jersey. The bottom line is this \nbill takes real steps to help American homeowners, and these steps are \nmuch needed.\n  Having said that, as always, no legislation is perfect. I do have \nsome concerns. I certainly believe the establishment of a strong \nregulator for government-sponsored enterprises is long overdue, and \nthere is no better time than now. But I have some significant concerns \nrelative to the effective date of the bill. Currently it does not \nprovide for an orderly transition period. GSE regulatory reform would \ncombine the regulatory powers and staff of three separate executive \nbranch agencies to create a new GSE supervisor with far-reaching powers \nover our Nation's housing finance system. I believe we cannot make \nthese changes at the flip of a switch. We need time to get the \ntransition right.\n  The House-passed GSE bill would do this by establishing a uniform \neffective date of 6 months after enactment of this legislation. I think \nthat is a transition period that would ensure an orderly transition to \na new GSE regulatory regime.\n  The bill also includes a separate provision that would limit the \nability of the GSE to create liquid markets for high-cost areas, as \nwell as for other typical portfolio products, such as multifamily \nlending and refinancing families out of subprime loans they cannot \nafford, by creating an arbitrary bias toward securitization in the \nportfolio language of the bill.\n  As we move forward, I urge the Senate to think more broadly about the \nimportance of the GSEs and the role they play in times of crisis and \ngenerally in the days ahead.\n  I would also like to have seen a higher GSE and FHA loan limit \nincluded in the final bill. In March, when the Banking Committee held \nits first hearing to address the subprime crisis, I spoke about the \nneed to raise the FHA loan limit in order to give borrowers more \noptions. Right now, in New Jersey, 12 of the 21 counties are at the FHA \nand GSE ceiling. Under this bill today, those 12 counties would have \ntheir ceiling lowered, and almost all the other counties in New Jersey \nwould see some reduction as well. By lowering the number, I think we \nare restricting our economic recovery and our ability to provide \nindividuals with better, more affordable options.\n\n  While I believe those are concerns, let me reiterate that none of \nthese provisions causes me to question my support for this bill. \nChairman Dodd has said numerous times that had he written this bill on \nhis own, without the necessity of the negotiation the Senate is well \nknown for, he would have drafted it differently himself. I certainly \ncommend him for his efforts, as I understand the art of the possible, \nand I hope we can address some of these concerns as we move forward.\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\n  At the end of the day, this bill will help struggling homeowners and \nwill have positive ripple effects on the rest of our country. Having a \nforeclosed home sit abandoned in a community doesn't benefit anyone. It \ndecreases surrounding home values and it can attract crime and \nvandalism. The bottom line is that foreclosure destabilizes \nneighborhoods. The funds in this bill allow communities to stop that \nspiral before it starts.\n  I am also proud to have supported a provision in this bill to provide \nfunding for counseling in order to reach and help families at risk of \nlosing their homes. Many Americans are sitting around their kitchen \ntables looking through their mortgage bills, their finances, and their \nbank notices, and they simply don't know where to turn. These \ncounselors could offer them real solutions and options to help them \navoid receiving the foreclosure notice. The bill puts forward $150 \nmillion to make sure counseling reaches those who need it the most.\n  Some argue that stepping in to help our communities recover from the \nhousing crisis would somehow be a blow to the concept of personal \nresponsibility, because some homeowners made bad choices in signing up \nfor a subprime mortgage. Don't get me wrong, personal responsibility is \nimportant, and that is why we need greater support for homeowner \neducation, and for foreclosure counseling and financial literacy, so \nthat anyone thinking about buying a home will be able to understand the \nterms of their mortgage, even the fine print, and have the tools to \nprotect themselves. But personal responsibility isn't just important \nfor homeowners. As I said at the start of this crisis, every \nparticipant in the life of a loan needs to step up and take real \nresponsibility and action. Blaming the homeowner alone is not right, it \nis not fair, and it is economically disastrous. Every broker, lender, \nrealtor, appraiser, regulator, credit rating agency, and investing firm \nhad a role in this storm, and I will not let the blame fall to only the \nhomeowners.\n  As we in this Congress are debating how best to help homeowners, how \nbest to end the housing crisis, and how best to get our economy back on \ntrack, we have to see the bigger picture. There is a lot at stake, no \nmatter who we are, whether we have a subprime mortgage or not. When the \nhouse next to ours gets boarded up, it affects the value of our \nproperty, too, and how safe we feel walking around our neighborhood at \nnight. When a neighbor of ours has to declare bankruptcy and is forever \nsaddled with debt they cannot pay, they shop less at stores and \npurchase fewer of the services our community offers, and that hurts our \ncommunity's bottom line.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr., reminded us that ``we are all tied into a \nsingle garment of destiny,'' that ``we cannot walk alone.'' This is a \ncrisis we are all in together. There is no reason why we can't all work \ntogether to end it. That is why I am proud of the effort of Chairman \nDodd and Ranking Member Shelby, and I am proud to support this bill. I \nhope next week we will pass it, move it on to the House, and get some \nreal relief not only for American families, and not only to preserve \nthe concept of home, but also to be able to deal with the very core of \nwhat is the economic challenge presently before the Nation and what \nwill be our challenge if we do not act in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, certain dates on the calendar carry special \nmeaning. These are great and glorious days that are given to devoted \nreverence and are a cause for recognition and adoration. Thanksgiving, \nthe Fourth of July, and New Year's Eve are a few dates that come \nimmediately to mind. Another one that comes to mind is June 20--the day \nwe celebrate as West Virginia Day.\n  Friday will be June 20. All over the world, it will be June 20, which \nmeans that all over the world, it will be West Virginia Day. And what a \ngreat and glorious day it will be.\n  It was on June 20, 1863, that West Virginia became the 35th State of \nthe Union. The State proudly adopted as its motto the phrase, ``Montani \nsemper liberi,'' which means, ``Mountaineers are always free.''\n  This was a most appropriate motto for a State born in the middle of \nthe greatest struggle for freedom and liberty in American history--the \nCivil War. And West Virginians have always strived to live up to our \nState motto.\n  West Virginia workers were in the forefront of the historic labor \nstruggles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that sought an end \nto the exploitation and oppression of American workers that had \naccompanied the Industrial Revolution. In 1877, the Nation's first \ngeneral strike began among the railroad workers and citizens of \nMartinsburg, WV, after the railroad tycoons repeatedly lowered wages.\n  Seeking to end the industrial autocracy that had engulfed the State \nwith the opening of the coal fields in the 1880s, West Virginia coal \nminers engaged in a series of conflicts now recognized as the West \nVirginia Mine Wars, including the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek Strike, the \nBattle of Matewan, and the Miners' March on Logan. These struggles, \nwrites coal-field historian David Corbin, must be viewed in the same \nperspective as Americans see Lexington and Gettysburg, not just as \nisolated incidents in the tragic spilling of blood but ``as symbolic \nmoment[s] in a larger, broader and continuing historical struggle . . . \nthe struggle for freedom and liberty.''\n  In his book, ``The West Virginia Mine Wars: An Anthology'', Corbin \ncompared the West Virginia miners' struggle for unionization to the \ncivil rights movement of the 1960s. ``Both movements,'' he writes, \n``are stories of oppressed, exploited people fighting for dignity, \nself-respect, human rights and freedom.''\n  This analogy to the civil rights movement is a good one because West \nVirginia has also played an important role in the quest of African \nAmericans for liberty and equality. For one thing, West Virginia has \nbeen the site of some of the important events in African-American \nhistory. Prior to the Civil War, John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry \nprefigured West Virginia's breakaway from the slaveholding Confederacy \ninto full statehood. Harpers Ferry later served as the setting for the \nsecond meeting of the Niagara Movement, a meeting that led to the \nformation of the NAACP.\n  Individual West Virginians have played important roles in this \nhistoric struggle. Author and abolitionist Martin Delany, with \nFrederick Douglass, edited the North Star newspaper, the leading \nabolitionist newspaper in the country. J.R.Clifford, along with his \ncolleague, W.E.B. DuBois, was one of the founders of the Niagara \nMovement in 1905. Rev. Leon Sullivan was a civil rights activist who \nwrote the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct for U.S. businesses \noperating in South Africa under apartheid.\n  Carter G. Woodson, Booker T. Washington, and John Warren Davis were \nall famous African-American educators who occupy important places in \nAmerican history and culture and played important roles in furthering \nthe development of our free society.\n  Furthermore, West Virginians have played an important role in the \nAmerican movement toward religious freedom. The most noticeable example \nof this effort came in the historic 1960 Democratic Party Presidential \nprimary--the political contest that paved the way for America's first \nCatholic President. In 1960, West Virginia was an overwhelmingly \nProtestant State, and religion became the ``burning issue'' of the \ncontest because, if Senator John F. Kennedy, who was Catholic, defeated \nhis only opponent, Senator Hubert Humphrey, who was a\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nProtestant, it would show that religion was no longer a defeating \nhandicap in a Presidential contest. Kennedy won that primary by a \nsubstantial margin, and, as a result, as Kennedy stated the day after \nwinning the primary, the religious issue was ``buried . . . in the soil \nof West Virginia.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud of my State. I love its beauty, its \nculture, and its history. Foremost, I have always appreciated its kind, \ngood, and generous people and the way they have retained what I call \nthe ``old values''--faith in God, love of country, family, honesty, \ndecency, and integrity. And a leading value of the people of West \nVirginia, as I have tried to show, has been our motto, ``Mountaineers \nare always free.''\n  Happy birthday West Virginia.\n  May God always bless you, and keep you free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5820-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FLOODING IN ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, President Bush is in Iowa today to see \nfirst-hand some of the devastation that more than a week of severe \nflooding has inflicted on that State.\n  It is the President's first visit to the Midwest since the floods \nbegan more than a week ago.\n  Midwesterners appreciate the President's visit to our region. These \nfloods are happening in our States, but they are a national disaster.\n  The President's visit to Iowa today gives us some reassurance that \nthe Federal Government will help our region through this crisis.\n  As the President visits Iowa today, I hope he looks across the river \nto my State of Illinois.\n  Floods don't stop at State lines.\n  The floodwaters are receding now in Iowa; they are rising in \nIllinois. Levees are breaking and farmland and towns along our side of \nthe Mississippi are being swallowed up by the river now.\n  The damage in Iowa has been staggering and heartbreaking , and we \npray for our neighbors' safety and well-being.\n  But the entire Midwest is reeling from weeks of flooding and \ntornadoes--from Minnesota to Kansas and everywhere in between; \nWisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and, of course, Illinois.\n  We know from the great flood that devastated the Midwest in 1993 and, \nmore recently, from Hurricane Katrina, that the losses from this chain \nof weather-related disasters will be more than our States and citizens \nalone can shoulder.\n  We also know that, in times of crisis, Americans have always come \ntogether to help those in need. We are counting on that American \ntradition of cooperation now.\n  My colleagues and I whose States have borne the brunt of these floods \nappreciate greatly the support and offers of cooperation we have \nreceived from Senator Landrieu and others whose States have also \nsuffered major natural disasters.\n  I hope that President Bush and others are equally committed to \nrebuilding the Midwest, not just through disaster relief but by \nstrengthening levees, rebuilding houses, providing loans to small \nbusinesses, or helping farmers who have lost an entire season of crops.\n  As we speak, the floodwaters are still rising--in Iowa in Missouri, \nand in my State of Illinois--breaking levees, leaving people without \nrunning water, and leaving whole towns submerged.\n  Yesterday, two more levees broke on the Illinois-Iowa border near \nQuincy, flooding thousands of acres of farmland and forcing people to \nleave their homes. That brings the total number of broken levees in \nIllinois to nine as a result of the flooding.\n  In Galesburg, residents are on boil order and are in danger of losing \ntheir access to running water.\n  In Lawrenceville, where the floodwaters from earlier storms are \nfinally receding, over 10,000 people have been without running water \nfor more than a week. We will not forget our neighbors on the east side \nof the State, where it all began earlier this month.\n  Over 500 homes have been affected in Machesney Park, a small \ncommunity in Winnebago County without a public works department and \nwithout trucks or any other equipment to help with the clean-up \nefforts.\n  My heart goes out to everyone affected by the floods, especially \nthose who have watched their homes and livelihoods disappear under \nmuddy waters.\n  But as the waters keep rising, the people of Illinois continue to \nhumble and inspire me.\n  Illinoisans continue to work day and night to prepare for the worst. \nIn cities and towns all along the Mississippi, people have spent the \nlast week filling sandbags and fortifying levees. This is difficult \nwork, often backbreaking, but as hard as it's been on the body, it \nhasn't broken people's spirits.\n  Day after day they have shown up--residents, volunteers, emergency \nworkers, members of the Illinois National Guard. It is not easy to \nstand your ground in the face of a force as powerful as the \nMississippi, but these folks have done just that. Their resolve and \ndetermination show an amazing spirit at work. It is something Senator \nObama and I had a chance to see for ourselves when we were in Quincy \nand Grafton last week. It is a sight to behold.\n  I also commend FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers.

MILLER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a well-respected \nKentuckian, Mr. Clarence L. Miller. Throughout his life, Mr. Miller has \ncontributed immensely to our Commonwealth and Nation.\n  Recently the Sentinel-News in Shelbyville, Kentucky, published a \nstory about Mr. Miller. The story summarizes the extraordinary life he \nled, while paying tribute to him as a remarkable Kentuckian. Throughout \nhis career as a public servant, Mr. Miller has worked hard to give back \nto the State and Nation that he loves so dearly.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Clarence L. Miller as a \ntrue patriot and Kentuckian whose legacy will forever be remembered, \nand I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel-News, April 30, 2008]\n\n     Clarence L. Miller: Farmer, Administrator, Diplomat, Raconteur\n\n                        (By BG Ron Van Stockum)\n\n       I called on Clarence Miller recently to add my appreciation \n     to that of his many other friends for his generosity in \n     donating his farm to Shelbyville. In our informal \n     conversation it became apparent that his story needed to be \n     recorded and reported.\n       Accordingly, a few days later, my son Reggie invited him to \n     Allen Dale where he taped as oral history an extended audio/\n     visual interview. My column today will constitute an \n     abbreviated story of Clarence Miller's life, providing \n     information additional to that contained in Gayle Deaton's \n     excellent article in an issue of last year's Sentinel-News.\n       Clarence Miller was born in Louisville in 1912. His father, \n     Pleasant Green Miller, always called ``P. Green'' (1871-\n     1968), born in Estill County, was employed as a federal \n     whisky inspector or ``whiskey gauger.'' His responsibilities, \n     within the Department of the Treasury, included the recording \n     of whiskey production and assuring that the distillers paid \n     the proper federal tax on alcohol. With the onset of World \n     War I, distillation was dramatically curtailed in order to \n     preserve grain. His job disestablished, he took his family to \n     Florida where he set out a citrus grove.\n\n\n              eighteenth amendment: prohibition (1920-33)\n\n       Before the production of whisky could be fully restored, \n     National Prohibition was established by means of the \n     Eighteenth Amendment, with Kentucky being the third state to \n     ratify it. Ratification was certified on 29 January 1919 and \n     on 28 October the Volstead Act was passed, defining \n     ``intoxicating\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\n     beverage'' as one containing greater than one-half of one \n     percent alcohol. This act went into effect on 29 January \n     1920, along with the Eighteenth Amendment. President Hoover \n     called Prohibition a ``noble experiment,'' but others used \n     stronger words. Clarence described the effect of Prohibition \n     on the distilleries as ``confiscatory.'' They held millions \n     of gallons of whiskey in storage, but, except for a \n     controlled trickle for ``medicinal'' purposes, were not \n     allowed to sell it.\n       Even moderate imbibers needed to adjust. While I do not \n     recall alcohol being served by my parents in Seattle, \n     Washington, I do remember my mother sending me out on the \n     lawn to pick dandelions for wine. The process she used is \n     unknown, but it is possible today to learn all that is \n     necessary by ``googling'' ``dandelion wine.''\n       P. Green Miller and many other federal agents, were called \n     back to the Treasury Department to enforce the new law. In \n     view of its unpopularity, affecting so many special interests \n     and tastes, this was a formidable task. In 1923, he became \n     Division Chief for Enforcement of Prohibition for the states \n     of Kentucky and Tennessee, with offices in Louisville and \n     Memphis. Later, he spent a good deal of time on the east \n     coast, in New York, Baltimore and Boston, trying to \n     eliminate, or at least minimize, the illegal smuggling by \n     high-speed cutters, called ``rum runners,'' which picked up \n     whisky from vessels lying beyond the territorial limits. He \n     also was involved in the attempt to break up the illegal \n     activities of the most powerful and infamous of all \n     bootleggers, Al Capone, who operated out of Chicago.\n\n\n          repeal of prohibition--twenty-first amendment (1933)\n\n       On 23 March 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, after \n     signing into law an amendment to the Volstead Act, allowing \n     the manufacture and sale of ``3.2 beer'' and light wines, is \n     reported to have remarked ``Now let's all have a beer.'' The \n     Eighteenth Amendment, itself, was repealed later with \n     ratification of the Twenty-first amendment on 5 December \n     1933. P. Green Miller returned to farming.\n\n\n                        young clarence l. miller\n\n       Meanwhile, on 1 January 1925, when Clarence was 12 years \n     old, the Miller family purchased Red Orchard Farm and \n     established residence there, although Clarence's father was \n     still spending most of his time elsewhere discharging his \n     enforcement responsibilities. The farm, originally 119 acres, \n     now constitutes 130 acres. Clarence helped his mother with \n     the farm, entering Shelbyville High School where he graduated \n     with the class of 1932. A schoolmate of his was Ben McMakin, \n     the subject of one of last year's columns, who died as a \n     Marine prisoner of war in 1945. ``Ben was president of our \n     class one year, and I the next.'' He then spent two years at \n     University of Kentucky with the intent of studying law, but \n     instead returned to Shelbyville.\n\n\n                        moving up in agriculture\n\n       Here, he was employed with the Agriculture Adjustment \n     Administration (AAA), later called the Commodity \n     Stabilization Service (CSS). He started literally from the \n     ground up, measuring tobacco plantings to assure compliance \n     with the regulations. In 1947 he married his high school \n     sweetheart, Katherine Barrickman, always called ``Toddy.'' \n     The daughter of a prominent Shelbyville lawyer and County \n     Attorney, she was an accomplished competitive golfer, being \n     local women's champion for 13 straight years. In 1953 \n     Clarence became chairman of the state CSS and a year later \n     went to Washington DC as national Director of the Tobacco \n     Division of the same agency. In 1956, he became Associate \n     Administrator of the national CSS. In 1959 and 1960, the \n     final two years of the Eisenhower administration, he served \n     as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and \n     Foreign Agriculture, working directly under Secretary Ezra \n     Taft Benson, Agricultural Attache in Madrid.\n       From 1961 to 1969 he was back in Shelbyville, operating his \n     farm and occupying a position in public relations with the \n     Kentucky Farm Bureau. In 1970 he was appointed under the \n     Nixon administration as Agricultural Attache in Spain, \n     serving until 1976, initially under his good friend, \n     Ambassador Robert C. Hill. It was during this period that \n     several of his friends from Shelbyville were his guests at \n     the Embassy in Madrid. I remember my fellow tennis player, \n     the late Guy Lea, one of his guests, remarking about \n     Clarence's hospitality when he and his wife visited Spain.\n\n\n                             world traveler\n\n       Despite undergoing double artery by-pass surgery and \n     replacement of the aortic valve in 1998, the following year \n     he took a trip to Singapore. There are few countries he has \n     not visited. He has traveled around the world, rounded both \n     Africa and South America by ship, and visited Greenland and \n     Antarctica. Nevertheless, he has never lost touch with his \n     home town and his lifetime of public service to his community \n     and to his country has culminated in the most altruistic act \n     of all: the gift to his home town of Red Orchard Farm.\n       Note: It is encouraging to report that Clarence Miller \n     continues to be hale and hearty, strong of voice, forceful in \n     expression and vitally concerned about public affairs. He \n     looks back upon his long life with a feeling of \n     accomplishment: ``It has been my good fortune to have been in \n     the right place at the right time with the right \n     credentials.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5821-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5821-S5822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CAPTURE ARREST AND TRANSPORT CHARGED FUGITIVES ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I \nrecently introduced called the Capture Arrest and Transport Charged--\nCATCH--Fugitives Act of 2008. I am pleased that Senator Dole has joined \nme as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The CATCH Fugitives Act addresses three important problems that \nundercut State and local efforts to catch fugitives. First, State and \nlocal law enforcement authorities have insufficient resources for \nidentifying and arresting fugitives. Second, even when fugitives are \narrested, they may not be prosecuted because of the high cost of \nextradition. Third, when fugitives flee across State lines, they \nfrequently escape detection because law enforcement officers lack \ncomplete information about warrants issued in other States. Fewer than \nhalf of all outstanding felony warrants have been entered into the \nnationwide database that alerts other law enforcement officials that a \nperson is wanted.\n  The act addresses these three problems by providing assistance to \nState and local law enforcement agencies through the U.S. Marshals \nService to help them identify fugitives and transport them from one \nState to another for prosecution. It also creates grant programs that \nwill encourage States to share information about warrants with each \nother and help them pay for the cost of additional extraditions.\n  This legislation is supported by Illinois Attorney General Lisa \nMadigan, Cook County State's Attorney Richard A. Devine, Cook County \nSheriff Thomas Dart, City of Chicago Police Superintendent Jody P. \nWeis, Peoria State's Attorney Kevin Lyons, the Illinois Association of \nChiefs of Police, and the Illinois Sheriffs' Association.\n  Nationwide, there are an estimated 2.8 million to 3.2 million \noutstanding warrants for the arrest of persons charged with felony \ncrimes, and the number is growing. Fugitives often commit additional \ncrimes while they are at-large. However, searching for and apprehending \nthem is costly. Increasing the resources available for conducting \nfugitive investigations would increase the number of fugitives who are \narrested, brought to trial for previous crimes, and prevented from \ncommitting new crimes.\n  The Marshals Service plays an integral role in the apprehension of \nfugitives and has a long history of providing assistance and expertise \nto other law enforcement agencies in support of fugitive \ninvestigations. Pursuant to the Presidential Threat Protection Act of \n2000, the Marshals Service created its Regional Fugitive Task Force \nprogram. The task forces combine the efforts and resources of Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement agencies as they work to locate and \napprehend fugitives. Between 2002 and 2006, the Marshals Service \nestablished task forces in six regions of the country. Since their \ninception, these six task forces have arrested approximately 90,000 \nFederal and State felony fugitives, contributing to a significant \nincrease in the number of fugitive arrests in those regions. The \nMarshals Service has developed a plan to establish 12 additional task \nforces--enough to serve the rest of the country--but since 2006 it has \nnot received the resources needed to implement this plan.\n  The CATCH Fugitives act increases the authorization for the Regional \nFugitive Task Force program from $10 million under current law to $50 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2009-2012 and $25 million for each of \nfiscal years 2013-2015, in order to fully fund the existing task forces \nand add new ones that serve the remaining parts of the country.\n  In addition to strengthening fugitive-hunting capacity in general, \nthe act also tackles the problem of capturing out-of-State fugitives \nand extraditing them for prosecution. Since 1967, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation has operated the National Crime Information Center, NCIC, \nwhich administers a database containing criminal history information \nfrom the Federal Government and the States, including outstanding \narrest warrants. The NCIC database is designed to allow a law \nenforcement officer who stops a person in one State to be made aware of \nany outstanding warrants for that person\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nissued in another State. The database contains approximately 1.3 \nmillion felony and misdemeanor warrants, but it is missing more than \nhalf of the Nation's 2.8 million to 3.2 million felony warrants, \nincluding hundreds of thousands of warrants for the arrest of the \npeople accused of committing violent crimes.\n  A State's failure to enter all of its warrants into the NCIC database \nenables fugitives to escape arrest even when they are stopped by an \nofficer in another State. Many such fugitives go on to commit \nadditional crimes. In addition, they pose a danger to the officers who \nencounter them but have no knowledge of their pending charges and \nrecord of fleeing law enforcement authorities.\n  Let me give an example from an investigative series of articles that \nappeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch earlier this year. On March 21, \n2001, Eloy Williams was charged with the rape of a college student in \nFlorida. Florida authorities issued a warrant for his arrest but did \nnot enter it into the NCIC database. On July 16, 2001, Williams skipped \na hearing in Florida on a cocaine trafficking charge. Florida \nauthorities issued a warrant for his arrest for failure to appear on \nthat charge but again did not enter the warrant into the NCIC database. \nOn April 11, 2002, Williams was stopped by a police officer in Decatur, \nGA. The officer found no record of the Florida warrants in the NCIC \nsystem and Williams was released the next day. On July 25, 2002, \nWilliams was arrested in Decatur for speeding. Again, the police \nofficer found no record of his Florida warrants so Williams was \nreleased the next day. On October 9, 2002, Williams raped and robbed a \n14-year-old girl while she was walking home from school. In May and \nJune of 2003, Williams raped four women in the Decatur and Lithonia, \nGA, areas. On June 12, 2003, officers finally tracked Williams down and \narrested him. He confessed to all six of these rapes. The five rapes \ncommitted between October 2002 and June 2003 could have been prevented \nif the outstanding Florida warrants had been entered into the NCIC \nsystem. The officers who stopped Williams in April and July of 2002 \nwould have learned of the warrants and made him available to Florida \nfor extradition. If extradited, he would not have been in a position to \ncommit those five rapes.\n  Improving the completeness of the warrant records in the NCIC \ndatabase would enable law enforcement officers to identify and arrest a \nlarger number of fugitives and would improve the safety of our \nofficers. However, the challenge does not end there. Even if a fugitive \nis arrested, extraditing that fugitive back to the State that issued \nthe warrant can be costly. Law enforcement agencies often lack the \nresources to pay for the cost of transporting fugitives. They \nfrequently choose to forego prosecution, allowing fugitives to evade \njustice and commit new crimes. Reducing the cost of extradition would \nincrease the number of prosecutions.\n  Let me give you another example from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nseries. In the fall of 1999, Virginia law enforcement authorities \nissued two felony warrants for the arrest of Felipe Fowlkes. Fowlkes \nhad a record of criminal convictions that spanned two decades and \nincluded convictions for crimes ranging from burglary to sexual \nmisconduct. In April 2000, Fowlkes learned of the warrants and turned \nhimself in to the local police in Schenectady, NY. The Virginia \nauthorities, however, refused to retrieve him for prosecution. Three \nweeks later, Fowlkes attempted to rob a woman and was arrested. He was \nconvicted and sentenced to prison time. In July 2003, 6 weeks after his \nrelease, Fowlkes attempted to sexually assault a woman. Hours later on \nthe same day, he lured a 15-year-old girl behind a school and raped \nher. The 2000 attempted robbery and 2003 rape might have been prevented \nif the Virginia authorities had extradited Fowlkes in 2000.\n  The CATCH Fugitives Act has three provisions that address the twin \nchallenges of identifying fugitives who have crossed State lines and \nextraditing them for prosecution. First, it includes a major grant \nprogram that offers States and local governments significant funding \nfor extraditions, but builds in strong incentives to improve the entry \nof warrants into the NCIC database. It authorizes $50 million in grants \nto States for each of fiscal years 2009-2015 to help cover the costs of \nextraditing additional numbers of fugitives from one State to another, \nbut it conditions eligibility for grants on improved performance in \nentering warrant records into NCIC. Any State or unit of local \ngovernment is eligible for an extradition grant during the first 3 \nyears after enactment. However, a State or unit of local government \nwould lose its eligibility if after 3 years it is still transmitting \nless than 50 percent of its warrants to NCIC; after 5 years it is \ntransmitting less than 70 percent of its warrants to NCIC; or after 7 \nyears it is transmitting less than 90 percent of its warrants to NCIC.\n  Second, to help States and local governments improve their \nperformance in submitting warrants to NCIC, the CATCH Fugitives Act \nauthorizes $10 million for each of fiscal years 2009-2013 for grants to \nState and local governments to improve their capacity, infrastructure \nand processes for transmitting warrants to NCIC.\n  Third, in order to help States and local governments further reduce \nthe cost of extraditing fugitives between States, the Act directs the \nMarshals Service to expand its Justice Prisoner and Alien \nTransportation Service, JPATS--currently used for transporting \ndetainees and inmates--and make it available for fugitive transports \nrequested by States and local governments that participate in a \nRegional Fugitive Task Force. The act authorizes $2 million for each of \nfiscal years 2009-2015 for this purpose.\n  In summary, the CATCH Fugitives Act addresses serious problems that \ninterfere with law enforcement efforts to bring fugitives to justice. \nIt increases fugitive-hunting capacity nationwide. It provides \nresources and incentives for States to make information about \noutstanding warrants available to other States so that law enforcement \nagencies in one State can recognize when a fugitive from another State \nis in their grasp. And, it provides assistance that will reduce the \ncost of extraditing such fugitives from one State to another for \nprosecution. I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5822-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5822-S5823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SYMQUEST\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

One would have to know Larry \nSudbay to realize that what he makes seem easy can be a Herculean task \nfor most people.\n  The other cofounder is Pat Robins of Burlington. I was privileged to \nnot only be a classmate of Pat's at St. Michael's College, but to have \nthe further privilege of maintaining our friendship for the past 50 \nyears.\n  Vermont is a small State with much to make us proud. People like \nLarry Subday and Pat Robins make our State even better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Free Press be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, June 2, 2008]\n\n                People, Paper and Pixels Propel SymQuest\n\n                         (By Joel Banner Baird)\n\n       South Burlington.--Behind thick glass, like a motionless \n     aquarium in the company's lobby, the SymQuest Group Inc. \n     server room might hold the visitor's interest for a minute or \n     two, tops.\n       Even CEO and co-founder Larry Sudbay can be easily \n     distracted from the racks of hardware and colorful cabling--\n     especially when one of his 152 employees walks by.\n       In this hardware-and-software company, everyone seems to be \n     on a first-name basis; people are the moving parts at \n     SymQuest. On May 21, Gov. Jim Douglas honored the 12-year-old \n     company as the recipient of this year's winner of Vermont's \n     top business accolade: the Deane C. Davis Award, citing \n     SymQuest for its outstanding commitments to work environment \n     and community--and for its vitality.\n       Last week, Sudbay, 51, made it sound simple.\n       He described the privately held, office systems management \n     firm's steady, double-digit growth as ``fun momentum.''\n       In a nutshell, he said, his goal in management ``is to \n     allow our employees to thrive, and to create raving fans.''\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n       The company's 3,000 customers must be right: Sudbay \n     predicts this fiscal year's sales to more than quadruple the \n     $9 million SymQuest earned in 1997.\n       There's still room for expansion at the company's 40,000-\n     square-feet headquarters on Community Drive. But a cautionary \n     history looms, as well: SymQuest is housed in the footprint \n     of now-extinct computer giant Digital Equipment Corp.\n       Sudbay and SymQuest co-founder Pat Robins sidestepped the \n     fragile dot-com bubble of the past decade by integrating \n     computer systems development with the lower-tech standbys of \n     office work flow: copiers and printers.\n       ``The Jetsons meet the Flintstones here,'' Sudbay quipped.\n       Approximately 20 percent of the company's revenues come \n     from toner shipments and service contracts, he added.\n       SymQuest continually researches ways to better bridge the \n     gap between pixels and paper.\n       Sudbay returns again and again to a fundamental question: \n     how does information--often an intangible product--move \n     through a business? And how is it thwarted?\n       His engineers, sales reps and technicians came up with a \n     winning strategy: maximize customers' uptime with secure, \n     off-site monitoring, matched with prompt, people-to-people \n     service.\n       Rob Bromee, who directs SymQuest's support center, said the \n     company's proprietary ``Sentinel'' devices allow his team to \n     diagnose and even predict failures on clients' computers and \n     networks.\n       ``This is not just patch management,'' he said. ``We're \n     listening. We like to go back upstream from the problem, to \n     see what's causing it.''\n       Remote monitoring now extends to printers and copiers, as \n     well. SymQuest can read meters and gauge maintenance needs; \n     customers receive toner shipments days before they're needed.\n       In theory, a company in Bangkok could choose to delegate \n     its IT management to SymQuest. For Sudbay, a 1979 graduate of \n     University of Vermont, the vision remains in New England: \n     Regional is beautiful.\n       ``Keeping everyone within two hours is our goal,'' he said. \n     ``Local is too small; regional provides us with the economy \n     of scale for purchasing similar to big Web and Wall Street \n     companies.\n       ``This isn't India,'' he continued. ``We're based in the \n     same time zone as our customers. If they need a physical \n     presence, we're able to put our capes on.''\n       Sudbay said a tighter network of offices also allows \n     employees to develop ties to their communities. Plaques on \n     the walls at the South Burlington headquarters laud \n     volunteers and charity fundraisers; firefighters, Little \n     League coaches and Penguin Plungers.\n       The Deane C. Davis Award also cited SymQuest's direct \n     outreach of cyber-expertise.\n       In February, following a competitive grant process, \n     SymQuest awarded a ``$25,000 Office Makeover'' to a drug \n     treatment and youth center near its Plattsburgh office. \n     Another makeover is under way to upgrade networking at a \n     mental illness center in Keene, N.H.\n       Neighborliness, Sudbay said, is essential to good business.\n       ``Simply put, we're looking for mutually profitable, long-\n     term relationships with customers,'' he said. ``The old adage \n     where good guys finish last? Well, it's bogus. Good things \n     happen to good people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5823-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING TIM RUSSERT\n\n  Mr. DODD.

And I would like to add my voice to the chorus of those \nwho have sung his praises these sad past several days.\n  Tim Russert was a force in American politics--and a force for \nintegrity in our media. For 17 years, millions of Americans have looked \nto Tim on Sunday mornings for his insight into our political process. \nFrom his days serving as an aide to our former colleague from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, through every minute of his remarkable tenure at NBC, \nTim never lost his enthusiasm for vibrant but respectful political \ndiscourse. It was in so many ways his lifeblood.\n  Like few others, Tim understood the role politics played not just in \nthe media--but in our daily lives. He saw politics for what it was--not \na fight among partisans, but rather the medium in which the diversity \nof views and values in our society are arbitrated to a national \nconclusion.\n  In that sense, under Tim's stewardship, ``Meet the Press'' became the \npremier forum for showcasing the fundamentally decent side of politics \nthat is almost entirely lost today--where people of very different \nviews, backgrounds and perspectives, could come together to debate \ntheir differences respectfully and constructively.\n  Indeed, one saw that in Tim's approach to matters of faith--where his \nown views and values were very formidable indeed. A year ago, Senator \nBrownback and I shared the stage with Tim at Boston College, where we \neach talked about our shared Catholic faith and the role the Church \nplayed in our lives, shaping our politics and our society. With all the \ncontroversy around faith in politics over the last several years, some \nwondered about the fireworks that could have ensued.\n  But what Tim, a practicing Catholic, wanted was not two Senators \ndelivering sermons, if you will--about how to ``use'' faith as a \npolitical weapon. Rather, as someone who once said that the nuns in \nCatholic school, ``taught me to read and write, but also how to tell \nright from wrong,'' Tim wanted us to talk about our formative \nexperiences as Catholics. He wanted to engage us in a robust \nconversation about all that we shared--even in areas we vigorously \ndisagreed with one another.\n  To be sure, in that sense, Tim was very much doing God's work each \nand every Sunday morning.\n  I was a guest on ``Meet the Press'' many, many times over Tim's years \nhosting the program. He was without question the most tenacious \nquestioner I have ever known. Never once did I feel like Tim let me off \neasy. Never once did I feel he was being unfair or trying to score \npoints. Every time I was on, most recently just a few weeks ago, he \npressed me, pushed me, poked and prodded me as he did thousands of \nguests.\n  We were all the same in his eyes--no matter how many years we had \nbeen in public life, no matter how accomplished we were. He simply \nwanted to get at the truth--and if you didn't give it to him, Tim made \nsure that the whole world would know.\n  Certainly, there are many guests over the years who ``bombed'' on \n``Meet the Press.'' One of the things I loved about Tim was that while \nhe might let you embarrass yourself on national television, he would \nnever embarrass you.\n  Part of that was his fundamental decency--but so, too, was it the \nspecial appreciation Tim had for his guests, having been on the other \nside himself, walking these very halls on behalf of our departed \ncolleague from New York. Tim understood as well as anyone what those of \nus in public life did for a living--and I wish more in his profession \nwere afforded his perspective.\n  Of course, Tim appreciated nothing more than family. Every time I saw \nTim, he always wanted to know how your family was doing. Indeed, for \nall of his famously aggressive journalistic acumen, it is impossible to \nnot mention the other side of that gregarious personality--the warmth \nand generosity. When I was on ``Meet the Press'' last year, Tim took \nthe time after our interview to jump around and dance with my two young \ndaughters. The twinkle in his eye was unmistakable when you talked \nfamily with Tim.\n  Lastly, I want to say a word about one of Tim's greatest legacies, \nand that is fatherhood--his contributions to what being a father means \nin America. His call to our responsibilities as fathers and the \ndifference an active, involved, caring father can make in a child's \nlife will be one of Tim's most significant legacies.\n  My colleagues know I have spoken many times on this floor about what \nmy father meant to me--how more than anything or anyone else, it was my \nfather's example that compelled me into public service.\n  Tim and I shared that bond, I think. Indeed, we both wrote books \nabout our fathers--I having published long lost letters from my father \nas a prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials, Tim writing two books, \nincluding one about the lessons he learned from his father, ``Big \nRuss'' in Buffalo.\n  At a time when some debate the condition of the American family, \nTim's meditations on fatherhood--on the wisdom and character passed \ndown by his father--struck a deep, resonant chord.\n  It was one of the saddest ironies of all that his next broadcast \nwould have been on Father's Day. But perhaps it was meant to be that \nway--remembering Tim on a day in which we were all celebrating our \nfathers.\n  Jackie and I send our deepest sympathies to Maureen, Luke, Big Russ, \nand the rest of the Russert family. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem--Tim will be dearly missed.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5824-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5824-S5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, earlier this week, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, now numbering over 1,000, \nare heartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo.\nsenate.gov to the Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record today's letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Let us see if our representatives truly represent us or \n     not. Or are they giving in to the environmental lobbyists? I \n     believe the question of drilling here at home for oil and \n     natural gas should be put on a nationwide ballot and then \n     Congress should push forward with the outcome of that result. \n     Are we really living in a democracy or not? I believe the \n     majority of Americans approve of drilling here for oil and \n     natural gas. If our representatives truly represented us, \n     that would have been happening by now.\n     Steven.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: The only way to stop the rise in oil \n     prices is to start drilling in our own country. The special \n     interest environmental groups run Congress to the detriment \n     of the American people and the economy.\n       We can't drill off the coast of Florida, but the Chinese \n     can; and everybody knows how careful the Chinese are when it \n     comes to the environment. We have huge supplies of natural \n     gas and oil right here in our own country but a few so-called \n     environmental whack jobs are being allowed to destroy our \n     economy and our country.\n           Sincerely,\n     George.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not have an energy story. I simply want to thank Mr. \n     Crapo and ALL of the folks that help him in the everyday part \n     of the legislature business.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peggy, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Crapo, I am a resident of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; \n     taxpayer and voter. Can you please explain to me why the \n     Republican Congress did nothing to confront this issue 4 \n     years ago when they controlled all three branches of the \n     government? You knew then that there was an energy crisis and \n     that it would get worse. yet no proactive legislation was \n     passed to confront the issue or to increase production. . . . \n     why?\n       Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello Senator and thanks for your efforts. You asked that I \n     share my story on how the high gas prices have affected my \n     life. I am sure my story is not nearly as poor as some may \n     be. I am thankful to have a stay-at-home eBay job. However, \n     even I wonder how others do it when once a week I pay $50 \n     towards a gas tank full to operate my car and I do not even \n     hardly go anywhere! I used to pay this much all month, now I \n     pay it once a week. My wages are not going up. I have an \n     energy-efficient mini-van.\n       It has mostly affected my family, however, because my 5 \n     children, 7 years and younger, can no longer feel free to \n     visit their dying grandmother and grandfather, just 3.5 hours \n     away. It used to cost just $20 in gas for a visit there and \n     back, not a big deal. Now it costs $60. Instead of doing this \n     a couple times a month for $30-40, I can now only do it once \n     every 1.5-2 months for $60. Grandma and Grandpa do not come \n     visit us anymore but maybe once every 6 months. They used to \n     come once a month. Our fun outings into the country for \n     enjoyment and to get away from the hectic busy pace of our \n     lives. They simply do not happen anymore. I take the stroller \n     down the bike path. Boring and depressing.\n       It is depressing to see such price gouging and why? Is it \n     because of the war? Cannot the government regulate price \n     gougers in such a time of war and economic depression with \n     the housing slump and all? It would be nice to see someone \n     step up to bat. Other families who drive to work every day \n     feel it the most. It makes for all our friends to have sad \n     moods.\n       Thanks for your time.\n     Marianne.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family and I are low middle income and, with the price \n     of fuel/groceries, we have had to choose our fuel to get to \n     work or food. Both my husband and I have been eating less to \n     ensure that our children are well fed, among other cuts in \n     our life. I am extremely worried that if it continues we just \n     won't be able to pay our bills too. We need to be utilizing \n     our own resources within our country! Thanks, Jennifer\n       This makes good sense to consider for all our ``Political \n     Leaders'' [to watch this video] . . . let's get something \n     positive going. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPch2k63uj4\n     Dan, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I watched part of a program on PBS where communities are \n     pooling together and buying wind mills to power their towns, \n     and the people in the communities profited from the projects \n     through little or no cost for power. Why can't we get \n     something started like that in Idaho? If for no other reason, \n     it would give the wind a reason to stop blowing.\n       We could invest the city/county/tax money in wind farm \n     projects--use money to make and save money for the \n     communities. If we could keep the shyster politicians away \n     from the cash.\n       Another energy idea would be to allow the carburetors for \n     automobiles to be revised for better gas mileage. That would \n     be a very simple solution. If an 80,000 pound semi and \n     trailer can get 8 miles per gallon, a car should be able to \n     get at least 100. That would substantially reduce the amount \n     of fuel consumed.\n     Kathy, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I am the Executive Director of the \n     Eastern Idaho Community Action Partnership in Idaho Falls \n     which serves 9 eastern Idaho counties. One of our programs is \n     the LIHEAP program which provides one time help with energy \n     bills. The program concluded at the end of March. There is a \n     component of LIHEAP called LIHEAP Crisis that provides \n     limited help outside of the normal Energy Assistance \n     schedule. Since the end of March, we have received requests \n     for help from families we have never seen before. Families \n     must meet the same income criterion that is required for the \n     standard LIHEAP program. What this tells us is that families \n     have been able to make due until now, but because of high \n     fuel costs and higher grocery prices, they are now not able \n     to meet all of their obligations. We are also seeing more \n     requests for food boxes than in previous years.\n       I hope this is helpful for you.\n     Russ, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I sell heavy equipment and these fuel prices are doing more \n     than pinching family budgets, although they are doing that \n     too. Almost every day I have a contractor tell of a job that \n     got put on hold or cancelled due to the high price of moving \n     dirt. Most of the increase in excavating prices is directly \n     related to diesel. These fuel prices are putting people out \n     of work.\n       What can we do to get Congress off their butts and start \n     drilling oil wells and refining it?\n       Why are we wasting natural gas making electricity, instead \n     of promoting nuclear and hydro?\n       Why are we not pushing diesel? It is cleaner and far more \n     efficient than gasoline.\n     Brent, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Crapo, thanks for your email update on the failure of \n     congress to act concerning higher energy prices. You are all \n     pandering to the environmental wackos. I'm ticked that the \n     Chinese can drill for oil just off our coast lines but we \n     cannot. We need congress to allow oil companies to drill on \n     federal land, especially up in Alaska. We have plenty of our \n     own oil, let's use it and quit depending so much on foreign \n     sources! Yes conservation is good, but we really need \n     increased domestic supply to drive down costs. And we need \n     lower costs NOW before our economy is run into the ground. I \n     can't even afford to fly out of Twin Falls right now because \n     airlines are raising their prices so high, so I have to \n     drive to Boise to catch lower cost flights; I fly a lot \n     for business purposes. But then I have to pay much more in \n     gas to drive from Twin to Boise, so I really do not save \n     all that much . . . but every little bit helps. My vote \n     this Fall, and from here on out will be for whoever will \n     work the hardest on this issue of increasing domestic \n     supply of oil.\n     Ron, Kimberly.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Crapo, I am responding to your request for some more \n     individual perspective on the brunt of the energy crisis. \n     With the cost of gasoline up 40% it directly impacts my \n     pocketbook, not just in driving costs, but everything that I \n     do. The cost of electricity, the cost of food, shipping, \n     everything has gone up. As a small business owner, and \n     employer here in the state of Idaho, it significantly affects \n     me, and my employees. We need to take every step we can to \n     make our country energy independent, relying on people that \n     hate us, and our way of life, for energy is suicide. If it \n     takes opening up areas for exploration of oil, and natural \n     gas I'm for it! Give oil companies incentives and tax breaks \n     for finding, and refining more product. Stop the stranglehold \n     these out of touch clowns have on our nation! Make us once \n     more the strongest nation in the world! We do not need to be \n     the strongest by subjugating other nations, just by being the \n     only nation that can stand on its own!\n       Thank you for your time,\n     Daniel, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: You asked how the energy crisis is \n     affecting me personally. My truck is a 1994 Chevy with 140 \n     thousand miles on it. I was going to buy a new one to replace \n     it. Since the increase in costs for gas and diesel, I can not \n     afford it now so I will just\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\n     continue to repair what I have and drive it less. So this \n     discussion affects many businesses in my area.\n       (1) I will not be spending money at the dealers to buy it.\n       (2) I will not be spending interest at my credit union for \n     the loan.\n       (3) I will not be spending money at the insurance company \n     for the added insurance.\n       (4) I will not be spending money at the parts houses for \n     improved add-ons to the vehicle (tinted windows, bed liner, \n     etc).\n       (5) I am not going to be taking a driving vacation this \n     year, cost too much.\n       (6) I do not think I'll be going on an airplane either cost \n     for tickets is increasing.\n       (7) I wanted to go over to Europe, Italy this year because \n     I have never been there, but now the cost Euro cost is 1.5 \n     times greater so that will not happen.\n       Think of the places in the U.S. you have to spend money to \n     get there. Congress does not realize that this is getting \n     worse every day, a recession is already here and if it \n     continues it will be a depression. The oil is not going to go \n     down. The World can only make 85 million barrels per day. The \n     World wants 86.5 million barrels per day. The world is now \n     out bidding the U.S. for oil supplies. The U.S. has to pay \n     the price to by oil for what the world market sets it at. \n     (Econ 101--supply vs. demand). The U.S. makes 5 million \n     barrels per day--the U.S. uses 21 million barrels per day so \n     we need 16 million barrels per day for imports. These are \n     facts FACTS----does congress get these FACTS!!!! We either \n     get more of our own oil or we continue to pay and pay even \n     more. Please tell them over and over again, THIS PROBLEM IS \n     NOT GOING TO GO AWAY IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE! Please tell your \n     democratic friends to do something and not put there head in \n     the sand.\n       Thanks for asking.\n     John, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a young mother in Meridian, Idaho. I am one of those \n     few who can honestly say that I LOVE my in-laws. We love to \n     be together as a family. Each year we have a family reunion \n     and do crazy things like make movies, or invent games. These \n     things create memories for generations. This year our family \n     reunion was going to be in late July at the Oregon Coast. \n     Sadly, we recently cancelled our family reunion due to GAS \n     PRICES. It would have cost over $700 per family just to drive \n     to the Oregon Coast. Since our family consists of 5 \n     collective young families--it was just too high of an expense \n     for many of us. $700 in gas is just absurd! We are so \n     disappointed! We have been looking forward to this vacation \n     for over a year! There was no way back in August of 2007 that \n     we could have predicted the rise in gas prices. What was \n     feasible then is impossible now. All because of the rise in \n     gas prices. Our family believes in being self sufficient and \n     I believe that America should start being the independent \n     nation we claim to be. Let's use our own oil to create our \n     own gas to put into our own cars so that we can take care of \n     our own families.

We are having to cut costs \n     wherever possible to compensate because our wages are not \n     going up equally with energy costs. I am so very frustrated \n     with the US Congress. They are inept! They argue instead of \n     taking action. Whenever a good bill comes up they tag it with \n     riders full of wasteful spending. I never thought I'd see a \n     day when the USA was so close to a real depression. Our \n     economy and dollar are heading down the tubes and nothing is \n     done. Of course it is the fault of years of bad government \n     for ruining our economy and it is only going to get worse.

Mr. President, although Somalia's 9 million people have \nsuffered from violence, natural disasters, and lawlessness for decades, \nthe humanitarian and human rights crisis they face seems to keep \ngetting worse. On Monday, the United Nation's humanitarian coordinator \nfor the Horn of Africa announced that due to fighting between rival \nmilitias, successive droughts, sharply rising food prices, and a \ncollapse of the Somali currency, more than 3.5 million Somalis will \nneed emergency food relief in the next 3 months.\n  On June 9, the United Nations' Special Representative for Somalia, \nMr. Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, announced the first piece of good news from \nSomalia in a long time. With support from the U.S.'s own Special Envoy \nfor Somalia, Ambassador John Yates--as well as representatives from the \nUK, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, the African Union, the League of Arab \nStates, the Organization of Islamic Conference, and the European \nUnion--Mr. Abdallah succeeded in brokering an agreement between \nSomalia's internationally recognized Transitional Federal Government, \nT.F.G., and a faction of the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation \nof Somalia, A.R.S.\n  We cannot be naive, however, because there have been numerous such \nagreements in the past in which ceasefires, political cooperation, and \nefforts to promote peace, justice, reconstruction, and reconciliation \nwere promised. The outcome could be different this time, if the \ninternational community commits the political and material resources \nnecessary to see it through. External actors were a critical driver \nbehind the peace talks in Djibouti and the resulting agreement, which \nends with a call for international support that was echoed in the \nsigning statements of the two rival political leaders. At the same \ntime, we must recognize that extremist groups like al Shabaab have not \naccepted this peace deal and intend to continue fighting. They should \nnot be allowed to derail the recently signed agreement. Indeed, by \nbringing the ARS into the institutional fold and consolidating a \nlegitimate peace, the international community is more likely to see al \nShabaab marginalized and rendered ineffective. This is not to say the \nroad forward will be smooth, but taking steps to encourage existing \ndivisions between the ARS and al Shabaab may create a path for ARS \nmoderates to press for dismantling al Shabaab.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Abdallah should be commended for this achievement, \nbut more than back-patting is in order. His success as a mediator--and \nindeed, the leverage and credibility of the United States and those who \nshare our vision of a stable, peaceful Somalia--rests upon the steps \ntaken in the next days and weeks to facilitate the implementation of \nthis agreement. Immediate, adequate, and coordinated action is needed \nto ensure that this most recent agreement does not meet the fate of its \npredecessors, with potentially more devastating consequences.\n  Last month, this body passed a resolution I introduced, which called \non Somalia's rival factions to recommit to an inclusive political \ndialogue and pledged international support for sustainable peace and \nsecurity in Somalia and across the Horn of Africa. Mr. Abdallah and \nothers have done their part.

Johnson who has been nominated by President \nBush to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. I did so because, prior to his confirmation as \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff told \nme in my office that if confirmed he would move expeditiously to \nimplement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET Guard--program. \nUnfortunately, Secretary Chertoff had failed to honor that pledge.\n  However, I am pleased to say that this morning the Department of \nHomeland Security has finally issued a solicitation for applications \nfor a NET Guard pilot program, effectively beginning the implementation \nprocess.

Mr. President, this week high school students from all \nacross the Nation have come together to celebrate National History Day \nat the University of Maryland. I would like to commend these students, \ntheir parents, and their teachers for demonstrating such interest to \nthe study of history. History education is the foundation of a quality \neducation, and ensuring that we have passionate and dedicated students \nof history is an important accomplishment of the competitions and \nevents at the University of Maryland this week.\n  The National History Day program delivers yearlong programs dedicated \nto improving the teaching and learning of history across our country. \nOver 1.5 million students, teachers and parents, participate in the \ninstructional and research projects each year. Since 1994, millions of \nAmericans from all across the country have improved their knowledge of \nhistory through participation in this creative program.\n  We know that there is a need for better teaching and learning of \nhistory. The 2006 National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, \nU.S. History report card shows that 82 percent of 4th graders, 83 \npercent of 8th graders, and 77 percent of high school seniors scored \nbelow proficient in historical knowledge. These results are similar to \nresults for the past decade in NAEP assessments, and it concerns me \ngreatly.\n  As an advocate for putting American history and civics back into its \nrightful place in our school curriculum, I chose to do my maiden speech \non the education of our children and the principles that unite us as \nAmericans. Along with several other distinguished cosponsors, I \nintroduced the American History and Civics Act in 2003 to create \nPresidential and Congressional Academies for Teachers of American \nHistory and Civics--and was pleased when that legislation was signed \ninto law.\n  I have had some experience with such academies when I was Governor of \nTennessee. In 1984, we began creating Governor's Schools for students \nand teachers. Eventually there were eight Governor's Schools helping \nthousands of Tennessee teachers improve their skills and inspiring \noutstanding students to learn more about core curriculum subjects. When \nthe school year began, students and teachers brought with them a new \nenthusiasm for learning and teaching that directly impacted their \npeers. Governor's Schools were one of the most effective and popular \neducational initiatives in our state, and I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to use that as a model for the Nation.\n  I applaud the organizers National History Day for recognizing the \nimportance of educating today's youth of the many great feats that were \naccomplished, the struggles that were overcome, and the events that \ntook place to make this country what it is today. I also congratulate \nall of the students, teachers, and parents who participate in it--and \nin particular wanted to congratulate the following Tennessee students \nparticipating in this event:\n\n       Emilee Frazier--Chuckey Doak Middle School, Afton, TN; \n     Katie Adams--Chuckey Doak Middle School, Afton, TN; Gary \n     Moats--Polk County High School, Benton, TN; Nick Ramsey--Polk \n     County High School, Benton, TN; Matthew Vandevander--Polk \n     County High School, Benton, TN; Anthony Joslin--Polk County \n     High School, Benton, TN; Jon Rivers--Tyner Academy, \n     Chattanooga, TN; Manish Jethva--Tyner Academy, Chattanooga, \n     TN; Jacquelyn Benford--Tyner Academy, Chattanooga, TN; \n     Markcus Kitchens--Tyner Academy, Chattanooga, TN; Walker \n     Thompson--St. George's Middle School, Collierville, TN; Ryan \n     Grover--St. George's Middle School, Collierville, TN; Mason \n     McGough--St. George's Middle School, Collierville, TN; Andrew \n     McBride--St. George's Middle School, Collierville, TN; Nikki \n     Martinez--St. Benedict at Auburndale, Cordova, TN; Anna \n     Cabe--St. Benedict at Auburndale, Cordova, TN; Mary Barczak--\n     St. Benedict at Auburndale, Cordova, TN; Andrew Grayson--Fred \n     Page Middle School, Franklin, TN; Adam Anderson--Fred Page \n     Middle School, Franklin, TN; and Olivia Smith--Fred Page \n     Middle School, Knoxville, TN.\n       Dylan Rasnick--Fred Page Middle School, Knoxville, TN; \n     Katherine Ballew--Fred Page Middle School, Knoxville, TN; \n     Willis Walker--Fred Page Middle School, Knoxville, TN; Erin \n     Stapleton--Fred Page Middle School, Knoxville, TN; William \n     Coe--Greenway School, Knoxville, TN; Sophie Yates--Greenway \n     School, Knoxville, TN; Shannon Gleason--Knoxville Catholic \n     High School, Knoxville, TN; Hannah Armendarez--Knoxville \n     Catholic High School, Knoxville, TN; Xrista Christopoulos--\n     St. John Neumann School, Knoxville, TN; Alexander Grimm--St. \n     John Neuman School, Knoxville, TN; Claire Northern--St. John \n     Neuman School, Knoxville, TN; C.C.

Mr. President, today marks the 143rd anniversary of \nJuneteenth, a day on which our Nation celebrates the complete abolition \nof slavery in the United States.\n  On June 19 of each year, we mark a turning point in American history. \nOn January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation \nProclamation, freeing slaves in the Confederate states. However, it was \nnot until June 19, 1865, a full 2\\1/2\\ years later, that Union General \nGordon Granger and 2,000 Federal troops arrived in Galveston, TX, to \ntake possession of the State and enforce the emancipation decreed by \nPresident Lincoln. Tragically, slaves in Texas were not freed until \nthat date. Juneteenth celebrations began in Texas the following year \nand have continued ever since.\n  Now, in communities across the country, Juneteenth is a day for \nAmericans to reflect upon a tragic period that divided our Nation and \nprevented realization of the Declaration of Independence's introductory \nwords, ``(W)e hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \ncreated equal . . . ''\n  For Marylanders, Juneteenth is a time to contemplate our own State's \nhistory. Slave labor helped spur Maryland's growth from the State's \nconception in 1664 until 1864 when slavery was abolished with the \nratification of a new\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nState constitution. Two hundred years of subjugation and oppression, of \nbondage and tyranny, serve as a reminder to all of us now of the \nimportance of freedom and equality.\n  Although Maryland was a slave State, it did not secede from the \nUnion. Marylanders' contributions to the Union cause and the \nabolitionist movement did much to secure the abolition of slavery. \nHarriet Tubman, who was born Araminta Ross in Dorchester County, freed \ncountless slaves from bondage and was the first woman to lead an armed \nassault in the Civil War. Frederick Douglass, who was born Frederick \nAugustus Bailey in Talbot County, escaped slavery and went on to become \none of the foremost leaders of the abolitionist movement. These heroic \nMarylanders dedicated their lives to the emancipation of all slaves and \nthe empowerment of African Americans.\n  Earlier this year, we commemorated the 40th anniversary of the death \nof Martin Luther King, Jr. His legacy remains with us as we continue to \npursue equality and justice wherever disparities exist, whether in the \neconomic, educational, housing, or health care arenas. It is our duty \nto eradicate discrimination in all its insidious forms. Our concerted \nefforts will be necessary to wipe out racial intolerance, and the \nstrength of the Nation depends on the success of these efforts.\n  Today, on this 143rd anniversary of the first Juneteenth, another \nhistoric event will take place. The first African-American woman to \nrepresent Maryland in the U.S. Congress, Donna Edwards, will be sworn \nin this afternoon. It is my honor, on this historic day, to call upon \nmy colleagues to join me in celebrating Juneteenth and those who made \nthis day possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5827-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JUNE SALANDER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to June \nSalander of Rutland, VT. On June 28, 2008, June will celebrate her \n100th birthday.\n  June Salander has led a remarkable life. Like many Jewish immigrants, \nshe came to the United States via Ellis Island in 1920 after a journey \nfrom Ros, Poland, making the trip with her mother, brother, and sister. \nFamily and a supportive Jewish community were always positioned as \ncornerstones of June's upbringing. In 1941 she married her husband Lew \nSalander and moved to Rutland, VT, where she has remained an active \ncommunity member ever since. A strong believer in the idea that it \ntakes a village to raise a child, June has lent her time volunteering \nat the Rutland Hospital and teaching Hebrew school classes. June has \nremained an active citizen into her golden years, earning her real \nestate license at the age of 62 and taking up tennis at the impressive \nage of 73. Her commitment to education and community outreach expands \nto the home with June's famous cooking. June warms the homes and lives \nof others with her legendary apple strudel which she has shared through \ncooking lessons. She continues to inspire with her dedication to \ncontinual learning and improvement.\n  June Salander inspires with her energy and enthusiasm within the \nreligious community as well. The Rutland Jewish Center has remained an \nintegral part of her social and cultural life. June's daughter, \nMenasha, accurately describes the center as June's living room, \nkitchen, dining room, and backyard. Deeply rooted community involvement \nremains a core value, and to further uphold and solidify the Jewish \ntradition, June was Bat Mitzvahed at the extraordinary age of 89. It is \nbelieved that June is the oldest Rutland resident to complete the \nsignificant ceremony. Her commitment to observing Judaism and keeping \ntradition alive through education is a landmark of encouragement and \npride for the Jewish community. I congratulate June Salander as she \nreaches yet another remarkable milestone, her 100th birthday. The \nmessage she has instilled in others through a lifetime of active \ncitizenship is commendable. I am confident that June's spiritually \nfulfilling and publicly active life will continue to inspire others for \nyears to come.\n  On a personal note, my wife Marcelle and I have cherished her \nfriendship for a third of a century, as we did that of her wonderful \nhusband.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5827-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING WAHIAWA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL'S CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Wahiawa community as it marks the centennial of \nWahiawa Elementary School. Located in central Oahu, Wahiawa is home to \none of Hawaii's first pineapple plantations. As the industry grew, so \ndid Wahiawa and the needs of its residents.\n  Wahiawa Elementary opened in 1908, on Lehua Street with one teacher, \nMrs. H.C. Brown, and 56 students. In 1924, Wahiawa Elementary expanded \nto six classrooms, only to be closed during World War II. In 1950, \nWahiawa Elementary reopened with a new building and a new location on \nGlenn Street.\n  Today, Wahiawa Elementary has an enrollment of approximately 500 and \nincludes a center for medically fragile students, a teacher training \ncenter for students with autism, and a preschool. Wahiawa Elementary \nstudents have a 95 percent attendance rate.\n  For 100 years, Wahiawa Elementary has been a focal point for Wahiawa, \nproviding a strong foundation for the community's children and \nfamilies. There are now several other elementary schools in the Wahiawa \narea due to dramatic population growth on the island of Oahu, but \nWahiawa Elementary remains a special place. In understanding what this \nelementary school represents to its community, the school's motto is \nfitting: Ku lokahi ka `ohana `o Wahiawa! Stand in unison the family of \nWahiawa!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5827-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN HONOR OF ALFREDO NUNEZ\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncelebrate the life and work of a dedicated educator. This month, \nAlfredo Nunez will retire as principal of the Agassiz Elementary School \nof Jamaica Plain, MA, and as he prepares to do so I am proud to join \nwith his colleagues, friends, and family in celebrating more than 30 \nyears of service to Boston Public Schools.\n  Born in Caracas, Venezuela, Nunez immigrated to the United States in \n1963. He attended high school in Jersey City, NJ, and subsequently \nmoved to New Brunswick, NJ, where he graduated from Rutgers University.\n  Following graduation, he moved to Boston where he became a U.S. \ncitizen and obtained his master's degree from Boston University in \nbilingual education. Nunez then became a fifth grade teacher at the \nAgassiz, where he has worked ever since. One of the largest elementary \nschools in Boston, with over 800 students and 100-plus faculty and \nstaff members, the Agassiz is a diverse and dynamic school with a large \nbilingual student population. Nunez relished the opportunity to not \nonly teach but also to learn from the thousands of students, parents, \nand teachers he has worked with over the years.\n  During his tenure as principal, the Agassiz has garnered numerous \nawards and accolades for its drive to achieve excellence in education. \nNunez has encouraged partnerships with institutes of higher education \nsuch as the University of Massachusetts and Harvard University, as well \nas art and cultural institutions like the Boston Ballet, to try to \nexpand his students' horizons. He has also worked to grow parent \nparticipation within the school to foster a more community oriented \napproach to learning.\n  I am proud to pay tribute to the service of Alfredo Nunez to the \nAgassiz and to the children of Boston. I wish Alfredo the very best as \nhe looks back on so many achievements and contributions to the \ncommunity and begins this new chapter in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5827-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5827-S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING J.R. SIMPLOT\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in 1923, a 14-year-old boy dropped \nout of school in Declo, ID, and began working as a potato sorter. He \neventually became a potato and hog farmer, a forester, a miner, an \nentrepreneur, an industrialist, an investor, a billionaire, and today--\nhe is a legend.\n  John Richard Simplot was born in Dubuque, IA, in 1909--but his family \nmoved to Idaho when he was young, and Idaho remained his home. At an \nearly age, J.R. knew school was not for him, so he dropped out and \nbegan\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nworking in the fields. He saved up and was able to buy 40 acres of land \nand several hogs. He planted potatoes and fed his hogs with a homemade \nfeed recipe that allowed him to use his own spuds and meat from wild \nhorses. That saved him some money on feed; moreover, as luck would have \nit, a harsh winter depleted the grain stock, and come market time, \nJ.R.'s fat, home-fed hogs stood out against everyone else's skinny \npigs, and the young man reaped the rewards.\n  He expanded his hog business, and by the time he sold it, he owned \nroughly 500 hogs. He took his earnings and put them into horses, farm \nmachinery, and seed potatoes. From there, he rented some land and began \nto build what would later become his empire.\n  In 1928, at the ripe old age of 19, Simplot learned of a machine that \nhad been built in eastern Idaho. It was an electrically driven potato \nsorter. J.R. saw potential and found a partner, and together they spent \n$254 on the new piece of equipment, which enabled them to sort not only \ntheir own crops but the crops of other farmers as well--for a price.\n  A dispute between J.R. and his partner forced them to decide who \nwould keep the machine. J.R. said ``I'll flip you for it,'' and \nwouldn't you know it--he won the coin toss. He was off on his own.\n  Winning the toss was luck, but the rest of his success throughout the \nyears can only be attributed to his devotion to hard work and his \nincredible resourcefulness. For years the young Simplot built hog pens, \ndug potato cellars, tilled soil, hauled sacks of potatoes, and did \ncountless other tasks.\n  It was after the Great Depression, though, when Simplot's chance came \nto make a name for himself in the potato business. The Bureau of \nReclamation was created, and projects like dams and canals began along \nthe Snake River in Idaho. The projects would bring more water to the \nvalley, which would lead to more farms, more crops, and more \nopportunity to diversify within agriculture. By 1940, J.R. had 33 \npotato warehouses and had also gotten into the business of onions and \nonion-drying.\n  When the United States entered World War II, there were only five \ncompanies that could dehydrate vegetables, and no one could dehydrate \npotatoes at least not until J.R. Simplot found a way. He began \nproducing dry potatoes for U.S. troops and by 1945 was producing an \naverage of 33 million pounds of dried potatoes a year. That was one-\nthird of the U.S. military's consumption during the war.\n  As his success in potatoes expanded, his ability to save money by \nproducing his own raw materials grew. In 1943, he didn't have enough \nboxes to ship out his dry potatoes, so he started his own box plant. \nWhen that company needed more lumber, he bought a lumber company. And \nwhen his supply for fertilizer for his potatoes was cut off, he \ndeveloped his own. He went to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation looking \nfor phosphate rock for his new fertilizer and ended up tapping into the \nlargest phosphate mine in the West. He leased the land and built a \nfertilizer plant.\n  In 1945, J.R. Simplot became a cattleman when he built a small \nfeedlot for the purpose of getting rid of the potato waste coming from \nhis processing plants. Peelings and sprouts were mixed with alfalfa and \nbarley to make feed for cattle, and yet another Simplot business \nflourished.\n  A huge discovery in the 1950s propelled the empire forward even \nfurther when Simplot discovered a way to freeze potatoes--and the \nfrozen french fry was born. It was the 1960s when J.R. went into \nbusiness with a man by the name of Ray Kroc. Kroc was a fast food \noperator who had begun a chain. That chain was McDonald's, and soon the \nSimplot Company became the largest supplier of frozen french fries to \nthe fast food giant.\n  By the late 1960's, J.R. Simplot grew more potatoes, owned more \ncattle and land, and employed more people than anyone else in Idaho. He \nwas the largest processor, drier, and freezer of potatoes in the world \nand owned processing plants, fertilizer plants, mining operations, and \nother enterprises in 36 States, Canada, and overseas--making him the \nlargest industrialist in Idaho and one of the largest in the world.\n  But he continued to get into new businesses. Using his potatoes, he \nbegan producing ethanol in the 1970s, and with the manure from his \ncattle operations, he began fueling methane gas plants in the 1980s. At \nthe same time, he invested in a small computer chip company that is \ntoday Micron Technology.\n  He left his footprint on Idaho perhaps more than anyone else in \nhistory. Dubbed ``Mr. Spud,'' he provided countless jobs for Idahoans \nin so many areas. He seemed to have his hand in everything that is \nIdaho, and everything he touched seemed to succeed.\n  But that is not the reason I admired the man. Even with all his \nsuccess, J.R. Simplot had his failures. The difference between many \npeople and Jack, though, was his never-ending drive and determination \nto get up and do something again, and to do it better. It was his \npersistence in wrangling successes from failures that made J.R. the \nkind of man everyone should admire.\n  He wasn't just a brilliant business man. He loved Idaho, and in fact, \na few years ago, signed his home over to the State of Idaho to use as \nthe new Governor's mansion. He also loved his fellow Idahoans. And \nalthough he never received a formal education, he always believed in \ngetting one and therefore gave millions of dollars to universities and \nstudents in Idaho. He was also a major supporter of the arts.\n  Recently, at the young age of 99, J.R. Simplot passed away at his \nhome in Boise. He had risen that Sunday morning, walked into his \nkitchen and insisted to his wife Esther that he was going to go to the \noffice. That was the kind of man J.R. Simplot was. Even at the age of \n99, even with billions of dollars, his last thought was that he needed \nto go to work.\n  I am going to miss my friend Jack, and my sincere condolences go out \nto Esther and his family.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Rutgers \nUniversity-Newark in honor of their 100th anniversary. From its roots \nas the New Jersey Law School, Rutgers-Newark has evolved into a premier \nurban research university with a tradition of outstanding scholarship \nand diversity.\n  Students from across New Jersey, the United States, and from all over \nthe world come to Rutgers-Newark to work and study with a world-class \nfaculty. Its global student body has earned it the designation by U.S. \nNews and World Report as the most diverse national university in the \nUnited States for 11 consecutive years.\n  As Rutgers-Newark has grown, so has their commitment to the local \ncommunity and the entire State of New Jersey. The expansion of Rutgers-\nNewark has added to the growing redevelopment of Newark. With the \ncelebration of its first 100 years in Newark, plans abound for expanded \ndevelopment of the university and its connections and commitment to the \ngreat city of Newark.\n  The faculty, students and alumni of Rutgers-Newark have much to be \nproud of after a century of outstanding educational achievement. \nRutgers-Newark is still dedicated to maintaining the highest standards \nof research and scholarship, educational opportunity, urban mission, \nand diversity. I applaud Rutgers-Newark for their ``Century of Reaching \nHigher'' and wish the university continued growth and success for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5828-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5828-S5829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JOHN W. KEYS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, unfortunately, a tragic accident is \nthe occasion of my remarks today. On May 30, recently retired \nCommissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, John W. Keys, was killed, \nalong with his passenger, when his plane crashed in Canyonlands \nNational Park in Utah. John worked for the Bureau of Reclamation for \nclose to 40 years, serving in most all regions including in Boise as \nregional director of the Pacific Northwest region. In\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n2001, President George W. Bush appointed him Commissioner of the \nBureau, where he served for 5 years until his retirement in April 2006.\n  John believed in the adapting mission of the Bureau of Reclamation. \nHe joined the Bureau at the time in its history when the final projects \nit oversees today were being authorized. During his tenure, the Bureau \nwent from constructing water projects in the West to maintaining and \nimproving facilities and processes. John was well-known for his efforts \nto facilitate collaborative management and solutions to challenges. He \nwas a man of solutions and integrity, and he cared deeply about people \nand our natural resources. Idaho benefited from John's leadership as he \nworked with the State legislature, interest groups, the Tribes and \nirrigation districts on solving some of the thorny issues that have \narisen with Endangered Species Act requirements in the Columbia River \nsystem for species such as salmon and bull trout.\n  In January, 2006, John spoke about the mission of the Bureau:\n\n       Our mission has evolved from the construction of dams to \n     management and maintenance. As water management has evolved, \n     Reclamation has transformed into a more comprehensive water \n     management agency. Today, much of our focus is on improving \n     the safety, security, and efficiency of the facilities we \n     already have, as well as meeting environmental obligations. \n     The challenges we face today in maintaining and improving the \n     system are as formidable as those challenges that we \n     surmounted during Reclamation's construction heyday. One \n     priority is security . . . We feel more prepared and, \n     therefore, more secure against terrorism, than ever.\n       A lot is changing, but some things remain constant. Since I \n     was appointed Commissioner in 2001, my main priority has been \n     carrying out Reclamation's core mission: deliver water, \n     generate power, do the things it takes to get that done, and \n     plan for the future. I'm interested not just in the next few \n     years, but in setting up the framework that will enable \n     Reclamation to succeed many years into the future.\n\n  John left a tremendous legacy at work and in his family. He devoted \nhis time in retirement to his family and his volunteer efforts with \nAngel Flight and other humanitarian efforts. He was a remarkable man \nwho did remarkable things for the country and region he cared about so \ndeeply. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this \nvery difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5829-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5829-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5829-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1333.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to reform the No Child Left Behind Act; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 268\n\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is an \n     ambitious effort by the Federal Government to ensure that all \n     States improve K-12 education opportunities. While standards, \n     accountability, and benchmarks are key features of this \n     landmark 2002 legislation, the goal of making sure all of our \n     children receive a quality education must not be forgotten. \n     The current reauthorization process for NCLB is an \n     opportunity to reform the act to ensure that no child is left \n     behind in this Federal, State, and school partnership; and\n       Whereas, NCLB needs to be amended in a number of areas to \n     fulfill its admirable goal. First, while schools are being \n     identified for failing to meet standards, Congress has not \n     met its promises for funding levels to allow schools to \n     correct identified inadequacies. Further, a whole range of \n     initiatives that expand early education, before- and after-\n     school programs, summer school options, and family support, \n     would enhance the ability of our schools to educate all of \n     our children to their full potential; and\n       Whereas, schools also need flexibility in a whole range of \n     areas. Special education implementation, teacher subject area \n     competency, school benchmarks, and student cohort definitions \n     must not be imposed from Washington, D.C. Local educators and \n     State legislatures must be allowed to refine these aspects of \n     NCLB to reflect local conditions and needs. Flexibility and \n     more sophisticated measurements will keep the focus on \n     educating children and not meeting unrealistic and rigid \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, the entire sanctions concept must be revised. It \n     may be comforting to think that NCLB sanctions ``schools'' \n     when they do not meet NCLB-established standards, but in \n     reality we sanction children in those schools by withholding \n     or effectively diverting resources from those schools. The \n     first response must be to target additional resources to \n     correct recognized deficiencies; and\n       Whereas, to support effective intervention in failing \n     schools, develop proper standards that promote education of \n     all children, and ensure relevant definitions and procedures \n     that reflect real conditions, NCLB must be amended to ensure \n     that the act's assumptions and standards are based on sound \n     research in student achievement and effective teaching; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act is an opportunity to refine the admirable goals of the \n     act based on five years of experience in implementing the \n     2002 initiative. We have much to do before ``no child left \n     behind'' is more than just a goal: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact legislation \n     to reform the No Child Left Behind Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-397. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to enact the Youth Prison Reduction \n     through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and \n     Education Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 155\n\n       Whereas, among the most effective approaches to reducing \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity are \n     those preventing children from turning to crime in the first \n     place, encouraging early childhood home visitation, parental \n     love and education, quality schooling, and proven youth and \n     family development initiatives; and\n       Whereas, there are many alternatives to incarcerating youth \n     that have been proven to be more effective in reducing crime \n     and violence at the national, state, local, and tribal \n     levels. Failure to provide for such effective alternatives is \n     a pervasive problem that leads to increased youth, and later \n     adult, crime and violence; and\n       Whereas, research funded by the U.S. Department of Justice \n     indicates that gang membership is short-lived among \n     adolescents--with very few youth remaining gang-involved \n     through their adolescent years, and therefore, allowing \n     ongoing opportunities for intervention; and\n       Whereas, over-reliance on incarceration and confinement of \n     youth, particularly in the early stages of delinquent \n     behavior and for nonviolent delinquent behavior, has been \n     shown to increase long-term crime risks; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act will provide resources to \n     enable communities with the greatest concentration of \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity to \n     come together to assess unmet needs and implement research-\n     based prevention and intervention approaches to promote youth \n     success and community safety; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act creates a PROMISE Advisory \n     panel, which will help the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention select PROMISE communities. It will \n     also develop standards for the evaluation of juvenile \n     delinquency and criminal street gang activity prevention and \n     street gang activity prevention and intervention needs and \n     resources in each designated geographic area in order to \n     facilitate the strategic geographic allocation of resources \n     provided under the act; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act establishes grants to enable \n     local and tribal communities, via PROMISE Coordinating \n     Councils, to conduct an objective assessment regarding \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity, \n     resource needs, and community strengths necessary to \n     effectively address juvenile delinquency and criminal street \n     gang activity. Based upon the assessment, the PROMISE \n     Councils will develop plans that include a broad array of\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\n     prevention and intervention programs which are responsive to \n     the specifics of the community, account for the cultural and \n     linguistic requirements of the community, and utilize \n     approaches that have been shown effective in reducing the \n     likelihood of a young person becoming involved in or \n     continuing delinquent conduct or criminal street gang \n     activity. Upon completion of the plan, the PROMISE Councils \n     may then apply for federal funds to assist with \n     implementation. The act also provides for national \n     evaluations of PROMISE programs and activities, and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act requires that local units of \n     government or Indian tribes receiving grants shall provide \n     from nonfederal funds, in cash or in-kind, 25 percent of the \n     costs of the activities carried out with such grants; and\n       Wheereas, the Youth PROMISE Act establishes a National \n     Center for Proven Practices Research, which will collect and \n     disseminate research to PROMISE Councils and to the public \n     (including via an Internet website), as well as other \n     information regarding evidence-based promising practices \n     related to juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang \n     activity prevention and intervention. The act also provides \n     the opportunity for regional research partners to assist with \n     developing their assessments and plans; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act provides for the hiring and \n     training of Youth-Oriented Policing officers to implement \n     strategic activities to minimize youth crime and \n     victimization and reduce the long-tern involvement of \n     juveniles in illicit activities, juvenile delinquency, and \n     criminal street gang activity. The act also establishes a \n     Center for Youth-Oriented Policing, which will be responsible \n     for identification, development, and dissemination to law \n     enforcement agencies the best practices for Youth-Oriented \n     Policing techniques and technologies; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act provides additional \n     improvements to current laws affecting juvenile delinquency \n     and criminal street gang activity, including support for \n     youth victim and witness protection programs and extended and \n     increased authorizations for the juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grant program: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to support through enactment the Youth \n     PROMISE Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-398. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging the President \n     of the United States to include the Republic of Korea in the \n     Visa Waiver Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 86\n\n       Whereas, there are nearly two million Americans of Korean \n     heritage and descent who live in the United States, including \n     forty thousand Hawaii residents, and January 13, 2003 marked \n     the centennial of the first arrival of Koreans in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the United States and the Republic of Korea have a \n     long history of friendship, and continue to strengthen \n     alliances and business partnerships; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Korea has been a trusted ally for \n     over fifty years, is a major trading partner of the United \n     States, and is the thirteenth largest economy in the world; \n     and\n       Whereas, visitors from the Republic of Korea to the United \n     States reached as high as 500,000 in 1999, inclusive of the \n     40,000 visitors to Hawaii that same year; and\n       Whereas, the Visa Waiver Program was established in 1986 \n     with the objective of promoting better relations with United \n     States allies, eliminating unnecessary barriers to travel, \n     and stimulating the tourism industry; and\n       Whereas, the Visa Waiver Program enables nationals of \n     twenty-seven countries to travel to the United States for \n     tourism or business for stays of ninety days or less without \n     obtaining a visa; the Republic of Korea is not a participant \n     in the Visa Waiver Program; and\n       Whereas, due to increased security prompted by the \n     terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, it has become much more \n     difficult for the citizens of the Republic of Korea, \n     especially those living outside the capital city of Seoul, to \n     obtain visitor visas that allow travel to the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, under Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission Act of 2007, the United States Congress revised \n     requirements for countries to become eligible for the Visa \n     Waiver Program, enabling South Korea to be eligible for \n     consideration, provided it meets the new security \n     requirements specified in the Act; and\n       Whereas, in a letter to the Secretary of State dated July \n     7, 2006, United States Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Daniel \n     K. Akaka, along with several other senators, expressed strong \n     support for including South Korea into the Visa Waiver \n     Program and noted that South Korea has repealed its visa \n     requirement for United States citizens traveling to the \n     Republic of Korea for thirty days or less and that South \n     Korea enjoys a visa-free status with sixty-six other nations; \n     and\n       Whereas, including South Korea in the Visa Waiver Program \n     would result in economic benefits to the United States \n     estimated to be $350,000,000 in actualized tourism revenues \n     for every 100,000 tourists increase in South Korean visitors \n     and tourists, based on visitors and tourists to the United \n     States from South Korea spending of nearly $2,200,000,000 in \n     2004; and\n       Whereas, while the Republic of Korea is doing its part to \n     facilitate the processing of travel requirements for its \n     citizens, the United States should also encourage visitors \n     from the Republic of Korea, especially as Hawaii continues to \n     be one of the premier destinations in the world and tourism \n     remains the backbone of Hawaii's economy: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2008, That the President of the United States, the Secretary \n     of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security are urged to \n     take all steps necessary to include the Republic of Korea in \n     the Visa Waiver Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation are urged to support the inclusion of the Republic \n     of Korea in the Visa Waiver Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary for Homeland Security, \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-399. A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Arizona urging Congress to \n     authorize the placement in Statuary Hall of a statue of \n     Senator Barry Goldwater; to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution 2001\n\n       Whereas, in 1864, Congress established the National \n     Statuary Hall in the Old Hall of the House of Representatives \n     in the United States Capitol and authorized each state to \n     contribute to the Hall two statues that represent important \n     historical figures of that state; and\n       Whereas, Arizona currently has statues on display in \n     Statuary Hall of John Campbell Greenway, which was donated in \n     1930, and Father Eusebio Kino, which was added later in 1965. \n     These are two acclaimed and distinguished individuals of \n     great importance in Arizona's history; and\n       Whereas, John C. Greenway was born in Huntsville, Alabama, \n     on July 6, 1872, and attended Yale University where he was a \n     star athlete. After school, he went to work for U.S. Steel, \n     where he worked his way up to a management role. He joined \n     the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War, and was a \n     leader of the charge up San Juan Hill. After the war, \n     Greenway helped U.S. Steel open the Western Mesabi Range. In \n     1910, Greenway moved from Minnesota to Arizona to manage the \n     copper mines at Bisbee. Seeing the potential of the copper \n     deposits at Ajo, he developed a method of extracting low \n     grade ore. Greenway planned and built the city of Ajo. The \n     mine was highly successful, and over three billion pounds of \n     copper were shipped from Ajo. Greenway also served as a \n     regent for the University of Arizona. John C. Greenway died \n     on January 19, 1926. His death at the age of 54 was mourned \n     across the country; and\n       Whereas, legislation enacted by Congress in 2000 authorized \n     any state to request the Joint Committee on the Library of \n     Congress to approve the replacement of a statue the state has \n     provided for display in Statuary Hall under certain \n     conditions; and\n       Whereas, the state of Arizona will celebrate its centennial \n     on February 14, 2012, it is appropriate at this time to \n     consider honoring a distinguished Arizonan who has played a \n     significant role in our state's history since statehood by \n     placing his statue in Statuary Hall, namely Senator Barry \n     Goldwater, This action in no way seeks to diminish the \n     positive contributions of the two Arizonans already honored \n     in Statuary Hall, and every effort will be made to ensure \n     that their legacy is preserved in our great state; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate that we honor John C. Greenway's \n     legacy by placing his statue prominently and permanently in \n     the Arizona State Capitol building as part of the centennial; \n     and\n       Whereas, Barry Morris Goldwater was born in Phoenix on New \n     Year's Day, 1909, three years before Arizona was admitted to \n     the Union. He attended the University of Arizona and took \n     over his family's. mercantile business after his father's \n     death in 1930. He transformed his passion for flying into \n     service in the Army Air Corps during World War II, and on his \n     return to Arizona following the war he helped organize the \n     Arizona Air National Guard. Remaining in the reserves after \n     the war, he retired with the rank of Major General; and\n       Whereas, Goldwater entered politics in 1949 when he was \n     elected as a Phoenix city councilman. He first won a United \n     States Senate seat in 1952, when he defeated then Senate \n     majority leader Ernest McFarland. In 1964 Senator Goldwater \n     was the Republican nominee for president. Although defeated \n     in that race, Goldwater became an icon for conservatism, \n     starting a movement which many believe led to the election of \n     Ronald Reagan as president in 1980; and\n       Whereas, Senator Goldwater was reelected to the Senate in \n     1968 where he served until his retirement in 1987. During his \n     time in the Senate, Goldwater served as Chairman of the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee and Chairman of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee; and\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n       Whereas, Barry Goldwater was a quintessential westerner and \n     a man of great personal charm. His reputation for personal \n     integrity was unblemished. Throughout his life, Barry \n     Goldwater had a love affair with the state of Arizona and her \n     people. He extensively explored areas throughout the state, \n     including the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, and he \n     loved to photograph the people and landscapes of Arizona. He \n     was a dear friend to the members of the Arizona's Native \n     American tribes. He served both rural and urban constituents \n     with equal passion, and his many years of faithful service to \n     this state earned him the fitting' nickname ``Mr. Arizona''; \n     and\n       Whereas, the legacy of Senator Barry Goldwater since his \n     death in 1998 has been a source of inspiration to many, and \n     the placement of a statue in his likeness in Statuary Hall \n     would be a well-deserved and lasting testament to Barry \n     Goldwater's tremendous impact on both our state and nation: \n     Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature. of the State of Arizona:\n       1. That the Members of the Forty-eighth Legislature and the \n     Governor of the State of Arizona respectfully request that \n     the Congress of the United States return the statue of John \n     Campbell Greenway earlier presented by the State of Arizona \n     for placement in Statuary Hall and accept in return, for \n     placement in 'Statuary Hall, a statue of Senator Barry. \n     Goldwater.\n       2. That the Members of the Forty-eighth Legislature and the \n     Governor of the State of Arizona direct the Arizona \n     Historical Advisory Commission to organize a solicitation for \n     monies for the creation of a statue of Senator Barry \n     Goldwater; to use the monies to acquire a statue for \n     placement in Statuary Hall in the Capitol of this nation; to \n     select and contract with a gifted and experienced sculptor to \n     create a suitable statue of Senator Barry Goldwater; and to \n     make the statue available for placement in Statuary Hall.\n       3. That the Members of the Forty-eighth Legislature and the \n     Governor of the State of Arizona direct that the costs of the \n     creation of the statue of Senator Barry Goldwater, as well as \n     the costs of transporting the statue to Washington, D.C. and \n     any incidental costs, be borne by the State of Arizona \n     through the use of private monies.\n       4. That the Secretary of State transmit copies of this \n     Resolution to the President of the United States Senate. the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each \n     Member of Congress from the State of Arizona, each Member of \n     the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress and each \n     Member of the Arizona Historical Advisory Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-400. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     pass the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act; to \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 372\n\n       Whereas, In 1944, the Congress of the United States passed, \n     and President Roosevelt signed, the Servicemen's Readjustment \n     Act, known to most people as the GI Bill of Rights. Since its \n     establishment, the GI Bill has created educational \n     opportunities for millions of veterans; and\n       Whereas, Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     members of the United States military have been asked to \n     perform heroic tasks in the name of freedom. These selfless \n     volunteers have performed with remarkable valor, and it is \n     incumbent on citizens of the United States to honor their \n     service in any way possible; and\n       Whereas, The cost of attending college has increased \n     greatly in recent years, and as a result the benefits \n     provided by the G1 Bill are no longer sufficient to cover the \n     average cost of tuition; and\n       Whereas, Since 1944, Congress has periodically updated the \n     GI Bill to reflect the changing needs of our soldiers and the \n     military as a whole. However, despite the changes of the past \n     decades, it has been 24 years since the law was significantly \n     reformed; and\n       Whereas, Improving and updating the GI bill would create an \n     additional incentive for individuals considering enlistment, \n     which is vital given the all-volunteer nature of our \n     military; and\n       Whereas, Two pieces of legislation currently before \n     Congress, S. 22 and H. R. 2702, would update the GI Bill to \n     reflect the current realities facing our servicemembers. \n     These bills, known as the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational \n     Assistance Act, would increase the amount of aid available to \n     these students, and would otherwise remove obstacles to \n     obtaining a college education. While not perfect, these bills \n     represent a significant improvement over the current system; \n     and\n       Whereas, Those who would complain about the costs of such a \n     program seem to forget the staggering price we ask of these \n     men and women. Likewise, those who complain that these bills \n     would create an incentive to leave the military underestimate \n     the dedication and devotion of our troops: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact, and \n     the President of the United States to sign, S. 22 and H. R. \n     2702; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5832-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BYRD, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Allocation to Subcommittees of \n     Budget Totals From the Concurrent Resolution, Fiscal Year \n     2008'' (Rept.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrelief to improve the competitiveness of United States corporations and \nsmall businesses, to eliminate tax incentives to move jobs and profits \noverseas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  MR. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, when the Senate reconvenes in January \n2009 for the 111th Congress, we will have an historic opportunity, \nthrough fundamental tax reform, to transform the U.S. economy in a \nmanner that will make our nation stronger and more prosperous for \ngenerations. A number of factors make the 111th Congress the occasion \nfor a perfect storm for the Tax Code. At the beginning of the next \nCongress, a new President will take office and will be looking to enact \nmajor tax changes. At the end, the 2001 and 2003 tax relief will \nexpire, resulting in an unprecedented tax increase on the American \npeople. And in between, the reach of the deeply flawed alternative \nminimum tax--or AMT--will threaten to hit tens of millions of middle-\nclass Americans unless Congress enacts major tax legislation. Finally, \nthe competitive pressures of a global economy will force us to change \nour uncompetitive and inefficient methods of business taxation, \nincluding one of the highest corporate marginal rates in the world.\n  I am not proposing today a comprehensive tax reform bill that would \ntouch every part of the Tax Code, but I am introducing legislation that \naddresses one large piece of tax reform, in the hopes of starting a \nconversation that will inform policymakers as we develop a more \ncomprehensive reform in the next couple of years. Today, I am \nintroducing the Manufacturing, Assembling, Development, and Export in \nthe USA--or MADE in the USA--Tax Act. The purpose of my legislation is \nto provide tax relief to improve the competitiveness of U.S. \ncorporations and small businesses and to eliminate incentives that \nfavor foreign competition and encourage companies to move jobs and \nprofits overseas.\n  A number of factors contribute to a company's decision about where to \nlocate activity and jobs, including wages, workforce skills, \ntransportation costs, and local regulations. But there is no doubt that \ntaxes are an important factor. Recent economic research concludes that \nin a global economy, workers bear the brunt of higher corporate tax \nrates, through lower wages and fewer jobs. Therefore, it is imperative \nthat we have a Tax Code that makes the United States an attractive \nplace to locate production, research, and other activity. While the \nMADE in the USA Tax Act would not address the ``wage pull'' that sends \njobs to places like China and India, it would deal with the ``tax \npush'' that encourages jobs to leave the United States.\n  The MADE in the USA Tax Act would eliminate tax breaks that encourage \ncompanies to move jobs overseas or that benefit foreign competitors and \nthen use that revenue to cut tax rates on large and small businesses \nthat invest and create jobs in the United States. The centerpiece of \nthe legislation is a one-fifth reduction in the Federal corporate rate, \nto 28 percent from 35 percent. Of the 30 member countries of the \nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development--which includes \nthe major industrialized nations of North America, Europe, and Asia--\nthe United States has the second highest combined Federal-State \ncorporate tax rate at 39.3 percent, lower only than Japan's rate of \n39.5 percent. The average is 27.6 percent, and Ireland has the lowest \nrate at 12.5 percent.\n  Even Communist China, our biggest economic rival in the 21st century, \nrecently cut its corporate tax rate to 25 percent. It will be that much \nharder to compete with China for jobs and investment when businesses \noperating in the United States have to pay a tax rate 15 percent higher \nthan they would have to pay in China.\n  In fact, a constituent of mine from Norwalk, OH, Tom Secor, who owns \nhis\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nown small business, came to my office and told a story about a business \ntrip he made to China. He said that he saw an editorial in a Chinese \nnewspaper that was discussing all the concerns that Americans have with \nChinese competition. The conclusion of the editorial was that the \nAmericans could solve most of their problems with Chinese competition \nif they would just reform their own Tax Code. Imagine that: even \nCommunist China knows that the United States needs tax reform to stay \ncompetitive, but for some reason we refuse to learn that lesson \nourselves.\n  In addition to slashing the corporate rate on U.S. production, my \nlegislation would also take steps to make small businesses more \ncompetitive and simplify the tax rules for individuals operating in the \nglobal economy. Specifically, my legislation would increase the \ndomestic activities deduction for partnerships, S corporations, and \nsole proprietorships to 12 percent from 9 percent; make permanent the \n2003 expansion in small business expensing; simplify the international \ntax rules for Americans working abroad by repealing complex and \npunitive rules enacted in 2006; and repeal the burdensome 3 percent \nwithholding requirement for contractors, also enacted in 2006.\n  These tax reforms, which will help create high-paying jobs in the \nUnited States, will be paid for by repealing a number of existing tax \nbreaks that favor foreign competition and that encourage companies to \nmove jobs and profits overseas. Among those tax breaks I would \neliminate are tax shelters that allow foreign competitors to hide their \nU.S. income offshore, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic \nbusinesses such as small manufacturers and domestic insurance \ncompanies; tax credits for moving our Nation's technological \ninnovation--such as patents, copyrights, and ``know-how''--overseas, \nalong with the high-wage manufacturing jobs that accompany that \nintellectual property; tax loopholes that encourage U.S. corporations \nto reincorporate as foreign corporations; a tax exemption for \nexecutives of offshore hedge funds if the executives put their money in \ncertain deferred compensation plans; and tax breaks for foreign oil and \ngas production.\n  Reducing the tax rates on corporate and small business income should \nlead to job creation and wage increases for American workers. Paying \nfor these tax cuts by eliminating tax breaks for foreign production and \noffshore tax shelters means we can accomplish these goals in a fiscally \nresponsible manner. My legislation is intended to be revenue neutral, \nas I believe that we can enact progrowth tax policy without increasing \nthe national debt.\n  In 1984, President Ronald Reagan declared to the American people that \nthe Tax Code was fundamentally unfair and that he was going to reform \nit. President Reagan held his belief in the unjustness of the Tax Code \ndeep in his heart. He knew that hundreds of targeted tax subsidies for \nthe benefit of powerful interests forced average Americans to pay \nhigher marginal rates and reduced economic growth. He saw tax reform \nnot as a retreat from his 1981 tax relief agenda but, rather, as a \nlogical continuation and enhancement of that agenda. The Tax Reform Act \nof 1986 was the culmination of the quest he began in 1981 to create a \nTax Code with low marginal rates that raised the necessary revenue to \nfund the government with the least possible interference in our free \nmarket economy.\n  We must enact fundamental tax reform to help make the Tax Code \nsimple, fair, transparent, and economically efficient. According to the \nPresident's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, headed by former \nSenators Connie Mack and John Breaux, only 13 percent of taxpayers file \nwithout the help of either a tax preparer or computer software. Since \nenacting the Tax Reform Act of 1986--legislation intended to simplify \nthe filing process for taxpayers--over 15,000 provisions have been \nadded to the Internal Revenue Code.\n  It is not just a matter of saving taxpayers time and effort. This is \nabout saving taxpayers real money. The Tax Foundation has estimated \nthat comprehensive tax reform could save Americans as much as $265 \nbillion in compliance costs associated with preparing their returns. \nNow, that would be a real tax reduction that wouldn't cost the Treasury \none dime.\n  I have been working on tax reform for years. In 2003, I attached an \namendment to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act that \nwould have created a blue ribbon commission to study fundamental tax \nreform. The amendment was adopted by voice vote but later was removed \nin conference.\n  In the autumn of 2004, I offered my tax reform commission amendment \nagain, this time to the American Jobs Creation Act. The Senate again \nadopted my amendment. During conference negotiations, the White House \ncontacted me and requested that I withdraw my amendment because the \nPresident was preparing to take a leadership role by appointing his own \ntax reform panel. I enthusiastically agreed to defer to his leadership, \nand I withdrew my amendment. It seemed to me that the tax reform \nbandwagon was finally starting to roll.\n  In January 2005, President Bush announced the creation of an all-star \npanel, led by former Senators Connie Mack and John Breaux, and that \npanel spent most of the year engaging the American public to develop \nproposals to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more conducive to \neconomic growth. In November 2005, the panel issued its final report. \nWhile not perfect in anyone's mind, the panel's two plans provided a \nstarting point for developing tax reform legislation that would \nrepresent a huge improvement over the current system. The panel's \nproposals belong as a key part of the national discussion on \nfundamental tax reform.\n  Some of my colleagues will suggest that we can just increase marginal \nrates to raise the revenue we need. But in a competitive global \neconomy, I can't understand why we would choose such a self-defeating \napproach. Higher marginal rates on an already-broken tax system would \nonly discourage economic ingenuity and reduce U.S. competitiveness.\n  Tinkering with the current Tax Code won't get it done. Tinkering is \nwhat got us into this mess in the first place. It is time to rip the \nTax Code out by its roots and replace it with something that works. We \nmust create a new tax system that is conducive to job creation and \neconomic growth. We should start by addressing one of the biggest \nproblems with the current code: it rewards moving production activity--\nand the good-paying jobs that accompany such activity--overseas. It \ntaxes domestic production heavily but taxes foreign production lightly. \nIt imposes the second highest corporate tax rate in the developed world \nbut collects one of the smallest amounts of corporate tax as a share of \nthe economy. Such a system sounds absolutely perverse, but that is what \nwe have in the United States. The MADE in the USA Tax Act is intended \nto fix that.\n  I know there is bipartisan support in this Chamber to move forward on \nfundamental tax reform. It probably won't happen this year, but that \ndoesn't mean that we shouldn't get started right away. We need to start \nsetting the table so that a new President and a new Congress can hit \nthe ground running in 2009 and enact comprehensive tax reform that \nmakes the code simple, fair, and progrowth. I hope my colleagues will \ntake a close look at the MADE in the USA Tax Act and join me in trying \nto make it a key part of our future efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 3164. A bill to amend tile XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce fraud under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, ``the first important rule of fraud \ncontrol is: What you see is not the problem. It is what we don't see \nthat really does the damage, and the efficacy of control systems \ndepends upon how well they uncover, and then suppress, the invisible \nbulk of the problem.'' Such are the words of the preeminent expert on \nhealth care fraud, Harvard, Kennedy School of Government Professor, \nMalcolm Sparrow.\n  Just last week, the Washington Post ran a front-page article, which I \nwould ask to be entered into the record, ``Medical Fraud a Growing \nProblem: Medicare Pays Most Claims Without Review.'' The story detailed \nhow one\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\nwoman, defrauded the Government out of $105 million using just a laptop \nwhile sitting in her Mediterranean-style townhouse.\n  While the lottery's slogan is ``All you need is a dollar and dream.'' \nThis woman discovered something better. Maybe Medicare should adopt the \nslogan ``All you need is a Provider Number and a dream.''\n  Quite simply, Medicare is not sophisticated enough to address the \nfraud that runs rampant through it. Every year, Medicare's anemic fraud \ncontrols let slip by an array of schemes that cost the Medicare program \nand taxpayers $60 billion, if not more. That is 20 percent of all \nMedicare spending.\n  Often, as pointed out by the Washington Post article, Medicare pays \nclaims with little or no review as to why or where the checks are going \nor to whom. One phantom company, comprising nothing more than two \nrented mailboxes and a phone number was paid $2.1 million over a 6 \nmonth period. In another case, the owner of the fraudulent company was \nan unemployed tow truck operator who used the identities of dozens of \ndead patients. Again, ``All you need is a Provider Number and a \ndream.''\n  Medicare fraud is not limited to one segment of the health care \nsector. There are numerous examples of fraud conducted by physicians, \ndentists, health systems, laboratories, teaching hospitals, patients, \nand billing specialists to name a few. While I would agree that most of \nthese groups are operating on the straight and narrow, the truth \nremains that the losses associated with Medicare fraud are helping \ndrive the program to bankruptcy.\n  Unfortunately, conducting Medicare fraud has such a low risk of \ngetting caught and less severe punishment yet high reward that it has \neven attracted organized crime. Again, ``All you need is a Provider \nNumber and a dream.''\n  Usually, the only way Medicare is able to recoup a small portion of \nthe annual $60 billion in losses is by expending more resources on \ninvestigations and law enforcement activities through the Office of \nInspector General and Department of Justice. While these agencies have \ndone a commendable job in combating fraud, to a large extent it is good \nmoney chasing bad.\n\n  Sometimes systems are set-up to fail. In this case, the Medicare \nfraud prevention program is not only set-up to fail, it is nearly non-\nexistent.\n  We need to go from ``pay and chase'' to ``detect and prevent.'' \nMedicare needs to be mobile and it needs to be focused on preventing \ncriminals from ever getting paid in the first place. Medicare needs a \nsystem that will continually, as Malcolm Sparrow said: ``uncover, and \nthen suppress.''\n  Today, I am proud to join Senator Martinez in what I hope is the \nfirst in a line of necessary common sense solutions to this problem. \nThe Seniors and Taxpayers Obligation Protection Act or STOP Act, will \nprotect honest taxpayers, seniors, and providers, by strengthening the \nMedicare program itself.\n  To prevent fraud, the STOP Act employs lessons from the private \nsector and moves Medicare into the 21st century. For example, Medicare \nmay be the only program, company, or industry left in the country that \nstill thinks it is a good idea to use social security numbers for \nidentification. In a time where a stolen social security number is a \nstolen identity, Medicare has not stopped printing it on identification \ncards that are sent through the mail.\n  Even worse, when seniors report that their social security number is \nbeing used fraudulently to bill for services in Medicare that they \ndidn't receive, Medicare has no ability to stop paying claims on that \nsocial security number or provide the senior with a new number. \nMedicare has ignored the warnings of the Government Accountability \nOffice and the pleas of groups like AARP and Consumers Union to change \nthis practice. Passage of the STOP Act will mean Medicare can ignore it \nno longer.\n  The STOP Act requires physicians in high risk areas to review the \nclaims they submitted, similar to how you or I would review our credit \ncard statement at the end of the month to ensure there are no mistaken \nor fraudulent charges.\n  It implements prepayment fraud detection methods, such as site \nvisits, data analysis, and integrity reviews, so that a guy with a \nmailbox can no longer rely on ``All you need is a Supplier Number and a \nDream.''\n  It ensures providers are billing for only those services for which \nthey are qualified.\n  It tracks the usage of durable medical equipment and it conducts a \nstudy on the implementation prospects of real-time claims analysis \ntechnology.\n  Yes, many acts of fraud may be invisible, but it doesn't make them \nundetectable, and it certainly doesn't mean that we should just turn a \nblind eye. I hope my colleagues and members of the health sector will \njoin Senator Martinez and me in stepping up to the task of being part \nof the solution. Our seniors, our providers, and our taxpayers deserve \nbetter accountability from Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3167. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \nconditions under which veterans, their surviving spouses, and their \nchildren may be treated as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould end an arbitrary process through which our own Government takes \naway the Second Amendment rights of American veterans.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \nAct prohibits the sale of firearms to those who have been ``adjudicated \nas a mental defective.''\n  The Government maintains a database on these individuals called the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System, or ``NICS.'' The \nBrady Law and the NICS database aims to prevent those who may pose a \ndanger to society or themselves from purchasing a firearm.\n  Gun shop owners use NICS to screen customers before selling a \nfirearm. Needless to say, it is a serious matter to have one's name on \nthe NICS. Every American should expect a rigorous and fair process \nbefore their right to bear arms is taken away.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to certain veterans, surviving spouses, \nand children, the process is neither rigorous nor fair.\n  Since 1999, VA has sent the names of 116,000 of its beneficiaries to \nthe FBI for inclusion on the NICS.\n  None of these names were sent to the FBI because they were determined \nto be a danger to themselves or others. They were listed in NICS \nbecause they could not manage their financial affairs. We should not \ntake away a Constitutional right because someone can't balance a \ncheckbook or pay their bills on time.\n  This practice is arbitrary, unfair, and applies a double standard.\n  VA's review process for assigning a fiduciary is meant to determine \none's financial responsibility in managing VA-provided disability \ncompensation, pension, and other benefits. For example, a veteran may \nbe assigned a fiduciary if they have credit problems.\n  The VA focuses on whether or not benefits paid by VA will be spent in \nthe manner in which they were intended. Nothing involved with VA's \nappointment of a fiduciary even gets at the question of whether an \nindividual is a danger to themselves or others, or whether the person \nshould own a firearm.\n  Yet that is exactly what happens if VA appoints a fiduciary. Over \n116,000 individuals have been listed in NICS since 1999 because they \nwere appointed a fiduciary. This includes veterans, surviving spouses, \nand even children.\n  This process is not only arbitrary, it is unfair. Taking away a \nConstitutional right is a serious action and veterans should be \nafforded due process under the law. At the very least, we should expect \nsuch decisions to be made by a competent judicial authority and not by \ncivilian government employees.\n  The current practice is also a double standard. Only VA beneficiaries \nfall under these guidelines. The Social Security Administration assigns \nfiduciaries to help beneficiaries, yet the Social Security \nAdministration does not send their names to the NICS.\n  Why are we singling out those who fought for this country and those \nwho sacrificed while their spouse or parent served?\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\n  My legislation would end this arbitrary and unfair practice that \nstrips the finest men and women of this country of their right to bear \narms. This legislation would require a judicial authority to determine \nthat an individual is a danger to themselves or others before their \nSecond Amendment rights are taken away.\n  I am not here to ask that we put guns in the hands of dangerous \npeople. I am here to ask that we treat our veterans fairly and we take \nthe rights of our veterans seriously.\n  No matter where my colleagues fall on the gun issue, I hope we can \nall agree that we need a process that is consistent and fair. Our \nveterans took an oath to uphold the Constitution. They deserve to enjoy \nthe rights they fought so hard to protect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3170.

I want to thank Senator Snowe for her \ntremendous leadership on the problem this bill is designed to address, \nwhich is a critically important issue for our region that we have \nworked together on for many years. That issue is the skyrocketing price \nof heating oil, which millions of families in the Northeast are \ndependent on to heat their homes through our long, cold winters.\n  According to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency, \nEIA, 6.2 million of the 8 million households in the U.S. that use \nheating oil to heat their homes are in the Northeast, or approximately \n78 percent. As crude oil and gasoline prices have risen higher and \nhigher, the cost of heating oil has risen as well. Currently, heating \noil is far and away the costliest method of heating homes, costing \nfamilies an average of nearly $2000 per year, and much more in the \ncoldest areas. Overall, heating a home with heating oil costs twice the \nnational average of all fuels combined, yet most families in the \nNortheast have little choice. Even in some of our region's cities, \nthere are no natural gas lines or other sources of home heating \navailable to residents.\n  This dependence on heating oil is stretching many families' budgets \nto the breaking point. Where once low and moderate income families \ncould struggle through the winter, soaring heating oil prices are \nforcing people to choose between heating their homes, driving their \ncars to and from work, and putting food on the table for their \nfamilies. The EIA estimated that this year, it will cost $1,962 to heat \na home with oil, a 33 percent increase from last year and a 117 percent \nincrease since 2004. In just 4 short years, the cost of heating a home \nwith oil has gone up more than $1000 dollars! Many families and seniors \nliving on fixed incomes simply cannot bear this burden.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I are proposing a price trigger to \nprovide for oil to be released from the Northeast Home Heating Oil \nReserve. This is a 2-million barrel reserve I originally worked to \ncreate in 2000, along with my colleague from Maine and other Senators \nfrom the Northeast, to protect the residents of the region from severe \nprice shocks to the heating oil market. Given the record heating oil \nprices we are experiencing today, we believe it would be reasonable to \nuse this reserve to try to cushion those dependent on heating oil to \nget through the winter. From November through March, the Secretary of \nEnergy would conduct a survey to determine the price of a gallon of \nheating oil on the first of each month. If the price meets or exceeds \n$4 per gallon, this would trigger an immediate release of 20 percent of \nthe Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. This oil would then be sold on \nthe open market to lower the price of heating oil in the region.\n  The revenue raised by the sale would then be devoted to the \nWeatherization Assistance Program to help low income heating oil \ncustomers increase the energy efficiency of their homes. Experience has \nshown that properly weatherizing homes can increase their energy \nefficiency by 20-30 percent, reducing energy consumption and lowering \nmonthly utility bills. However, most low and middle income families \ncannot afford the upfront investment necessary to reap these benefits. \nThe Weatherization Assistance Program is an enormously successful \nprogram designed to help families make that initial investment.\n  This bill will not solve our Nation's energy crisis, nor will this \nalone solve the problem of high heating oil prices in the Northeast. As \nthe Senator from Maine well knows, we need to devote far more money to \nprograms like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and we \nneed to take a serious look at restructuring our Nation's comprehensive \nenergy policy. But this legislation is a very good first step toward \neasing the pain so many residents of the Northeast and my State of \nConnecticut are feeling. I urge my colleagues to support us in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/19/senate-section/article/S5838-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5838-S5839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 596--CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON CELTICS ON WINNING THE \n           2008 NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Gregg) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n       Whereas on June 17, 2008, the Boston Celtics won the 2008 \n     National Basketball Association Championship (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``2008 Championship'') in 6 games over \n     the Los Angeles Lakers;\n       Whereas the 2008 Championship was the 17th world \n     championship won by the Celtics, the most in the history of \n     the National Basketball Association (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NBA'');\n       Whereas the 2008 Championship marked the culmination of the \n     greatest single season turnaround in the history of the NBA, \n     as the Celtics improved from a record of 24-58 during the \n     2007-2008 season to a league-best 66-16 mark during the 2007-\n     2008 campaign;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics NBA Championship team, like all \n     great Celtics champions of the past, epitomized team work, \n     selflessness, character, effort, camaraderie, toughness, and \n     determination;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics honored the rich legacy of their \n     franchise, which was--\n       (1) established by a legion of all-time greats, including \n     Bill Russell, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Bob Cousy, Tom \n     Heinsohn, K.C.

The notice \n     shall include a copy of the complaint to be filed to initiate \n     such civil action, except that if it is not feasible for the \n     State to provide such prior notice, the State shall provide \n     notice immediately upon instituting such civil action.\n       (3) Intervention by ftc.--Upon receiving the notice \n     required by paragraph (2), the Commission may intervene in \n     such civil action and upon intervening--\n       (A) be heard on all matters arising in such civil action;\n       (B) remove the action to the appropriate United States \n     district court; and\n       (C) file petitions for appeal of a decision in such civil \n     action.\n       (4) Savings clause.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     prevent the attorney general of a State from exercising the \n     powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of such \n     State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or \n     affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of documentary and other evidence. Nothing in this \n     section shall prohibit the attorney general of a State, or \n     other authorized State officer, from proceeding in State or \n     Federal court on the basis of an alleged violation of any \n     civil or criminal statute of that State.\n       (5) Venue; service of process; joinder.--In a civil action \n     brought under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) the venue shall be a judicial district in which the the \n     defendant is found, is an inhabitant, or transacts business \n     or wherever venue is proper under section 1391 of title 28, \n     United States Code; and\n       (B) process may be served without regard to the territorial \n     limits of the district or of the State in which the civil \n     action is instituted.\n       (6) Preemptive action by ftc.--Whenever a civil action or \n     an administrative action has been instituted by or on behalf \n     of the Commission for violation of any provision of law or \n     rule described in paragraph (1), no State may, during the \n     pendency of such action instituted by or on behalf of the \n     Commission, institute a civil action under that paragraph \n     against any defendant named in the complaint in such action \n     for violation of any law or rule as alleged in such \n     complaint.\n       (7) Award of costs and fees.--If the attorney general of a \n     State prevails in any civil action under paragraph (1), the \n     State can recover reasonable costs and attorney fees from the \n     lender or related party.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4997.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began \n     operation on October 1, 1958, with about 8,000 employees and \n     an annual budget of $100,000,000;\n       (2) over the next 50 years, the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration has been involved in many defining \n     events which have shaped the course of human history and\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n     demonstrated to the world the character of the people of the \n     United States;\n       (3) among the many firsts by the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration are that--\n       (A) on December 6, 1958, the United States launched Pioneer \n     3, the first United States satellite to ascend to an altitude \n     of 63,580 miles;\n       (B) on March 3, 1959, the United States sent Pioneer 4 to \n     the Moon, successfully making the first United States lunar \n     flyby;\n       (C) on April 1, 1960, the United States launched TIROS 1, \n     the first successful meteorological satellite, observing \n     Earth's weather;\n       (D) on May 5, 1961, Freedom 7, carrying Astronaut Alan B. \n     Shepard, Jr., was the first American space flight involving \n     human beings;\n       (E) on February 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first \n     American to circle the Earth, making 3 orbits in his \n     Friendship 7 Mercury spacecraft;\n       (F) on December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 became the first \n     spacecraft to commit a successful planetary flyby (Venus);\n       (G) on April 6, 1965, the United States launched Intelsat I \n     (also known as Early Bird 1), the first commercial satellite \n     (communications), into geostationary orbit;\n       (H) on June 3 through 7, 1965, the second piloted Gemini \n     mission, Gemini IV, stayed aloft for 4 days, and astronaut \n     Edward H. White II performed the first EVA or ``spacewalk'' \n     by an American;\n       (I) on June 2, 1966, Surveyor 1 became the first American \n     spacecraft to soft-land on the Moon;\n       (J) on May 31, 1971, the United States launched Mariner 9, \n     the first mission to orbit another planet (Mars) beginning \n     November 13, 1971;\n       (K) on April 12, 1981, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration launched the Space Shuttle Columbia on the \n     first flight of the Space Transportation System (STS-1).\n       (L) on June 18, 1983, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration launched Space Shuttle Challenger (STS-7) \n     carrying 3 mission specialists, including Sally K. Ride, the \n     first woman astronaut;\n       (M) in another historic mission, 2 months later, the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched STS-8 \n     carrying the first black American astronaut, Guion S. \n     Bluford; and\n       (N) on July 23, 1999, the Space Shuttle Columbia's 26th \n     flight was led by Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first \n     woman to command a Shuttle mission;\n       (4) on April 9, 1959, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration unveiled the Mercury astronaut corps, 7 men \n     with ``the right stuff'': John H. Glenn, Jr., Walter M. \n     Schirra, Jr., Alan B. Shepard, Jr., M. Scott Carpenter, L. \n     Gordon Cooper, Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, and Donald K. \n     ``Deke'' Slayton;\n       (5) on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy, reflecting \n     the highest aspirations of the American people, proclaimed: \n     ``I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the \n     goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon \n     and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in \n     this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more \n     important in the long-range exploration of space; and none \n     will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.'';\n       (6) on September 19, 1961, the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration announced that the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration center dedicated to human space \n     flight would be built in Houston, Texas;\n       (7) on February 17, 1973, the Manned Spacecraft Center in \n     Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center;\n       (8) on December 21, 1968, Apollo 8 took off atop a Saturn V \n     booster from the Kennedy Space Center for a historic mission \n     to orbit the Moon;\n       (9) as Apollo 8 traveled outward, the crew focused a \n     portable television camera on Earth and for the first time \n     humanity saw its home from afar, a tiny, lovely, and fragile \n     ``blue marble'' hanging in the blackness of space;\n       (10) this transmission and viewing of Earth from a distance \n     was an enormously significant accomplishment and united the \n     Nation at a time when American society was in crisis over \n     Vietnam, race relations, urban problems, and a host of other \n     difficulties;\n       (11) on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. \n     Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin made the first lunar landing \n     mission while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo \n     command module;\n       (12) Armstrong set foot on the surface of the Moon, telling \n     the millions of listeners that it was ``one small step for a \n     man, one giant leap for mankind'', and Aldrin soon followed \n     and planted an American flag, but omitted claiming the land \n     for the United States, as had routinely been done during \n     European exploration of the Americas;\n       (13) the 2 Moon walkers left behind an American flag and a \n     plaque bearing the inscription: ``Here Men From The Planet \n     Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon. Jul. 1969 A.D. We Came in \n     Peace for All Mankind.'';\n       (14) on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was \n     launched into space aboard the STS-31 mission of the Space \n     Shuttle Discovery, and since then, the Hubble has \n     revolutionized astronomy, while expanding our knowledge of \n     the universe and inspiring millions of scientists, students, \n     and members of the public with its unprecedented deep and \n     clear images of space;\n       (15) on July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars \n     and on January 29, 1998, an International Space Station \n     agreement among 15 countries met in Washington, DC, to sign \n     agreements to establish the framework for cooperation among \n     the partners on the design, development, operation, and \n     utilization of the Space Station;\n       (16) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's \n     stunning achievements over the last 50 years have been won \n     for all mankind at great cost and sacrifice; in the quest to \n     explore the universe, many National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration employees have lost their lives, including the \n     crews of Apollo 1, the Space Shuttle Challenger, and the \n     Space Shuttle Columbia;\n       (17) the success of the United States space exploration \n     program in the 20th Century augurs well for its continued \n     leadership in the 21st Century, such leadership being \n     attributable to the remarkable and indispensable partnership \n     between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and \n     its 10 space and research centers, including--\n       (A) from small spacecraft to supercomputers, science \n     missions and payloads to thermal protection systems, \n     information technology to aerospace, the Ames Research Center \n     in California's Silicon Valley, which provides products, \n     technologies, and services that enable NASA missions and \n     expand human knowledge.\n       (B) the Dryden Flight Research Center, the leading center \n     for innovative flight research;\n       (C) the Glenn Research Center, which develops power, \n     propulsion, and communication technologies for space flight \n     systems and aeronautics research;\n       (D) the Goddard Space Flight Center, which specializes in \n     research to expand knowledge on the Earth and its \n     environment, the solar system, and the universe through \n     observations from space;\n       (E) the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the leading center for \n     robotic exploration of the Solar System;\n       (F) the Johnson Space Center, which manages the \n     development, testing, production, and delivery of all United \n     States human spacecraft and all human spacecraft-related \n     functions;\n       (G) the Kennedy Space Center, the gateway to the Universe \n     and world leader in preparing and launching missions around \n     the Earth and beyond;\n       (H) the Langley Research Center, which continues to forge \n     new frontiers in aviation and space research for aerospace, \n     atmospheric sciences, and technology commercialization to \n     improve the way the world lives;\n       (I) the Marshall Space Flight Center, a world leader in \n     developing space transportation and propulsion systems that \n     accelerate exploration and scientific discovery, including \n     the Michoud Assembly Facility, which has been a world-class \n     facility since 1961 for fabrication of large space \n     structures, including the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle \n     External Tank, and which will have a critical role in the \n     Constellation program, including manufacturing major pieces \n     of the Orion crew capsule, the Ares I upper stage, and the \n     Ares V core stage; and\n       (J) the Stennis Space Center, which is responsible for \n     rocket propulsion testing and for partnering with industry to \n     develop and implement remote sensing technology;\n       (18) the United States should pay tribute to the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration, and to its successful \n     partnerships with the space and research centers, by minting \n     and issuing a commemorative silver dollar coin; and\n       (19) the surcharge proceeds from the sale of a \n     commemorative coin would generate valuable funding for the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration Families \n     Assistance Fund, for the purposes of providing need-based \n     financial assistance to the families of any National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel who lose their \n     lives as a result of injuries suffered in the performance of \n     their official duties, and for other worthy and important \n     purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3.
