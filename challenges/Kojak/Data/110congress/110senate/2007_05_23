Mr. President, on Tuesday, I came to the Senate floor \nto present ideas on health care reform, particularly on the problem of \nfixing the internal operations of our broken health care system so that \nit runs better, at less cost, and with improved care.\n  I suggested that three fundamental things are wrong with our health \ncare\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nsystem: One, it doesn't adequately provide quality care or invest in \nprevention; two, the system doesn't have adequate information \ntechnology infrastructure; and, three, the way we pay for health care \nsends perverse price signals that misdirect market forces.\n  I am here today to speak about quality reform, about those areas in \nour health care system where improving the quality of care will lower \nthe cost--let me repeat that--where improving the quality of care will \nlower the cost.\n  There is a lot at stake, in money and in lives. Up to 100,000 \nAmericans die every year as a result of unnecessary and avoidable \nmedical errors. By some measures these outcomes are even getting worse. \nA 2003 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine \nrevealed that the rate of hospital-acquired infections has actually \nincreased over 36 percent since 1999. This increase has occurred even \nthough we have shortened the average length of stay in a hospital and \ndecreased the number of inpatient surgeries. In other words, infection \nrates rose that much even though the opportunities for exposure \ndecreased.\n  Pennsylvania has recently chronicled hospital-acquired infection data \nfor its 168 general acute care hospitals. The numbers are staggering: \n19,154 patients acquired an infection while in the hospital in 2005, \nresulting in average commercial insurance payments of $45,601 higher \nthan for patients who did not contract infections. That is big money \nthat could be saved.\n  Remember the example I gave on Tuesday from Michigan's intensive care \nunit reform. In a 15-month span between March 2004 and June 2005, the \nproject saved 1,578 lives. It saved 81,020 days patients would \notherwise have spent in the hospital, at great expense; and it saved \nover $165 million just in a 15-month period.\n  However, it is not easy to pursue these quality reform initiatives. \nFunding is scarce, collaboration is required in an environment where \npeople are pretty mad at each other, and the economics are perilous. \nWhen doctors and hospitals go to the trouble to figure out quality \nreform and implement it and pay for it, the effect on them is lowered \nrevenues. Investing time and effort and capital in projects that reduce \nyour revenues is not a great business model, but that is our health \ncare system.\n  Thankfully, efforts to pursue quality reform--in all these indicated \nStates and locations on the chart--are flickering to life around the \ncountry, in local initiatives such as the Puget Sound Health Alliance \nin Washington, the Utah Health Information Network, the Indianapolis \nNetwork for Patient Care, and our own Rhode Island Quality Institute. \nThese groups have gathered health care industry players together to \nseek the holy grail of improved care at lower cost.\n  The fact that this is happening is itself a small miracle. The health \ncare system is acrid with soured, angry relationships. When I was \nattorney general of Rhode Island, negotiations took place between one \nof our major hospital chains and our major health insurer in my office. \nIt was not because I was a great mediator or that there was a role for \nthe attorney general in this, it was simply because they were so angry \nwith each other that I needed to calm things down and keep them in the \nroom so the negotiations could proceed. For a bunch of reasons, through \nour Government policy to shortchange providers, through the perverse \nreward structure of our health care system, and our HMO experiment, we \nhave encouraged combat among hospitals, doctors, and insurers, each \ntrying to push their costs onto somebody else rather than working \ntogether for the common good.\n  So these local health care quality initiatives from this toxic \nclimate are as marvelous as that spontaneous Christmas truce in World \nWar I, when the soldiers began singing Silent Night across the barbed-\nwire wasteland, as they came out from the cold, muddy trenches to share \ncigarettes and schnapps with the enemy, men they had just been mustard-\ngassing and machine-gunning.\n  Let me tell you about the Rhode Island Quality Institute. By the time \nI became attorney general, I was already deep into health care, having \nserved as insurance regulator, hospital trust administrator, fraud \nprosecutor, and health care reformer. I had seen firsthand the anger \nand the vitriol in the system. I had been successful in reforming the \nworkers' compensation system and was optimistic about what sensible \nreforms could do to repair a broken administrative system. I saw common \nground on how quality could lower cost. In 2001, I began to pull \ndoctors, nurses, insurers, regulators, pharmacists, academics, and \nhospital administrators together. Over many months, we developed a \nconcept of a statewide collaboration that would focus on producing \nsignificant, measurable improvements in health care quality, safety, \nand value in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Quality Institute was born.\n  Since then we have made significant progress in e-prescribing, \nelectronic health records, ICU infection rates, and health information \ninteroperability. This happened because the Quality Institute is a \nplace where health care leaders can work through health care problems, \ndespite economic signals that punish them for doing the right thing.\n  For example, in Rhode Island, our hospitals are pursuing a quality \nimprovement project in every intensive care unit in the State, modeled \non the Michigan program. The Rhode Island ICU program had a significant \nhurdle to overcome, however. The cost was expected to be $400,000 per \nyear to be borne by the hospitals. The savings, estimated to be $8 \nmillion per year, went to the payers. For its $400,000 invested, a \nhospital actually stood to lose money from shorter intensive care unit \nstays and fewer procedures.\n  For hospitals, truly pushing that quality envelope and striving for \nzero tolerance in infections in errors was economically self-abusive \nbehavior. It took the Christmas truce relationships developed within \nthe Rhode Island Quality Institute to overcome that obstacle.\n  Now similar things are happening all over the country, in little \nflickering beginnings of reform. The easiest and best way to promote \nquality reform that lowers cost is to feed, with Federal grants, a \nlittle kindling into these flickering flames; to tend them gently with \nFederal encouragement and support, to network them together to share \nenergy and information and ideas, to have Federal officials clear away \nregulatory obstacles to their initiatives, and to report on the best \nand brightest ideas and successes that emerge--in a nutshell, to create \na MacArthur genius grant program to encourage these efforts and to \nclear the way for them through the bureaucracy.\n  My legislation proposes a Federal grants program to do just that. A \nlittle money will go a long way. The CVS/Caremark charitable trust just \nguaranteed the Rhode Island Quality Institute $500,000 per year for the \nnext 5 years, a great expression of business support and confidence, \nand it has made a world of difference. Compare that half-million-dollar \nyearly investment to the savings from the Keystone project in Michigan \nover a little more than a year, 15 months--$165 million. What if every \nQuality Institute-type organization got a half million dollars? There \nare somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 such organizations around the \ncountry now. The total savings they can generate could be hundreds of \nmillions, billions of dollars perhaps, based on a yearly investment of \nperhaps $25 million.\n  Don't forget, it is not just money. The Keystone project saved over \n1,500 lives. Quality reform is already on the march in local \ncommunities. To make a significant difference, we need do no more on \nthe Federal level than support these initiatives, encourage new ones, \ntransmit best practices and ideas, and, when necessary, secure waivers \nfor them to help realize the promise of quality reform in both lives \nsaved and dollars saved.\n  I will close today by noting that if we can do three things \ntogether--quality reform, health IT investments, and reimbursement \nalignment--they will reinforce each other and compound the beneficial \neffects. Remember, health care is a dynamic system and cannot just be \ntold what to do. We have to identify the problems, find their causes, \nand repair them. That is not a partisan or even a political effort; it \nis a repair job, and it has no more a Democratic or a Republican nature \nto it than an engine tune-up or a plumbing repair. We should work \ntogether on\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nthis issue to get it right. Hundreds of billions of dollars are at \nstake, and terrible consequences await American families and businesses \nas health care costs mount if we fail in our duty. While we still have \nthe time before the economic, fiscal, and health consequences become \ntoo urgent for deliberate action, let us not fail in our duty. Let us \ngrasp the controls of change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nhigh gas prices we are seeing all over America and certainly on the \nwest coast, where Washington State is paying some of the highest gas \nprices in the Nation.\n  My point this morning is that we are approaching the Memorial Day \nweekend in which Americans will be remembering loved one and wanting to \nspend time with their families, but this Memorial Day might go on \nrecord as having the highest gas prices in our Nation's history. That \nmeans we in the Senate need to act on energy legislation that not only \ndiversifies us off fossil fuels into more renewables and alternative \nfuels, as well as pass energy conservation measures, it also means we \nneed to protect consumers with a strong bill that makes price gouging \nand market manipulation of energy markets illegal. We need to assure \nthat there are tough Federal penalties on the books so that any kind of \nmarket manipulations will be met with fines and penalties.\n  I know many people think this is all just about supply and demand. It \nis pretty hard to tell the people of Washington State it is just about \nsupply and demand when we have five refineries in the State of \nWashington and most of our oil comes from Alaska. And people say we are \nan isolated market. In fact, there are schools in our State that are \nfeeling the brunt. One of the school districts in the Yakima Valley, \nwhere buses travel more than 2,200 miles each day, will have to spend \nabout $125,000 more this year on fuel. That is revenue which could go \nto books or hiring teachers or other needs for the school. In Spokane, \nthe volunteers for Meals on Wheels, which usually delivers 350 meals a \nday to homebound elderly and disabled residents, are having to cut back \non their routes. Another constituent called the office to say he was \nhaving trouble paying for gas he needed to make the 80-mile round trip \nto the Tri-Cities to get kidney dialysis for his wife. That loving \nhusband said he was either going to have to quit his job or move closer \nto the facility so they could avoid paying high prices of gasoline. So \nwhile the pundits are talking about just supply and demand, my \nconstituents and many constituents across this country are feeling the \npain at the pump.\n  It is time that we act and pass the Cantwell-Smith bill, which we \nwill have a chance to do when we return after the Memorial Day recess. \nThis legislation is based on a New York law that has been held up in \nthe courts and gives the Federal Trade Commission the ability to do the \njob that is needed to investigate potential market manipulation and \nprice gouging. Many of the statutes that are on our books today are \ninadequate for looking at markets when there is a tight supply.\n  I heard a great deal about supply and demand during the Western \nenergy crisis. For probably my entire first year in office, that is all \nwe heard about from various people who wanted to say that the Enron \nproblems were nothing more than supply and demand and the failure to \nbuild more capacity. In fact, when it came down to it, there was a lot \nmore to this question than lack of supply in California. It turned out \nthat there were elaborate schemes to manipulate energy markets, with \nnames such as Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, schemes in which people \ndeliberately took supply off line or manipulated it just to drive up \nprices by suppressing supply.\n  My colleagues have worked hard in the last several years to put into \nstatute protections for consumers to make sure electricity and natural \ngas markets are not manipulated. This law is based on the same \nprotections the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC use to \nmake sure there is not manipulation in those markets. Why not have the \nsame protection for consumers as it relates to oil and gasoline \nmarkets?\n  I hope that when we return, we will give great attention to this \nissue and not be swayed by those who think this is a simple market-\ndemand issue. If we want to protect the consumers of this country, we \nwill pass a strong law that gives the ability for Federal regulators to \ndo their job. I believe there are real U.S. jobs, pensions, and \nbusinesses on the line if we do not act and act aggressively. The \nAmerican people want to know that the Senate is going to stand up and \ndo something about these record gas prices. They want to know that they \nare paying a fair and market-based rate for fuel and that they will \ncontinue to have the transparency in oil markets to make sure prices \nare reasonable and affordable, and they want to be sure we are \nempowering the right people to make sure an investigation takes place.\n  As I said, there is much that we need to do in the near term and the \nlong term for our energy markets to diversify and to give consumers \nreal choice at the pump, to make sure we are investing in conservation \nand fuel efficiency. But in the meantime, with tight energy markets, we \nneed to make sure we are giving consumers the protection they need and \nto pass this legislation when we return after the recess.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6497-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6497-S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to use time in morning \nbusiness to discuss the very important bill that is before us that we \nwill be going on in about 20 minutes, and that is the immigration bill. \nThis sometimes is referred to as the ``grand compromise.''\n  It is no secret that I have had concern about the immigration issue, \nand now specifically this bill, and in my opinion it contains an \namnesty program. I know around here those who are backing this ``grand \ncompromise'' don't want us to use the word ``amnesty,'' but I think if \nit walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. So I am \ngoing to refer to it as the amnesty program for illegal aliens already \nin the United States.\n  Not too many Senators today can say they voted for the 1986 amnesty \nbill. That was the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, the present law we are \namending. I did vote for that amnesty bill, so, in a sense, I voted for \namnesty. I am here to tell you that I felt at that time as though I \nwere doing the right thing. I can also tell you that now, looking at \nhistory, it was the wrong thing to do. I thought then that taking care \nof 3 million people illegally in the country would solve the problem \nonce and for all. I found out, however, if you reward illegality, you \nget more of it. Today, as everybody has generally agreed, we have 12 \nmillion people here illegally.\n  I did believe that bill would solve our problems, but it was not only \nshortsighted, the one we passed 20 years ago, it turned out to be \nunworkable. It was soft on enforcement and weak on legal reforms. We \nbelieved a legalization component was in the best interest of the \ncountry.\n  The American people, myself included, thought that illegal \nimmigration would decline with an amnesty program. We were wrong. The \n1986 legislation failed us, as well intended as it was. That was not a \nbill that went through very quickly. That bill was worked on over a \nperiod of 6 years, as we have been working on other immigration \nlegislation at least over a 3- or 4-year period of time.\n  Today we are back as a body we call the Senate to put another bandaid \non this issue. I don't blame the American people for being angry or \nrejecting the promises some are making that we will enforce our laws \nfrom now forward because I heard that same thing in 1986--from now \nforward. I think it is fair to say the people of this country are \ncynical on this issue. They don't have any\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nfaith that the law is going to be enforced.\n  One specific aspect of this bill that is so concentrated on \nenforcement, first, before we do anything else, is called the trigger \nmechanism. I am going to talk about that trigger mechanism. Before I \nget to the amnesty program and trigger, I want to point out that the \ntrigger that is included in this substitute, the trigger says the Y and \nthe Z visa program would be subject to a trigger. I wish to point to \nthe famous Trigger, Roy Rogers' Trigger. I think everybody knows about \nthat Trigger. I point to that because I think, if Roy Rogers were here \ntoday--and he has been dead about 20 years--he would say: Boys, saddle \nup. There is going to be a rough ride ahead for us.\n  The ``Trigger'' is coming in handy today. He first galloped into this \nChamber when I used ``Trigger'' during a budget resolution because \nthere is a trigger in the budget resolution just adopted. Now \n``Trigger'' is back for the immigration debate because there is a \ntrigger mechanism in this bill.\n  You can see from the chart that Trigger is a very impressive-looking \nhorse. He looks big and strong and probably can help do some of the \nchores around the farm. I am sure my grandkids would like to ride \nTrigger, if they knew he was safe to ride. This horse and its rider \nlook very safe and confident. But I wish to make the point, in this \nbill, with a trigger mechanism, we can't trust the trigger in this \nbill. It is false and it is misleading and that is what I wish to point \nout.\n  I have heard Members of this body talk about how amnesty would not \nstart until the trigger is pulled. It says on page 2, ``with the \nexception of the probationary benefits,'' the Y and Z visa programs \ncannot start until certain actions and certain items are completed. So \n12 million illegal aliens will apply and likely get a probationary \ncard. This card gives the illegal alien a work authorization, a Social \nSecurity number, and protection from removal. That is problem No. 1. \nAmnesty is given away before we even get to the trigger.\n  I wish to talk about four of the key actions that the trigger \nrequires. First, it requires the establishment of an electronic \nemployer verification system. I am a champion for that concept--make \nthe employer responsible for making sure the person is legally in the \ncountry. In fact, I wrote title III last year. It could be a very solid \nenforcement tool. But the trigger only says it needs to be established. \nIt says nothing about requiring all businesses to use it. Under the \ncompromise, employers would not be forced to use it until up to 3 years \nafter the date of enactment.\n  Second, the trigger says that 18,000 Border Patrol agents have to be \nhired. According to the Department of Homeland Security, we already \nhave 14,000 agents, so the trigger requires that 4,000 more are hired. \nSure, we can hire these agents. But the trigger doesn't require that \nthe agents be trained and stationed and doing their job.\n  Third, the trigger says we have to construct 370 miles of real fence \nalong the border. I understand this construction is currently underway. \nCongress authorized 700 miles of fencing in the Secure Fence Act of \nlast year. We also provided billions of dollars for fencing and \ninfrastructure last year. Why doesn't the trigger require that all 700 \nmiles has to be constructed?\n  The trigger also says the Department of Homeland Security needs \nresources to detain up to 27,500 aliens per day on an annual basis. If \nthey are caught, you have to have someplace to secure them. The problem \nis these spaces are full this very day.\n  How do these trigger actions, then, add to our present day \nenforcement? The impression is left by the author of the trigger--and I \nthink it is the intent of that author and the ``grand compromise''--\nthat all these security provisions are going to be in place before any \nof the other provisions of the law, such as allowing legality of people \nhere illegally--before those provisions can go into effect.\n  Fourth, the trigger requires the United States to end what we call \nthe catch-and-release practice. Maybe it is late-breaking news to some \naround here, but we ended that practice already. Secretary Chertoff was \non TV, telling the world on August 23, last year, that he ended catch \nand release.\n  However, further along in the bill it says--and it is referred to as \nOTMS, ``other than Mexicans''--can be released into our community on a \n$5,000 bond. The policy of catch and release will not end. This part of \nthe trigger in my judgment is false and misleading.\n  There is a lot missing from the trigger. For example, title I of the \ncompromise has border security requirements, but they are not in the \ntrigger. The bill requires the Department to have a national border \nsecurity strategy and surveillance plan. One would think a plan is \nnecessary right away in order to secure the borders, not after the \ntrigger is pulled.\n  The trigger does not include authorizations for a number of Homeland \nSecurity personnel. While the bill requires the Department to hire more \ninvestigators for alien smuggling and more interior enforcement \npersonnel, these requirements are not part of the trigger.\n  I think, before an amnesty starts, we should require interior \nenforcement measures to be met. Our national security is not just a \nborder issue.\n  Finally, I think the trigger should include something we have been \ntrying to do since 1996, after the first attacks on the World Trade \nCenter. Congress enacted a law that requires an entry and exit system \nto track all foreign travelers. That is known as the US-VISIT Program. \nWe had to endure another attack in 2001 before people took the entry \nand exit system seriously. We got it partly implemented, but the \nadministration decided on their own that the exit portion was not worth \nthe cost, so that 1996 mandate still remains ignored.\n  After 10 years, for us in Congress it is still like pulling teeth, \ntrying to get an implementation schedule out of the agency bureaucrats. \nI think we should be ashamed that is not done yet. This trigger is not \nlegitimate or worthy of the tradition of Roy Rogers. It is only a \ncoverup for amnesty.\n\n  I wish to address the flaws that I found in title 6, the part of the \nbill that gives probationary status and Z visas to illegal aliens \ncurrently in the United States. I am simply going to list my top 15 \nflaws. I don't have time to go into them in great detail. I will be \nglad to supply more detail if people want it.\n  No. 1, probationary benefits are not subject to the trigger. \nProbationary benefits, including work authorization, protection from \nremoval, and a Social Security number are granted to illegal aliens \nimmediately, even if the alien's background check is not complete. I \nwish to emphasize that point--even if the alien's background check is \nnot complete.\n  No. 2, many criminal provisions may be waived. Numerous criminal \nprovisions are waived for eligibility purposes. For example, an alien \nwho falsely claimed U.S. citizenship would be considered eligible for \namnesty, even though it is a crime.\n  No. 3, background checks are taken too lightly. An illegal alien can \napply for probationary status and a Z visa without thorough background \nchecks. Immediately after the bill passes, the alien can apply for \nprobationary legal status and receive a card, even if the alien's \nbackground check is not complete.\n  No. 4, illegal aliens are protected from removal. If an alien is in \nremoval proceedings or being detained at the time of enactment, the \nalien can still apply for amnesty. Aliens who apply for amnesty cannot \nbe detained or deported while their application is being processed, \nessentially giving them immunity from justice.\n  No. 5, terrorists and criminals can apply for amnesty. The Secretary \nof Homeland Security is allowed to waive the grounds of ineligibility \nfor those who have an outstanding final administrative order of \nremoval, deportation or exclusion. Currently, there are more than \n637,000 alien absconders in the United States who have defied orders to \nleave.\n  No. 6, taxes. Illegal aliens are required to provide the Internal \nRevenue Service information about tax payments only when applying for \nlegal permanent residence if that avenue is pursued. Illegal aliens can \nskirt the Federal, State and local tax laws because it is not a \nrequirement to prove one has paid outstanding tax liabilities to get \nprobationary or Z status.\n  No. 7 limits eligibility to illegal aliens. It creates a Z \nnonimmigrant\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\nvisa program for illegal aliens and illegal aliens only. No one else is \neligible for this program, particularly those waiting their turn in \nline. Also, there is no cap on the number of eligible participants.\n  No. 8, indefinite renewal of the Z nonimmigration visas. Z \nnonimmigrant visas are valid for 4 years and may be renewed \nindefinitely. This is a disincentive for illegal aliens to pay the \n$4,000 penalty, touch back to their own country, and prove that they \npaid their taxes or receive a very important medical exam.\n  No. 9, health standards are ignored. No medical exam or immunizations \nare needed to get a Z visa.\n  No. 10, there is no incentive to learn English. There is no English \nrequirement to get a Z visa. Each Z nonimmigrant must only demonstrate \n``an attempt to gain an understanding of the English language'' upon \nthe first renewal of the Z visa. There are waivers even for that \nrequirement.\n  No. 11, green card applicants are not required to return to their \nhome country. Green card applicants, only for the principal alien, must \nbe filed in person outside the United States but not necessarily in the \nalien's country of origin.\n  The alien can then reenter, likely on the same day, under a Z \nnonimmigrant visa because it serves as a valid travel document. Again, \nthere are exceptions for the requirement.\n  No. 12: Fault with these provisions. Fines are, quite frankly, false \nand misleading. Not everyone is required to pay the $5,000 penalty. The \nprincipal alien pays some fines and fees, and the dependents only have \nto pay a processing and State-impact fund fee. To get a green card, if \nan alien intends to pursue this route, a Z-1 nonimmigrant must pay a \n$4,000 penalty. Z-2 and Z-3 aliens are only required to pay application \nfees.\n  No. 13: Fines will not adequately pay for the cost of amnesty. The \nbulk of the monetary fines are required at the end of the program. All \nfines may be paid in installments, and waivers are available in \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  No. 14: Impact on State and local government. State impact money will \nbe granted to States to provide services for noncitizens only, instead \nof providing services to all citizens impacted by the large number of \nillegal immigrants. Examples would be school systems and health care \nservices.\n  No. 15 and last: Revocations of terrorist visas. You know that visas \nrevoked on terrorism grounds--I am talking about terrorists--if a visa \nis revoked on terrorism grounds, it would allow Z visa holders to \nremain in the United States and use the U.S. court system to appeal \nthose terrorism charges.\n  The bill, including the amnesty program, does not address visa \nrevocation for any visa holder.\n  I would like someone to tell me that this is the last time we will do \nan amnesty because I heard that 20 years ago. I will not hold my \nbreath. Nobody is making any promises that this is the last amnesty, \nand that is because we all know amnesties will continue. We are on a \npath to make what I consider a mistake that I made in 1986. We ought to \nget it right and focus on the long-term solutions to this problem.\n  So I am going to be offering some amendments to fix some of these 15 \nflaws, but I am not sure it can be repaired at the end of the day. It \nis my plan, when we go into the bill, to offer an amendment, to lay an \namendment before the body.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.)

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To clarify that the revocation of an alien's visa or other \n            documentation is not subject to judicial review)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF VISA REVOCATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 221(i) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1201(i)) is amended by striking \n     ``There shall be no means of judicial review'' and all that \n     follows and inserting the following: ``Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, including section 2241 of title 28, \n     United States Code, any other habeas corpus provision, and \n     sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a revocation under this \n     subsection may not be reviewed by any court, and no court \n     shall have jurisdiction to hear any claim arising from, or \n     any challenge to, such a revocation.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (2) apply to all visas issued before, on, or after such \n     date.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the amendment I have before you is \ndealing with an issue I just described in morning business as one of 15 \nflaws in a very important part of this legislation. This amendment is \ngoing to revise current law related to visa revocation for visa holders \nwho are on U.S. soil.\n  Now, we have this situation which does not make sense. My amendment \nis meant to bring common sense to this. Under current law, visas \napproved or denied by a consular officer in some of our embassies \noverseas would be nonreviewable. In other words, what that consular \noffice said would be final. That person being denied a visa to come to \nthis country would not have access to courts because consular officers \nhave the final say when it comes to granting visas and allowing people \nto enter a country. So if you are a consular officer and you believe \nsomebody is a terrorist or a terrorist threat, you can deny the visa, \nno review.\n  However, if that person gets a visa and they come to this country and \nwe find out later on that they are a potential terrorist and should not \nhave come here in the first place and you want to get them out of the \ncountry as fast as you can--because that is surely what we would have \ndone with the 19 pilots who created the terror we had on September 11--\nthen that decision made when the person comes to this country, that \ndecision by the consular officer is reviewable in the U.S. courts.\n  Now, everybody is going to say: Well, that just does not make sense. \nYou know, the same person over in some foreign country wants to come \nhere, and the consular officer says: We can't let that person come here \nbecause he is a potential terrorist threat. Well, then they do not get \nto come here and nobody can review that. But if that very same person \ncame here and we decided they shouldn't have been here in the first \nplace, then they have access to our court system before they can be \nremoved. Thanks to a small provision inserted during conference \nnegotiations on the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, the visa holder at that point has more rights than he or she \nshould have. I think that is very obvious.\n  Now, the ability to deport an alien on U.S. soil with a revoked visa \nis nearly impossible if the alien is given the opportunity to appeal \nthe revocation. This section has made the visa revocation ineffective \nas an antiterrorism tool.\n  My amendment would treat visa revocations similar to visa denials \nbecause the right of that person to be in the United States is no \nlonger valid. In other words, if it was not valid for him to come here \nin the first place and it\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nwas not reviewable by the courts, and then they get here and for the \nsame reasons they should not be here--because they are a terrorist \nthreat--they should not have access to our courts.\n  So this exception has made the visa revocation ineffective as an \nantiterror tool. My amendment would treat visa revocations similar to \nvisa denials because the right of that person to be in the United \nStates is no longer valid. If they were originally denied a visa by the \nconsular officer, there would be no right to dispute; they would not be \nhere in the first place.\n  I asked Secretary Chertoff about the problem with our current law on \nthe visa revocation, and I want to quote from what he told the \nJudiciary Committee in March because I have been working on this \nproblem for a while. To quote Secretary Chertoff:\n\n       The fact is that we can prevent someone who's coming in as \n     a guest. We can say ``You can't come in overseas,'' but once \n     they come in, if they abuse their terms and conditions of \n     their coming in, we have to go through a cumbersome process. \n     That strikes me as not particularly sensible. People who are \n     admitted as guests, like guests in my house, if the guest \n     misbehaves, I just tell them to leave; they don't get to go \n     to court over it.\n\n  We can equate the role of homeowner to that of a consular officer. \nCurrently and historically, all decisions by consular officers with \nregard to the granting, the initial granting of visas are final and not \nsubject to review. Revocations shouldn't be treated differently in the \ncase of terrorists.\n  Why is this important to do? Consider visa revocations related to \nterrorism. Consider the 2003 Government Accountability Office report \nrevealing that suspected terrorists could stay in the country after \ntheir visas had been revoked on the grounds of terrorism because of a \nlegal loophole in the wording of revocation papers. This loophole came \nto light after the Government Accountability Office found that \nindividuals were granted visas that were later revoked because there \nwas evidence the persons had terrorism links and associations.\n  The FBI and the intelligence community suspected ties of terrorism in \nhundreds of applications. The FBI did not share this information with \nour consular officers in time, so the consular officers granted the \nvisas. So I suppose at that point you cannot blame the consular \nofficers when they did not have the information the FBI should have \ngiven to them. So then when they got the derogatory information about \nthese individuals from the FBI, then it was too late. They had already \nbeen granted visas. They were already here. The consular officers then \nhad to go through the process of revoking the visas. What the \nGovernment Accountability Office found was that even though the visas \nwere revoked, immigration officials could not do a thing about it. They \nwere handicapped from locating the visa holders and deporting them.\n  I wish to give you an example of how this hurts us today. A consular \nofficer grants a visa to a person, and that person makes his or her way \nwhere they were intended to come, to this great country of the United \nStates. After arriving in the United States, a consular office finds \nout that the foreign individual has ties to terrorism. Maybe the \nconsular officer found out that visa holder attended a terrorist \ntraining camp or maybe the intelligence community just informed the \nconsular officer that the visa holder was linked to the Taliban or \nmaybe our Government just learned that visa holder gave millions of \ndollars to a terrorist organization before they applied for a visa. \nThese are all very good reasons for revocation of a visa. If a person \nshould not have received a visa in the first place, then the consular \nofficer has to revoke it. Well, I mean if they had the visa then, you \nhave to go to the trouble of getting it revoked.\n  Three key points to consider: First, the decisions to revoke a visa \nare not taken lightly. If a consular officer needs to revoke a visa, \nthe case is thoroughly vetted. In fact, the case is decided back here \nin Washington, DC, at the highest levels. Second, consular officers do \nnot have the authority to revoke a visa based on suspicion. A \nrevocation must be based on actual finding that an alien is ineligible \nfor the visa. Third, consular officers give the visa holder an \nopportunity to explain their case. They may ask them to come to the \nembassy and defend themselves. So when a visa is revoked, it is very \nserious business. But the current law handicaps law enforcement and \nmakes it nearly impossible to deport the alien if they already made it \nto the United States.\n  Current law allows aliens to run to the steps of our country's \ncourthouses and take advantage of our system. Allowing review of a \nrevoked visa, especially on terrorism grounds, jeopardizes the \nclassified intelligence that led to the revocation. It can force \nagencies such as the FBI and the CIA to be hesitant to share any \ninformation. Current law could be reversing our progress on information \nsharing, the very major thing we did to make sure September 11 didn't \nhappen again. Prior to September 11, the FBI and the CIA could not \nshare information. Now they can, in hopes that we will stop September \n11 from happening again. But if all this information is going to get \nout through the court system, one of two things will occur: It isn't \ngoing to be given to the State Department in the first place, or, \nsecondly, if it is given and it gets into the court system and gets \nout, we are going to have a damper put on the sharing of information.\n  We ought to be able to make sure a terrorist doesn't get into this \ncountry without exposing the source of our information and, once here, \nget them out. We need to secure this country, and we need the ability \nto revoke visas without terrorists or criminals seeking relief from \ndeportation. I remind my colleagues of our poor visa policy \ncontributing to the attacks on September 11. Nineteen hijackers used \n364 aliases. Those people who killed 3,000 people in New York and 300 \npeople here at the Pentagon knew how to play the system. They had 364 \naliases. Two of the hijackers may have obtained passports from family \nmembers working in the Saudi passport ministry. Nineteen hijackers \napplied for 23 visas and obtained 22. The hijackers lied on the visa \napplication in detectable ways. The hijackers violated the terms of \ntheir visas. They came and went at their convenience.\n  The 9/11 Commission pointed out the obvious by stating:\n\n       Terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in this \n     country if they are unable to enter the country.\n\n  In the Midwest we call that common sense.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended that we intercept terrorists and \nconstrain their mobility. This amendment would do that. Allowing aliens \nto remain on U.S. soil with a revoked visa or petition is a national \nsecurity concern and something the 9/11 Commission would suggest is \nneeded. We should not allow potential terrorists and others who act \ncounter to our laws to remain on U.S. soil and get the protection of \nour courts, stay in this country for years through the appeals process \nof seeking relief from deportation.\n  Terrorists took advantage of our system before 9/11. We cannot let \nthat happen again. This amendment will be helpful in making sure that \ndoesn't happen again.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia and I know the Senator from New Jersey \nwishes to speak on this issue. I will speak briefly. Will the Senator \nagree to an hour of time on the amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. Will the Senator let me check with our leadership?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. We don't expect to vote at that time. I \nhave been informed by the leader we are going to try to do this \namendment, then the Bingaman amendment, and then vote on both at 2 \no'clock. I won't propose that as a time, but if the Senator would think \nin those terms, we will go ahead with other Senators and then come back \nto the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, may I say to the Senator that it is \nnot my idea to take a long time, but I was asked to offer my amendment \nnow by the leadership. I want to check with them.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, in deference to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, I will only be a minute.\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\n  To the distinguished Senator and my ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee and my dear friend, I commend him on his words and his \neffort. I do want to correct or at least amplify on a simile he used in \nhis remarks where he had the picture of a stuffed horse named Trigger \nand made an analogy to the triggers in this bill.\n  I have worked for 18 months on these triggers. They actually are a \ncomplement to what he wants to do in terms of deporting people who are \nin this country on expired visas. One of the triggers in the bill that \nis a prerequisite to any of the rest of the bill going into effect is a \nbiometrically secure ID which will prohibit exactly what happened with \nthe hijackers on 9/11, because every business, school, employer, \nuniversity, training center, and the like will be able to swipe that \nmag tape, and if they have an expired visa, they will know it. \nSecondly, because of the biometrics of a fingerprint, you cannot have a \nforged ID, nor can you have a stolen ID, because the holder of the \nstolen ID's print will not match.\n  With regard to the other triggers--and I appreciate the time of the \nSenator from New Jersey to amplify on the remarks I made yesterday--the \ntriggers in this bill provide 2,700 redundant miles of barriers and \nvisual security on the border, more miles than there are on the common \nborder; 18,000 Border Patrol agents; 27,500 beds to detain anyone who \nis caught until their hearing date comes forward; 375 miles of \nbarriers; 1,640 miles of ground positioning radar; 600 miles of \nconstant surveillance in the air, plus all the ground sensors and the \ncameras that allow those 18,000 agents, when they are on duty, to \nimmediately intercept the people who are violating the border, \nimmediately put them in one of the 27,500 beds, and hold them until \ntheir case comes up and they are deported. I have no qualm with the \nSenator's amendment whatsoever, but I don't think it is exactly correct \nto make the reference to Roy Rogers' horse as an analogy to the \ntriggers in this bill because, in fact, these triggers are meaningful. \nIn their absence and in the absence of the President seeing that they \nare done, Homeland Security executing, and the Congress appropriating, \nthis bill self-destructs. It is the predicate upon which complementary \nthings such as the Senator is trying to do actually are made more \nmeaningful and more helpful.\n  I appreciate the Senator letting me amplify on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I have two purposes for rising at this \npoint. One is to speak to the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa and then to speak substantively, as we get into a \nfull debate of comprehensive immigration reform, to lay out some \nparameters I hope all of our colleagues will consider.\n  Let me start off with the Grassley amendment. I rise in strong \nopposition to the amendment. It abolishes the last--underlined--remnant \nof judicial review on visa revocations. During the course of this week \nand the week when we come back, we are often going to hear terrorism \ninvoked as the reason we must act in certain ways. Some of those ways \nultimately undermine the essence of the Constitution of the United \nStates and the equal protection clause. I think it is a false choice to \nbe put in a position between the suggestion of terrorism and the \nsuggestion that we should undermine the Constitution. I raise that as a \nwarning flag now, as we look at all other amendments that are going to \nbe coming. We are going to hear a wide range of reasons why we should \ndramatically change judicial reviews, the essence of protection under \nthe Constitution. I hope our colleagues will understand that is a \nslippery slope to go down.\n  I hope we are not going to undermine due process, rule of law, and \njudicial review, because they are not just limited to suggestions on \nterrorism. Maybe if they were limited only on that, we could consider \nsupporting such amendments. But it is eliminating judicial review \ntotally, as it relates to visa revocation.\n  Right now what is the law? Right now judicial review of a visa \nrevocation is already severely restricted. In fact, visa revocations \nare insulated from any judicial review when the visa holder is outside \nof the United States and the consular officers--these are our \nrepresentatives abroad--have exceptionally broad authority to make \nrevocation decisions. If you are outside the United States, you are not \neven coming. You don't even get a chance at judicial review. Let's make \nthat clear.\n  The only area where limited judicial review of visa revocation \nremains available is with respect to individuals who are in the United \nStates and then are placed in removal proceedings as a result of the \nrevocation. Then judicial review is permitted in the context of those \nremoval proceedings, if revocation is the only ground for that removal.\n  This is a critical check on Government authority to make arbitrary \ndecisions. It is vitally important to allow the court review of removal \nproceedings because a person's ability to remain in the United States \nis at stake. We know immigration authorities have on more than one \noccasion made a mistake in the person's case or the person may have \ncompelling circumstances that warranted consideration by a judge. We \nhave seen cases time and time again that have so dictated and have said \nthe Government is wrong, the individual is right. This would nullify \nthat opportunity totally. This amendment would eliminate the last \nremaining remnant of judicial review.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened with great interest--I hope our colleagues \nare--to the point the Senator from New Jersey is making. I wish to ask \nhis comment on a situation. Some months ago we had a raid in New \nBedford, MA. The people were picked up. They were sent up to Fort \nDevons and flown out of there, and many of them were transported to El \nPaso. Then some of them were deported. I have in my hand a May 3 \narticle from the Boston Globe. The headline is ``U.S. Deports Wrong \nRaid Detainee In Case of Mistaken Identity.''\n\n       A man arrested in the March 6 raid of the Michael Bianco \n     leather factory in New Bedford was deported by mistake, \n     Federal officials said yesterday. Juan Sam-Castro, a native \n     of Guatemala, was taken for a man of the same name, said the \n     spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Service. As \n     soon as the Customs Service became aware, we took immediate \n     steps to bring Castro back to the United States. We are \n     trying to locate him.\n\n  Here is an American citizen who has been deported and they are trying \nto locate him. Is the Senator not saying that in the situation where \nlast year we deported 187,000 individuals and even in the last few \nweeks where we have this kind of mistake, at least some opportunity for \nan expedited kind of a review that effectively is not slowing the \nprocess down with this individual, between the time he was arrested and \nthe time he was deported, was very few weeks, let alone the time he had \nthe hearing, does this illustrate at least part of the points the \nSenator is trying to make with regard to the immigration service and \nthe need for at least permitting the kind of review that currently \nexists? I do not believe we have had testimony to the contrary that \nthis is an undue burden on the system.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the question and \ndescription from the Senator from Massachusetts. In fact, it is clearly \none element--one very dramatic element--of the Government acting \nwrongly: deporting someone who had every legal right to be here in this \ncountry--making that mistake, and then, realizing they made a mistake, \nare now trying to find that individual whose life has been turned \nupside down.\n  In the process of doing that, under the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa, they do not even have a chance to go to court. So the human faces \nwe are talking about here are real. That is not about terrorism.\n  Now, let me give you another example. The Senator from Massachusetts \ngave a very vivid one. Let me give you another example of what happens \nwhen we do not permit basic due process as a part of our law.\n  This amendment would eliminate judicial review for all visa \nrevocations unnecessarily, and it unduly expands the already broad \ndiscretionary authority of the executive branch. Let me\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\ngive you an example--a different case. A foreign government that wants \nto rein in one of their dissidents provides false information to the \nU.S. consulate that leads the consul to revoke the visa. This is \nsomeone who is speaking against maybe a totalitarian regime, a \ndictatorship, people who are oppressing people's human rights, but they \nare here in the United States. They got a visa, and they are here \nspeaking out. That government wants to make sure that person can no \nlonger speak out, so they give false information to the consul, and the \nconsul reviews it and makes a factual determination: Do you know what. \nThis looks right. Let's revoke the visa.\n  That person, that dissident, struggling to make a difference in the \nlives of people in that country--we want to see people like that \nchallenging their own systems; we want to see people like that fighting \nin their own countries so we never have to send our people abroad--that \nperson does not even have one chance to make the case in a court of law \nthat what is being said is false.\n  Exposing individuals in this country to such arbitrary and capricious \naction is un-American. We should be striving for more balance and more \ntransparency, not less.\n  Let me say there is another case, a case decided here in the United \nStates in June of last year, where a U.S. Federal judge issued an order \nsoundly rejecting the Government's contentions against an individual--\nthe same type of case that would not, under this amendment, have access \nto this type of judicial review where this Federal judge determined \nthat the Government was wrong, the individual was right.\n  What was the individual saying? He was saying his point of view, \nwhich separated him from the administration's point of view. Because it \nseparated him from the administration's point of view, they revoked his \nvisa. The judge held the decision was not a due authority, a use for \nthe revocation of the visa, and that person was allowed to stay simply \nbecause they were expressing their points of view different from this \nadministration.\n  Is that what we want to do? Eliminate the possibility for someone to \nbe able to go to court and say: ``I am being hushed because I have a \ndifferent point of view. My visa is being revoked with not one chance \nto go to court''?\n  By the way, finally, if we are going to talk about terrorism, if I \nhave a terrorist in my possession, under other provisions of law I do \nnot want to deport them. I want to arrest them. I want to throw them in \njail. I want to make sure they do not get out of the country to do harm \nback to this country. Why would I want to deport them? I want to arrest \nthem. I want to jail them under other provisions of law. I want to \nprosecute them. I do not want to let them go free so they can try to do \nharm again to the United States.\n  This amendment actually works to the opposite of our national \nsecurity interests. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Now, let me speak more broadly about the overall immigration effort. \nSince I have already heard some of the commentaries on the floor, I \nthink it is important for us to have a framework of where this \ndiscussion, I hope, will go in a civilized fashion that understands the \nbetter angels within us.\n  From the congressional district I had the honor of representing for \nover 13 years in the House of Representatives, one can see the Statue \nof Liberty. You can almost touch it. Ellis Island has been a gateway to \nopportunity for millions of new Americans. For me, it is a shining \nexample of the power of the American dream, a place that launched \nmillions down their own road to success.\n  As Americans listen to this debate, I hope they understand and are \nhonest with themselves--whether their family was part of the men and \nwomen who made the voyage on the Mayflower or part of the millions who \nstepped off of Ellis Island or part of those who were brought to \nthis Nation against their will or, if like my own parents, they came to \nthis country fleeing tyranny and searching for freedom--we all have a \nconnection to immigration.\n\n  America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation \nof laws. History is replete with examples of the United States of \nAmerica being a welcoming Nation. But, unfortunately, very often the \npublic dialog through the years has been less than welcoming. Over the \ndecades, the influx of immigrants of various ethnicities has caused \nconcerns and, in many cases, heated comments against such immigrants to \nour Nation. In some cases, there were even laws enacted to limit or ban \ncertain ethnic groups from being able to come to the land of \nopportunity. Let's remember some of this history so we do not repeat it \nagain in these debates.\n  Before the American Revolution, Founding Father Benjamin Franklin \nwrote of the influx of German immigrants to Philadelphia:\n\n       Those who come hither are generally the most stupid of \n     their own nation.\n\n  Henry J. Gardner, the Governor of Massachusetts in the middle of the \n19th century, saw the Irish as a ``horde of foreign barbarians.''\n  In 1882, Congress enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which made it \nnearly impossible for additional Chinese to enter America. The law was \nnot repealed until 1943, in the middle of World War II, when the United \nStates and China were allies against Japan.\n  In the early 1900s, H.G. Wells, a British novelist, stated that the \narrival of Eastern Europeans, Jews, and Italians would cause a ``huge \ndilution of the American people with profoundly ignorant foreign \npeasants.''\n  Congressman Albert Johnson, coauthor of the Johnson-Reed Immigration \nAct of 1924, which severely restricted immigrants from Southern and \nEastern Europe, and entirely prohibited East Asians and Asian Indians, \nstated that:\n\n       Our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands \n     diluted by a stream of alien blood, with all its inherited \n     misconceptions respecting the relationships of the governing \n     power to governed. . . . The day of unalloyed welcome to all \n     peoples, the day of indiscriminate acceptance of all races, \n     has definitely ended.\n\n  Finally--to give you a sense of some of these things that have been \npart of our past--a 1925 report of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce \nstated that Mexicans are suitable for agricultural work ``due to their \ncrouching and bending habits . . . , while the white is physically \nunable to adapt himself to them.''\n  That was in 1925.\n  These are just a few statements from the past that have taken issue \nwith and criticized the relatives and forefathers of various segments \nof our Nation's population today.\n  We must all remember that just in the last Congress the House of \nRepresentatives passed H.R. 4437, better known as the Sensenbrenner \nbill. Beyond the heated rhetoric that existed during the debate on that \nlegislation, the bill itself was shortsighted and even more mean \nspirited and would have made felons out of anyone who was here in an \nundocumented status. That bill would have also criminalized citizens of \nthe United States through a much broader definition of smuggling that \nwould have allowed the Government to prosecute almost any American who \nhad regular contact with undocumented immigrants. Luckily, that did not \npass.\n  But today we continue to hear across the landscape of the country \nhateful rhetoric used to polarize and divide our country on this issue. \nBut we must never allow ourselves to buy into the rhetoric. We must \nnever subscribe to the policies of fear and division, driven by \nxenophobia, nativism, and racism.\n  The responsibility is on all of us--not just on Members of Congress, \nbut everyone in this Nation. We must reject the rhetoric of hatred, \ndivision, and polarization. We must demand a comprehensive immigration \npolicy that does not denigrate or demonize, but is tough, smart, fair, \nand humane.\n  However, on this issue, we must be completely honest with ourselves. \nOur country's immigration system is unarguably broken. In light of \nthese failures, we must enact tough, smart, and comprehensive \nimmigration reform that reflects current economic and social realities, \nrespects the core values, I hope, of family unity and fundamental \nfairness, and upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants.\n  In the absence of Federal legislation, what is happening is many \nlocal governments in my State of New Jersey and, for that matter, \nacross the Nation are passing ordinances to address issues surrounding \nundocumented immigration in their communities. Unfortunately, many of \nthese ordinances\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nviolate constitutional equal protection guarantees and create divisions \nin communities that did not exist.\n  In addition to the moral imperative, our society would greatly \nbenefit economically if we enacted comprehensive immigration reform. \nSuch reform would allow undocumented immigrants to come out of the \nshadows and fully pay their taxes, ensuring accurate census counts, \nwhich translates into equitable funding levels for programs and \nschools. Additionally, we can reduce law enforcement demands since the \nneed for day laborers, forged documents, and driver's licenses, along \nwith the use of exploitation and human trafficking would largely be \nshut down.\n  As to those who don't come forward when such an opportunity is \npresented, we would be focused on asking: Why are they not coming \nforward? We would be able to determine who is here to pursue the \nAmerican dream versus who is here to destroy it.\n  We need to aggressively curtail unauthorized crossings at the border, \nprotect both undocumented immigrants and American workers from \ncorporations exploiting undocumented labor, and provide a pathway for \nimmigrants to earn--and I repeat: earn--permanent residency in order to \nensure our immigration system is safe, legal, orderly, and fair to all.\n  Our goal should be neither open borders nor closed borders but smart \nborders. The specter of terrorism in a post-September 11 world creates \nan even greater imperative for us to succeed in this endeavor. The \nunderlying bill has a whole host of triggers that go to the very heart \nof those elements.\n  We have all seen some of the consequences. We have seen lawlessness \nalong the borders. Crime in our border communities is increasing and \noverwhelming local law enforcement's ability to address these \nchallenges. So-called coyotes, or human smugglers, charge thousands of \ndollars to bring people into this country, creating a multimillion \ndollar industry for organized criminal organizations to exploit and \nfuel their other illegal activities. In fact, several reports have \nindicated there is more money in smuggling these undocumented \nimmigrants into our Nation than smuggling drugs.\n  However, history proves it is not enough to rely on enforcement \nalone, even though I am totally for the enforcement. Over the past two \ndecades, the Federal Government has tripled--tripled--the number of \nBorder Patrol agents and increased the enforcement budget tenfold--\ntenfold. Yet, despite tripling the Border Patrol and increasing the \nbudget tenfold, these efforts have yet to stop those who have either \ncrossed the border or overstayed their visas. So it is about border \nprotection, but it is also about a more comprehensive effort to make \nsure you deal with the push-and-pull factors of immigration.\n  Securing our borders is the first step to ensure an orderly, fair, \nand smart immigration system, but by no means is it adequate in \nisolation. We must also crack down on companies that illegally hire \nundocumented workers--something that is long overdue. I know under the \nClinton administration, employers were held accountable for hiring \nundocumented workers, as 417 businesses were cited for immigration \nviolations in 1999 alone. In contrast, a mere three--three--employers \nwere issued notices of intent to fine by the Bush administration in \n2004 for similar violations, making it 22 times more likely for an \nAmerican to be killed by a strike of lightning in an average year than \nprosecuted for such labor violations.\n  So much for enforcing the existing law.\n  What happened in the span of those 5 years? What happened? Did \ncompanies suddenly decide to start abiding by the law by not hiring \nundocumented immigrants? No. The truth of the matter is, similar to \nborder enforcement, this administration made a conscious decision to \nlook the other way in order to once again serve the interests of \ncorporate America to the detriment of average American citizens.\n\n  That is why I support stronger immigration enforcement not only at \nthe borders but at the workplace. Unscrupulous companies that \nintentionally hire undocumented immigrants do so because they know they \ncan exploit these people without fear of retribution. They know this \nbecause undocumented immigrants are forced to hide in the shadows of \nsociety and subsequently have no avenues to report labor abuses. Not \nonly does this hurt the immigrant being exploited, it also directly \nimpacts American citizens who must compete in the market with exploited \nlabor. We must immediately end these abuses and in doing so create an \nequal playing field to ensure that the wages, benefits and health and \nlabor standards of the American worker are not undercut.\n  While securing our borders and enforcing strengthened workplace \nemployment laws will enable us to regulate the influx of new \nimmigrants, it does nothing to solve our current dilemma of an \nestimated 12 million undocumented immigrants who currently reside in \nthe United States. That is why our immigration policy must be about \nmore than simply enforcement. It must be about providing a safe, \norderly, timely, and legal process that deals with the economic \nrealities of our time.\n  So in order to make our immigration system overall workable, we must \nbe practical, fair, and humane in dealing with the estimated 12 million \nundocumented immigrants living in the United States. To do otherwise \nwould require the most massive roundup and deportation of people in the \nhistory of the world--in the history of the world. I believe this is \nboth highly unlikely and impractical on many levels, including due to \nboth budgetary and economic impacts on the Nation and its economy.\n  Such a mass deportation of the undocumented population, even assuming \n20 percent could leave voluntarily if such a policy was enacted, would \ncost us over $200 billion over a 5-year period, according to the Center \nfor American Progress. That is not going to happen. So fully securing \nour borders is impossible unless efforts to include a temporary guest \nworker program and a path to earn residence for undocumented immigrants \nis part of the overall reform.\n  This solution will encourage immigrants to come out of the shadows \nand legalize their status. By doing so, we will learn who is here to \nseek the American dream versus who is here to destroy it through \ncriminal or terrorist acts. Most of the people who cross our borders \ncome looking for work, as many of our ancestors did. These immigrants \ncontribute to our economy, provide for their families, and want a \nbetter life for their children.\n  Let me say I am, first and foremost, in favor of hiring any \nAmerican--any American--who is willing to do any job that is available \nin this country today or tomorrow, but let's remember the jobs we are \ntalking about. The fruit you had for breakfast was picked by the hands \nand bent back of an immigrant laborer. The hotel room and bathroom you \nuse in travels through the country is likely cleaned with bended knee \nby an immigrant worker. The chicken you had for dinner yesterday was \nlikely plucked by the cut-up hands of an immigrant laborer. If you have \nan infirmed loved one, their daily necessities are probably being \ntended to by the steady hands and warm hearts of an immigrant aide. Let \nus remember that.\n  So we have to create an equal playing field to ensure that the wages, \nbenefits, health, and labor standards of the American worker are not \nundercut. But it is also in our best interests to have these workers \nparticipate and contribute to our society, especially when we had a \n4.5-percent unemployment rate in April of this year and a declining \nratio of American workers to retirees.\n  By coupling enhanced enforcement efforts with new immigration and \nlabor laws, we will not only regulate how workers come into the country \nbut finally give our border and law enforcement agencies a fighting \nchance to fulfill their duty.\n  Now, much of what the underlying bill does meets some of these \nchallenges, and I respect those elements. But I wish to talk about one \nvery compelling issue that I believe it does not meet: the importance \nof family. I said throughout the negotiations that were had, with a \nmassive, complex bill such as this one, the devil is in the details. \nThere are a number of details in this deal that would create an unfair \nand, in my mind, impractical immigration system, undercutting the more \nsensible provisions.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  This is especially true when it comes to the issue of family. The \ndeal struck virtually does away with a provision for family \nreunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy \nthroughout our history. This idea not only changes the spirit of our \nimmigration policy; it also emphasizes family structure, and all \nwithout a single hearing on the issue of family and our immigration \nsystem by the Senate Judiciary Committee, either in the 109th or the \n110th Congress.\n  Under this bill, they change the fundamental values of our \nimmigration policy by making an advanced degree or skill in a highly \ntechnical profession the most important criteria--the most important \ncriteria--for a visa. This Nation has been built by immigrants who came \nhere to achieve success, but the deal tilts toward immigrants whose \nsuccess stories are already written. They are already written.\n  Family reunification will be deemphasized under this deal, serving to \ntear families apart. From a moral perspective, this undermines the \nfamily values I hear so many--in different contexts--so many of my \ncolleagues talk about all the time.\n  As the late Pope John Paul II said:\n\n       The church in America must be a vigilant advocate, \n     defending against any unjust restriction of the natural right \n     of individual persons to move freely within their own Nation \n     and from one Nation to another. Attention must be called to \n     the rights of migrants and their families and to respect for \n     their human dignity.\n\n  Practically speaking, a breakdown of family structure often leads to \na breakdown of social stability. I took it to heart when President Bush \nsaid: ``Family values don't end at the Rio Grande,'' but this \nagreement, similar to his proposal before it, belies those words.\n  Yet here we are with a piece of legislation which the White House \npromoted that undermines the very essence of that. Even under a new \npoint structure that is envisioned under the bill, it seems to me that \nthe essence of family should be given more weight and points within the \ncontext of a whole new process of how we are going to move our \nimmigration system forward. Family, I would hope, even under a new \nsystem, is a critical value, in our country.\n\n  I would like to take a little time to get into some of the details of \nthis agreement and how they would impact families.\n  Under current law, foreign-born parents of U.S. citizens are exempt \nfrom green card caps when applying for legal permanent residency as \nthey fall in the immediate relatives category. Now, remember, this is \nsomeone--a U.S. citizen already--a U.S. citizen or a U.S. permanent \nresident who has a right--who has a right--to claim their relative. In \nthis case, I wish to talk about parents. Unfortunately, the agreement \nremoves these individuals from the immediate relative category and sets \nan annual cap for green cards for parents of U.S. citizens at 40,000. \nLast year, 120,000 visas were given to such parents, and the annual \naverage number of green cards issued over the past 5 years to parents \nis 90,000, so this bill would slash required green cards by more than \nhalf for a U.S. citizen to be reunified with their mother or father. So \nwe are automatically creating a new backlog, even though the bill is \nintended to end such family backlogs.\n  Another area that would be negatively impacted under the deal is the \nspouses and minor children of legal permanent residents of the United \nStates. The bill before us does not lift the visa cap on the spouses \nand minor children of lawful permanent residents; it actually lowers \nit, ensuring that backlogs continue indefinitely. The separation is not \nonly immoral in my mind, but it exacts an economic toll, as lawful \nimmigrants who are productive members of society move to rejoin their \nfamilies. Moreover, unification with immediate family members gives \nrise to an undesirable incentive to break the law and live in the \nUnited States illegally. Families want to migrate to each other, and \nthat is a natural, human instinct. We undermine that in this respect.\n  Now, the so-called ``grand bargain'' also moves us to a point-based \nimmigration system which would turn current immigration on its head--a \nsystem that hasn't received any hearings by the Judiciary Committee. \nYet, in the agreement, we are moving to a point system that is geared \ntoward people with degrees who are highly skilled or educated. Fine. We \ncan have people who are highly skilled and educated as part of the \nequation, but in my mind it shouldn't ultimately undermine dramatically \nthe ability of families to have a fighting chance. In fact, in the \npoint system that is contained in the bill, families would receive no \npoints at all--no points at all, none--unless the applicant has \nobtained at least 55 points through other elements: employment, \neducation, language. So much for family values under that system, in my \nmind.\n  In addition, if the applicant meets the 55-point threshold, they \nwould be eligible for a maximum of 10--a maximum of 10--additional \npoints; that is out of 100 maximum points. I guess that some who preach \nfamily values don't believe that family should count for more than 10 \npercent--10 percent.\n  Now, this legislation also curtails the ability of American citizens \ntoday, permanent residents, to petition for their families to be \nreunified here in America.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there is a family backlog of people who have \napplied for legal permanent residency who are claimed by U.S. citizens. \nThis legislation, as currently drafted, does away with several of the \nfamily categories such as adult children of a U.S. citizen and lawful \npermanent residents and siblings of citizens. These categories will be \ngrandfathered in and dealt with as part of clearing the backlog during \nthe first 8 years but only if you filed your application before May 1 \nof 2005. What is the consequence of that? The consequence of that is \nover 800,000 people who have played by the rules, applied under the \nnormal process, didn't come across the border, didn't violate any law, \ndid the right thing, that all of those who did all the right things but \napplied after that date, will not be cleared as part of the family \nbacklog. They lose their chance under this law.\n  More importantly, it vitiates--it takes away--the right of the U.S. \ncitizen to have them claimed because they lose it. They have a petition \npending under existing law, and yet that petition is gone with the \nflash of this bill.\n  So the legislation, as currently drafted, says that if you legally \napply for a visa after May 1, 2005, you have to compete under an \nentirely new system. It is an arbitrary date that was picked out of the \nthin air.\n  Let's think of how fundamentally unfair that is. Imagine you are a \nlawful, permanent U.S. resident. You have fought for your country, you \nhave shed blood for your country, and in some cases, you may have even \ndied for your country. In fact, a noncitizen, a legal permanent \nresident of the United States, Marine LCpl Jose Antonio Gutierrez, \noriginally of Guatemala, was the very first, the very first U.S. combat \ncasualty in the war with Iraq. Had he not been a combat casualty under \nthis bill, he would not have been allowed to claim his family. If this \nbill moves forward the way it is, these legal permanent residents are \nalso not only--there are thousands of them in the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States, and they are protecting our airports, our seaports, and \nour ports. They risk their daily lives in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \nplaces around the world to protect us here at home, yet we would do \naway with their right to petition to have their sister or their brother \ncome join and live with them in America. Under this bill, you lose that \nright if you file after May 1, 2005. It is hard to imagine that one \nwould have that right taken away from them.\n  Here is another case for you to consider. You are a U.S. citizen. You \nhave paid your taxes. You may have served your Nation. You attend \nchurch. You make a good living. You are a good citizen. You have \npetitioned to have your adult child come to America, but you did so \nafter the date of May 1, 2005. Under this bill, that U.S. citizen loses \ntheir right. However, those who are undocumented in the country after \nMay 1 of 2005, they actually get a benefit under the bill. So if you \nobey the law, follow the rules, do all the right things, you are a U.S. \ncitizen, paid your taxes, maybe even served your country in the Armed \nForces, doing everything you should do, you lose your right to claim \nyour relative under the existing law and be part of the backlog, but \nthe person who came in an undocumented\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\nfashion over the border, they actually will get a benefit as of January \n1, 2007. It seems to me that the legal permanent resident, the U.S. \ncitizen, should have at least the same date as those who have not \nfollowed the law and the rules. It is hard to imagine, but it is true.\n  So these are a few of the shortcomings contained in the bill we are \nmoving forward. This deal would have prevented my own parents, a \ncarpenter and a seamstress, from coming to this country. They wouldn't \nhave qualified under this point system. I would like to think that they \nand others whom I have heard about around this Chamber--I have heard so \nmany stories from my colleagues in the Senate and formerly in the \nHouse, talking about their proud history.\n  Their parents would not have been eligible to come to this country \nunder this bill. I would like to think that, on both sides of the \naisle, they have contributed to the vitality of this Nation. I have \nlistened to so many of the stories of our colleagues, and I know many \nof their parents never would have qualified to come to this country \nunder this bill. It seems to me a new paradigm could have been \nstructured where family values and reunification have more of a \nfighting chance than under the framework agreement that we consider.\n  The story of the legislation is not finished. We still have the \nhistoric opportunity this week to craft tough, smart, and fair \nimmigration reform. It is my intention, starting, I hope, later today, \nthrough a series of amendments, to get to the heart of the issues I \nhave mentioned, to change and to improve this deal. I know many of my \ncolleagues are committed to the same issues of practicality, fairness, \nand family values, and I will work with them to turn this unworkable \ndeal, in those respects, into sound policy we can all support.\n  As we have throughout our Nation's long and proud history, I believe \nwe can create a pathway to the American dream for those who contribute \nto our Nation and allow them to fully participate in our economy and \nour society. As the President told Congress in this year's State of the \nUnion speech: Let's have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so \nyou can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into \nlaw.\n  It is a rare moment, but I agree with the President. Reform is long \noverdue. I want to just say that I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Massachusetts in his advocacy in this regard. I look \nforward to trying to--even though he may not be able to support some of \nthese things as part of his commitment to a grand bargain--change it in \na direction that we can all be proud of. But for him, we probably would \nnot be on the Senate floor debating this issue today, or in the past, \nand I admire him greatly in that respect.\n  However we got here, from wherever we came, we know we are in the \nsame boat together today as Americans, and together I hope we can make \nthis journey a safe, orderly, and legal process that preserves and \nfulfills the American dream for all, that upholds the right of U.S. \ncitizens to seek the reunification of their families. It takes those \nwho serve our country and who are not U.S. citizens yet and gives us \nthe right to say: You fought for America, you may have been wounded in \nthe process. You have done everything we would want of any citizen. \nYour right to make a simple claim to have your family reunited for you \nwill not be snuffed out by this legislation.\n  If we do that, this process deserves our respect. I hope this \npreserves the Constitution, as well as the due process of law that \nmakes America worthy of fighting for and dying for--the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights. When we seek to erode and undo it, we undermine \nthe very essence of America's greatness. Those are our challenges in \nthis debate and also our opportunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first of all, I commend my friend from \nNew Jersey for an excellent presentation, particularly on this issue of \nthe Grassley amendment, and for also reminding us about the importance \nof family in the consideration of our immigration bill.\n  I think we are going to have an opportunity during the course of the \nday to deal with those issues in greater detail, and we will look \nforward to that. I think we have made some important progress in terms \nof family issues, but I think we have also seen some changes in the \nexisting law in those issues. And it is important for the American \npeople to understand exactly the areas we have made progress in and the \nareas that we have altered as we deal with this underlying bill.\n  I wish to take a moment to address the points that are included in \nthe Grassley amendment, which is the pending amendment. Then I \nunderstand the Senator from New Mexico will be coming down shortly to \noffer an amendment that deals with the temporary workers. We will have \nan opportunity during the noontime to address that issue. Then, \naccording to the leadership, we will have the two votes. If there are \nside-by-sides, other votes--at 2 o'clock or in the time close to 2 \no'clock. I say that for the benefit of our colleagues here.\n  Madam President, on the Grassley amendment, I think it is important \nto understand that people who come into the United States under visas \nhave to go through extensive background checks before they are granted \nvisas, and again before they are admitted. We are talking about \nmillions of visitors, about hundreds of thousands of scholars and \nresearchers and workers. These are not criminals or terrorists. Anybody \nwho is a terrorist or criminal is not eligible for a visa.\n  I will just mention the various crimes that individuals have \ncommitted that have denied them the opportunity to come to the United \nStates to get a visa: crimes of moral turpitude, such as aggravated \nassault, assault with a deadly weapon; aggravated DWI, fraud, larceny, \nforgery; controlled substance offenses, such as the sale, possession, \nand distribution of drugs, and drug trafficking; theft \noffenses, including shoplifting; public nuisance; multiple criminal \nconvictions, any alien convicted of two or more offenses regardless of \nwhether the offense arose from a scheme of misconduct; crimes of \nviolence; counterfeiting; bribery; perjury; certain aliens involved in \nserious criminal activity who have asserted immunity from prosecution; \nforeign government officials who have committed particularly severe \nviolations of religious freedom; significant traffickers of persons; \nmoney laundering; murder; rape; sexual abuse of a minor; child \npornography, as well as attempts or conspiracy to commit most of those \noffenses.\n\n  Those, obviously, who are denied on security-related grounds include \nespionage or sabotage; engaging in terrorist activity, and that is \nbroadly defined; likely to engage in terrorist activity, broadly \ndefined; association with terrorist activity; representative of a \nterrorist organization; spouse or child of an individual who is \ninadmissible as a terrorist; activity that is deemed to have adverse \nforeign policy consequences for the United States; membership in a \ntotalitarian party.\n  All of those ban individuals from coming into the United States. So \nif a visitor here has his visa revoked, he should be entitled to \nreview. This doesn't create a burden on our courts but simply preserves \nbasic due process. Courts review these cases every day, and we have \nheard no evidence of any undue burden on the courts. These cases can be \nhandled expeditiously.\n  Immigration judges ordered 220,000 people deported last year. Only 9 \npercent of these decisions were appealed. We have no abuse in the \nsystem at the current time. So providing review to a few more people \nwhose visas are revoked won't flood the courts.\n  Again, we are talking about the mistakes that can be made with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, as a Member of the Senate, I was put \non the no-fly list by the Department of Homeland Security and denied \nthe opportunity to even fly out of the Nation's Capital to go back to \nmy home city of Boston. In Boston, I had the temporary approval by the \nDepartment there, which had to overrule Homeland Security. Despite the \nhead of the Homeland Security then saying we have cleared that up, it \nwasn't cleared up for 3 more weeks, and with the airlines, it was 4 \nmore weeks. If that happens to a Senator, what is happening to other \nindividuals?\n  I have given the example of a person in my home State of \nMassachusetts\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nwho was deported. Now the Immigration Service is trying to find that \nindividual down in Guatemala. It was because of similar names.\n  So I think, as the Senator from New Jersey pointed out, the system we \nhave included in the legislation is appropriate. It is not burdensome. \nWe have had no complaints even during this long period of time. We have \nhad no complaints from any of those who have been involved in the \nsystem that it is an undue burden, or any complaints from the judicial \nsystem. We have found out that we have 23 different incidents reported \nby my own Boston office of individuals who are very substantial \ncitizens in New England, including a dean of a medical school, who were \nput on the list by mistake.\n  So mistakes happen. All we have in this is a simple process of \nreview. That process has been outlined and stated by the Senator from \nNew Jersey, and it should be preserved.\n  I look forward to not closing off the time to the Senator from Iowa, \nbut we are trying to move this process along and consider the amendment \nof the Senator from New Mexico and then see if we cannot continue to \nconsider the follow-on amendments. The Senator from South Carolina has \nan amendment as well. We will be looking forward to having debate on \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Iraqi Translators\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate \nthe House for moving on the issue of Iraqi translators. I am talking \nabout translators who have worked for the American Armed Forces in \nIraq. They have to follow a very detailed procedure, and then they get \ncertified. Most of them have to work on it for more than a year.\n  These people have been particularly targeted by the terrorists. Their \nnames are printed in mosques and other places of worship, and if they \nare found, they are executed. We have a limitation, I believe, of 50, \nand we have taken in 18. Many of these individuals have risked their \nlives for American service men and women and this legislation will be a \nvery small downpayment in terms of their safety and their security. It \nis important, and I am hopeful we will be able to address this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1169 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send to the desk an amendment to the \nunderlying substitute and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     and Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Obama, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1169 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce to 200,000 the number of certain nonimmigrants \n             permitted to be admitted during a fiscal year)\n\n       Strike subparagraph (B) of the quoted matter under section \n     409(1)(B) and insert the following:\n       ``(B) under section 101(a)(15)(Y)(i), may not exceed \n     200,000 for each fiscal year; or\n       In paragraph (2) of the quoted matter under section 409(2), \n     strike ``, (B)(ii),''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to reduce the \nnumber of visas issued each year under the new guest worker program \nthat is in this bill--reduce it to 200,000. This is 200,000 new visas \neach year which would be permitted if my amendment were to be adopted.\n  The amendment I am offering is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, \nObama, Dodd, and Durbin. It is essentially the same amendment I offered \nwhen we had the debate on the immigration bill last year when we were \nfortunate to have the support of 79 Senators for the amendment.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the context of this before getting \ninto the detail of the amendment. The Kyl-Kennedy or Kennedy-Kyl \nsubstitute amendment allocates 400,000 new guest worker visas per year, \nand it has in it also an increase mechanism that allows the annual \nallocation to go from 400,000 up to 600,000 per year. After a few \nyears, presumably, we would be at a level of 600,000 per year from then \non. Workers are allowed to stay for a total of 6 years under this \nprogram. They would work for 2 years--and Senator Dorgan described this \nvery accurately as part of the debate on his amendment yesterday--and \nthey would be allowed to work for 6 years; that is, they work for 2 \nyears, leave the country for 1 year, work for an additional 2 years, \nleave the country for another year, and work for an additional 2 years, \nthen leave for good. That is the structure of the system as it now \nstands. I can go into whatever details Members are interested in to \nexplain how the increase mechanism provided for in the law is \nstructured, but before I get into that, let me just talk about the \nlarger context.\n  This bill, the Kennedy-Kyl substitute, contains really three so-\ncalled temporary worker programs which are very distinct, and \nindividuals can come to our country and work in our country under any \nof these three programs.\n  One program is what I would refer to as the true temporary worker \nprogram, and that is where you bring people in for seasonal work. \nClearly, that is something we have done for a long time. I think the \nlimit in the law today is 66,000 are permitted to come in each year for \ntemporary work--to work at resorts or work in some kind of a seasonal \njob--and then that 66,000 is then allowed to be increased to reflect \nthose who have come the previous year or two. In fact, I think the \nestimate I have seen is that there are about 135,000 people in our \ncountry each year doing that kind of temporary seasonal work.\n  This bill, this Kennedy-Kyl substitute, would change that 66,000 to \n100,000. It would contain an increase mechanism similar to what is in \nthis new guest worker program, and so the 100,000 would eventually go \nto 200,000 after a few years. As I understand it now, there is also \nwritten into the law, written into the substitute, a provision that \nsays the 200,000 number for the seasonal guest workers does not include \npeople who have been here under that same program working in any 1 of \nthe previous 3 years. Obviously, you have the potential for a great \nmany more than 200,000 to come in as seasonal temporary workers under \nthat provision.\n\n  Another separate provision of this substitute bill which allows for \ntemporary workers to come in is the agricultural workers program. I \npoint out to my colleagues, that is without limit. There is no cap on \nthat. There is a tremendous opportunity for people to come into this \ncountry and work in agriculture. We do not have numerical limits on \nthat, so, to anyone who says we are not going to be allowing people to \ncome into the country to do the work Americans don't want to do, the \ntruth is, if they want to do work that is related to agriculture, we \ncan bring them in, in whatever numbers, without any limits being \nimposed by this law.\n  The third opportunity to come in as a so-called temporary worker is \nthis new guest worker program. This is a little bit of a misnomer, when \nwe talk about temporary worker, because these are permanent jobs that \nwe are bringing people in to fill. People need to understand that. \nThese are not temporary jobs, these are permanent jobs. We are bringing \npeople in for a temporary period, or a designated period of 2 years, \nthree different times, to do the work.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\nBut these are not temporary jobs in the same sense that a seasonal job \nis a temporary job--that you have it for a few months and then the ski \nresort closes and you no longer have a job. That is not the kind of \njobs we are talking about.\n  As I see it, there are several fundamental problems with this guest \nworker program as it is currently constructed. The most significant \nproblem is the bill anticipates letting way too many people come into \nthis country in a new, untested program. This is a new program. There \nis nothing in the current law that is comparable to this new guest \nworker program that we are talking about. The amendment I and my \ncosponsors are offering tries to restrict the size of the program until \nwe find out how it is working, until we figure out whether this makes \nsense. Let's not build into the law automatic increases in a program we \nhave never tested before. Let's not start this program at 400,000 and \nhave it escalate up to 600,000. The amendment I am offering is trying \nto bring down the size of the program.\n  Another problem with the program is the structure, and I described \nthat. This idea we are going to bring people in for 2 years, kick them \nout for 1 year, bring them in for 2 years, kick them out for 1 year, is \nnot good for the employee, obviously. That is not good for the \nemployer, obviously. It is not a realistic expectation. I think anyone \nwould have to recognize that is not a good structure.\n  The third problem I have with the bill is there is no real avenue for \nany of these individuals we are talking about to ever gain legal \nstatus, so we are creating a group of workers who have come to this \ncountry and worked for 2 years or 4 years or 6 years, to whom then we \nare saying: Your time is up, go home. There is a tremendous likelihood \nthat we are going to have a lot of people staying over and overstaying \ntheir visas. I think that is unfortunate.\n  That is a change from the previous legislation. We passed that bill \nSenator Kennedy brought to the Senate floor last year and I supported \nit. There was a much more realistic opportunity for people who came in \nunder the guest worker program to pursue legal status at some time, so \nthe incentive to essentially go underground to try to avoid deportation \nwas not the same in that bill.\n  I think the most significant thing we can do at this point to try to \ncorrect the most significant problem with this guest worker program is \nto reduce the number. Let me show a couple of charts, for my colleagues \nto understand what we are talking about.\n  The current bill calls for 400,000. The first year this law is in \neffect, 400,000 are permitted to come in under this guest worker \nprogram. Then there is a complicated process if that total is reached. \nIf there is a demand to bring in 400,000 during the first half of the \nyear, then there is an automatic increase of 15 percent. So you bring \nin an additional 15 percent at that point, which is 60,000, so you are \nat 460,000. You start the next year at 460,000, but you add another 15 \npercent to that immediately, and if there is another demand, using up \nall of those, you can go up another 15 percent.\n  In any event, it rachets up pretty rapidly. It says if the 400,000 is \nnot used up until the second half of the year, then there is only a 10-\npercent increase each year from then on.\n  What we have done on this chart--and I think people need to try to \nunderstand this--is we have tried to show with this graph how many so-\ncalled guest workers under this program--not under the other two, not \nunder the ag workers program, not under the seasonal workers program \nbut under this program--how many people we would actually have in the \ncountry as the bill is currently written. You would have 400,000 the \nfirst year; the second year you would have 840,000 because you would \nhave the first 400,000, plus the second 400,000, plus the increase, 10 \npercent. You would have 924,000 the third year, you would have 1.4 \nmillion the fourth year, you would have 1,958,000 the fifth year, and \nthis keeps going up so, by the eighth year, you would have 3,158,000 \npeople in the country legally working under this program.\n\n  There is a very important assumption built into this chart. The \nassumption is that everybody who comes in under this program goes home \nwhen their visa says they ought to go home; nobody overstays his or her \nvisa. If, in fact, that assumption is false and people get to the end \nof their 6 years and say: Wait a minute, I am not ready to leave the \nUnited States, I am staying, and they stay here on an undocumented \nbasis at that point and overstay their visa, then they go on top of \nthese numbers.\n  So you have a tremendous number of new people. This is a brandnew \nprogram. We have never had this program before. I think that is too \nlarge.\n  Let me show what the amendment I am offering does. I did not support \nSenator Dorgan's proposal to eliminate the guest worker program \nentirely. I think there is a legitimate argument that some number of \nguest workers is appropriate to bring into the country to do some of \nthe work. But as I say, this is a brandnew program and we ought to do \nthis in a judicious way and feel our way along. In this proposal that I \nhave put forward, it says let's bring in 200,000 the first year and \n200,000 each year after that and see how this goes. We can make \njudgments and we can alter this in future years. Congress meets every \nyear, so we can alter this if we decide that is not the appropriate \nnumber. But let's start with a number that we think makes sense.\n  Even at that very substantial reduction, we would wind up in the \neighth year with 1.2 million people in the country under this program, \nlegally working as guest workers. It is not that there are going to be \n200,000 people working here each year, there are going to be 1.2 \nmillion people working here each year. Again, the assumption is there \nwill only be 1.2 million, assuming everyone goes home when their visa \nsays they ought to go home, which I think is a fairly questionable \nassumption.\n  That is what the amendment does. I think it is a far better way for \nus to proceed than what the underlying bill calls for. I know there are \nsome who are coming forward and arguing that this is terrible, that we \nare not going to have enough people to keep the economy running, that \nthere are going to be all kinds of jobs going unfilled. I point out \nagain that there are other ways people can come to our country and \nobtain employment. They can do so under the seasonal workers program, \nwhich is being increased very substantially under the bill. They can do \nso under the ag workers program, which has no limits on it at all. Of \ncourse, there are other ways that people can immigrate into our country \nthat are provided for in the legislation as well.\n  This is an amendment that I think makes all the sense in the world. I \nwas very pleased we had such strong support for it when we offered it \nin the previous debate that we had on immigration last year. I hope we \ncan adopt it again this year. By doing so, I think we begin to bring a \nlittle more judiciousness to this process if we are going to start a \nbrandnew program.\n  Let me also point out there is provision in this legislation for a \ncommission to be established to review how this new program is working \nand to make recommendations back to the Congress. I think that is \nentirely appropriate. To me, that is another reason why we should not \nbe building in automatic escalators in the size of this program. We \nshould not be starting with a program that is so large as 400,000 and \ngoing up to 600,000. We should start at 200,000 and keep it right there \nuntil we get those recommendations and find out what we think at that \npoint about whether to increase the size of the program or terminate \nthe program or whatever steps we might take at that point.\n  That is the basic gist of my argument. I hope colleagues will support \nthe amendment. I think it is a meritorious amendment. I think it will \nimprove the legislation substantially.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend from New Mexico for \nhis thoughtful presentation on this issue. As he mentioned, he offered \nthis amendment last year and it passed overwhelmingly. I expect there \nwill be a similar result today.\n  I appreciated the fact in our earlier debate he understood we need \nthis temporary worker program. All of us want to have a strong border, \nbut we do understand there will be pressure on the\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nborder, and we will either have a front door or a back door, the back \ndoor being for those who are going to try to penetrate that border, or \nthe front door so they can come in and have a temporary worker program.\n  The real issue is the size of this program. The Senator has mentioned \nthe other provisions that are included in the legislation. We have the \nlongstanding temporary worker, the H-2B, which is about 100,000 \nworkers. Those are the seasonal workers, for the most part, who work in \nmany of the resorts during the summer or wintertime and are truly \ntemporary workers. They are entitled to bring their families. They do \nnot. That program has been very modestly expanded over this program.\n  You have the H-1B, which is sort of high tech, which is 150,000--it \nwill go up to 180,000; and the ag jobs, which is 40,000 to 60,000.\n  The reason the 400,000 was reached is that is the general estimate, \nalthough there are some a good deal higher, of individuals who \npenetrate now. I think it is safe to say it is probably closer to \n500,000 undocumented who come across the border and are able to gain \nemployment here. So the 400,000 represented an evaluation, an estimate \nfrom results of hearings. That is how we built that in. Then, in the \nlegislation, there is the possibility it can either go up or go down. \nThe Council of Economic Advisers thinks we need probably close to a \nmillion new jobs every year.\n  I think what we, in our considerations, were thinking about \nestablishing is some panel that would be made up of workers as well as \nmembers of the business community and people who could help give an \nassessment, and make a recommendation of what that number would be.\n  I think that is probably the best way to go in the future. But that \nis not where we are today. Where we are today in the bill is 400,000 \nand the possibility of an escalator to go up or an escalator to go \ndown.\n  The Senator says: Let's start off in this area, we are not sure how \nthis program is going to work. Let's start off with just 200,000, watch \nit very carefully, find out if the kind of mix we have with this and \nwith the point system we have been able to develop is going to function \nand work, whether after 2 years people will really go back or they will \nnot go back.\n  I think he makes a strong case. I did not support this last year. I \nfeel sort of compelled--under the agreements we have made earlier in \nterms of the totality, I feel the same restraint this time. But I \ncommend him for the thoughtful presentation. It was thoughtful last \nyear, and it is thoughtful this year. He makes his points very \neffectively. It ought to be considered by the Members. I do not, as I \nmentioned, tend to support it, but I certainly would ask our colleagues \nto look at it very closely because it is a thoughtful presentation. He \nraises some very important and worthwhile points.\n  I thank him also for coming over here and offering this amendment. I \nthink the time has been set for voting at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez.) The senior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is obviously hard to calculate what is \nthe precise figure among the Senators who crafted the so-called ``grand \ncompromise.'' We thought the figure we had here was correct. We are \naware that the Senator from New Mexico offered an amendment last year \nand was successful in reducing the amount to 200,000. But I think \neither figure would be understandable. But I will stand by what we have \nworked out in the bill.\n  In arriving at the compromise legislation which has been proposed, \nthere was a great deal of give-and-take. While we are facing a \ntremendous number of objections from both sides of the political \nspectrum, for every point someone does not like, there were concessions \nmade by others for some points the person does like. There is no doubt \nthat we are facing very substantial criticism in the initial stages of \nthe consideration of this bill. The criticism came before the bill was \neven printed. The criticism has continued after it was printed, before \npeople had a chance to read it. There is a great deal of analysis and \nconsideration being undertaken at the present time.\n  I think Senator Lott has expressed the issue very succinctly; that \nis, do we have a problem? The answer to that is, categorically, yes, we \nhave an enormous problem. We have a border which is porous. We have \nanarchy in the way the immigration system works at the present time. \nPeople are complaining that it is amnesty. In my legal judgment, it is \nnot. It is not amnesty because people have to pay a fine, people have \nto have a job, people have to contribute to our society, people have to \npay their taxes, people have to learn English, people go to the very \nend of the line, are not even considered until they have been here 8 \nyears, and it may take as long as 13 years. That is not amnesty.\n  But the fact is that these 12 million undocumented immigrants are \ngoing to be here whether we pass this bill or not. The only difference \nwill be whether they will be here in a way where we regulate their \npresence here. If we have a registration system, we will have an \nopportunity to identify people who ought to be deported. It is not \npractical to deport 12 million people. But when we cull through the \nlist, we may find those who should be deported, if in a practical sense \nthey can be deported. To deport someone, you have to take them into \ncustody. Then you have to have detention facilities, and then you have \nto have judicial proceedings. It is a total impossibility to think of \ndeporting 12 million undocumented immigrants, but at least we would \nmove toward regulation.\n  As part of the comprehensive system, we are structuring border \nsecurity as outlined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael \nChertoff. The entire border would be covered either by fences, by \nobstacles, or by drones. So the entire border would be covered, fences \ncovering the populated areas.\n  It is not possible to structure border security so that no one slips \nthrough, but by moving toward employer verification, we will be \neliminating the magnet. Until we have a system to positively identify \nwho is legal and who is illegal, you cannot impose tough sanctions on \nthe employers. But now that we have that system, those tough sanctions \ncan be imposed, and that has the objective, a realistic objective, of \neliminating the magnet.\n  There is great distrust, and understandably so, as to whether the \nenforcement procedures will occur. Bear in mind that there are \npreconditions to having the guest worker program or the processing of \nthe 12 million undocumented immigrants.\n  I think it is fair criticism that since the 1986 legislation, no \nadministration, Democratic or Republican, has enforced the law. There \nare ideas which are now being formulated to move to a very prompt \nappropriation immediately after the bill is passed--if and when it is \npassed--so that we have a structure here.\n  Senators Lott's first question is: Do we have a problem? Yes. Is this \nbill an improvement? Yes. Again, categorically. Will there be a better \nchance at a better time to improve the system? Categorically, no. If we \ndo not get it done at this setting, as we are moving ahead, hopefully \nshortly after the Memorial Day recess, then we are off into the \nappropriations process, and next year is an election year. So that if \nnot now, if not never, certainly not soon.\n  When we come to the Bingaman amendment, as I say, my preference is to \nstick with the bill. A certain understanding has been reached among \nthose who were parties to the negotiations of the structuring of the \nbill to stand together on it. If the Bingaman amendment is adopted, \nthen it is my hope we will retain the adjustment features so that if we \nfind that more or fewer guest workers are necessary for our economy, \nrealizing they perform a very vital function in so much of our economy, \nin the restaurants and the hotels, on the farms, landscaping, so many \nfacets--talked about that yesterday with the hearings which we held in \nthe Judiciary Committee last year, cited the economists who testified \nabout the importance of immigrants in our economic structure--I hope we \nwill at least retain the so-called adjustor factors so we can make \nadjustments should that become necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first of all, let me take a moment to \nacknowledge the senior Senator from\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nPennsylvania, the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, for their leadership and Herculean efforts on this \nlegislation. In the spirit of praise I heard just a moment ago from the \nSenator from New Mexico on bringing judiciousness to this process, I \nrise in opposition to amendment No. 1166 offered by the very \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. The amendment would \neliminate judicial review of removal proceedings where revocation of a \nvisa is the sole ground for removal. That may sound technical and \ncomplex, but the amendment is actually quite simple in the way it \nworks. It means that if the State Department should wrongly decide to \nrevoke a visa, whether through bureaucratic error or misjudgment, and \nthen the Department of Homeland Security tries to remove you from the \nUnited States, you have no opportunity to have your case heard in \nFederal court; the case ends at the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  It means a dissident lawfully admitted to the United States on a \nvisitors visa could find himself giving a speech one day and then the \nvery next day learn the Department of State revoked his visa based on \nfalse information provided by his home country. The dissident may even \nrisk punishment upon return to his home country. But there will be no \nmeans to fight his removal in Federal court. The amendment means that \nwhen DHS invokes the ideological exclusion provision which allows the \nGovernment to exclude anyone from the country who endorses or espouses \nterrorism or persuades others to support terrorism, there is no \njudicial check to make sure that is, in fact, what is going on, and \nthat great power is not being abused.\n  As U.S. district judge Paul Crotty wrote in an opinion last year, \nrejecting the Government's efforts to exclude a Swiss citizen who had a \nvisa to teach religion, conflict, and peace-building at Notre Dame \nUniversity.\n\n       While the Executive may exclude an alien for almost any \n     reason, it cannot do so solely because the Executive \n     disagrees with the content of the alien's speech and \n     therefore wants to prevent the alien from sharing this speech \n     with a willing American audience.\n\n  That is exactly the kind of case which would be barred by the \namendment we are debating. What is the basis for this change? How can \nit be that review by a Federal court under these circumstances is such \na serious burden to the Government that it must be eliminated? Are the \ncourts clogged with these cases? Is it too much to require DHS to \nsubmit to a modicum of checks and balances before it exerts its power \nto expel someone under these circumstances? Judicial review of visa \nrevocation is already severely limited--so severely limited, in fact, \nthat the subject of this amendment is the only area remaining in which \nsomebody can still seek judicial review of a removal order.\n  Too often, we are obliged to defend basic principles of American \ndemocracy--in other circumstances, the great writ of habeas corpus; \nhere, the core principle of separation of powers and judicial review. \nWe should not trample lightly on our founding principles.\n  I have said over and over that the cornerstone of any comprehensive \nimmigration package must be strengthened security at our borders, \nenhanced workplace enforcement, and a sensible, practical solution for \nthe 12 million people already living illegally in this country. But \nstrong security means smart security, and smart security must include \nrespect for the administration of justice, including our great American \nsystem of checks and balances, and a realization that sometimes the \nGovernment gets it wrong.\n  This amendment, by further limiting the authority of Federal courts \nto hear removal cases, goes too far. I ask my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the immigration \nbill, the underlying amendment.\n  I am delighted we are taking up this issue dealing with immigration. \nI am glad we are debating this important issue in the Senate and that \nthe majority leader has dedicated 2 weeks to do this bill. I think we \nneed at least that period of time to delve into this issue. I have \nworked on it before. I have served on the Judiciary Committee. It is a \ntough topic, and it needs a lot of debate.\n  Immigration is an issue which has seized Americans across the Nation. \nPeople are torn trying to balance two fundamental American principles: \none, of being a rule of law nation; and, second, trying to be a \ncompassionate society. Here I think we do not need to mitigate either \nof these desires, that we can do both of them. But it is difficult and \nthe details matter.\n  America is a nation of both justice and compassion. The two are not \nmutually exclusive. But reconciling the two is sometimes difficult, as \nwe find in this debate.\n  Currently, we have, we think, somewhere around 12 million illegal \nimmigrants in our country. The number is growing. In 1987, there were \nroughly 4 million undocumented immigrants in our country; in 1997, \nthere were roughly 7 million; and today, in 2007, there are somewhere \naround 12 million. In addition, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, \nannual arrivals of illegal immigrants have exceeded the arrival of \nlegal immigrants since 1985. That is not the trend we want.\n\n  The reality is our immigration system is seriously broken and needs \nto be fixed. Some people think the solution is to grant undocumented \nimmigrants amnesty as we did in 1986, but that won't work. Others think \nthe solution to the problem is to simply enforce the laws we have and \nkick everyone out. We have taken a serious look at this option, and \nalthough our enforcement efforts over the last year have dramatically \nincreased, I do not believe this answer alone will work either.\n  The office responsible for detaining and removing illegal immigrants \nis the Office of Detention and Removal, DRO. It is a division of U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the largest investigative agency \nin the Department of Homeland Security. You may be surprised to know \nthat the DRO is actually quite large, despite the relatively small \nimpact they are able to have. DRO includes 6,700 authorized employees, \nincluding nearly 5,300 law enforcement officers and 1,400 support \npersonnel. To put this in perspective, the number of DRO law \nenforcement officers is just under half as large as the number of FBI \nspecial agents. With these resources in 2006, ICE, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, removed 187,513 illegal aliens from the country--a \nrecord for the agency and a 10-percent increase over the number of \nremovals during the prior fiscal year. If you do the math, though, that \nworks out to roughly 28 illegal aliens deported per DRO employee per \nyear or 35 deportations per law enforcement officer per year. At that \npace, if we shut down the border to a point at which no one crosses \nillegally, and successfully end 100 percent of the visa overstays and \ndouble the number of DRO agents, then it will take us 25 to 30 years to \ndeport the estimated 11 million to 13 million illegal aliens who are \ncurrently in the United States.\n  As a matter of national security, we can't afford to wait 30 years to \nknow who is in our country illegally. For the sake of our national \nsecurity and our Nation's future, we need to solve the immigration \nproblems facing our Nation now. The comprehensive bill before the \nSenate goes a long way toward\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nenabling us to fix our immigration system and the problem of illegal \nimmigration. I might point out that people are not opposed to \nimmigration, they are opposed to illegal immigration, and we need to \nget the legal system to work and fix the problems in it. I believe we \nneed a multifaceted approach to the complex immigration problem we are \nfacing, and the compromise bill before the Senate now will enable us to \ntake significant strides toward fixing the problem.\n  That said, there are certain aspects of the bill I wish to change. I \nlook forward to the opportunity to do so through the amendment process \nand to see whether I can support the final product.\n  With respect to solving the immigration problem, we must first and \nforemost secure the border, and this bill appears to do that. Section 1 \nof the bill ensures that we don't repeat one of the biggest mistakes of \nthe 1986 amnesty of implementing immigration reforms without increasing \nborder and worksite enforcement. The triggers in section 1 require the \nDHS Secretary to certify in writing the following border and worksite \nenforcement measures are funded, in place, and in operation before--\nbefore--initiating a guest worker program or issuing Z visas to current \nundocumented immigrants. These are the triggers: 18,000 Border Patrol \nhired; construction of 200 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of \nfencing; 70 ground-based radar and camera towers along the southern \nborder; the deployment of 4 unmanned aerial vehicles and supporting \nsystems; ending catch and release; resources to detain up to 27,500 \naliens per day on an annual basis; the use of secure and effective \nidentification tools to prevent unauthorized work; and the receiving, \nprocessing, and adjudication of applications for Z status.\n  I go through the details because the details really matter in this \nbill.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes enhanced border enforcement, \nincluding a national strategy for border security, 14,000 new Border \nPatrol agents by 2012, doubling the current force; 2,500 new Customs \nand Border Protection officers by 2012; 3,000 new DHS investigators by \n2010; 24,000 new detention beds by 2010; enhanced surveillance, using \nunmanned aerial vehicles, as I mentioned; cameras, sensors, satellites, \nand other technologies.\n  That is not enough for just taking care of the border. We also have \nto go to the workplace. Most people are attempting to enter the United \nStates illegally to work. I think we have to focus on what we do at the \nworkplace. I think we need to implement a smart worksite enforcement \nsystem, smart and tough. The primary reason for illegal immigration, as \nI stated, is employment. If we eliminate a person's ability to \nunlawfully gain employment, then we will dramatically reduce the \nincentive for illegal immigration. This bill includes several measures \nthat enhance our ability to enforce immigration laws at the workplace: \nincreasing penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal \nimmigrants; requiring DHS to issue a tamper-resistant work \nauthorization document with biometric information; allowing the \nCommissioner of Social Security to share information with DHS so they \ncan go after those who use fraudulent Social Security cards to gain \nemployment; creating an employment eligibility and verification system \nthat requires employers to electronically verify a prospective \nemployee's work authorization.\n  The robust worksite enforcement system included in this bill fixes a \nhuge hole in our current system and should curtail the use of false \ndocuments to fraudulently obtain employment.\n  Now let's look at the immigration system reforms. The most \nsignificant immigration reform this bill makes is the implementation of \na merit-based immigration system--and this is a big shift--to choose \nthe best and the brightest of those coming into our country. This \ndoesn't mean we should only allow rocket scientists or brain surgeons, \nbut education is and should be a factor. The merit-based system under \nthe bill does that. It sets up a system in which immigrants can earn \npoints in four categories: education, employment, English proficiency, \nand family.\n  In addition to the merit-based system, this bill ends chain migration \nfor extended family, while preserving family unification for the \nimmediate family. I think that is an important distinction, that we \nwant family reunification for immediate, nuclear family, but we don't \nwant the chain migration system for extended family members. This is an \nimportant change.\n\n  I am one of the staunchest supporters of family in the Senate. I \ndon't think our immigration system should blindly favor, though, non-\nnuclear families such as siblings and adult children over skilled \nworkers who are coming to apply their trade and contribute to our \neconomy. It seems to me this is an appropriate balance. Throughout this \nbill, what we are trying to accomplish is an appropriate, workable \nbalance for the good and the future of this Nation.\n  On the temporary guest worker program, once we are able to secure the \nborder and implement worksite enforcement enhancements, we need to \nreform our immigration system to create sufficient legal means for \nwell-meaning workers to come to our country and to work. The temporary \nguest worker program in this bill does that, while at the same time \nprotecting American workers and wages by: requiring employers to \nadvertise jobs to U.S. workers first; requiring employers to advertise \npay, a wage equal to that of an average wage for the particular job or \nindustry, particular in that region of the country; and prohibiting a \ntemporary guest worker from working in a county that has 7 percent \nunemployment or higher.\n  I think there are some important changes that need to be made in the \nbill. As I have said, the compromise bill before us does a lot of good, \nbut I think it is far from perfect and needs improvement.\n  To give some examples, section 601(h) of the bill gives certain \nimmigration benefits to undocumented immigrants who seek \n``probationary'' status, and states that an undocumented immigrant can \nobtain no probationary benefits until the alien has passed all \nappropriate background checks, or until the next business day, \nwhichever is sooner. So you have a 24-hour check period. That is \ninsufficient, if they want to look into the background of an individual \nseeking this probationary status. I will seek to change that particular \nprovision. The impact of this provision is that 12 million or more \nundocumented immigrants could receive lawful status, the right to work, \nand other such benefits even if a background check cannot be completed \nin time.\n  I think the problems with this provision are significant and obvious. \nFirst, in a post-9/11 world, it is misguided at best and dangerous at \nworst to grant millions of people unlawfully present in the United \nStates lawful status, even if a background check has not been \ncompleted. That is not wise. Second, there is no evidence that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is capable of conducting cross-\ndepartmental and cross-governmental background checks, let alone a \nmillion of them, or millions of them, in a 24-hour time period. Third, \nmany records relevant to a background check are not electronic and/or \nare not in possession of or otherwise accessible to the Federal \nGovernment, suggesting that more than one business day may be required \nfor a thorough check, and a thorough check we must do. This is an \nimportant issue with potentially grave consequences for our national \nsecurity.\n  I have filed an amendment to change this provision so no one would \nreceive any immigration benefits without passing a background check. I \nwould urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  In addition, I think the bill should require followup background \nchecks when Z visa holders apply to extend their visa beyond the \ninitial 4 years. As the bill is drafted, it leaves that decision to \nperform a background check up to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I think we need to be able to have removal proceedings for ineligible \nZ visa applicants. Section 601(d) of the bill lays out certain grounds \nof ineligibility for a Z visa, which include multiple criminal \nconvictions, controlled substance trafficking, trafficking in persons, \nand even terrorist activity.\n  The very same section also states:\n\n       Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary to \n     commence removal proceedings against an alien.\n\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\n\n  The obvious question is: Why not? Why should DHS not be required to \nimmediately begin removal proceedings against someone who is ineligible \nfor a Z visa because they are a criminal or a terrorist? I think DHS \nshould be required to begin removal proceedings or at the very least \ntake steps toward removing such people from the country.\n  The two main reasons for providing undocumented immigrants the \nability to obtain a Z visa are to separate those who are here with good \nintentions to work and support their families from those who intend to \ndo us harm; and second, to create a system where people have a legal \nstatus. In order to successfully do this, this provision needs to be \nchanged so when an individual is found to be ineligible to remain in \nthe country legally under this program, they are removed.\n  In conclusion, I look forward to continuing this debate on this bill \non these issues I have identified and others to strengthen this bill. \nAs many Members have said, this bill is not perfect and can certainly \nbe improved in ways I have noted and in others. But we can't use the \nbill's imperfections as an excuse for doing nothing for a system that \nis clearly broken.\n  I look forward to offering these amendments to improve the bill, and \nI look forward to hearing some of the ideas my colleagues in the Senate \nhave as well. At the end of the day, I hope we can pass a bill the \nPresident can sign, so we can say we did something to improve America \nby enacting immigration legislation that secures our borders, restores \nrespect for our laws, and creates an immigration system that works.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:20 p.m. \ntoday, there be 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the \nBingaman amendment No. 1169, with the time divided as follows: 2 \nminutes under the control of Senator Bingaman, and 1 minute each under \nthe control of Senators Kennedy and Specter or their designees; that \nwithout further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the amendment, with no second-degree amendment in \norder prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish also to speak to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, last year, I spoke at one of the marches in \nChicago for comprehensive immigration reform. I looked out across the \nfaces in the crowd. I saw mothers and fathers, citizens and \nnoncitizens, people of Polish and Mexican descent, working Americans, \nand children. What I know is these are people we should embrace, not \nfear. We can and should be able to see ourselves in them.\n  I do not say that to diminish the complexity of the task. I say it \nbecause I believe that attitude must guide our discourse. We can and \nshould be able to fix our broken immigration system and do so in a way \nthat is reflective of American values and ideals and the tradition we \nhave of accepting immigrants to our shores.\n  I think the bill that has come to the floor is a fine first step, but \nI strongly believe it requires some changes. I am working with others \nto improve it.\n  In approaching immigration reform, I believe that we must enact \ntough, practical reforms that ensure and promote the legal and orderly \nentry of immigrants into our country. Just as important, we must \nrespect the humanity of the carpenters and bricklayers who help build \nAmerica; the humanity of garment workers and farmworkers who come to \nAmerica to join their families; the humanity of the students like my \nfather who come to America in search of the dream. We are a Nation of \nimmigrants, and we must respect that shared history as this debate \nmoves forward.\n  To fix the system in a way that does not require us to revisit the \nsame problem in twenty years, I continue to believe that we need \nstronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace. And that means \na workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the \nlegality of their workers.\n  But for reform to work, we also must respond to what pulls people to \nAmerica and what pushes them out of their home countries. Where we can \nreunite families, we should. Where we can bring in more foreign-born \nworkers with the skills our economy needs, we should. And these goals \nare not mutually exclusive. We should not say that Spanish speaking or \nworking class immigrants are only good enough to be temporary workers \nand cannot earn the right to be part of the American family.\n  With regard to the most pressing part of the immigration challenge--\nthe 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.--we must \ncreate an earned path to citizenship. Now, no one condones unauthorized \nentry into the United States. And by supporting an earned path to \ncitizenship, I am not saying that illegal entry should go unpunished. \nThe path to permanent residence and eventual citizenship must be tough \nenough to make it clear that unauthorized entry was wrong.\n  But these immigrants are our neighbors. They go to our churches, and \ntheir kids go to our schools. They provide the hard labor that supports \nmany of the industries in our country. We should bring them out of \nhiding, make them pay the appropriate fines for their mistakes, and \nthen help them become tax paying, law-abiding, productive members of \nsociety.\n  I am heartened by the agreement that we have to put all 12 million \nundocumented immigrants on a path to earned citizenship. I applaud \nthose who worked on this compromise. But there are other parts of the \ncompromise deal before us that cause me serious concern. Let me briefly \naddress some of those concerns.\n  In order to stem the demand for illegal workers, we need a mandatory \nemployment verification system that is actually mandatory. It needs to \nallow employers to check with the Department of Homeland Security to \nsee that their employees are legally eligible to work in the United \nStates. This is something I worked on last year. But this year's \nversion of the employment eligibility verification system would give \nDHS too much power to force the screening of everyone working in \nAmerica without appropriate safeguards. I will be working with others \nto offer an amendment to make this provision closer to what we proposed \nlast year.\n  As for the guestworker program in the bill, it proposes to create a \nnew 400,000 person annual temporary worker program that could grow to \n600,000 without Congressional approval. And it expands the existing \nseasonal guestworker programs from 66,000 up to 100,000 in the first \nyear and 200,000 after that. At the end of their temporary status, \nalmost all of these workers would have to go home. That means at the \nend of the first three years, we would have at least 1.2 million of \nthese new guestworkers in the country with only 30,000 of those having \nany real hope of getting to stay. I believe we are setting ourselves up \nfor failure, and that will just create a new undocumented immigrant \npopulation.\n  As we have learned with misguided immigration policies in the past, \nit is naive to think that people who do not have a way to stay legally \nwill just abide by the system and leave. They won't. This new group of \nsecond-class workers will replace the current group of undocumented \nimmigrants, placing downward pressure on American wages and working \nconditions. And when their time is up, they will go into the shadows \nwhere our current system exploits the undocumented today.\n  I will support amendments aimed at fixing the temporary worker \nprogram that Senator Bingaman and others will be offering. And if we're \ngoing to have a new temporary worker program, those workers should have \nan opportunity to stay if they prove themselves capable and willing to \nparticipate in this country.\n  But the most disturbing aspect of this bill is the point system for \nfuture immigrants. As currently drafted, it does not reflect how much \nAmericans value the family ties that bind people to their brothers and \nsisters or to their parents.\n  As I understand it, a similar point system is used in Australia and \nCanada and is intended to attract immigrants who can help produce more \ngoods. But we need to consider more than economics; we also need to \nconsider our Nation's unique history and values and what family-based \npreferences are designed to accomplish. As currently\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nstructured, the points system gives no preference to an immigrant with \na brother or sister or even a parent who is a United States citizen \nunless the immigrant meets some minimum and arbitrary threshold on \neducation and skills.\n  That's wrong and fails to recognize the fundamental morality of \nuniting Americans with their family members. It also places a person's \njob skills over his character and work ethic. How many of our \nforefathers would have measured up under this point system? How many \nwould have been turned back at Ellis Island?\n  I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator Menendez to remove that \narbitrary minimum threshold of points before family starts to count and \nto bump up the points for family ties.\n  And at the appropriate time, I will be offering another amendment \nwith Senator Menendez, to sunset the points system in the bill. The \nproposed point system constitutes, at a minimum, a radical experiment \nin social engineering and a departure from our tradition of having \nfamily and employers invite immigrants to come. If we are going to \nallow this to go forward, then Congress should revisit the point system \nin five years to give us time to examine the concept in depth and \ndetermine whether its intended or unintended consequences are worth the \ncost of continuing the experiment or whether we should return to the \nexisting system that allows immigrants to be sponsored through family \nand employers.\n  In closing, we must construct a final product that has broad \nbipartisan support and will work. I agree with Senator Brownback that \nthe time to fix our broken immigration system is now. If we do not fix \nit this year, I fear that divisions over the issue will only deepen and \nthe challenge will grow.\n  I also believe that we have to get it right. I think it is critical \nthat as we embark on this enormous venture to update our immigration \nsystem, it is fully reflective of the powerful tradition of immigration \nin this country and fully reflective of our values and ideals.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I inquire, is the pending business the \nBingaman amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will speak on that. I support the \nBingaman amendment. It is sort of instructive in a number of different \nways for us in the Senate because I don't know how the number 400,000, \nfor the first year of the program, got accepted as the number that we \nwould have in the temporary worker program. The temporary worker \nprogram is a new way of doing business that I think has great \npotential, although I am concerned about how it can be effectuated in \nits details. The temporary worker program is now in addition to the \npermanent citizenship track that we have in our country--the track \nwhere you get a green card and then move on to citizenship.\n  So the temporary worker program is designed to create an opportunity \nfor people who want to come into America and work for a period of time \nbut who do not desire or may not be accepted on the citizenship track. \nIt makes some sense to me. We have had a portion of our State damaged \nin Hurricane Katrina, and Mississippi and Louisiana have been severely \ndamaged; tremendous reconstruction is being done. That created a real \nshortage of labor. Anybody can say that area of the country--at least \nfor a certain period of time--needs additional labor, and temporary \nworkers could help fulfill that and other needs in the country.\n  I wish to say that the temporary worker program, as I understand it \nin the legislation--remember, it was dropped in Monday night; that is \nthe first time it has been filed as part of the legislative process in \nthe Senate, and no hearings have been conducted on it--the 400,000 \nwould be for 2 years. So you would have 400,000 come in year one of the \nbill's passage. They would stay for 2 years. The year after the first \ngroup gets here, another 400,000 would come the next year. So it is \n800,000, at a minimum, after the first year. So that is a lot of people \nwho would be coming in on the temporary worker program.\n  I am not aware that we have ever done any research or gone out and \nactually studied how many temporary workers we need. Apparently, the \nconferees--this group I affectionately call the ``masters of the \nuniverse,'' who met and came up with this 400,000 number, talked to \nsome interest groups out here, and they got an idea somewhere about how \nmany it ought to be. I don't know how they reached that number. I will \nsay this to my colleagues. Earlier this year, when this proposal was \nraised about a temporary worker program and expressed to me in a way \nthat could actually work, I thought it was a good idea. That is why I \nvoted--reluctantly--against Senator Dorgan's amendment, because I think \nwe need a temporary worker program. But when I asked how many, a member \nof the Bush administration said 200,000. So now it is 400,000 and over \n2 years it becomes, at a minimum, 800,000, and there are accelerators \nin it that indicate to us--the way my staff calculated the numbers--and \nI think we are fairly accurate--it would be, in 2 years, almost 900,000 \ntemporary workers alone, not including their family members. So I am \nnot sure that is correct. Professor Borjas at Harvard, himself a Cuban \nrefugee who has studied immigration more deeply than anyone in the \ncountry, I would suspect, has written one of the more preeminent books, \n``Heaven's Door,'' that deals statistically and quite methodically with \nimmigration and its consequences and how it works out.\n  It is calculated that the low-income workers in America have received \nan 8-percent reduction in their wages as a result of a large amount of \nimmigration. So there is no doubt that more and more immigration has an \nincreasingly adverse impact on the wages of hard-working American \ncitizens. I don't think anybody can dispute that. Where did this come \nfrom--the 400,000--really 800,000--really almost 900,000? Where did \nthat number come from? I don't know.\n  Professor Borjas, who is a part of the Kennedy School at Harvard--\nperhaps Senator Kennedy needs to meet him sometime--Professor Borjas \nsaid in his opinion, 500,000 immigrants a year is the right number. I \ndon't know what the right number is. He is a Cuban immigrant. He came \nhere as a young man fleeing the oppression of Castro. That is what he \nsays.\n  Where did this number 800,000, almost 900,000 come from? Actually, I \nthink it kicks in with an accelerator. In the outyears, it goes up even \n10 to 15 percent a year. It is complicated to read. We just haven't had \nmuch time to figure it out.\n  I think the deal is set up, actually. I think the people who wrote \nthe bill knew we were not going to approve 400,000 people a year and \n800,000 over 2 years--that is in the country at a given time, 800,000 \nto 900,000. I think they knew that. Everybody has known all along. \nSenator Bingaman has filed his amendment to cut that number in half, \nand then we will go to 200,000 a year, and everybody can say we did \nsomething, we made this bill better, so now let's all vote for it.\n  Regardless, if that is what the deal was about, I suggest to my \ncolleagues that certainly the Bingaman amendment is a move in the right \ndirection. Until we have some very good economic data that shows this \ncountry needs a lot more than 200,000, we ought not to be doing it \nbecause, remember, the 12 million people we see out here today who are \nhere illegally and those who are here legally are not going to be made \nto leave America under the amnesty we have here.\n  If someone came in December 31 of last year, they would be able to \nstay in this country. So now we are talking about, on top of all of \nthat, on top of the 1 million people who come into the country with \ngreen cards that we give each year, that permanent track, we are \ntalking about another track for temporary workers which is in addition \nto AgJOBS, the agricultural and seasonal workers. So this is a big \nnumber.\n  This bill could be two times plus the current rate of legal \nimmigration into America. I don't think the average\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nAmerican would believe, when we are supposed to reform this broken \nimmigration system, that we would be creating a system that would \ndouble the number of people legally coming into the country because \neven though we certainly hope any legislation that passes would reduce \nsomewhat the number of illegal entries, we know we will still have \nillegal entries on top of that.\n  This probably is a very easy vote for colleagues to vote for the \nBingaman amendment. I don't see a reason not to do so. I am not aware \nof any economic study or objective analysis that says we need these \nkinds of large numbers of immigrants.\n  Professor Chiswick at the University of Illinois in Chicago testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, when we brought \nup this issue last year. He cautioned strongly that a large flow of \nlow-skilled workers will pull down the wages of American workers. Alan \nTonelson, who wrote about a number of job categories from 2000 to 2005, \nsaid wages of workers have not gone up, that they actually have gone \ndown, and in each one of those areas, more than half the workers were \nAmerican citizens.\n  This is a matter we ought to be careful about. I believe 200,000 is \nmore than adequate based on what I know. And I support the Bingaman \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nBingaman amendment. The idea of 400,000 temporary workers per year was \nnot just pulled out of thin air, but it is based on the estimates of \nwhat is needed on a yearly basis to meet the needs of our economy. It, \nin fact, parallels what takes place each and every year as \napproximately that many illegal workers cross our borders.\n  Much has been said about whether there is a need for a workforce. I \nbelieve there is. In my home State, the people who are more adamant in \npursuing a bill on immigration reform are those very employers who \ncannot seem to find enough workers to fill their needs. They are in the \nhospitality industry, the tourism industry, our attractions, theme \nparks. They are also in agriculture, as well as home construction, \nwhich is a huge part of Florida's economy. All of those people seem \nhard pressed to have enough people available to do the work that is \nwaiting.\n  So this is a number that was derived according to the Pew Hispanic \nCenter in a March 2005 survey of the migrant population which suggested \na group of about 500,000 a year. We think it is a good idea from that \nstandpoint. It is a legitimate number. It is based on the studies of \nwhat our needs seem to be.\n  At the end of the day, it is about supply and demand. It is about the \nissue that there is a workforce available to meet the demand for \nworkers, and that is the problem in which we find ourselves.\n  But there is another problem, too, and that has to do with the \nborder. Sure, we are going to do all we can to lessen the likelihood of \nillegal border crossings. We are going to have more border agents. We \nare going to have electronic surveillance. We are going to have all \nthat we can build physically and technologically provide, as well as \nmanpower, to provide for safety at the border.\n  However, wouldn't it be a good idea if to assist safety at the \nborder, if to assist and lower the number of illegal entries in our \ncountry, if we disincentivized and legalized the way people come to \nwork in America? At the end of the day, that is what our 400,000 number \nseeks to do. Reducing it to 200,000 would diminish the effectiveness of \nour current approach of having a guest worker force that really is \ncoming here legally.\n  I hope the Bingaman amendment does not receive the support of the \nSenate. I ask my colleagues to stick with the number that is in the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I made remarks earlier about my \nestimation of the number of persons who would be admitted. I would like \nto be a little more precise and explain it this way. In the first year, \nunder the bill as written, when 400,000 would be allowed in, 400,000 \nwould come for a 2 year period. In the second year, we will have a 15-\npercent escalator clause. If that is met, the next year would be \n460,000 new workers. So we are talking about at that point 860,000 \nworkers. Then 20 percent of the people who come as temporary workers \nare entitled to bring their families.\n  On average--and the numbers, I think, are undisputed--when a person \nis allowed to bring their family, it adds 1.2 persons to the number. So \nI calculate in just 2 years, the temporary worker program, as written \nin the bill, will allow for over 1 million persons into the country. I \nbelieve that is an honest and fair statement of where the numbers are.\n  I take seriously these numbers because last year my staff worked \ntheir hearts out and concluded and shocked everybody that the bill as \noriginally introduced, the McCain-Kennedy bill, would allow 78 million \nto 200 million persons into our country in just 20 years when it, at \nthe normal rate, would be less than 20 million. Some objected to those \nnumbers. The Heritage Foundation did a similar study about the same \ntime, and their numbers confirmed our numbers.\n  At that point, Senator Bingaman offered two amendments and I offered \none and it ended up bringing the number down to 53 million over 20 \nyears to enter legally as opposed to this incredible number. With these \naccelerators and this large a number, I think we ought to be very \ncautious.\n  I would also note, again, that the Bingaman amendment does not reduce \nthe AgJOBS people who would be coming under that track or the seasonal \nworker people who would be coming. So a number of areas will not be \nreduced. I think it clearly is the correct thing to do to adopt the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 4 minutes of debate on \namendment No. 1169, offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, with 2 minutes under the control of Senator Bingaman and 1 \nminute each under the control of Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly, and then I \nwill reserve the last minute to try to close this debate.\n  This amendment will reduce the number of people who can come into the \ncountry under this new guest worker program. The underlying bill calls \nfor 400,000, up to 600,000 per year coming in under this new guest \nworker program. The amendment I am offering would reduce that to \n200,000 per year, maximum. I think that is plenty.\n  This is an unproven, untested, brandnew program. We need to see how \nit is working. We need to see the impact it is having on other wage \nrates in the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support that amendment. I will reserve the \nremainder of my time in case there is someone speaking against the \namendment. Then I will conclude.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from New Mexico \nfor his presentation on this issue. He has spoken to those of us who \nhave been working on immigration about his concerns on the numbers. He \nmade this\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\npresentation the last time the Senate considered the immigration bill \nand was successful, and I expect he will be this afternoon.\n  It was very difficult for us to make an exact judgment about the \ntotal numbers. Those numbers were set at about 400,000 because that was \na somewhat lower estimate of people who were coming in here who were \nundocumented, and it was also recommended by the Council of Economic \nAdvisers in terms of the needs of the economy. That is where it is \nfrom.\n  But he makes a legitimate point--we do not have a real definite idea \nabout what these numbers ought to be. We looked at the idea that we \nestablish this program and then try to establish a commission that \nwould make a recommendation to Congress in terms of the numbers on into \nthe future. I think that is probably the best way to proceed in the \nfuture.\n  I will reluctantly oppose the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico, but I thank him for the thought he has given to this issue. We \nwill be willing to work with him regardless of how this comes out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield whatever time we \nhave--except for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and \ncongratulate him on his leadership in getting us to this point in the \ndebate. I do hope Members will support this amendment. We had 79 \nSenators support this amendment when it was offered last year. I hope \nwe get a strong vote again this year. I think this is the prudent thing \nto do. It does not destroy the bill. It does allow for a guest worker \nprogram but a much more prudent one than would otherwise be the case.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator suspend?\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do. Mr. President, I believe I have 1 minute of \nargument?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been called \nfor, and the impression was at that time that time had been yielded \nback.\n  Is there sufficient second for the yeas and nays? There is.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask consent--I think I yielded the time \nback before I knew the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is a cosponsor, \ndesired to speak. It will only be half a minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent that he be able to speak prior to the time of the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I amend that, Mr. President, to request a full \nminute?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the 400,000 figure was decided after a \nvery careful analysis and consideration. We had hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee where prominent economists stepped forward to \ntestify about the importance of immigrant help. We have an economy \nwhich relies on immigrants for hospitals, for hotels, for restaurants, \nfor farms, for landscapers, and many lines.\n  One crucial feature of the Bingaman amendment would take out the \nadjustment factor, which is important, where we say the needs rise and \nfall. If the Bingaman amendment is adopted--and I know it was adopted \nby a large vote last year--at least I hope we will return to provide \nfor the adjustment factor so we can raise or lower the number depending \nupon the needs of the economy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent. The Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 74, nays 24, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 175 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--74\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--24\n\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     Salazar\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1169) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, Senator Grassley was here earlier. I \nunderstand he may be modifying his amendment. Senator Graham is \nprepared to move ahead. Then we will alternate back and forth. The \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is ready to go. I see the \nSenator from South Carolina. If he is prepared to proceed, we will go \nahead with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1173\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I call up amendment 1173.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Isakson, Mr. McCain, Mr. Martinez, and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 1173 to amendment No. \n     1150.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for minimum sentences for aliens who reenter the \n                      United States after removal)\n\n       Strike subsections (a) through (c) of section 276 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by section 207 of \n     this Act, and insert the following:\n       ``(a) Reentry After Removal.--Any alien who has been denied \n     admission, excluded, deported, or removed, or who has \n     departed the United States while an order of exclusion, \n     deportation, or removal is outstanding, and subsequently \n     enters, attempts to enter, crosses the border to, attempts to \n     cross the border to, or is at any time found in the United \n     States, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, \n     and imprisoned not less than 60 days and not more than 2 \n     years.\n       ``(b) Reentry of Criminal Offenders.--Notwithstanding the \n     penalty provided in subsection (a), if an alien described in \n     that subsection--\n       ``(1) was convicted for 3 or more misdemeanors or a felony \n     before such removal or departure, the alien shall be fined \n     under title 18, United States Code, and imprisoned not less \n     than 1 year and not more than 10 years;\n       ``(2) was convicted for a felony before such removal or \n     departure for which the alien was sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment of not\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n     less than 30 months, the alien shall be fined under such \n     title, and imprisoned not less than 2 years and not more than \n     15 years;\n       ``(3) was convicted for a felony before such removal or \n     departure for which the alien was sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment of not less than 60 months, the alien shall be \n     fined under such title, and imprisoned not less than 4 years \n     and not more than 20 years;\n       ``(4) was convicted for 3 felonies before such removal or \n     departure, the alien shall be fined under such title, and \n     imprisoned not less than 4 years and not more than 20 years; \n     or\n       ``(5) was convicted, before such removal or departure, for \n     murder, rape, kidnaping, or a felony offense described in \n     chapter 77 (relating to peonage and slavery) or 113B \n     (relating to terrorism) of such title, the alien shall be \n     fined under such title, and imprisoned not less than 5 years \n     and not more than 20 years.\n       ``(c) Reentry After Repeated Removal.--Any alien who has \n     been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed 3 or \n     more times and thereafter enters, attempts to enter, crosses \n     the border to, attempts to cross the border to, or is at any \n     time found in the United States, shall be fined under title \n     18, United States Code, and imprisoned not less than 2 years \n     and not more than 10 years.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we try to repair a broken immigration \nsystem and replace it with a new system that learns from the mistakes \nof the past, I believe it is time for this body and this country to get \nserious about enforcing border security violations. After 9/11, the \nimmigration debate has taken on a different tone. After 9/11, it is no \nlonger about economic and social problems associated with illegal \nimmigration. It is about national security problems associated with \nillegal immigration. In the Fort Dix, NJ, case, there were allegations \nmade that six people were conspiring to attack Fort Dix. Apparently, \nthree of those people came in illegally as children or crossed the \nsouthern border, and three of the people charged with crimes overstayed \ntheir visas. So it is more than securing the border. That is a central \nconcept to this bill.\n  Democrats and Republicans are rallying around the idea that the \ncurrent system is broken in many ways. The borders are not secure. When \nit comes time to verify employment, fraud is rampant. The way you get a \njob now is to produce a Social Security card. I could take a Social \nSecurity card out of my wallet and have it faked by midnight. We are \ntalking about replacing that kind of fraudulent system with tamperproof \nidentification, which would be a great change in terms of understanding \nwho is here and why they are here and employing people on our terms, \nnot theirs.\n  In the future, after we begin to control our borders, Senator \nIsakson's amendment says you can't bring new people into the country in \na permanent fashion until you meet border security triggers. The \nemployment verification trigger is a great idea. Here is the question I \nhave: After we do all this, after we spend all this money to secure our \nborders and replace fraudulent systems with tamperproof systems, what \ndo we do to people who try to come across illegally in the future? What \nmessage do we send them and the world?\n  Here is the message: If you come across our border illegally in the \nfuture, you violate our border security, you are going to jail. No more \ncatch you and send you back. My amendment would require a mandatory 60-\nday jail sentence for the first illegal reentry, up to a year but \nmandatory 60 days. If you come back again illegally, no less than 2 \nyears. So everyone needs to know that America is changing its \nimmigration laws, and we are going to be serious about enforcing them. \nIf you break our laws, you do so at your own peril, and you will lose \nyour freedom. That will help us dramatically make sure we don't repeat \nthe mistakes of the past.\n  There is another group of people we need to deal with in terms of \nillegal reentry that is bone chilling. The amendment would create \nmandatory jail time for people who have been convicted of crimes in the \nUnited States, illegal immigrants who have committed violent offenses, \nnonviolent offenses, who have served jail time, that if you get \ndeported--and you are required to be deported after you serve your \nsentence--and get caught coming back into this country, you are going \nto go to jail, not be deported again.\n  Let me give an example. Angel Resendiz is known as the railroad \nkiller. Let me tell you the story of this criminal. In August 1976, he \ncame across the border illegally. In September 1979, he was sentenced \nto a 20-year prison term for auto theft and assault in Miami, FL. He \nwas paroled within 6 years and released into Mexico as a result of \ndeportation. Over the next 10 years, he was apprehended and tried in \nTexas for falsely claiming citizenship. He did an 18-month prison term. \nHe was arrested for possessing a concealed weapon in 1988 in New \nOrleans and received another 18-month prison term. Every time he was \nsentenced, he was deported and came right back to commit another crime. \nHe got 30 months for attempting to defraud Social Security in St. \nLouis. He pled guilty to burglary charges in New Mexico that gained him \nan 18-month prison term, and he was paroled in 1992. He was apprehended \nin the Santa Fe rail yard for trespassing and carrying a firearm in \n1995.\n  On June 2, 1999, he was apprehended by the Border Patrol for crossing \nillegally. Due to a computer glitch, they let him go. Every time he \ncommitted a crime and served a sentence, he was deported, only to come \nright back and commit another crime. Once we caught him, all we did was \ndeport him. He wound up killing two people within 48 hours of being \nreleased by the Border Patrol. If this amendment had been in place for \npeople such as this guy, once he was found back on our soil after he \nserved his prison term for a violent crime, he would not have been \ndeported. He would have gotten a 20-year jail sentence with a mandatory \nminimum of 5 years.\n\n  So there are people who have been convicted of rape and murder within \nthe United States who have illegally come across the border, committed \na crime, served their time, been deported, who have come right back, \ncommitted another crime, and nothing happens.\n  If this amendment becomes law, once you have been convicted of a \nviolent crime and deported, if you are found in our country, whether \nyou are committing a crime, that is a crime in and of itself, and you \nare going to go to jail for up to 20 years, with a minimum of 5 years.\n  Now that, to me, is what has been missing when it comes to our legal \nsystem and illegal immigration. It is now time to tell the world--our \nown citizens and all those who wish to come here--there is a right way \nto do it and there is a wrong way to do it. If you do it the wrong way \nin the future, you are going to go to jail.\n  We need to change the system that would allow nothing to happen to \nsomebody who had been in our country illegally, who was convicted of \nrape or murder, who served their sentence and had been deported, who \nillegally comes back into our country. If they cross the border again, \nif they cross the border in the future, after committing a violent \ncrime, they are going back to jail for serious jail time to protect us \nagainst them.\n  Now, I hope every Member of the body will understand this will make \nour effort to reform illegal immigration meaningful. If America does \nnot care about enforcing its laws in the future, those who want to \nviolate it will not care either.\n  So now is the time to start the clock over, learn from the mistakes \nof the past and make a national commitment to secure our borders and \ndeal with those who violate our immigration law in the sternest \nfashion. Because this Nation is under siege. After 9/11, illegal \nimmigration is not just about people coming here to work, it is about \npeople coming here to commit crimes and do us harm.\n  So I am very hopeful this amendment will become part of the bill, and \nwe can say, after this bill passes, we have taken a new approach, a \ntough approach, a long overdue approach, that we do care about the laws \non our books and we are going to enforce them, and if you violate the \nlaw in the future by illegally coming across our border, you are going \nto jail.\n  Mr. President, I would like, if I could, at this time, to recognize \nmy colleague from Georgia, Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my friend and my colleague, Senator Graham. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  As I have said before, I believe the agreement we reached among a \nbipartisan group of Members of this body is\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\na step in the right direction because it gets us to where we are today; \nthat is, we are debating this critical issue on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Bringing this issue to the floor of the Senate allows Members of this \nbody an opportunity to improve upon what has previously been \nnegotiated. Senator Graham's amendment is an improvement that should be \nadopted because it deals with the very most important part of this \nparticular bipartisan piece of legislation, that is, border security \nand interior enforcement.\n  This amendment creates a more effective deterrent against future \nillegal immigration by ensuring that illegal immigrants who are caught \nand deported and then return to the United States in violation of our \nlaws again serve minimum jail sentences. There is nobody who is going \nto be deported and gets caught coming back in who is going to escape \ngoing to jail. It is kind of unbelievable to think about that we do not \nalready have this kind of law on the books today. That is why this \npiece of bipartisan legislation is so critically important to the \nfuture of our immigration laws in this country.\n  Under current law, if an illegal alien is caught entering the United \nStates, that person is deported. This system is subject to abuse \nbecause an estimated 20 to 30 percent of those illegal immigrants \ndeported simply return to the United States again in an illegal way. If \nthat same person illegally reenters the United States again, they are \nsubject to fines or imprisonment, but currently there is not a \nmandatory jail term.\n  So our Border Patrol agents and our Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement agents are faced with the problem of removing the same \nillegal immigrants time and time again. This amendment will ensure that \neveryone who is deported from the United States and reenters will serve \njail time.\n  This is a most vital piece of legislation in getting control of our \nborders and in ensuring we have efficient and meaningful interior \nenforcement. This amendment is critical because it will make sure the \nresources of our Border Patrol and Customs agents are not expended on \nthe same violators again and again.\n  It also sends a strong signal to everyone in the world thinking about \nillegally coming to the United States that we are serious about our \nlaws and are seriously going to punish those who violate those laws.\n  I have to say, one problem we have, as we debate this bill and we \ntalk with folks back home, is the credibility of this body, as well as \nthe other body, as well as the agencies charged with carrying out the \nenforcement. Even though we are charged with oversight, the credibility \nof the U.S. Government in enforcing the current laws on the books is \nseverely lacking.\n  This is a measure that does put some real teeth into the deporting \nand reimporting by criminals. In this particular measure, it does give \nour law enforcement officials an opportunity to not only be serious \nabout enforcement of the law but in a way that is truly meaningful and \nwill go a long way toward stopping illegal immigrants from coming \nacross our borders, as well as doing a better job of enforcing our \nimmigration laws from an interior standpoint.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment \noffered by my good friend and colleague, Senator Graham.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have a good deal of respect for my \nfriends from South Carolina and Georgia, but I am somewhat mystified by \nthis proposal. Let me illustrate why.\n  First of all, this proposal by the Senator from South Carolina is a \nlarge Federal mandate. Do you understand? It is a large Federal \nmandate. Why? Because the Bureau of Federal Prisons now says it takes \nup to 45 to 60 days for any individual who is found guilty in the lower \ncourts to get to a Federal prison. Who pays for that? The local people \npay for that.\n  First, it takes 45 to 60 days--all of which will be included in this \namendment--which is going to be paid by the local people. So we are \nsaddling all the local communities, as they start off in their \nproposal.\n  Now, after we hear the speeches about how we are going to be tough on \ncrime, let's look specifically at the current law and what our bill \ndoes and then what this amendment does.\n  For the entry of an alien after removal--no deportation or denied \nadmission, no criminal history--under current law: fine, or not more \nthan 2 years, or both. Our bill is the same as current law. But the \nGraham amendment says: not less than 60 days in jail--60 days in jail.\n  So we want to let Arizona, California, Texas, New Mexico know that \nfor all those people whom we all heard about coming back across the \nborder, they are going to be for 45 to 60 days in the local jails. Is \nthere any kind of report about how they can handle it? Is there any \nsense about whether the jails are crowded? Is there any idea about what \nthe Governors say? Is there any idea about what local communities say? \nNo. But this happens to be the fact. There are seven different places \nwhere they put these mandatory penalties in.\n  Under current law, for the entry of criminal offenders, with three or \nmore misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against persons, or both, or \na felony: fine, not less than 10 years, or both. In the bill, S. 1348, \nwe say, three misdemeanors or one felony gets a penalty of not more \nthan 10 years in jail. What does the Graham amendment say? New \nmandatory minimum creates minimum penalty of 1 year.\n  So they say you get 1 year. We say you can get up to 10 years. Why \nthe difference? Because we want the judge to make the decision on the \nseverity of the crime.\n  Here, we go down to the prior aggravated felony conviction penalty, \nwhich under current law is not more than 20 years. We, in the bill, say \nthe penalty can be 15 years, or a fine, or both. Under the Graham \namendment, it is 2 years and a fine.\n  Once more, we leave it up to the judge. If we have the serious kinds \nof penalties, they ought to get the serious time. Who is being tougher \non crime? We are listening to the Senators from South Carolina and \nGeorgia: We are tough on crime. Who is tough on crime? Come on.\n  The list goes on. If you are caught, you are a repeater, you are \ncaught back across the border with a prior conviction for murder, rape, \nkidnapping, slavery, terrorism, then the penalty is not more than 20 \nyears. Under the Graham amendment, it is 5 years--the new mandatory is \n5 years. Ours is 20 years. We let the judge make that decision, but his \nis 5 years.\n  Now, I have been a strong supporter of sentencing reform from the \nvery beginning. We have had these enormous disparities on the issue of \nsentencing. The Sentencing Commission was supposedly to make an \nevaluation about the nature of the crimes taking place in the country, \nthe space that exists in the various States and Federal institutions \nand to make recommendations in terms of what the scope ought to be in \nterms of various crimes and what the availability is in these various \npenal institutions and how they compare to other kinds of crimes. It \nseems to me that is what we ought to be doing with the penalties in \nthis legislation as well.\n  Let's listen to Supreme Court Justice Kennedy, who has vigorously \ncriticized mandatory minimums as unfair and inconsistent with the \nfundamental principles of justice. In February, he was very clear in \nhis opposition to penalties in his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. He also said mandatory minimums are wrong because \nthey restrict the ability of judges to strike the best balance between \nthe goal of consistent sentencing and the need to give judges \ndiscretion to make the punishment fit the crime in individual cases.\n  That is what we have in the underlying law.\n  In 2003, Justice Kennedy said:\n\n       I can accept neither the necessity nor the wisdom of \n     Federal mandatory minimum sentences. In too many cases \n     mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust. The \n     legislative branch has the obligation to determine whether a \n     policy is wise.\n\n  Now, I am more than willing to establish tough penalties where \nappropriate, but we have to draw the line with a rash of mandatory \nminimum sentences in current law. We have a new Congress and a new \nopportunity to stop the madness with mandatory minimums that impose \nlong and costly sentences. Moreover, there is no suggestion that these \npenalties make a\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\ngreat deal of sense. If anything, they are already causing a terrible \nburden.\n  There is no epidemic of leniency in the Federal courts today. We have \nnot heard, in hearings in the Judiciary Committee, about leniency in \nterms of the crimes--we have not--nor with regard to these different \nprovisions.\n  The Federal prison population has quadrupled in the last 20 years. \nNow it is larger than any State system. The addition of new mandatory \nminimums only places further strains on the Federal prisons, which are \nalready struggling with a growing population, along with diminishing \nbudgets. Justice Rehnquist made the following observation about \nmandatory minimums: Our resources are misspent, our punishments too \nsevere, our sentences too long.\n  That is his statement in opposition to mandatory minimums. We have \nthe statements that have been made by the 2006 Conference of Mayors, \nrepresenting 1,100 mayors and cities with populations over 300 that \npassed a resolution opposing the mandatory minimum sentences. It called \nfor a fair and effective sentencing policy. The Nation's mayors are \nopposed to mandatory sentences on both Federal and State levels. Our \nmayors believe we should have laws that permit judges to define \nappropriate sentences based on the specific circumstances of the crime \nand the perpetrator's individual situation, and that States should \nreview the effects of both Federal and State mandatory minimum \nsentencing and move forward.\n\n  As I say, that is my position on this. I am under no illusions about \nwhat the desire and the will of this institution is on this particular \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, very briefly, and I will move to have this \namendment voted upon, if that is the correct order of business.\n  To my very good friend Senator Kennedy, it is my understanding in \nterms of incarceration costs, the costs are paid by the Federal \nGovernment through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program about 90 \npercent--90 cents on the dollar. So the Federal Government does help \nthe local communities almost fully to deal with the expense of people \nwho are caught violating or who are put in jail.\n  In terms of leniency--is there any evidence our laws are too \nlenient--I would say there are about 12 million pieces of evidence that \nour laws are too lenient. How can you have 12 million people come \nacross the border and the word not be out that there is not much of a \ndownside to doing it? Now, if you get 12 million people violating the \nlaw, it must be common knowledge among that population and others there \nis not much going to happen to you.\n  Well, that needs to stop. We need to give people who are here a \nchance to assimilate. Legal paths, we have more legal paths than we \nhave ever had through this bill.\n  The illegal part of it has to come to an end and will only come to an \nend if there is a downside to breaking our law, and this amendment is \nabout mandatory jail time. I am not trying to make it easier on people; \nI am trying to make it harder on people who take the law into their own \nhands and violate our border security. That is why we have mandatory \njail time. Prior misdemeanors, you are going to go to jail 1 year if we \ncatch you here again. If you served jail time of 2\\1/2\\ years and we \nfind you on our soil again after you have been deported, 2 years. If \nyou got a sentence of 5 years and we find you on our soil again after \nyou have been deported, 4 years in jail. If you are convicted of three \nor more felonies, 4 years in jail, if we find you here again. If you \nare convicted of a violent crime, no less than 5 years, and up to 20 \nyears.\n  It is time to get serious. This is a serious amendment for a serious \nproblem. I know this is going to send the right message and that we \nneed to be tough, not just in words but in deeds.\n  I urge passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I indicated in my earlier comments about \nthe different provisions that exist in the law, the kind of flexibility \nthat is out there to deal with serious crimes. But with the mandatory \nminimums you have a blunderbuss solution. There is no ability or \nflexibility at all to be able to deal with it.\n  The Federal Bureau of Prisons estimates it costs $67 a day for each \nperson in jail. Estimates are it costs $90 per day to detain an \nimmigrant. Right now each immigrant spends an average of 42.5 days in \ndetention prior to deportation, at an average cost of $3,825. Senator \nGraham's 60-day mandatory minimum for illegal reentry would increase \nthe total spent in detention by 17.5 days, which increases the cost of \ndetention per immigrant to $5,400. These increased costs couldn't be \navoided because the mandatory minimum won't let the judge give any \ndefendant a lower sentence regardless of the facts. This is a major \nproblem with the mandatory, and this amendment would be a costly \nmistake.\n  The fact is the States pick up before the individual enters the \nsystem, the States pick up the tab. So New Mexico, Arizona, California, \nand Texas, you are going to have this new mandate and expenditures for \nit.\n  Last year, 11,000 immigrants were charged with the offense of \nimproper entry. If this amendment passes, we are looking at increasing \nthe costs by millions of dollars. According to 2005 data, the U.S. \nGovernment has the resources to hold 19,000 immigrants. It represents \nless than 1 percent of the undocumented population. This amendment may \nalso require us to build new facilities to house these people, new \nprison beds, $14,000 per bed. We don't know how many beds will have to \nbe built if this amendment is adopted.\n  It seems the provisions we have in the legislation make sense, and if \nthe Senator wanted to alter his amendment and say: Let's let this go to \nthe Sentencing Commission and let them make the recommendations, which \nwe have done on other pieces of legislation to permit the penalty to \nsuit the crime, I would say amen. But this amendment is going to put an \nimportant additional burden on the local communities, and it doesn't \nhave the flexibility we have in the existing legislation in terms of \ndealing with those who are the real bad guys in this process. We have \nthat ability in the existing legislation. The idea we are going to make \nit mandatory for people to go in for this period of time takes away \nthat kind of flexibility, which is desirable.\n  I see my friend and colleague from New Mexico on the floor and I know \nhe desires to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in opposition to \nthe amendment. I have great respect for my colleague from South \nCarolina, but I think this is very misguided.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist was speaking in 1994 to a luncheon of the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission and he said the following:\n\n       Mandatory minimums are frequently the result of floor \n     amendments to demonstrate emphatically that legislators want \n     to ``get tough on crime.'' Just as frequently they do not \n     involve any careful consideration of the effect they might \n     have on the sentencing guidelines as a whole. Indeed, it \n     seems to me that one of the best arguments against any more \n     mandatory minimums, and perhaps against some of those we \n     already have, is that they frustrate the careful calibration \n     of sentences, from one end of the spectrum to the other, \n     which the sentencing guidelines were intended to accomplish.\n\n  I think Justice Rehnquist was right, that this is--this, as I \nunderstand it, is an amendment that has not been brought up for \nhearing. These proposed changes in the law have not been brought up for \na hearing in the Judiciary Committee. I am not a member of that \ncommittee. My colleague Senator Kennedy is, of course, as is Senator \nGraham. But my impression is this is not the result of a careful \ndeliberation by the committee of jurisdiction here in the Senate. \nInstead, this is one of these floor amendments that is intended to \ndemonstrate that legislators want to ``get tough on crime'' and \nparticularly want to get tough on crime if it involves immigrants. So \nthat is what is going on here.\n  I think the strongest argument I know, and I am sure this is what the \nSenator from Massachusetts was mentioning, is the cost that is involved \nin actually going ahead with this amendment. We are talking about \ntaking people, and instead of kicking them out of the country, we are \nrequiring those individuals be incarcerated in this country at very \nsubstantial expense to the U.S. taxpayer for a very long period of\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\ntime. I don't know that it makes good sense for us to be doing this.\n  One of the purposes of this immigration legislation that is before \nthe Senate right now is to reduce the burden on U.S. taxpayers of all \nof the immigrants coming into the country. This amendment does the \nexact opposite. This amendment puts an enormous additional expense on \nthe taxpayers of the United States by saying: If you come into this \ncountry illegally, we are going to lock you up and we are going to be \nsure you stay locked up for a long time. Well, that is fine, as long as \nyou want to pay--what is it--$30,000, $40,000 per year to keep one of \nthese individuals incarcerated. We are paying a lot more to keep an \nindividual in one of these Federal prisons, I can tell you that, than \nwe pay to keep people in some of our best universities.\n  I don't think it is a good use of our resources. I think this is one \nof these feel-good amendments which says we are not being tough enough \non immigrants, let's tighten this thing up, let's be real tough on \nthem.\n  The statistics I have--and these are statistics from the 2006 Source \nBook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, put out by the United States \nSentencing Commission. They have a chart on page 13 where they talk \nabout the distribution of offenders in each primary offense category. \nIt shows that 24.5 percent of the offenders we are incarcerating today \nare being incarcerated for immigration-related offenses. The only other \ncategory that is larger is drugs, where 35.5 percent are being \nincarcerated for drug-related offenses. So 24.5 percent of our \nprisoners today are there because of immigration-related offenses. That \nnumber is going to go up dramatically if we actually adopt and put into \nlaw these mandatory minimum sentences that are contained in this \namendment.\n  I wish also to point out that the penalties, the sentences these \npeople are being given and the actual period of incarceration, the \nnumber of months of incarceration for these immigration offenses, is \nfairly significant. It ranges from 22.8 months up to over 25 months. So \nwe are talking about putting people in prison for a significant period \nof time. As I say, they are all for immigration-related offenses.\n  I think it is foolhardy for the United States to be passing \nimmigration reform legislation to reduce the financial burden on U.S. \ntaxpayers for all of the illegal immigration coming into the country \nand at the same time adopt an amendment that loads an enormous \nadditional cost on to the taxpayer so we can keep these people in \nprison for a long time and thereby demonstrate we are getting tough on \ncrime.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nMcConnell as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, very briefly, to respond to my good friend \nfrom New Mexico about some of his concerns, this is not about me \nfeeling good; this is about having the law work in a way that will \ndeter people from crossing our borders illegally.\n  I point to the Angel Resendez case, and if we had this law in effect \nwhere we had mandatory jail time for those who had committed offenses \nand caught on our soil. In a 10-year period he committed five crimes, \ngot deported each time, and was able to come back and commit another \ncrime. If this amendment had been in place, he would have been in jail \nfor a longer period of time and maybe his murder victims would be alive \ntoday. This is a case not about me feeling good; it is about somebody \nwith a great propensity to cross our border illegally and commit crimes \nand not being held accountable in a serious way.\n  After the Booker case, the sentencing guidelines are advisory. If we \nwant to send a message that we are flexible when it comes to \nimmigration law violations, we are doing a great job of it. People must \nbelieve we are flexible, because they are coming across our borders in \ndroves. Flexibility is being taken as indifference. What we need to do \nis to make it a crime that will sting people when they come across.\n  The cost to this country of having laws that are ignored and are \nvirtually a joke is huge. Look at where we are today with illegal \nimmigration. Let's try something new. Let's try doing something that \nhas worked over time: If you commit a crime, you do some time.\n  With that, I yield the floor and ask for passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, briefly, to quote from the American Bar \nAssociation, this was their comment a year ago on the previous \nimmigration bill on the same subject, on the issue of mandatory \nminimums when this issue came up during that time:\n\n       The American Bar Association strongly opposes the \n     provisions in the draft legislation--\n\n  That was the draft legislation a year ago--\n\n     that would enhance or create new mandatory minimums. First, \n     as a general matter, the mandatory minimums produce an \n     inflexibility and rigidity in the imposition of punishment \n     that is inappropriate for a system that we hold out to the \n     world as a model of justice and fairness. To insist that all \n     those convicted of a crime be lumped into the same category \n     and be penalized indefinitely inevitably means the injustice \n     of a sentence in particular circumstances will be ignored. \n     Additionally, we are concerned at the high cost of imposing \n     mandatory minimums. Numerous studies have demonstrated the \n     extraordinary costs of incarcerating thousands of nonviolent \n     offenders in our Nation's prisons and jails.\n       The provisions to create the new mandatory sentences, \n     coupled with those to increase the mandatory detention, have \n     the potential to greatly increase the number of individuals \n     being incarcerated in immigration-related cases at a \n     significant cost to the American taxpayers.\n\n  We have provisions in the legislation that are tough and that a judge \ncan use and must use in those circumstances which require it. But I \nthink to effectively tie the judge's hands in these other circumstances \nmakes little sense.\n  I see the Senator from California on the Senate floor. I would like \nto ask how the Senator wants to dispose of this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I urge passage of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest that we proceed with the \nSenator from California and then come back to that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That suggestion is well taken, yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go now to \nthe Senator from California and her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I \nwant to say a few words on the bill in general and then move to an \namendment, if I might.\n  I am a supporter of this bill. It is not a perfect bill. I think it \nis easy to tell the people on the far right of the political spectrum \nand the far left of the political spectrum are not happy with this \nbill. But what this bill accomplishes--like nothing I have ever seen in \nmy 15 years in the Senate--is that it is a piece of work that is a \nproduct of people on both sides of the aisle sitting down and trying to \nwork something out that can get 60 votes in this Chamber and move on, \nand not be a useless piece of legislation, but rather one that offers a \nkind of comprehensive reform that has definition.\n  People use the word ``comprehensive,'' and nobody really knows what \nthey are talking about. But in the case of this bill, anyone who \ncarefully looks at the bill will understand what the word \n``comprehensive'' means because the word means addressing all sides of \nthe immigration issue, taking borders that are broken and repairing \nthem, stabilizing a border with additional border patrol, prosecutors, \ndetention facilities, and also strengthening interior enforcement.\n  Three major sections--called titles--of this bill really deal with \nenforcement of our borders, enforcement of the interior. Then there is \nthe question of how do you deal with the 12 million people who have \nbeen here for some time illegally, most of whom are engaged in \nlegitimate, bona fide work. How do you deal with what has developed to \nbe an entire subterranean economy in this country, with its own special \nshops, stores, and special points of congregation for work? How do you \nremove the element of fear that drives all of this further and further \nunderground?\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\n  The more the ICE agents--formerly INS--pick up people in the \nworkplace for deportation, the more you see the inequality and \ninjustice--there was one family, about a week ago in San Diego, by the \nname of Munoz, who had been here for a long period of time. They both \nworked and raised three children who were born in this country. They \nowned their home and their furniture.\n  Well, in came the agents, who picked up the parents. The parents were \nout of the country and the children were left. The home was sold and \nthe furniture was gone. And this is a family who had the piece of the \nrock of America. They were contributing to the economy of America. But \nthey were destroyed.\n  Many of us in this body believe you cannot find and deport 12 million \npeople. My State of California has the largest number of people living \nin undocumented status, which is estimated to be in the vicinity of 3 \nmillion people. They are a vital part of our workforce. They are 90 \npercent of California's agricultural workforce, which is the largest of \nthe 50 States. They also work in service industries. You see them in \nhotels and in restaurants, and you see them in construction and \nhousing. So they have become an indigenous part of the California \nworkforce.\n  This bill puts together reforms in immigration with a process to \nbring those people out of the shadows. What has bothered me over these \ndays, as I listen to the television and read in the newspapers, is I \nhear the drumbeat, and I even see small signs on automobiles that \nsimply say ``amnesty.'' This bill is not amnesty.\n  What is amnesty? Amnesty is the categorical forgiveness of a crime, \nan event, or whatever the issue may be. This does not do that. This \nsets up a roadmap, which is complicated for someone who wants to remain \nin this country, to be legal, to be able to work legally, and perhaps \neven someday get a green card, and maybe someday further off, become a \ncitizen.\n  Well, there is an 8-year road created in this bill. There are fines \nof $5,000 plus an additional $1,500 fee for processing. There is a \ntouchback, which may be changed in a further amendment, but at this \nstage in the debate it is this: If during that 8-year period the \nindividual who has now achieved this Z visa, which gives them the right \nto work in this country, decides they want to pursue a green card, they \nwould go to their country of origin, to the nearest U.S. consulate, and \nwith the Z visa they can come in and out of the country at will. They \ndon't have to stay in their country of origin. What they would do is \nfile their papers. They would submit their fingerprints, and they would \nturn around and come back into the United States. Then, electronically, \nthe evaluation would be done after the present line for green cards \nexpires. Everybody waiting in line legally for a green card gets it. \nThey would have the opportunity to get a green card. This is estimated \nto be between 8 and 13 years. During that period of 8 years, they would \nhave to re-up, come in and prove that they have done the things the \nbill requires them to do. This is not an amnesty.\n  Now, the other part is that there are changes made in what is called \nchain migration. Currently, one person on a green card can bring in any \nnumber of family members. This is changed to the nuclear family. The \nperson holding the green card can bring in their spouse and their minor \nchildren. That future green card, after the 8 years--after the list is \nexpunged, future green cards would be granted on the basis of the point \nsystem, which deals with merit in the sense of the availability of job, \nwork, the educational attributes of the individual, the family, and \nother things. I think it is as close as we are going to get to solving \nthis problem and creating the interior enforcement, the border \nstability, and the laws that are necessary to secure the rule of law \nwhen it deals with immigration.\n  Mr. President, many Senators from both sides of the aisle worked long \nhours over the past several months to address immigration reform. And \nthrough the process of negotiation and compromise a tough, fair, and \nworkable bill has been crafted.\n  The bill before the Senate provides solutions to restore the rule of \nlaw, fix our broken borders, protect our national security, and bring \nthe 12 million people now living illegally in the U.S. out of the \nshadows.\n  I believe this bipartisan bill is a strong first step toward \naddressing illegal immigration in a fair and balanced way.\n\n\n                        Immigration Enforcement\n\n  The bill is predicated on several fundamental principles. The first \nis that we must control our borders and protect our national security.\n  The bill ensures that before a single temporary visa is issued, or a \nsingle undocumented alien in the United States can earn their green \ncard, several important ``triggers'' must be met--``triggers'' that \nshow the Federal Government is taking a hard stance on enforcing the \nlaw and enforcing the border. The triggers include:\n  Installing at least 200 miles of vehicle barriers as well as 370 \nmiles of fencing, 70 ground-based radar and camera towers, and \ndeploying 4 unmanned aerial vehicles along the southern border; \ndetaining all illegal aliens apprehended at the southern border, rather \nthan continuing the ``catch and release'' policy; establishing and \nusing the new Employment Verification system to confirm who can work in \nthe United States legally and who cannot, and hiring 3,500 new border \npatrol agents to increase the total number of agents on the border from \n14,500 to 18,000.\n  Then later, after the first 3,500 border patrol agents are hired, the \nbill requires that an additional 10,500 more border patrol agents are \nhired. So, the total number of border patrol agents will increase from \nits current level of 14,500, to 18,000 under the trigger, to eventually \n28,500 by the end of five years.\n  The bill also requires hiring 1,000 new immigration agents, 200 new \nprosecutors, and new immigration judges and Board of Immigration \nAppeals members.\n  Next, the bill increases the penalties for people who illegally enter \nthe U.S. or who overstay their visas.\n  Under current law, if an individual enters the U.S. illegally or \noverstays their visa they are barred from returning to the United \nStates for three years, and could be barred for up to 10 years if they \nstayed in the U.S. illegally for over a year.\n  However, under the bill, if an individual is in the United States \nillegally the penalty is increased so that the person would be barred \nforever--and never be allowed to come to the United States.\n  The bill also includes provisions to fight passport and visa fraud \nbased on the bill that Senator Sessions and I introduced this year.\n  These new provisions would punish people who traffic in 10 or more \npassports or visas, and increase the penalty for document fraud crimes \nto 20 years.\n  By including these tough new enforcement measures, this bill goes a \nlong way to protecting our borders and takes a hard stand against \nindividuals who violate the law.\n\n\n                         Employment Enforcement\n\n  The bill also takes a hard stand against employers who violate the \nlaw and hire illegal immigrants.\n  For too long, the administration has not enforced the laws on the \nbooks, and the negligible fines for hiring illegal aliens were just a \npart of doing business--this bill changes that.\n  Under current law, an employer can be fined $250 to $2,500 for hiring \nan unauthorized worker; the bill increases that fine to $5,000.\n  The bill also increases the penalties for employers who repeatedly \nviolate the law and hire illegal aliens. Under current law, the highest \npenalty that can be assessed against an employer is $10,000 for a \nrepeat violation; this bill imposes a new larger fine of $75,000 for \nrepeat violations.\n  The bill creates a new employment verification system--mandating that \nwithin 3 years, all employers must verify with the Government that all \nof their employees, foreign and American, are who they say they are.\n  This new system will require employers to submit each employee's name \nand social security number or visa numbers to the Department of \nHomeland Security. DHS will then confirm whether the employee is in \nfact legally allowed to work.\n  If the DHS says the employee is not legally allowed to work or his \nlegal status is in question, the employee then has 10 days to challenge \nthe Government's conclusion, and while the employee is taking steps to \ncontest his rejection, the Secretary must extend\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nthe period of investigation and the employee cannot be fired.\n  This new verification system should ensure that individuals who are \nhired by American businesses are actually legally permitted to work in \nthis country.\n\n\n                             Grand Bargain\n\n  Once the security and enforcement measures were established, the \nnegotiators sought to devise a pragmatic solution to deal with the \napproximately 12 million illegal immigrants currently living in the \nUnited States.\n  This solution to this issue is what has been referred to as ``the \ngrand bargain.''\n  In order to bring Democrats and Republicans together a compromise was \nadopted that creates a new ``Z'' visa that will establishes a strict \npath for those individuals who are already in the United States to be \nable to earn a legal status.\n  In exchange, the bill reforms the current immigration system and \neliminates policies that allow for ``chain migration.''\n\n\n               Practical solution to 12 million now here\n\n  With respect to the first part of the grand bargain, I firmly believe \nwe have to develop a practical solution to the deal with the 12 million \nillegal immigrants already in the country.\n  While some have complained that all 12 million undocumented aliens \nshould be deported, such a solution is not practical nor is it \nreasonable--for many of those individuals and families who have become \nintegrated into the fabric of their communities deportation would be a \nsevere outcome.\n  For example, in my home State of California, the Munoz family from \nSan Diego is facing exactly what a policy of absolute deportation would \nmean.\n  In 1989 Zulma and Abel Munoz came to the United States seeking \nmedical care for their infant son who was sick--sadly, despite their \nefforts, 2 months later he died. At the time, Mrs. Munoz was pregnant \nwith her second child, a girl, and a medical worker who had helped her \nson urged Mrs. Munoz to stay longer in the United States to make sure \ntheir infant daughter received proper care. They took that medical \nworkers advice, and have remained in the United States since then. Both \nparents found work; they bought a home, and they repeatedly tried to \nlegally adjust their status, but their attempts failed.\n  Then last month, at 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, Mrs. Munoz was \narrested and led away from the house in her pajamas. Later when Mr. \nMunoz returned from Home Depot, he was handcuffed and taken away--\nleaving behind their three children, now 16, 13, and 9.\n  There are many families, like Mr. and Mrs. Munoz, who are not \ncriminals, who have lived and worked in their communities for years, \nand who are productive members of society, but who are also in the U.S. \nillegally.\n  Families like these should be given the opportunity to come out of \nshadows, to earn a legal status, and to eventually apply for a green \ncard--and that is what this bill provides through the Z visa program.\n  Let me be clear, this is not an amnesty. For those who say it is, I \nthink it is important to define what amnesty means. Amnesty is \nautomatically giving those who broke the law a clean slate no questions \nasked. This bill does not do that.\n  Instead, to qualify for a green card each individual must wait until \nthe backlog has been cleared--approximately 8 years--and during that \ntime these individuals and families would need to pass a national \nsecurity check; apply for a Z-visa that allows them to stay in the U.S. \nlegally; work or get an education; pay taxes; learn English; pay a fine \nof $5,000, plus processing fees of at least $3,000; not commit \ncrimes; reapply and undergo additional background checks; return to \ntheir home country for a ``touch-back'' for at least a day, to submit \ntheir application, provide a fingerprint , biographical and biometric \ninformation; and earn enough points under the same merit system that \nall future applicants will use.\n\n  This is not amnesty. This is not simply giving a green card to anyone \nwho is in the country illegally. Instead, through the Z visa program \nand the new merit system, each individual must meet these significant \ndemands in order to earn a green card.\n\n\n                           Green card backlog\n\n  The second component of the ``grand bargain'' is to clear up the \ncurrent backlog of individuals who have been waiting for green cards \nand to reform how green cards are awarded by creating a point system \nthat is based on merit.\n  To achieve this, the bipartisan bill would provide about 200,000 new \ngreen cards annually that will go to those individuals who have \nfollowed the rules and applied for a green card prior to May 1, 2005.\n  For anyone who applied after May 1, 2005, they will now be required \nto re-apply through the new merit-based point system. This new point \nsystem is based on what has been done in other countries, including \nCanada and Australia. It sets up a framework to allow individuals to \nearn points that would qualify them to earn a green card.\n  Under this new system, individuals will get points for education, \nwork history, ability to speak English, as well as whether they have \nU.S. citizen family members. This new point system is a balanced \napproach that considers multiple factors and allows individuals to earn \ntheir green cards.\n\n\n                        Temporary Worker Program\n\n  Finally, the third component in the ``grand bargain'' is to ensure \nthat temporary means temporary--meaning workers who come to the United \nStates on a ``temporary worker visa'' must return to their home \ncountries when the visa expires.\n  Under the new ``Y-visa'' there are 2 temporary worker programs--one \nthat brings in workers for 2 years, and then requires the worker to \nleave for a year; and a second, seasonal Y-visa where workers can come \nin for 10 months, and then are required to leave for 2 months.\n  Workers who come to the United States under the longer ``2 years in \nthe country, 1 year out of the country'' program can renew their visa \nso that they can work up to 6 years total; but every 2 years they must \nleave the United States for a year.\n  However, if Y-visa holder wants to bring their family with them to \nthe United States then they would be limited to only 1 renewal and they \nwould have to demonstrate that they can support their family. They \nwould do this by showing that the family has health insurance and that \nthey will earn a wage above 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nguidelines.\n  Finally, the new Y-visa program is capped at 400,000 foreign workers \na year for the 2-year/1-year program and 100,000 visas for the seasonal \n10-month/2-month program. Both of these caps contain escalation clauses \nthat allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue additional visas \nup to 600,000 per year for the longer program and up to 200,000 per \nyear for the seasonal program.\n  The escalation clause in the longer program gives the Secretary the \ndiscretion to increase the number of Y-visas by as much as 10 percent \nor 15 percent each year. According to some estimates, this means that \nin 10 years well over 3.4 million foreign workers could come into the \nUnited States through the longer Y-visa program.\n  I am concerned about the impact on our economy and our country if \nsuch a substantial number of visas were to be issued. Senator Bingaman \nhas an amendment that would eliminate the escalator and reduce the cap \nto permit only 200,000 Y-visas each year to be issued under the longer \nprogram. I am a cosponsor of the Bingaman amendment and I voted for it \nlast Congress.\n  While I agree with the grand bargain principle that temporary means \ntemporary, I am concerned that the high cap on the longer Y-visa \nprogram and the inclusion of the escalator means that the numbers of \ntemporary workers coming in through this program are just too high.\n  But with the adoption of the Bingaman amendment I believe the \ntemporary worker program adopts the right balance and still fulfills \nthe principles of the ``grand bargain.''\n\n\n                      Need for Agricultural Labor\n\n  In addition to these important principles that were developed as part \nof the ``grand bargain'', the bipartisan bill contains two more \nimportant provisions: the DREAM Act and AgJOBS.\n  Last Congress, Senators Craig, Kennedy, and I repeatedly tried to \npass AgJOBS. This bill reforms the current H-2A agricultural temporary \nworker program and creates a path to legalization for undocumented farm \nworkers currently in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\n  There is no industry that is suffering more from a labor shortage \nthan agriculture. Foreign workers make up as much as 90 percent of the \nwork force and over half of the foreign workers are undocumented--as \nmany as 1.5 million.\n  But for years now we have heard from farmers and growers that they \ncan not get the labor force needed to harvest their crops.\n  California growers tell me that their labor forces are already down \n30 percent this year. For example, Larry Stonebarger, a cherry packer \nin Stockton, CA, has said that his packing house only has 650 workers, \ninstead of 1100 he needs.\n  California provides a vital part of our Nation's food source. Half of \nthis country's fruits are grown in California and, in fact, California \nis the only U.S. producer of almonds, figs, kiwi fruit, olives, and \nraisins. The importance of having locally grown produce cannot be \nunderestimated.\n  This Sunday, the Washington Post reported that the Food and Drug \nAdministration detained 107 food imports from China at U.S. ports just \nlast month. They found dried apples preserved with a cancer-causing \nchemical; mushrooms laced with illegal pesticides; juices and fruits \nrejected as ``filthy''; and prunes tinted with chemical dyes not \napproved for human consumption. This situation is unacceptable. But, \namazingly, as we fight to keep out foreign produce that is not \nprotected by safety and quality controls, our own immigration policies \nundermine the ability of U.S. growers to produce high quality fruits \nand vegetables right here in our own country.\n  The reality is, if there are not enough farm workers to harvest the \ncrops in the United States, we will end up relying on foreign countries \nto provide our food. This is not good for our economy or for ensuring \nthat Americans are receiving safe and healthy foods.\n  The best way to avoid this outcome is to ensure that American farmers \nand growers have the workers they need to harvest the crops, and the \nbest way to ensure we have a stable agriculture labor force is to pass \nAgJOBS.\n  Our bill will stabilize the labor shortage on our farms by allowing \nundocumented farm workers who have worked in agriculture and agree to \ncontinue to work in agriculture for 3 to 5 years to earn a Z-A visa and \neventually a green card. This will create a path to earn legal status \nfor those ag workers already in the country.\n  Secondly, AgJOBS will streamline the H-2A program so that it is \nusable, so that growers and farmers can have access to a consistent \nsupply of temporary workers in the future.\n  AgJOBS is a bipartisan bill that needs to be enacted to ensure that \nfarmers, growers, and farm workers can continue to provide Americans \nhome-grown, safe and healthy produce.\n  Immigration reform is certainly a difficult area to tackle, but this \nbill strikes the right balance and reflects the best thinking on how to \naccommodate all the various concerns and interests.\n  While it is easy to sit on the sidelines and criticize, it is harder \nto stand up, take on the tough issues, make the hard decisions and do \nwhat is right to fix our immigration system. I want to commend Senators \nKennedy, Specter, Salazar, and Kyl for their hard work in undertaking \nthis difficult issue and crafting this important legislation.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill, and it is a bill \nthat I hope the Senate will pass.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1146 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1146, and I \nask unanimous consent to add Senator Martinez as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     and Mr. Martinez, proposes an amendment numbered 1146 to \n     amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, May 21, 2007, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, about 6 years ago, I was sitting at \nhome and I was watching television. What I saw was, I believe, \nhappening in Seattle. It was a 14-year-old Chinese youngster who had \ncome to this country in a container. Her parents died in the container. \nShe had survived. She had been in a detention facility for 7 months \nprior to coming before the judge. What I saw on television were tears \nstreaming down her face, her hands in cuffs, and the chain went around \nher waist. She was unable to wipe away her tears. I thought this was \nvery strange, something really must be wrong.\n  I found out that she is not alone. There are 7,000 unaccompanied \nyoungsters who come to this country every year. Many of them--at least \nup to a recent point--were held in detention facilities for unlimited \nperiods of time. They don't speak the language, they have no friends, \nthey have no guardians, and they have no one to represent them. Often, \nthey are sexually abused. It is a real problem.\n  This amendment is the same as a bill that passed the Senate last year \nby unanimous consent. There are a few changes, and those changes remove \nprovisions that were contained in the previous version that are no \nlonger necessary because of changes in agency practices to bring this \nbill in line with other laws, and to require promulgation of \nregulations and reporting of statistics on children affected by this \nbill.\n  Now, in the Homeland Security Act, the responsibility for the care \nand placement of unaccompanied alien children was transferred from the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement. This amendment provides \nguidance and instruction to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice, for how \nto handle the custody, release, family reunification, and the detention \nof unaccompanied alien children.\n  The amendment clarifies that any child who was deemed to be a \nnational security risk, or who has committed a serious crime, will \nremain under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security or \nthe Department of Justice and will not be released to the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement. For those who pose no danger to themselves or \nothers, the amendment requires that the children be placed in the least \nrestrictive setting possible, and it defines what those settings are.\n  This is the order of preference: One, licensed family foster care; \ntwo, small group care; three, sheltered care; four, residential \ntreatment center; five, secured detention. So the least restrictive \nplace for these children--remember, in any given year, there are a \nsubstantial number of these children. The amendment also would \nestablish minimum standards for this custody or, where appropriate, \ndetention of these children, including making sure they have access to \nmedical care, mental health care, some access to phones, legal \nservices, interpreters, and supervision by professionals trained to \nwork with these children.\n  I am delighted that Senator Martinez is a cosponsor, and I hope he \nwill come to the floor because I believe he just said to me he found \nhimself in a similar situation. I mentioned to him a case with which we \nare all familiar, Elian Gonzalez, who landed on the shores of Florida, \nwhose mother drowned trying to get here. He had relatives in Florida. \nFlorida has moved to create certain centers where these children are, \nin fact, secure, but many States have not.\n  The amendment also requires that wherever possible, these children \nare returned to their place of origin if there is a family member who \ncan receive them. So a juvenile is sent home if there is a suitable \nplacement for that child. If not, another appropriate placement must be \nsecured for that child.\n  I think this legislation is very good legislation. As I said, it has \npassed the Senate before. We have amended it to comply with bills that \nhave passed the Senate, and I am very hopeful that this amendment might \neven pass by unanimous consent today.\n  I will not ask for the yeas and nays at this time.\n  I do not see Senator Martinez in the Chamber at this time, so I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will not take much time. I commend and \nthank the good Senator from California. This is an extraordinary \nhumanitarian need. I have listened to the Senator from California on \nthe floor, I have listened to her in committee, and I have listened to \nher at hearings. This is a matter of enormous importance. It relates to \nminors, children, vulnerable people, and the record of exploitation. \nThis amendment is well thought out. She has had strong bipartisan \nsupport for it. In the past, there has not been objection to this \namendment. I know of no objection to it. It is an extremely worthwhile \namendment.\n  I have spent a good deal of time commending her and talking about the \namendment, but she has done an excellent job in its presentation. I \ncertainly hope we will accept this amendment. I believe we are prepared \nto accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have 1 minute of comments to make on the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina, and then I wonder if we \ncan proceed with the possibility of three amendments being disposed of \nin quick order so that then the Senator from New Hampshire can begin \nwith his amendment.\n  Let me make my comments about the amendment offered by Senator \nGraham. I support this amendment because it provides a deterrent to \nfuture illegal immigration. While there are a great deal of statistics \nI would like to cite, in the interest of time, let me make this point.\n  There is a very interesting operation going on right now in the Del \nRio, TX, sector, in something called Operation Streamline in which they \nactually have the jail space available to detain, for up to 180 days, \nillegal immigrants caught coming across the border. This has been in \noperation now since 2005. Anyone caught entering the United States \nillegally faces prosecution under this particular operation unless for \nhumanitarian reasons they need to be released. It has proven very \neffective in reducing the number of crossings in that area. The word \nhas spread very quickly to people in Mexico that if they try to cross \nin this sector and they are caught, they are not just going to be \nreturned home, they are going to spend time in jail. That totally \ndisrupts their lives. They cannot afford not to be back working \nsomeplace, either in their own country or in the United States. As a \nresult, the word has spread quickly: Don't try to cross in that sector \nor you are going to go to jail.\n  As a result, I think the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina \nis very well taken. It will provide a deterrent for future illegal \ncrossings into the United States. And that is what this legislation \nshould be all about, the stopping of illegal immigration. So I support \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. President, if I may address the Senator from Massachusetts, would \nit be possible at this point to address three amendments that have been \noffered and dispense with them?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I ask \nunanimous consent that the previous incomplete voice vote on amendment \nNo. 1173 be vitiated and the amendment be agreed to. This is the Graham \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had hoped we could voice vote the amendment of the \nSenator from California. I have been notified that we cannot voice vote \nit, so we will have to have a rollcall vote on that amendment. I \nbelieve the Senator from California is prepared to go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand I am next in order to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Massachusetts is not ready to go to \nSenator Feinstein's amendment at this time, I suggest I offer mine and \nthen we do the two amendments in sequence.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is an excellent suggestion, if the Senator from \nPennsylvania thinks it is a good idea.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is an excellent idea. Do we \nhave Senator Grassley's amendment to voice vote?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we ought to do that in a few minutes. I am \nhopeful we will be able to do it. I hope that request will be made \neither during or after the debate on the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So, Mr. President, just before the Senator from New \nHampshire begins, we are moving along. We are going to take up the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, and then it will come back \nto our side. We have several Senators who have indicated a desire to \noffer an amendment. Then I believe it will go back to the other side, \nand I believe Senator Cornyn has an amendment. That is how we will \nproceed. We intend to go back and forth. We have quite a list here. We \nare making progress. I am grateful for all the cooperation we have had.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1172 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up my amendment, which is No. 1172.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1172 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the essence of this bill for most \nAmericans, I believe, is the need and the desire to secure the border, \nto make sure that people coming across our border are coming across \nlegally, that we know who they are, and that we are able to manage our \nborder.\n  It is a national disgrace that we have been unable to control the \nillegal flow of people into our country, especially the massive illegal \nflow of people across the southwestern border into this country. So I \ndon't believe there is really ever going to be a consensus around major \nimmigration reform, which I happen to strongly support.\n  I supported last year's bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and \nSenator McCain. I support the effort this year in concept, although I \nstill want to see how it is going to end up in detail. But there will \nnever be a consensus support for major immigration reform, which we \nneed so dearly in this country, unless the American people can be \nconfident that the border is secure as the first condition of \nimmigration reform. Thus, I think it was really a touch of genius--and \nI don't think I overstate that--by Senator Isakson from Georgia to come \nup with this idea of a trigger over a year ago so that it would be \nclear that the precondition of major immigration reform would be that \nthe border would be secure, especially the southwestern border. I \ncongratulate Senator Isakson for that initiative, and it is included in \nthis bill in concept in that the trigger is in place.\n  The concern I have is that the elements which exercise the trigger, \nso that we then move on to the policies of this bill relative to other \nelements of immigration reform, such as the guest worker program, \nmaking sure we have adequate employer verification, doing the things \nthat are necessary in the area of creating more capacity for people to \ncome into this country who are qualified in the area of skills, those \nelements are subject to a trigger today which is in this bill, and I \nbelieve the specifics around that trigger do not lead, unfortunately, \nto what we want, which is a secure border. It is a movement down the \nroad, but it is a movement down the road which appears in some way to \nhave been set not on the basis of what is necessary for controlling the \nborder but on the basis of what would be necessary to make sure the \noperative part of this bill goes into action or occurs within 18 months \nof passage of the bill.\n  So it seems that the numbers which have been put down in this bill \nrelative to how many Border Patrol agents we need, how many detention \nbeds we need, relative to how many observation facilities we need along \nthe border for a virtual fence, relative to other structural needs of \nthe southern border control, those elements were not defined in terms \nof what would lead ultimately to full security and operational control \nof the southwestern border, but those elements were defined as to what \nwas perceived as being doable in the next 18 months.\n  The difference between what is necessary for operational control of \nthe border and what those numbers are is not dramatic, quite obviously, \nbut it is significant, very significant. I had the good fortune for a \nnumber of years to chair the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I served on it for a long time. So I do \nbelieve I am fairly familiar with this issue, as familiar, probably, as \nanybody in this body with this issue since there were a number of \ninitiatives which I began both as a chairman of the Commerce-State-\nJustice Subcommittee, which was a precursor to the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, and then as chairman of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee which were targeted directly on the issue of upgrading the \nBorder Patrol capability, the port control capability, the Coast Guard \ncapability, and the detention bed capability so that we could get \noperational control over the border.\n  Throughout this period, as we have been ramping up--and we have \nramped up dramatically. We have come really from a marginal capability \nof controlling the southwestern border to a capability that is quite \nhigh, and we are making dramatic strides every day in that area. The \nnumbers that are necessary were fairly well vetted as we stepped with \nintensity into this process 3 or 4 years ago. The numbers in this bill, \ntherefore, should reflect what was the consensus position at that time \nand what I continue to believe is the consensus position as to the type \nof resources and the number of people they need and the type of support \nthey need on the border to gain operational control of the border.\n  This bill we are dealing with calls for 18,000 Border Patrol agents, \nof whom it is assumed 16,000 will be boots on the ground on the border. \nIt calls for something like 21,000 detention beds. It calls for \nsomething like 70 towers where we do virtual fence activity. We just \nlet out a contract called SBInet, the purpose of which is to replace a \nprogram which was a total failure, which would put an electronic \nsurveillance system along the border. That SBInet is a fairly complex \ntechnological initiative which involves ground sensors, visual sensors, \nand heat sensors, and it involves unmanned aerial aircraft to cover \nthat part of the border which cannot be effectively and should not be \ncovered with physical fencing. It is a complex initiative, but it is \none which will work, we hope, and one which we are well down the road \ntoward doing. But for it to work effectively and for it to be properly \nbuilt, the amount of resources that needs to be committed to it exceeds \nby a factor of about 30 percent what is in this bill. The same is true \nin the area of Border Patrol agents and in the area of detention beds, \nalthough less is needed.\n  So what I have done in this amendment is essentially propose that we \ntake the numbers that we know are necessary to gain operational control \nover the border and put those numbers into this bill. And that we allow \nthe trigger, which is this exceptional idea Senator Isakson came up \nwith, to function off those numbers, rather than backing into the \ntrigger by using the number of months which we think we want to use \nbefore we move on to the rest of the bill.\n\n  The difference, as I said, is not dramatic, significant but not \ndramatic. For example, instead of 18,000 border agents--we had a lot of \ntestimony, a lot of discussion, and the head of the Border Patrol at \nthe time, Robert Bonner, said he needed 20,000 agents on the border--\nnot 16, 20. So there is a 2,000 agent difference. Now, the issue will \nbe hiring, the issue will be how quickly you can work them through the \nsystem and bring them on board.\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nThe issue is attrition. But the fact is, that is the number where there \nwas consensus, pretty much, that we needed in order to get the right \nnumber of agents on the Southwest border--20,000; so 2,000 additional \nagents over what the bill calls for.\n  In the area of detention beds, the bill calls for 21,000. We are \nalready headed well past that with the appropriations process, so that \nwas almost picking a number that was already done. It is like saying we \nare going to approve this event, the trigger will occur if the Sun \ncomes up in the east. The Sun was going to come up in the east. The \nfact is 21,000 beds is not enough. We know that. We know we need closer \nto 30,000 beds in order to have the adequate detention capability to \nstop completely the catch-and-release issue, which is a huge issue.\n  There are a couple of amendments that have already been offered. I \nthink Senator Grassley has offered that amendment. I am not sure of \nthat, but certainly Senator Graham's amendment, which was just \naccepted, is related to that point. So instead of 21,000 beds, the \nnumber I have put in my amendment is 31,000, which is the consensus \nposition. Again, it is not hard to get to 31,000 from 21,000 because we \nare already over 21,000, or we are headed over 21,000. We can certainly \nget well above that number fairly quickly.\n  In fact, 21,000 may be wrong. Maybe the bill calls for 27,000. I \napologize. The number here is 27,000. Somewhere I had seen 21,000, but \nif it is 27,000 the bill calls for, we are only asking for another \n4,000 beds in order to accomplish the goal that was agreed to in order \nto reach the capacity to handle people coming into this country and not \nhave to release them and ask them to come back, which they do not do, \nfor their hearings.\n  In addition, on the virtual fence side and on the hard fencing side, \nthis amendment doesn't call for any additional hard fencing. The hard \nfencing language is 370 miles. I happen to believe that is probably as \nclose to the number as we need. Hard fencing is needed in urban areas, \nbut most of the border is not urban. In the nonurban areas, hard \nfencing is not functional and doesn't add a whole lot to our security \nor to our ability to control the border. But we do need additional \nvehicle barrier fencing, probably another 100 miles over what this bill \ncalls for, which is 200 miles, which is already in place and we are \nheaded toward, so this calls for 300 miles of vehicle fencing, which \nwas what we agreed to back when we did the Safe Border Initiative.\n  On the virtual capability, this bill calls for 70 towers. Well, we \nare already headed toward 70 towers. We know we can build 70 towers, \nbut 70 towers isn't what we need to make the system work. We need \nsignificantly more than that. We believe, within a reasonable \ntimeframe, we can build 105 towers, which would have us on track, so \nthis language calls for 105 towers.\n  It also eliminates the arbitrary language in here which is a sense of \nthe Senate that everything has to be done within 18 months. As I \nmentioned, if you look at these numbers, you can see basically what \nhappened here, I suspect, was somebody said, what numbers can we be \nabsolutely sure we are going to hit in 18 months so we can exercise the \ntrigger and the numbers? They were good numbers that were put in, but \nthey weren't the numbers there had been consensus built around 2 years \nago, 3 years ago, even as recently as 1 year ago, that were needed in \norder to actually gain operational control of the border. So this \namendment simply says, let us use the trigger mechanism. It is an \nexcellent idea, and let's take it forward but use it as a real trigger \nthat functions off of numbers that we know, if they are in place, will \ncreate operational control and which will not unduly delay the \nexecution of the rest of this bill.\n  With proper resources, almost everything I have proposed in my \namendment could be accomplished fairly quickly. It is more than a \nstatement of commitment to operational control; it is a commitment to \noperational control before the trigger gets pulled. In addition, to \nmake sure we are getting the operational control we need, the amendment \nhas an independent review by the Government Accountability Office of \nthe effort by the Department to meet these different benchmarks so we, \nas a Congress, will know when there is a certification that the \nbenchmarks have been reached, the benchmarks actually will have been \nreached and they will have been reviewed by an independent group, \nspecifically the Government Accountability Office, to confirm they have \nbeen reached.\n\n  The amendment's purpose is to accomplish what the bill wishes to \naccomplish. The purpose of this amendment is to make sure the first \nstep in this effort of immigration reform is to secure specifically the \nSouthwest border so we have a situation where people are not continuing \nto cross into this country illegally after we have passed immigration \nreform--or at least there is a clear roadmap which will get us to the \nresources and the number of people we need on the southwestern border \nto assure people won't be coming into this country illegally along that \nborder because we will have the necessary support to accomplish that. \nIt is, I believe, an extremely reasonable amendment.\n  Ironically, the numbers in this amendment have been offered from the \nother side of the aisle on numerous occasions, or pretty close to these \nnumbers, by Senators who feel, as I do, that the border needs to be \nsecure. I would note especially Senator Byrd has had a number of \namendments right along this course where he has said, let us do what we \nhave to do in the area of resources to assure that Homeland Security \nhas the people they need in Border Patrol agents, has the resources \nthey need in the area of detention beds, has the resources they need in \nthe area of a virtual fence and regular fencing in order to adequately \ncontrol the border--not adequately, but to have actual operational \ncontrol over the border.\n  I hope this amendment would be accepted. This is an amendment which \ntoughens up our commitment to border security and it does it in the \ncontext of what is an idea that makes a lot of sense, which is the \nIsakson trigger and, therefore, it is, in my opinion, a significant \neffort to improve the bill and give people the confidence that when we \npass this immigration reform, it will have as its first element our \nability to make sure we know who is coming into this country, \nespecially across the Southwest border.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1146\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, had an \namendment. I understand now that we are prepared to voice-vote that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Feinstein amendment has been cleared \non this side of the aisle. I agree with Senator Kennedy, we can voice-\nvote it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 1146?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1146.\n  The amendment (No. 1146) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1172\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we have the Gregg amendment that is \npending; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will say a brief word about this \namendment. If others want to say a word\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nabout it, that is fine. Then I intend to make a motion to table it.\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, long before we developed this \nlegislation, had extensive hearings about border security. We listened \nto Secretary Chertoff speak. We listened to him both in open session \nand in closed session.\n  I am convinced those recommendations were the best information that \nwe had in terms of our border security and they are incorporated in \nthis legislation.\n  It is a reflection of a bipartisan effort to make sure that we are \ngoing to do everything that is necessary and can be done to provide a \nsecure border. We are using the latest in technology. They are using \nthe fence areas where they believe that is appropriate and have the \nsupport to do it.\n  They are using the latest in terms of aerial drones, the latest in \nterms of barriers that are out there. All of the latest in technology \nwill be used in terms of securing our border.\n  Now, the Senator from New Hampshire says he wants additional kinds, \nas well as dramatic increases, in the total number of Customs agents.\n  What we have to understand, what has been clear since we have started \nthis whole kind of a process is, if we are going to control our border, \nas we have heard from Homeland Security, the leader of Homeland \nSecurity, it has to be comprehensive.\n  You have to have a secure border, but you also have to have some \nopportunity to have a border which permits individuals to be able to \ncome through the front door if you are going to help them.\n  What I mean is, you are going to have to complete this in a timely \nway. If we just think we are going to be able to delay the completion \nof a comprehensive program, which the Gregg amendment will do, we are \ngoing to find out the borders are going to continue to be penetrated \nover the foreseeable future. That just happens to be the fact.\n  We made those points at the time to those who have said they want to \nabolish or close out a temporary worker program. If you think you can \nbuild a border and have border security there and have no opportunity \nfor any individuals to be able to come in legitimately, you have not \nlistened to the record and you have not listened to the testimony and \nyou have not listened to those who have been responsible for national \nsecurity.\n\n       They say you have to have some opportunity for individuals \n     to choose the more hopeful aspect rather than risk their \n     lives out in the desert. Now, with the Gregg amendment, what \n     that will do is effectively ensure that we are denied a \n     temporary worker program, we are denied the opportunity to \n     have any chance for individuals to come through the front \n     door.\n\n  As Governor Napolitano pointed out very clearly in her record \nmaterials that we have used previously, if you build a 50-foot high \nfence, those who want to come in will build a 51-foot high ladder. That \nhappens to be the fact. That is why we have heard from those who have \nbeen involved in national security and border security who say: You \nneed the comprehensive approach that is the underlying bill.\n  I think the Gregg amendment will delay the opportunity for us to do \nthe underlying kind of effort to which we have been committed. I think, \ntherefore, we should not accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment by the Senator from New Hampshire. The changes he makes are \nonly modest in nature. I think they are not directed to accomplish a \nsignificant change: from 1,800 Border Patrol agents to 2,000; from 200 \nmiles of vehicle barriers and 70 ground-based radar and camera towers, \nhe moves for 300 miles and 205 ground-based radar and camera towers.\n  He changes the detention service from 27,500 to 31,500, and a change \nin some additional protection.\n  This has been very carefully calibrated. We are looking for an 18-\nmonth period for the completion of these triggers. The Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Michael Chertoff, has assured us, in testimony \nbefore the committee and in the extensive negotiations, that these are \nrealistic. We have questioned Secretary Chertoff about whether it can \nbe done within this period of time because they are conditions \nprecedent. Until these barriers and fencing and Border Patrol agents \nare in place, the balance of the bill cannot go forward. That is the \nassurance to those who wonder if we are serious about securing our \nborders before going ahead with the other parts of the program. We do \nnot want to tamper with what the Secretary has articulated. The \nadditional requirements obviously will take longer to complete. We have \nthis bill in place. I urge my colleagues to stay with the negotiated \narrangement and to reject the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to table the Gregg amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Gregg amendment \nNo. 1172.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes against \nthe Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, the floor managers \nof this bill, Senators Kennedy and Specter, in urging our colleagues to \nvote against the Gregg amendment. There is broad agreement among all \nMembers who have been working on this reform package that we need to \nsecure the border. Indeed, when you look at what Secretary Chertoff has \nsaid we need to do to secure the border, he has said we need to do a \nnumber of different things which we have incorporated in this \nlegislation. We call for 18,000 Border Patrol agents. We call for 370 \nmiles of fencing, 200 miles of vehicle barriers, 70 ground-based radar \nand camera towers, 4 unmanned aerial vehicles, new checkpoints and \nports of entry, and a host of other things. Those numbers were not just \npicked out of the sky and put into this bill; those are the numbers the \nSecretary of Homeland Security said we need in order to secure the \nborders. He has been a constant presence in the fashioning of the \nimmigration reform proposal that is before the Senate. The Gregg \namendment essentially would derail the triggers that have been set up \nand is inconsistent with what we have heard from the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I join Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter and my colleagues in \nurging a ``no'' vote on the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Hampshire. I \nwould be glad to withhold if the Senator wanted to address the Senate; \notherwise, I will make a motion to table the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's courtesy. I wish \nto respond briefly to the points which were made.\n  The numbers in this bill are numbers which are a fait accompli. They \nare numbers which we already know we will reach within the next 18 \nmonths, if we stay on the appropriations path which was set up by \nmyself and Senator Byrd 2 years ago, but they are not the numbers on \nwhich there was consensus needed in order to bring operational control \nto the borders. They are not those numbers. They are good numbers. They \nare a-step-in-the-right-direction numbers. That is why we funded them \nand put in place a path to continue to fund them. But there was \nabsolute consensus--and don't let anybody come to this floor and say \nsomething else--that the numbers for gaining control over the border \nare different than these numbers. If they weren't, then we wouldn't \nhave let the contract on creating the virtual fence, because the \nnumbers in this bill do not come anywhere near the completion of the \nvirtual fence.\n  The numbers in this bill do not come anywhere near what is needed to \nhave the detention beds necessary to completely end catch and release, \nnor do they reach the numbers necessary to have the number of people on \nthe border necessary to control the border. The Commissioner of \nCustoms, Mr. Bonner, made it very clear in testimony 3 or 4 years ago \nthat they needed 20,000 agents on the ground on the border.\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\n  This amendment hasn't asked for a radical change from what the bill \nsuggests. It says the bill makes a great stride, but if we are to use \nthe Isakson trigger effectively, which we want to--and the purpose of \nthe trigger is to make sure the border is secure before we move to the \nnext step in the bill--then we have to have the resources on the border \nto accomplish that security. The resources necessary to do that are \n20,000 agents, which is an increase of 2,000 over what the bill calls \nfor; the addition to 31,000 beds is an increase of about 2,500 over \nwhat the bill calls for; an additional 100 miles of vehicle barrier \nover what the bill calls for; and within a timeframe we believe is \nreasonable, so you could still hit the 18 months or be close to it, not \n70 towers of virtual fencing, which is where the communications and the \noptics will be operated out of, but 105. That won't be the end of the \ntowers, but that would be enough to allow operational control over the \nborder.\n  This is not dramatic or radical. It is not even a grand change from \nwhat the bill suggests. It is simply a change that meets the conditions \nwhich we know are necessary in order to give operational control over \nthe border. The point which this amendment makes is that operational \ncontrol of the border should not be determined by an arbitrary number \nof months going by--in other words, if 18 months go by, we will lose \noperational control over the border. It should be set by the resources \nbeing in place on the border which will limit the ability of people to \ncome across the border illegally. That is what this language does. How \nmuch more will this language cost than what the bill costs? About $700 \nmillion more. That certainly should be within the funding capabilities \nof the Appropriations Committee. In fact, if the administration wanted \nto, they could send up a supplemental to accomplish that. That is a \nvery doable event.\n  Then it has a second condition, which is, it simply says the \ncertification that these numbers have been met shall be reviewed by \nGAO. I do think as a Congress we would want that independent review. \nThat is reasonable.\n  It takes the number of Border Patrol agents up by 2,000 and gets it \nto the number that was agreed to as being needed. It takes the number \nof beds up by about 2,500 and gets the number which was agreed to. It \ntakes the number of vehicle barriers up by 100 and gets to the number \nthat was contracted for. It does not change the fencing requirement. It \nkeeps that at 370 miles. It adds 35 towers for the virtual fence, which \nis what the contract called for.\n  To represent this is some sort of amendment which therefore \nfundamentally undermines the core agreement is absurd on its face. The \ncore agreement was, we would put in place, using the Isakson trigger, \nwhich was a stroke of genius for resolving this issue, resources on the \nborder which would allow for operational control of the border. This \nsimply calls for those resources to be consistent with what the \ntestimony has been over the last few years as to what is needed in \norder to accomplish that.\n  The great irony is less than 6 months ago, we passed the Safe Fence \nAct. The Safe Fence Act essentially put in place the mechanism which \ngot us to these numbers. The Safe Fence Act called for this action. The \nSafe Fence Act got 92 votes. It seems to me if 6 months ago we believed \nthese were the numbers that should be used for fencing--and that is one \nelement of it--how can we change 6 months later and say: We are going \nto step back from that and that is not the number we need in order to \nhave the trigger occur? If this were a dramatic shift, a radical shift, \nan undermining shift in the exercise of this bill, I would say, fine, \noppose it; it is an attempt to kill the bill. But just the opposite is \nthe case. I am one of the few people on my side of the aisle who \nactually voted for the Kennedy-McCain bill the last time it came \nthrough here. I am on record and my commitment is to do immigration \nreform.\n  I also know the American people will not be sold on the idea that we \nare going to do immigration reform until they are confident our border \nis secure, especially the southwestern border where the vast numbers of \npeople are coming in illegally. The northern border is a whole other \nissue and a serious one, especially from the view of terrorism. But on \nthe southern border, people want it stopped. They want to know there \nare in place the resources to allow us to control that border before we \ntake the next step into immigration reform, which next steps are \ncritical and necessary. That is, of course, the genius of the Isakson \ntrigger for which he deserves great credit, and which this language \nwill essentially make more effective because it accomplishes the \nunderlying goal of the trigger mechanism.\n  How long will this delay over the 18 months, which appears to be the \narbitrary number? In fact, a sense of the Senate in this bill says \neverything has to be done in 18 months. How long will these numbers I \nhave suggested we meet, which aren't my numbers but are numbers that \nhave been around and on which there was consensus before this bill came \nout of committee or came out of the working group--it never came out of \ncommittee, obviously--came out of the working group around which there \nwas so much consensus last year that we had a 92-to-2 vote on the Safe \nFence Act, how much will that extend that time period beyond 18 months? \nActually, it might not extend it at all.\n  With proper dollars, Homeland Security could probably do all of these \nthings within the next 18 months. Certainly, they could do the extra \nhundreds of miles of vehicle barrier. I am told they can do the extra \n35 towers without the contractor. We have talked to the contractor. He \nthinks that is a very doable event. The detention beds are certainly \ndoable because you can actually, if you can't build them--of course, \nwhat we should be doing is putting up tent cities, which we are doing, \nbut in any event, you can contract them out, potentially. We are \ntalking another 2,000 beds. The border agents is an issue, but if it is \ngoing to be an issue at 18,000, it will be an issue at 20,000. Hiring \nborder agents has become a function of finding the people we know we \nwant to do the job. But it is still very doable within that timeframe.\n  I am not sure it will delay it at all. I suspect you could still do \nall this within 18 months, but there should not be a set series of \nmonths at the end of which we are going to say: OK, we have operational \ncontrol of the border, and we can move on to the next things. What we \nshould have, rather, is a set of very determinable benchmarks which \nwill allow us to say that benchmark has been met and there is consensus \nthat that benchmark will accomplish what we say it will. In this \ninstance, that is the issue of operational control of the border.\n  So I would hope people would not vote to table this amendment. I \nwould note that many Members on the other side of the aisle have voted \nfor these types of resources in the past, when the amendment had been \noffered by Senator Byrd. So you may want to ask yourself, are you going \nto be consistent if you vote against this one?\n  But, more importantly, I think you have to ask yourself, are these \nchanges--an additional 2,000 border agents, an additional 100 miles of \nvehicle barriers, an additional 2,500 beds--so onerous that they are \ndeal killers? If that is the case, then this bill must be dead because \nwe just passed an amendment to cut the number of temporary workers in \nhalf. Now, that is a serious issue. This is taking procedure and \nputting it over policy when you take that position to the extreme.\n  So I hope Members will support this amendment. If the Senator from \nMassachusetts is inclined to move forward at this moment, I have no \nproblem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will include in the Record the Homeland \nSecurity proposal that was shared with the members of the committee. We \nasked what was going to be necessary for secure borders. I have in my \nhand the proposal of Homeland Security. That is what we have included \nin this legislation, their recommendations. I am sure we could always \ndo more and more and more, but what we have done is taken what has been \nthe recommendations of Homeland Security in each and every one of these \nareas.\n  They have made it very clear that in carrying forward and reaching \nthese recommendations it is going to take a combination of different \nelements. It is going to take their own kind of manpower to be able to \nreach this. It is\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\ngoing to take the technology to be able to reach it--over what period \nof time in terms of the contracting, and all the rest.\n  But as to what was necessary in terms of securing the border, that \nwas it. We are all for it. This is what they told us. That is what we \nhave accepted. We have gone over the list. I will make it part of the \nRecord. It goes over the numbers of hires, going all the way into the \nBorder Patrol agents. They come into the whole issue of border barriers \nand surveillance, the number of miles each year planned, what they \nbelieve is necessary. They review what they believe is the timeline for \nthe catch and return, the number of beds that are going to be \nnecessary. They go through the various milestones, the start-up costs, \nthe actual recurring costs.\n  They have outlined all of this in very careful detail. That is what \nwe have done. Every Member of the Senate ought to understand, these are \nHomeland Security's recommendations to secure the border, and that is \nwhat we have included in the legislation. It is always possible, I am \nsure, to be able to do more. We have done what was recommended to \nsecure it, and I think it is a very effective program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   STAFF ENHANCEMENTS FOR BORDER PATROL--GOAL: INCREASE BORDER PATROL\n                  AGENTS BY 6,000 BY DECEMBER 31, 2008\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Projections              FY07      FY08      FY09      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStarting Onboard................    12,319    14,819    17,819    18,319\nHires...........................     3,900     4,350       850     9,100\nAddition........................     2,500     3,000       500     6,000\nAttrition.......................     1,400     1,350       350     3,100\nEnd of Year Onboard.............    14,819    17,819    18,319  ........\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                 STRONG BORDER BARRIERS AND SURVEILLANCE\n                          [Dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Total\n                                   FY06      FY07    Calendar  estimated\n                                  actual    planned   year 08  cost FY06-\n                                   \\1\\                            FY08\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMiles of primary fence........         75       +70  \\1\\ +225      $998M\nMiles of vehicle barriers.....         57       TBD       200      $176M\nGround-based radar and camera           0       TBD        70  \\2\\ $737M\n towers (technology)..........\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)           1        +1     \\3\\+2    $85.6M\n (A)........................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Equals 370 miles total.\n\\2\\ Reflects the fully loaded costs of the integrated technology\n  solution, including engineering, unattended ground sensors,\n  communications, etc.\n\\3\\ Equals 4 total UAS.\n\n                      Key Assumptions of Timeline\n\n       USCIS will publish regulations governing the TWP within 6 \n     months of enactment, pursuant to expedited rulemaking \n     authority.\n       USCIS will begin accepting and adjudicating applications 6 \n     months after enactment of the legislation.\n       USCIS will stop accepting applications 18 months after \n     enactment.\n       A total of 12.5 million unauthorized aliens may be eligible \n     for the immigration benefits associated with the TWP, of \n     which approximately 93% are expected to apply for the \n     program.\n       Additional temporary sites will be established, equipped, \n     and manned to support processing requirements above the \n     current Application Service Center (ASC) capacity.\n       Not every applicant will require an adjudication interview \n     (based upon S. 2611 requirements--currently constructing \n     plans for interview of all applicants).\n       TWP applicants will be screened against all relevant \n     security checks.\n       USCIS will receive the funding and resources necessary to \n     upgrade systems infrastructure to handle increased processing \n     demand.

Mr. President, I now move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would make a motion to table the \namendment of the Senator----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will make a point of order a quorum is \nnot present.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. From New Hampshire, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG. I make a point of order a quorum is not present, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. OBAMA). Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a quorum is not present. I make a point of \norder that a quorum is not present.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll on the quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, we were necessarily absent during the \nearlier presentation by the Senator from New Hampshire at a meeting \nwith----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that a motion to table \nhas been made. It is not debatable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was under the impression we had gone \nthrough the debate and discussion. I had indicated I was going to make \na motion to table. When the Senator from New Hampshire came to the \nfloor, I was glad to withhold as the Senator remembers. The Senator, as \nI understood it, had finished his comments, and I made brief comments.\n  I am more than glad, if the Senator wants to address the amendment. \nWe have just been in the process of trying to move along. I have no \nintention of cutting him off. We have not attempted to cut anyone off. \nSo if he had that impression, I regret it. I say to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, we have been longtime friends, and we have been trying \nto have a process of moving this along. I had not known, at least on \nour side, we had other people prepared to speak. I had not heard there \nwere others who were prepared to speak on the other side. So that was \nbasically the reason for moving ahead.\n  But I am glad to withdraw the motion, as I was earlier. I would hope \nthe Senator would understand, and we would hear from the Senator, if he \nso desires. We want to, at some time, reach some judgment on the \namendment, but I am glad to work that out with the Senator, as I have \ntried to over the years.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and I will take 2 minutes to respond to his \ncomment, and then I would be happy to have the Senator renew his \nmotion. That was all the time I wished to use to respond--the issue \nbeing I had not been aware the Senator was going to respond to my \ncomment. But I did believe his comments deserved a response, and that \nis what I was seeking recognition to do at the time I was cut off. \nHowever, I do appreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  In response to the specifics of the Senator's representations that \nthe Department's position is that these numbers, as contained in the \nbill, will accomplish operational control of the border, I find that to \nbe entirely inconsistent and unsupportable, first, from the testimony \nof the Department's lower level individuals--who are in charge of these \nagencies--before the Appropriations subcommittee which I chaired at the \ntime, specifically, the Director of the Border Patrol, Mr. Bonner, who \nmade it very clear he needed 20,000 border agents; and, secondly, the \nfact they had let a contract which has in it significantly more numbers \nin the area of virtual fencing towers than are in this bill. If they \ndid not need those, why did they have a contract which calls for them?\n  So I think on its face the representation of that proposal may be \nthat is what they can do in 18 months, but it is not what they need to \ndo for operational control.\n  The proposal I have is the numbers necessary to obtain operational \ncontrol: 2,000 more border agents than called for in the bill, 2,700 \nmore beds than called for in the bill, 35 more towers for virtual \nfencing than called for in the bill, and 100 miles more of vehicle \nfencing.\n  It is not outrageous, not inconsistent, not inappropriate, and will \nactually strengthen this bill and make the American people believe we \nare doing something constructive in the area of border security.\n  With that, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nMassachusetts in allowing us to reopen the debate and ask unanimous \nconsent that further\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\ndebate on this amendment be ended and that the Senator be allowed to \nmake his motion, which he has a right to do anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nyeas and nays on the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1172) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from New \nHampshire. We continue to make progress. I thank him. I know his strong \nviews on this, and we will continue to work on it as a matter of \nenormous importance. I know the Senator from Arizona and others feel \nvery strongly. We want to have a secure border. People have differing \nviews, but we will work very closely to try and achieve the objectives, \nand we will work very closely with him as we go to conference and in \nconference as well. We all understand this is a work in progress.\n  Now, for the Members, I know Senator Cornyn wanted to offer an \namendment. As I understand it, he is still in the Armed Services \nCommittee. We were ready to go on our side. We had an amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota which is going to sunset the temporary worker \nprogram. He is giving thought to that. If he would like to--I see \nSenator Cornyn is here now. We may go out of sync here, but if we \nwanted to go ahead with that--I see my friend from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in order to take the next 10 minutes or so, \nmy understanding is that Senator Cornyn will be ready in a few minutes, \nbut in the meantime, a couple of people have been waiting patiently to \nspeak for maybe no more than 5 minutes or so. I think the Senator from \nTennessee would like to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the bill managers yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the information of the body, could the \nSenators give us some picture on the voting circumstances this evening? \nIs there a clear picture on whether you might expect additional \nrollcall votes tonight or would they be debated tonight and held over \nuntil the morning? What do the bill managers anticipate?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we would like to try to at least \nget another vote, possibly two. I think we will know more clearly in \nabout 15 minutes and we will notify our colleagues. I think we have \nmade some good progress. We had several of our colleagues--as always, \nthese are enormously important--from the Armed Services Committee and \nothers. We will probably have a brief window tomorrow.\n  The Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, was here earlier and wants \nto do an amendment on back taxes, and I have indicated I thought we \ncould probably do that in the morning and we will try to work out a \ntime with him. We are trying to follow going back and forth, but if \nthere are people here from a particular party who are prepared to go \nahead, we want to try to deal with that.\n  I think we will have a limited time in the morning. I don't know when \nwe are going to get the supplemental, but I am hopeful we would have at \nleast a window in the morning.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could interrupt my colleague to give a \ncouple of bits of further information, the next opportunity for an \namendment should be from the Democratic side. Senator Cornyn is ready \nto proceed with an amendment, and also Senator Hutchison has an \namendment I think that is cleared on both sides that we could do by \nvoice vote, when that is appropriate. But the next amendment should \ncome from the Democratic side.\n  My suggestion would be, while we are deciding the immediate future \nahead of us, that Senator Alexander be allowed to proceed on a matter \nthat is unrelated, and then we could go to the Democratic side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine. I see the Senator from Iowa here who \nwanted to make a comment as well.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, up to 5 minutes for Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I inquire, is there any possibility \nof having further debate tonight and votes in the morning in lieu of \nadditional votes this evening?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is always possible. We would like to check with the \nleadership. Senator Cornyn has been extremely patient through this \nprocess and has indicated at the start of the day that he would like to \nbe able to address the Senate on an issue. He has now returned. I would \nlike to see if we can't have maybe a short period here and then I could \ntry and make an assessment and let the Senator know. But I would be \nvery hopeful that we would be able to address Senator Cornyn tonight, \nand then I could talk to the Senator from North Dakota and Senator \nMcCain. If we can get those lined up for the morning, maybe we will be \nable to give an announcement about where we are.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Massachusetts will \nyield, I am happy to offer my amendment tonight and wait to vote on it \ntomorrow, if that suits the schedule of the bill managers. I wanted to \noffer that. I would like to offer it tonight and have the debate \ntonight, but if you would like to stack the vote up with others \ntomorrow, that is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we could proceed with the Senator from Tennessee for \n5 minutes and the Senator from Iowa for 10 minutes, and then we will \nannounce what the plan is for the evening and for the morning. I ask \nunanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n               Internet Tax Freedom Extension Act of 2007\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today, Senator Carper and I introduced \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Extension Act of 2007. Other cosponsors were \nSenators Feinstein, Voinovich, and Enzi. All of those Senators have \nbeen interested in this subject for the last few years.\n  The bill would, very simply, extend a moratorium on Internet access \ntaxes by State and local governments for another 4 years. This is a \ncommonsense compromise of what can sometimes be a very complicated \ndiscussion about continuing the moratorium, without blowing a hole in \nthe budgets of State and local governments.\n  We all want to be careful about so-called unfunded Federal mandates. \nWe want to respect State and local governments. But at the same time we \nwant to create an environment that encourages technology. We believe \nthis would do that.\n  The background of all this is, briefly, that originally Congress \npassed the Internet Tax Freedom Act in 1998, which did an extraordinary \nthing. It said State and local governments could not tax Internet \naccess for three years. That sounds like a good thing, but we could \njust as easily pass a bill we might call the food tax freedom act, \nbecause that would keep State and local governments from taxing food; \nor because we are against income taxes, we might say the income tax \nfreedom act and ban Tennessee from having an income tax; or we might \nsay the sales tax freedom act, or the property tax freedom act, or the \ntelecommunications tax freedom act. But instead we created the Internet \nTax Freedom Act, meaning, in effect, that States could not tax Internet \naccess. The rationale was that the Internet and electronic commerce is \na fledgling industry, and Congress extended that in 2001.\n  In 2004, after extensive debate, we worked out a compromise extending \nthis moratorium over the next 4 years.\n  The compromise we worked out in 2004, according to the National \nGovernors Association, may have saved\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nState and local governments up to $12 billion in revenue. All of us \nwant to keep taxes low, but here is where I am coming from. When I was \nGovernor, nothing made me angrier than for Members of Congress coming \nup with a big idea to pass a law, take credit for it, and send the bill \nto the Governors, legislators, mayors, and county commissions. That is \nwhat we will do if we are not careful about the Internet access tax \nbecause, as we saw 4 years ago, telephone calls moved to the Internet. \nIf we banned taxes on telecommunications as part of Internet access, \ntelephone calls over the Internet would be free from taxation.\n  That sounds good, except States might have to increase college \ntuition, increase sales tax on food, or some States might have to put \nin, for the first time, a State income tax.\n  Mr. President, $12 billion in revenue is a lot of money. The \ndefinition of Internet access that is in this new compromise that \nSenator Carper and I introduced on the moratorium would, for the next 4 \nyears, protect State and local governments, while continuing the \nmoratorium on Internet access. It is sensible. I think we will debate \nit more over time. Maybe it will even be accepted by all parties. I \nwanted to signal on my behalf, Senator Carper's behalf, and on behalf \nof the National Governors Association, the National Conference of \nMayors, and the National Association of Counties, that we believe it is \nvery important to do no harm to State and local government. If we want \nto give a tax break to the telecommunications companies or to Internet \ncompanies, then we in Congress should pay for that and not send a bill \nto State and local governments.\n  This avoids our having to do that because the moratorium carefully \ndefines Internet access to mean States are free to continue to make \ntheir own decisions. This doesn't mean States should attempt to tax the \nInternet; it means States may, if they choose, impose a sales tax on \nInternet services, just as States may impose a tax on food, or on \nmedicine, or on gasoline, or may impose a tax on income. That is the \njob of State and local government. That is not the job of the Congress.\n  I am glad to join with Senators Carper, Feinstein, Voinovich, and \nEnzi in introducing the Internet Tax Freedom Extension Act of 2007. I \nam glad to extend a commonsense moratorium on State and local taxation \nof Internet access, and I look forward to passage of that legislation \nbefore long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin pertaining to the introduction of S. 1469 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I believe we are now prepared to turn \nto the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, is there a pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1184 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n (Purpose: Establishing a permanent bar for gang members, terrorists, \n                          and other criminals)\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator from Texas will yield \nfor a question.\n  We are trying to determine what is going to happen on the balance of \nthe evening. Senators, understandably, at 6 o'clock, are asking if \nthere is going to be a vote this evening. I understand from our \nconversation in the cloakroom that there are two Senators who are \nconsidering joining with you and you are not now prepared to enter into \na time agreement. But if those Senators would come to the floor and let \nus know what they intend to do, we will be in a position to see if we \ncan vote. We wish to vote this evening, but we don't want to keep \npeople around here if we are not going to vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I agree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and will certainly try to work to accommodate \neverybody. It is not my intention to keep people hanging around here if \nwe are not going to vote, but I can't enter into a time agreement \nspecifically yet until we can get some people who are examining the \namendment, the cosponsors who might wish to speak on it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Maybe I could direct the question to the Senator from \nTexas. Would it be out of line to identify the Senators we have in mind \nso we can direct them to the floor to get this resolved?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I hate to identify them until they have made a decision \nto cosponsor the amendment or to speak on it, because they may want to \nstudy in confidence and then make a decision whether they want to \ncosponsor it or come to the floor. We are in communication with them, \nencouraging them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, they know who they are. We would ask \nthem to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1184 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know we are all anxious to proceed. No \none is more anxious than I to proceed with the hearing of amendments \nand debate. I think colleagues will, when they hear what this amendment \nis about--and I apologize that, due to the legislative counsel being \nbacked up drafting amendments, we have only recently been able to \ndistribute the amendment text, but I think as I describe this \namendment, my colleagues will share my concern with two problems that \nare in the underlying bill.\n  First, this amendment would do two things: The amendment would \nprovide technical corrections to what I can only assume are drafting \noversights in the underlying bill as well as close loopholes in the \ncurrent law. These technical corrections include closing loopholes that \nfail to permanently bar from the United States and prohibit awarding of \nany immigration benefits to the following categories of individuals: \nNo. 1, persons associated with terrorist organizations; No. 2, violent \ngang members; No. 3, sex offenders; No. 4, alien smugglers who use \nfirearms; and, No. 5, repeat drunk drivers.\n  The question I put to my colleagues is whether Congress should \npermanently bar from the United States and from receiving any \nimmigration benefit the persons in the categories I have just described \nand others who are dangerous to our society. I sincerely hope none of \nmy colleagues would answer this question in the negative.\n  Let me point out a couple of examples of what I will call the \ntechnical fixes that are sorely needed. Current law prohibits U.S. \ncitizens convicted of sex crimes against minors from bringing a \nrelative into the country. This bill, however, does not specifically \nprohibit aliens who would be removed from the country because they are \nsex offenders and fail to register as such from entering the United \nStates and getting legal status, such as lawful permanent residence \nstatus.\n\n  This, as I say, is what I believe to be an oversight. Perhaps in the \nhaste in which the bill was drafted it has been left out, but it needs \nto be fixed, obviously.\n  The bill also retains a loophole under current law that would allow \nan alien who has been repeatedly convicted of driving while intoxicated \nto remain in the United States and get legal status, such as a Z status \nor a green card.\n  The bill also retains the loophole in current law that allows an \nalien who belongs to a terrorist organization, or perhaps even \ncommitted terrorist acts\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\nand has not yet been removed from the United States, to get legal \nstatus.\n  Now, lest my colleagues think I am exaggerating, let me provide a \nreal-world example of this loophole. Last year, Mohammed El Shorbagi \npleaded guilty to providing material support to Hamas. His act of \nproviding material support to Hamas would not have barred him from \nestablishing good moral character under current law because it is not \none of those grounds specifically included in the list of acts that \nprevent an alien from establishing ``good moral character'' under our \nimmigration laws.\n  Now, I would hope these what I would call technical fixes are the \nkinds of commonsense solutions my colleagues would support. We have to \nensure those aliens who have committed crimes, such as failure to \nregister as a sex offender, or alien smuggling while using a firearm, \nare permanently barred and ineligible for benefits. We must also ensure \nthose aliens who have committed acts or who engage in conduct in \nassociation with a terrorist organization, or perhaps have even \ncommitted terrorist acts themselves, are rendered permanently \nineligible for any legal status and are barred from our country.\n  Finally--and this is not a technical fix; this, I believe, is a \nconscious decision on the part of the bill drafters to omit this \ncategory of individuals--my amendment would close the loophole in this \nbill that allows legalization of those illegal aliens who have already \nhad their day in court and violated court-ordered deportations. These \nare known as absconders and, in fact, have committed a felony, if found \nguilty of their failure to deport once ordered deported, or if they \nhave been deported and simply reentered the country.\n  Unlike the first half of my amendment, this is not a technical \ncorrection. In other words, the decision to legalize this population of \nillegal aliens was no drafting oversight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Texas to do me the \ncourtesy of allowing me 1 minute to take care of something that is \ngoing to be accepted, and that is going to modify an amendment that is \nto be accepted.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I yield for that purpose but claim my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1165, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1165.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCasey and Schumer be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1165, as modified, to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In section 218E(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (as added by section 404(a)), strike paragraphs (2) and (3) \n     and redesignate paragraph (4) as paragraph (3).\n       At the end of section 218E, add the following:\n       ``(i) Special Rule for Aliens Employed as Dairy Workers.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an alien \n     admitted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) for employment as \n     a dairy worker----\n       ``(1) may be admitted for a period of up to 3 years;\n       ``(2) may not be extended beyond 3 years; and\n       ``(3) shall not be subject to the requirements of \n     subsection (h)(4).\n       In section 218G of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as \n     amended by section 404(a)), strike paragraph (11) and insert \n     the following:\n       ``(11) Seasonal.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `seasonal', with respect to the \n     performance of labor, means that the labor--\n       ``(i) ordinarily pertains to or is of the kind exclusively \n     performed at certain seasons or periods of the year; and\n       ``(ii) because of the nature of the labor, cannot be \n     continuous or carried on throughout the year.\n       ``(B) Exception.--Labor performed on a dairy farm shall be \n     considered to be seasonal labor.\n       At the end of section 404, add the following:\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)) is amended by inserting ``or work on a \n     dairy farm,'' after ``seasonal nature,''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this modification is required by the \nauthors of the bill in order for dairy provisions to be accepted into \nthis bill. I have attempted through this language to ensure as best we \ncan that our Nation's dairy farmers have adequate access to labor in \nthe future. This amendment only deals with prospective immigration and \nis focused on dairy only.\n  Dairy is a year-round operation where interruptions to a farmer's \nlabor force can have significant consequences--the H-2A provisions as \nthey exist in the bill now do not adequately address the unique needs \nof dairy because they permit only 10-month terms of work. This sort of \ninterruption does not work for dairy farmers, who need year-round, \ndependable employees.\n  In the AgJOBS legislation that this body passed last year and that we \nreintroduced this year, I supported a much broader provision to address \nthe unique needs of the dairy industry. That provision had the \noverwhelming endorsement of America's family dairy operations. \nUnfortunately, there were objections from the Bush administration and \nthe authors of the bill now pending, so I have worked with the managers \nof this bill to craft this compromise.\n  This modification would enable dairy farmers to have multiple avenues \nto employ legal workers in the future. First, under the H-2A program, \ndairy farmers would have the ability to hire workers for a 3-year \nperiod after which time the workers would return home. Second, this \namendment would refine the H-2A program to allow dairy farmers to more \neasily obtain workers under the normal H-2A time frame of 10-month work \nperiods. In combination with available opportunities under the Y visa \nprogram, these changes should provide significant opportunities for \nAmerica's dairy farmers to obtain future legal workers to meet their \nneeds. I urge support for this modified amendment to ensure that \nessential changes for dairy farmers become part of this legislation.\n  Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, there is no objection on our side to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1165), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1168 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if I could request the indulgence of \nSenator Cornyn, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, I call up amendment No. \n1168 and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for Mrs. \n     Hutchison, for herself Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1168 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide local officials and the Secretary of Homeland \n  Security greater involvement in decisions regarding the location of \n                            border fencing)\n\n       On page 6, line 11, strike the second period and insert the \n     following: ``;\n       (C) in paragraph (2), as redesignated--\n       (i) in the header, by striking ``Security features'' and \n     inserting ``Additional fencing along southwest border''; and\n       (ii) by striking subparagraphs (A) through (C) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(A) Reinforced fencing.--In carrying out subsection (a), \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security shall construct reinforced \n     fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border \n     where fencing would be most practical and effective and \n     provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, \n     roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational \n     control of the southwest border.\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\n       ``(B) Priority areas.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall--\n       ``(i) identify the 370 miles along the southwest border \n     where fencing would be most practical and effective in \n     deterring smugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal \n     entry into the United States; and\n       ``(ii) not later than December 31, 2008, complete \n     construction of reinforced fencing along the 370 miles \n     identified under clause (i).\n       ``(C) Consultation.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the \n     Secretary of Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, States, \n     local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners in the \n     United States to minimize the impact on the environment, \n     culture, commerce, and quality of life for the communities \n     and residents located near the sites at which such fencing is \n     to be constructed.\n       ``(ii) Savings provision.--Nothing in this subparagraph may \n     be construed to--\n\n       ``(I) create any right of action for a State, local \n     government, or other person or entity affected by this \n     subsection; or\n       ``(II) affect the eminent domain laws of the United States \n     or of any State.\n\n       ``(D) Limitation on requirements.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), nothing in this paragraph shall require the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical \n     barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a \n     particular location along an international border of the \n     United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or \n     placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means \n     to achieve and maintain operational control over the \n     international border at such location.''; and\n       (D) in paragraph (5), as redesignated, by striking ``to \n     carry out this subsection not to exceed $12,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``such sums as may be necessary to carry out this \n     subsection''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to speak to an \namendment and resolve an issue impacting the citizens of our country \nthat live along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n  I have long stressed the need to secure the borders of the United \nStates--not only our southwest border with Mexico but also our northern \nborder with Canada and our maritime borders, coastlines, and ports of \nentry.\n  I have consistently supported and voted in favor of border security \nefforts--such as the installation of reinforced fencing in strategic \nareas where high trafficking of narcotics, unlawful border crossings, \nand other criminal activity exists. I have also supported installing \nphysical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors where necessary \n.\n  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed by Congress and signed into \nlaw by the President, and it signaled a major initiative to secure the \nborder with Mexico and Canada.\n  We must address border security so that we can move forward to \naddress comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I will continue to champion border security measures and strongly \nsupport the efforts of my colleagues to strengthen our southwest \nborder--protecting our citizens from threats of terrorism, narcotic \ntrafficking, and other unlawful entries. However, I am concerned that \nCongress is making decisions about the location of border fencing \nwithout the participation of State and local law enforcement officials \nworking with the Department of Homeland Security. The location of \nfencing should not be dictated by Members of Congress who have never \nvisited our border.\n  Our border States have borne a heavy financial burden from illegal \nimmigration, and their local officials are on the front lines. Their \nknowledge and experience should not be ignored. Texas shares \napproximately one-half of the land border between the United States of \nAmerica and the Republic of Mexico. Our State and local officials and \nthose in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas should not be \nexcluded from decisions about how to best protect our borders with \ntheir varying topography, population, and geography.\n  Local officials and property owners in my home State of Texas--\nparticularly in the areas of El Paso, Del Rio to Eagle Pass, and Laredo \nto Brownsville--cited in the Secure Fence Act, under current statutory \nlaw, do not have an opportunity to participate in decisions regarding \nthe exact location of fencing and other physical infrastructure near \ntheir communities.\n  To address this issue, I hosted a meeting in my Washington office, on \nJanuary 17, 2007, with DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, my colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator John Cornyn, mayors from the border cities in \nTexas, and representatives of the private sector. That meeting began a \ndialogue with our local representatives in Texas and the Federal \nGovernment. I look forward to helping ensure that this dialogue \ncontinues.\n  The Hutchison-Bingaman Amendment, No. 1168, cosponsored by Senators \nCornyn, Kyl, McCain, Feinstein, and Domenici, addresses these issues \nand provides local and State officials greater involvement in decisions \nregarding the location of border fencing.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1168) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1184\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be reinstated as the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is once again pending.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I have discussed what I would call technical \ncorrections or oversights that have been left out of this bill, in \nhaste, perhaps, because I know that following the negotiations that \nwent on for several weeks leading up to the announcement of an \nagreement by a bipartisan group of Senators on Friday, there was a lot \nof effort made to try to then turn that agreement into bill text. It \nwasn't until roughly midnight, I believe on Saturday night, that an \noriginal, or I should say a rough draft for discussion purposes was \ncreated; and then, if I am not mistaken, it was the night before last, \nabout 9 o'clock, when this original amendment was laid down, this \nsubstitute amendment, which actually reflects bill text, that we could \nthen go to legislative counsel to try and craft our amendments to be \naddressed.\n  Before I talk a little bit more about the second part of my \namendment, which I think was consciously omitted from the bill, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Senator \nDeMint of South Carolina be added as original cosponsors to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the second part of my amendment has, I \nthink it is fair to say, a substantial impact on the underlying bill, \nbut one I hope my colleagues will agree is necessary and important to \nadopt.\n  My amendment would close the loophole in this bill that allows \nlegalization of those illegal aliens who have already violated court-\nordered deportations. They are sometimes known as absconders because \nthey literally have absconded from the law, but they are, in fact, \nunder section 243 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act felons by \nvirtue of their having absconded either after they have been ordered \ndeported--they have simply gone on the lam and been fugitives from \njustice--or they have left the country pursuant to their order of \ndeportation and then reentered the country illegally. They are, under \nsection 243 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, felons if found \nguilty of those offenses.\n  Unlike the first half of my amendment, this is not, as I said, a \ntechnical correction. In other words, the decision to legalize this \npopulation was no drafting oversight. It was a conscious part of the \nnegotiated package that is now represented by the substitute amendment \npending before the Members of the Senate. The drafters of this bill \nhave made a conscious decision that Congress will allow exceptions for \nindividuals who are illegally in the United States, in defiance of a \ncourt order, as well as those who have previously been deported from \nthe United States pursuant to a court order and have again reentered \nillegally.\n  It is important to note that Congress has determined that each of \nthese crimes is a felony. The laws, as I said, are already on the \nbooks. These acts of defiance of our legal system are not actions which \nwould signal an individual's likelihood of future compliance with the \nlaws of the land. I don't think Congress should be in the business of \nallowing exceptions to a class of individuals who can reasonably be \ndubbed as fugitive aliens.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\n  In fact, it was Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nMichael Chertoff who said during our negotiations that illegal aliens \nwho have defied our court system after having been given full due \nprocess of law do not deserve to be rewarded with legalization. \nUnfortunately, the drafters of this bill, in an effort to accommodate \ncertain advocacy groups, have ignored Secretary Chertoff's commonsense \nobservation, what is being peddled as ``discretion'' by way of a \n``waiver.''\n  We can't guarantee the American people that future Presidents will \nappoint, nor the Senate confirm, Secretaries of Homeland Security with \nthe good sense and judgment of Secretary Chertoff. Thus, I think we \nneed to eliminate any discretion in allowing these individuals to \nremain in the country and obtain the benefits of this legalization. I \nsubmit that discretion is something Congress gives away to a \nbureaucracy when Members don't have the intestinal fortitude to create \na bright-line rule. This bright-line rule would affect roughly 700,000 \nabsconders who are still in the United States. The underlying bill \nwould allow them a path to legal status and perhaps even to \ncitizenship. My amendment would say these people have had their \nopportunity to have their day in court and do not deserve the benefits \nthat this underlying bill would give to other persons who have not \nsimilarly defied our U.S. legal system and, indeed, have committed, \nperhaps, felonies.\n\n  I ask my colleagues this. What is the message we send about the rule \nof law in America when Congress would not even categorically prohibit \nrewarding those illegal aliens who have defied lawful orders? What is \nthe message we are sending to immigrants who are lawfully waiting \noutside the country when we reward those who have not simply violated \nour laws by entering illegally but who have also thumbed their noses at \nour legal system, after having been ordered or actually been removed?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the policy in this bill that would \nreward felony conduct with legal status. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Texas asked a question. \nI think the answer is probably fairly obvious. What is the message we \nsend to people around the world who applied for status to come to this \ncountry through the immigration quota process? There is a process that \nis our legal immigration process. What is the message to those folks \nwho, perhaps 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 9 years ago, filed a petition \nonly to discover that if they had walked across the border on December \n31 of last year, they would, with this legislation, be deemed to have \nbeen here legally? That is the message. It is sort of a Byzantine \nmessage as far as I am concerned.\n  Yesterday something happened that was quite interesting. I attempted \nto eliminate the so-called guest worker program or the temporary worker \nprogram by which millions of additional people who do not now live in \nthis country would be invited in to take American jobs. I attempted to \neliminate that. I failed to do that. I will next offer an amendment at \nsome point, perhaps tomorrow morning, that will sunset the temporary \nworker program. If we cannot eliminate it, at least let's put an end to \nit--put a sunset on it.\n  During the debate yesterday, something fascinating happened. We are \ntold repeatedly on the floor of the Senate that this bill is a piece of \nlegislation that provides border security because most of us know that \nwhen you start dealing with immigration, the first step, the first baby \nstep is to provide border security. If you do not do that, all you do \nis set up, another 10 or 15 years from now, exactly the same debate and \nprovide amnesty for another 10 or 15 million people.\n  We have done that before, in 1986. We have heard exactly the same \narguments: We are going to have border security, we are going to have \nemployer sanctions, we are going to shut down illegal immigration, and \nwe are going to have nirvana. The fact is, none of that worked. We have \ndone this before.\n  What happened yesterday was fascinating to me. In an attempt to shut \ndown the temporary worker provision, I was told by the people who \nconstructed this proposal that if you shut down the temporary worker \nprovision by which we will bring people into this country who are not \nnow here to take American jobs--if you shut down the temporary worker \nprovisions, what will happen, they said, is people will come across \nillegally anyway.\n  I said: I don't understand your point. First, you said you have \nwritten a bill that provides border security and stops illegal \nimmigration. Now you are saying if we get rid of the temporary worker \nprovision, what will happen is we will have illegal immigration anyway. \nYou can't have it both ways. Either this bill does what is advertised \nand provides real border security or it doesn't.\n  Those who put the bill together told us yesterday it doesn't have \nthat border security because they believe they have to designate those \nwho are coming across as legal, therefore, temporary workers, because \nif they did not do that, they would come across and we would call them \nillegal. That is the most unbelievable thing I ever heard.\n  They cobbled together this proposal. I said yesterday it reminds me \nof the old saying that a camel is a horse produced by a committee. They \nhave cobbled together this camel of policy here with several different \npieces, saying, first, because I believe they understand the politics \nof it that requires them to say this, we have provided for border \nsecurity when, in fact, they have not. That is not the case. All they \nhave done is created the same promises I heard 21 years ago.\n  Then they say, but we must, even as we decide to say to this 12 \nmillion who are here, including those who came across the last week of \nDecember last year: By the way, you are now legal and given a work \npermit--we must, in addition to that, allow millions more to come in.\n  Yes, you get millions more when you do 400,000 a year for 2 years, \nhave them go back for a year, come back 2 more years, have them go back \na year, and have 2 more years and accumulate that, and you have at the \nvery least, without even counting families, 12 million workers in a few \nyears. They say we have to do that--invite others to come in to take \nAmerican jobs--because if we don't, they will come across the border \nanyway. That is a serious admission of failure, in my judgment, in the \nbill that is brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I didn't intend to come here to say anything, but I heard my \ncolleague from Texas ask, What is the message? The message is a \nByzantine message to those who believed there was a legal way to try to \ncome to this country, a legal process by which we have immigration \nquotas from various countries and they, thinking it was all on the \nlevel, actually made application to say I would like to come to the \nUnited States of America and I am willing to wait. I waited 5 years or \n7 years, they say, only to discover that as of today, if this bill \npasses, we say you should have come across on December 28 or so into \nthis country. You could have gotten on a plane on a visitor's visa with \na full intention of never going back, or walked across the border \nsomeplace, and this Congress with this legislation would say to you: We \nhave a great surprise for you. You came across illegally and we now \ndesire to say to you: You are legal, you have legal status and a work \npermit.\n  What kind of message? We know the answer to that. It is a Byzantine \nmessage that makes no sense at all.\n  Is immigration an issue? Yes, it is. But this bill will not solve it. \nI intend to offer an amendment in the morning that will establish a \nsunset on the provision called the temporary worker provision. But even \nthat will not solve the problems of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise today to, first of all, thank our \nleadership for allowing a true debate to take place on this issue. I \nknow at one time it was discussed that we would pass this huge piece of \nlegislation, that affects so many people, in 3 days. Because of the \nacquiescence of the bill\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nmanagers and leadership, we are truly going to have 3 weeks of debate.\n  You heard the Senator from Texas offer an amendment to make this \nlegislation better; and the Senator from North Dakota, to offer his \nviews. I think this whole process has been very healthy.\n  One of the things we are trying to address in this bill is a \nsituation where our immigration has been broken, the system has been \nbroken for many years. In 1986, legislation was offered to try to solve \nthis problem. What has happened is it has gotten even worse, so there \nhas been, obviously, more thought put into this bill.\n  I appreciate again the many amendments and the discussion that has \ntaken place. Many of the things we have talked about have addressed the \nlegalities, have addressed some of the technicalities in our \nimmigration system. It seems to me, one of the things we have not \naddressed--while we have tried to address fairness to businesses, we \ntried to address fairness to immigrants, we tried to address fairness \nto families--one of the things I think we have not addressed is a sense \nof fairness to the American citizen.\n  What I mean by that is this. There is a sense of fairness that we see \nmany times on the floor that is not addressed by the fact that we have \nabout 12 million people in this country today illegally. People see \nthis bill as straight amnesty, where all of a sudden we are going to \nmake it legal that if you have been here working, for however long, you \nbecome legal in this country by virtue of being here.\n  In many cases, people have talked about some of the draconian \nmeasures that require people to actually return home to their \ncountries. Yet this bill, in some cases, does that. Certainly, to \nbecome a green card holder, somebody has to return home to their \ncountry before coming in. That is something Americans think is fair.\n  If you want to be a temporary worker in this country, according to \nthis bill, what you would do is work here for 2 years, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota responded, then you would leave and go back for a \nyear, and then you would come back into our country. Yet that is not \nperceived to be draconian and I do not think it is at all. But the one \nprovision that seems to me to hit at the essence of the American \nfrustration that is not in this bill, is the fact that we have some \ntriggers that are going to cause our borders to be secure and make us \nbe able to track people in an appropriate way--the administration said \nthis can take place over the next 18 months--but what we are not doing \nis asking the people who are here in our country illegally to actually \nreturn home and come back through legal channels.\n  It is that point, I think, that has divided the American people, the \nfact that this bill does not address the inequity of allowing those \npeople to remain here. These are people who came here, obviously, to \nsupport their families, and we understand what the motivation is for \nmany people to be here, but this bill does not address that inequity.\n  What I propose tonight and I am working with other Senators to \nhopefully make happen after we come back from recess, is to actually \nhave a provision in this bill that treats people who are here illegally \nlike those who wish to have a green card, like those who would be \ntemporary workers in this bill. I would ask that other Senators work \nwith me and others to create an amendment to this bill that actually \nwould cause, over a reasonable amount of time, people who are working \nin this country to return to their home country and then come back \nthrough legal channels. I think that strikes at the very core of what \nso many Americans believe is so inappropriate about having illegal \nimmigrants, illegal workers, automatically made legal.\n  I think that is a central fallacy in this bill as it has been offered \ntoday. After many of these technical amendments are agreed to over the \ncourse of the next few days, and as we come back from recess, I look \nforward to working with other Senators to try to ensure that if this \nimmigration bill passes, it passes in a way that meets the sense of \nfairness the American public believes this bill ought to have; that it \naddresses that inequity of people who jumped in front of the line and \ncame here, being here illegally and yet being able to benefit without, \nduring a reasonable period of time, returning home and coming back \nthrough legal channels, once we have the mechanisms in place to allow \npeople to do that. I hope to have the opportunity to work with others \nin this body to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I wish to rise briefly to speak to the \namendment of the Senator from Texas. I think I caught him describing it \nas a ``technical one.'' At first blush, having just seen it for the \nfirst time, looked at it and having seen the intersection of what he \nseeks to do throughout title II of the bill, it is far from technical; \nit is very substantive. I appreciate that he has very substantive \npositions that might be different from mine, but they are very \nsubstantive, they are not technical. They go, in some cases, to the \nheart of due process for individuals, and they go to the heart of \nundoing what some cases in the appellate division and beyond have \ndecided is the appropriate law of the land.\n  I just wish to start off by saying that I certainly hope this \namendment will not come to a vote tonight because I think all of us \nneed to understand the nature, the scope, the breadth, the width of \nwhat, in fact, is being offered here, which I truly believe is far more \nthan technical. So I just wanted to, so to speak, wave my saber early \nfor the distinguished Senator from Texas and say that I am sure he is \ngoing to get a vote, but I will have to object if there is any \nintention to seek a vote tonight. You have to take all of the 12 pages \nthat were just presented, intersect them, and see how they affect \ndifferent sections of the underlying statute, and those have real \nmeaningful consequences at the end of the day. I might agree with some; \nI might strongly disagree with others. So I just wanted to make it \nclear to the body that, from my perspective, it is a little bit more \nthan technical.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the concerns of my \ndistinguished colleague. It is a fair point; this is more than a \ntechnical amendment. He may not have heard my entire earlier statement. \nI indicated that some aspects of my amendment were what I thought were \ntechnical, but there was a second part that was far from technical, it \nwas very substantive, and I knew it would be controversial because we \ndiscussed it during the course of the negotiations in which the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey participated, as did I, and it \nwas, the best I can tell, consciously omitted from the draft. So my \neffort here is to insert it by way of amendment. I do believe it \ndeserves full and fair consideration. People need to understand what \nthe impact of it will be.\n  Indeed, this whole subject matter has a lot of ramifications and a \nlot of moving parts, and that is the reason I am so glad we have not \nonly this week but also a second week after the recess which the \nmajority leader has scheduled to conclude the debate and vote on the \nbill.\n  I certainly understand the Senator's concerns, and I would welcome \nthe debate that will ensue, but I can understand why he would object to \na vote tonight. We have actually talked with the bill managers and \nsuggested that perhaps, if unanimous consent can be obtained, this \namendment would be set aside temporarily and perhaps other amendments \ncan be laid down and even voted on tonight but that we can wait until \ntomorrow, perhaps, to schedule a vote on this after everyone has had a \nchance to digest it and consider its ramifications.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the offer from the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, and I certainly hope we will take his \noffer because I would have to object if we were\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nto try to proceed tonight to a vote on his amendment. I think his \namendment is important. I think it has real consequences. There are \nreal consequences of substantive law, there are real consequences of \ndue process, and there are real consequences of equal protection. So \nthese are major legal issues which affect potentially millions of \npeople.\n  I appreciate the spirit in which he has offered it. I appreciate him \nsaying he is more than willing to give time. I hope the bill managers \nwould pursue that course of action and make sure that a vote on this \ndoes not take place until sometime tomorrow so that we can digest all \nof this and have the appropriate debate because legal protections are \nvery important in the context of what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to spend, if I can, just a few \nmoments--I see my colleague from New Jersey is still on the floor, and \nhe will be joining me at an appropriate time in offering an amendment \ndealing with parents of U.S. citizens. The Senator from New Jersey \nspeaks eloquently about this issue on a very personal level. I am proud \nto be the author of an amendment with him and others to try to improve \nthis legislation.\n  This amendment would unite parents with their families in the United \nStates by increasing the cap on green cards issued to them, extending \nthe duration of the newly created parent visa, and ensuring that \npenalties imposed on people overstaying this visa are not unfairly \napplied to others, as they would be in this legislation.\n  Under current law, parents of U.S. citizens are defined as immediate \nrelatives, along with spouses and minor children, and are exempt from \ngreen card caps. Under the proposed legislation, S. 1348, parents would \nbe removed from this category and subject to an annual cap of 40,000 \ngreen cards. This amendment increases the cap on green cards in this \nbill to 90,000. That is about the average annual number of green cards \nissued to parents of U.S. citizens.\n  Second, we are trying to extend the duration of the newly created \nparent visitor visa to 180 days. Under this bill, the amount of time a \nparent could stay here under a parent visitor visa is limited to 30 \ndays per year. On the other hand, a tourist visa is valid for 180 days \nper year. The idea that your parent can only come here for 30 days is \nsomething that is offensive to a lot of Americans who believe in the \nvalue and importance of children and parents being together.\n  This amendment would also ensure that penalties imposed on overstays \nare not unfairly applied to others, as they would be in this \nlegislation. If the number of overstays exceeds 7 percent, individuals \nfrom disproportionately high-risk countries could be barred from coming \nto the United States on this visa program or the entire program could \nbe terminated.\n  I hardly think it necessary to make the case about the value of \nparents and children being united for a period of time and what it \nmeans, if you are parents yourselves, to be able to have grandparents \nspend some time with their grandchildren.\n  We take great pride in that. We extol the value of family. One would \nbe hard pressed to hear a speech given by someone in public office \ntoday, regardless of the subject matter, that doesn't at some point or \nthe other talk about how important it is to value families, to do \neverything we can to keep families together, the importance of inter-\ngenerational communication, grandparents and grandchildren, parents and \nchildren, the value of that to a nuclear family. Certainly, we all \nrecognize we have serious issues of security that need to be dealt with \nat our borders, doing what we can to provide for the legal status of \nthose who are seeking to come here through traditional means. It is a \nmajor step backwards for a country that prides itself on allowing for \nfamilies to be together, understanding the importance of it, that we \nwould be talking about legislation that cuts by more than half the \naverage annual number of green cards needed for parents to visit their \nchildren, dealing with them in a separate category, and providing \nactually a longer visa for tourists than for parents.\n  No one knows who gets excluded when you go from no cap down to \n40,000. Obviously, a lot of parents would be excluded in any given \nyear. As evidenced over the years, once parents do come for a limited \namount of time, that usually completes the family unit. They are not \nlikely to sponsor other relatives. U.S. citizens with parents abroad \nshould not be treated differently than those with parents here, to \nprovide that opportunity in time for them to be together.\n  This amendment would increase the green card cap to 90,000 so we are \nmeeting the average annual need and not creating an insurmountable \nbacklog. It would make sure that sufficient numbers of green cards are \navailable to parents who come to the United States. We extend the \nparent visa to 180 days and make it renewable and valid for 3 years. \nThose are already accepted time frames for the validity of visas. 180 \ndays is the length of a tourist visa. H-1B visas are valid for 3 years.\n  This legislation limits parents to an annual stay of 30 days. It does \nnot specify any long-term validity. This is far too short a time \nallotment, I think most would agree, particularly for parents who come \nfor health reasons or to help their children during and after \nchildbirth.\n  Lastly, this amendment would make penalties for parent visa overstays \napplicable only to them. Under the legislation before us, if the \noverstay rate among visa holders exceeds 7 percent for 2 years, all \nnationals of countries with high overstay rates can be barred from this \nprogram or the program can be terminated. Sponsors of overstays are \nalso barred from sponsoring other aliens on this visa. This amendment \nstrikes that language that unfairly collectively punishes those who \nhave not violated the law, allowing law-abiding parents to continue to \nunite with their children.\n  The amendment is comprehensive and touches on all three points of \nfamily reunification: parents with their children, grandparents with \ntheir grandchildren. Again, it hardly needs a lengthy explanation of \nthe value. I regret deeply that my children don't have the benefit of \ntheir grandparents. They passed away too many years ago. How many times \non a daily basis I think of what a value it would be to my children to \nknow their grandparents, not to mention what it would have meant to my \nwife when she gave birth to be able to have her mother around during \nthat period of time or the weeks thereafter to have her come and spend \na couple of months. To be with the family as they are getting on their \nfeet, I don't know of a single American who doesn't understand this \nbasic concept.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer this amendment. I am pleased my \nlead cosponsor on this amendment is my colleague and friend from New \nJersey. I thank him for his support. He told me the story of his \nfamily. I think maybe more than anything else I heard over the last \nseveral weeks, thinking about what it would have meant for his family \ncoming from Cuba and not being able to come here moved me to the point \nwhere I thought this was something we ought to offer on this \nlegislation.\n  At the appropriate time I will offer the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I thank and applaud the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut for soon offering this amendment. I am proud \nto join him in this effort. I want to build upon a couple of things he \nsaid as to why this amendment should be accepted, not voted but \naccepted.\n  First, I have listened to a new definition of what a nuclear family \nis. It is amazing. I have heard so many speeches over my 15 years in \nthe Congress about family. All of a sudden, the nuclear family doesn't \ninvolve mothers and fathers. All of a sudden it doesn't involve \nchildren, just because they happen to be over the age of 21. All of a \nsudden brothers and sisters are not part of a nuclear family.\n  What is a nuclear family? Certainly as people travel throughout the \ncountry making speeches about nuclear families--about families period--\nthey certainly mean their parents, people who gave life to them; \ncertainly they mean their children, individuals to whom they gave life; \ncertainly, they\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\nmean their brothers and sisters. I have been amazed at some of the \ncomments I have heard on the floor of the Senate about what is not \nnuclear family.\n  What else is this about? This is about the right of a U.S. citizen to \napply for their mother and father. That is what the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut is all about, the right of a U.S. citizen \nalready to apply. Do everything right. Pay your taxes, serve your \ncommunity, serve your country, you want to have a right, which you have \nunder the law today, to simply bring your father and mother, or either \none depending if they are not both alive, the opportunity to be \nreunited with you, a nuclear family, be reunited with you because you \nneed them, be reunited, as the Senator from Connecticut says, because \nyou have a child and now there is the opportunity to have the love and \ncare a grandparent can offer, to create a sense of family, which is the \nessence of stability in our communities. Of any faith, it is the very \ncore.\n\n  What we see in the underlying bill is an elimination for the most \npart, a significant right of U.S. citizens dramatically reduced. The \nSenator's amendment actually will allow not for everybody. It still \nwill have a certain degree of limitation because last year we gave \n120,000 visas to parents. The Senator--which I think is reasonable--has \nlooked at the historic average, and this says this is the amount that \nat least generally has taken place in family reunification of a U.S. \ncitizen claiming their parents.\n  When I hear chain migration, how dehumanizing. Chain migration, it \nmakes me think of a bunch of paper clips hanging together. Chain \nmigration, is that what we have come to? Parents are part of a little \nchain? There is this concern that they will be able to claim someone \nelse. Who can they claim if they are being claimed by their son or \ndaughter? That's it. You can't claim anybody else. Chain migration. How \neasy it is to try to take something that has so much significance in \nour lives and dehumanize it. Chain migration? No, this is about family \nreunification. It is the core of what our society is all about. It is \nwhat we hear speeches about all the time in terms of strengthening \nfamilies. Families will be strengthened when they are together, not \ntorn apart.\n  In the universe of visas, this is very small, but it has a big \nconsequence. Therefore, I salute the Senator from Connecticut for \noffering the amendment. I am proud to join with him when he offers it \nat the appropriate time. I hope we are not going to now say that \nparents are not part of the nuclear family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1158 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1158.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman], for himself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1158 to amendment \n     No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n Responsibility Act of 1996 to facilitate information sharing between \nFederal and local law enforcement officials related to an individual's \n                          immigration status)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 642 of the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. \n     1373) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(4) Acquiring such information, if the person seeking \n     such information has probable cause to believe that the \n     individual is not lawfully present in the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, following the attacks of 9/11, we made \na promise to the American people to make this country safer. We \nidentified on all levels cracks in our system. Most alarming, we found \nthat intelligence agencies were not talking to one another. We found \nthat when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing, the \nconsequences can be disastrous. The gathering of intelligence is not an \nabstract concept that only happens on the streets of Afghanistan or \nIraq. It happens every day on the streets of Duluth or St. Paul, MN. \nOur local law enforcement agencies are on the front lines of our \ncommunities and often know exactly what is happening on our streets.\n  Sadly, in what is reminiscent of pre-9/11 days, municipalities have \nidentified a loophole in the law--or in many ways I don't even call it \na loophole, they have simply circumvented Federal law and have banned \nthe practice of officers inquiring about a suspect's immigration \nstatus, allowing cities throughout the country to become what are \ncalled sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.\n  My amendment seeks to end the practice of sanctuary cities. These are \ncities that seek to evade their obligations under section 642 of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. \nThat law expressly prohibits any Federal, State, or local government \nentity from preventing a law enforcement officer from sharing \ninformation with the Federal Government regarding the immigration \nstatus of a person with whom they come in contact.\n  The law is very clear. Section 642, subsection (b) states:\n\n       no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict--\n\n  In any way restrict--\n\n     a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any \n     of the following with respect to information regarding the \n     immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual:\n\n  It goes on to say, you cannot restrict ``sending such information to, \nor requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.'' You cannot restrict, in any way, \n``maintaining such information.'' You cannot, in any way, restrict \n``exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local \ngovernment entity.''\n  So that is what the law states.\n  Several cities have passed ordinances or issued executive orders \nforbidding local law enforcement from even asking the question as to \nwhether a person is in the United States lawfully, and thereby evading \ntheir legal responsibility to report their suspicions to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In other cases, police department policies forbid or severely \nrestrict their officers from asking a person about immigration status.\n  Essentially, the philosophy is ``don't ask, don't tell''--don't ask \nsuspects about their immigration status, so then you don't have to \nfollow the dictates of the Federal law. These cities have decided the \nrule of law does not apply to them.\n  Scores of law enforcement officers have chafed at the gag order. I \nhad a meeting last week with law enforcement officers from Minnesota in \nmy office, and they mentioned this. They mentioned the frustration they \nhave with what they think is their responsibility to report if they \nthink somebody is not here legally, that--who knows?--this person could \nbe somebody who had been deported before, and that is a felony. They \nare absolutely prohibited from even asking the question or having the \nconversation.\n  Many say they routinely come in contact with dangerous persons they \nknow have been deported already--they know it--yet their local \nsanctuary policy is to prevent them from being able to do anything \nabout it.\n  Supporters say sanctuary policies are intended to be humanitarian \nbecause they allow illegal immigrants to cooperate with the police \nwithout fear of deportation. But the consequences of these policies are \nanything but for the law-abiding members of these communities: in some \ncases, dangerous criminal aliens remaining on the streets, muzzled law \nenforcement officers, and scarce local resources being wasted on\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nnoncitizens who should be turned over to the Federal authorities.\n  Opening the channels of communication between local and Federal law \nenforcement will help prevent crimes against other members of the \ncommunities. Consider some recent examples.\n  Two young women who were killed in an accident near Virginia Beach \nearlier this year were struck by a drunk driver who had three previous \nalcohol-related convictions and an identity theft conviction, but \nbecause he had never been sent to prison, there had never been an \nexamination of his immigration status. Reportedly, many area police \nofficers knew the individual was in the United States illegally. Yet \nthey never reported it to Federal immigration authorities.\n  In April 2005, a Denver police officer was shot and killed by an \nillegal immigrant who had been stopped three times for traffic \nviolations and even appeared in court just 3 weeks before committing \nthe murder. Strict rules in the police manual deterred officers from \ninquiring about his immigration status, so Federal immigration \nauthorities were never notified.\n  In June 2003, a 9-year-old girl was kidnapped in San Jose, CA, by an \nillegal immigrant who had been arrested previously for auto theft. \nBecause the San Jose Police Department's policy manual forbids officers \nfrom initiating police action intended to determine a person's \nimmigration status, Federal authorities were never contacted.\n  In December 2002, a 42-year-old mother of two was raped in Queens by \na group of men. Four of them were illegal immigrants, and three had \npreviously been arrested for such crimes as assault, attempted robbery \nin the second degree, criminal trespass, illegal gun possession, and \ndrug offenses, but were later released.\n  In May 2002, three women in Houston, TX, were raped and murdered by \nWalter Alexander Sorto, an illegal immigrant who had been ticketed \nseveral times for traffic violations.\n  This is not to suggest all aliens are violent criminals or that all \nviolent criminals are illegal aliens. We caught Al Capone on tax \nevasion. We can protect our communities by allowing police officers to \nfind out whether a person has broken our immigration laws.\n  Sanctuary city policies do not just leave their own citizens at risk. \nMohammed Atta, the leader of the 9-11 hijackers, was stopped and \nticketed for driving without a license in Broward County, FL, in early \n2001. His visa was expired. Under these policies, no one would ever \nknow that.\n  Just this month, we saw a terror plot unfold in Fort Dix that might \nhave been prevented sooner had the local officials, who pulled the \nsuspects over on numerous traffic violations, inquired about their \nimmigration status. Make no mistake, this is a national security issue.\n  To address this problem, I am offering a simple amendment to make it \nclear a police officer has the right to ask immigration-related \nquestions of a suspect, and to report his or her suspicions to Federal \nauthorities. My amendment restores the original intent of the 1996 law, \nwhich I read before, by stating that Federal, State, and local \ngovernments may not prohibit law enforcement from acquiring information \nabout immigration status where there is probable cause. That is what \nthe 1996 law says, and yet cities have been able to circumvent this. \nLet us, then, go back to the original intent of that law.\n  My amendment does not require local law enforcement to use their \nscarce resources enforcing immigration laws. It does not enable local \nlaw enforcement to conduct immigration raids or act as Federal agents, \nor even determine a person's immigration status. Instead, my amendment \nsimply gives law enforcement officers the ability to pursue a person's \nimmigration status as part of their routine work, and thus to report \nany suspicions to the appropriate Federal authorities through already \nestablished channels, such as through the Law Enforcement Support \nCenter at ICE, or ICE's Criminal Alien Program.\n  In essence, sanctuary cities are thumbing their noses at Federal law. \nThe Justice Department has concluded that States have the inherent \nsovereign right to make arrests for both criminal and civil immigration \nviolations. Section 642 of the 1996 immigration reform bill expressly \nstates local law enforcement officers must communicate with Federal \nauthorities. Yet their leadership or their local government or their \ncity council is actually preventing them from doing so. In this day and \nage, we cannot allow for such law enforcement-free zones.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the bill before us today takes \naway the strongest argument that sanctuary city supporters have; \nnamely, that illegal immigrants will be so frightened about being \ndeported that they will never go to the police.\n  As currently written, this bill will give a legal status to these \naliens. Any alien participating in the program should not fear an \nencounter with a police officer. The only aliens who would fear contact \nwith the police are those who have committed some crime.\n  Sanctuary cities take away the ability of a police officer to use his \nor her own judgment in the course of their routine police work to \ninquire about a person's immigration status and share their concerns \nwith the Federal Government for followup action.\n  The reality is law enforcement officers ask a wide range of questions \nof suspects every day that touch upon many aspects of the person's \nbehavior. But in sanctuary cities, they cannot ask about immigration. \nThe artificial wall relative to immigration status is illogical--and I \nwould suggest perhaps even unconstitutional--and in this day and age \nharmful to our national security. We ought to give this tool back to \nour local law enforcement.\n  Finally, one other point. One of the challenges we have with the bill \nbefore us--by the way, a bill where I would like to see us deal with \nthe immigration issue. The system is broken. It needs to be changed. \nClearly, we know that. We all know that.\n  We have had a group of Senators on both sides of the aisle, from a \nbroad political spectrum, come together to try to find some common \nground, to try to deal with the issue of strengthened border security, \nwhich we must deal with--to do those things--to ensure greater employer \nresponsibility, and then to figure out some way to deal with the 11 \nmillion who are here, to know who they are, have them learning English, \nhave them pay taxes, and not to provide amnesty but to provide fines \nand a series of sanctions and a path before one can even consider \nproceeding to something like citizenship.\n  But one of the problems we are having--I am having it now. I have \ngotten thousands of calls on this issue, most against this bill, even \nthough people have not even read the bill yet. I think it is, in part, \nbecause folks do not trust us, do not trust the Federal Government to \ndo what we say we are going to do. They do not trust us to absolutely \nuphold the rule of law. They do not believe when we say we are going to \nsecure our borders that we are actually going to do it.\n  In many ways, this issue I raise today is a rule of law issue. If we \ntell people across America that in sanctuary cities the rule of law \ndoes not apply when it comes to immigration, how are we going to get \nthe American public to believe we are serious about border security--\nwhen we then try to figure out a way to do a guest worker program, to \ndeal with the 11 million who should come out of the shadows into the \nsunlight?\n  I suggest by supporting this amendment what you are doing is \nsupporting respect for the rule of law. We need to do more of that to \ngain the trust and the confidence of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of a resolution honoring the life of \nRachel Carson, a scientist, writer, and pioneer in the environmental \nmovement, on the occasion of the centennial of her birth, which was \nintroduced early today by Senators Cardin, Specter, and others; that \nthe resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements thereon be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I object on behalf of another Senator, \nanother Republican.\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the obligation my friend from \nMinnesota has. But I am going to continue offering this unanimous \nconsent request. To think that we would not honor Rachel Carson on the \nanniversary of her 100th birthday--a woman who did as much for the \nenvironmental movement in this country as any human being who has ever \nexisted.\n  Somebody has objected to this? I have heard the reason for the \nobjection is she relied on flawed science to come to her conclusions. I \ndo not know anything about flawed science, but I do know this woman \nturned the minds of young people to the environment, turned the minds \nof the academic world to the environment. As a result of her work--as a \nresult of her work--we became conscious of our need to make sure we do \nthings to protect the environment.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to continue to move on this. I will \ntell you, I feel strongly about this, as do Senators--both Democrats \nand Republicans--that we will have a couple more objections, and then I \nam going to have a vote to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to \nthis piece of legislation.\n  I think it is too bad, first, that the person who objected to this \nwould not have the--I should not say courage, but that person who \nobjects to this should come and do it on their own behalf, not have \nsome other Senator object.\n  Rachel Carson was a scientist, a writer, and a pioneer in the \nenvironmental movement to make this world a better place. This is a \nsimple resolution. It does not cost a penny. All it does is give \nrecognition to someone who certainly deserves that. So I am terribly \ndisappointed that there is an objection to this, but we will do it \nagain at another time.\n\n\n                             Yucca Mountain\n\n  Mr. President, for 25 years, there has been an effort made to do \nsomething that is degrading to the environment and that would \njeopardize the health and safety of millions of Americans. It is a \nproject to bury nuclear waste in the deserts of Nevada.\n  Originally, when this project started, there was a program that would \nhave had three sites that would be selected for places to characterize; \nthat is, to prepare them for the taking of nuclear waste. One was in \nWashington, one was in Nevada, and one was in Texas. There was a time \nthat came in the 1980s where, because of political maneuvering, \nWashington and Texas were eliminated, and they thought because Nevada \nwas a place that set off atomic bombs and did other things, it was a \nbig desert wasteland and it didn't matter. But it has mattered. The DOE \nhas done a terribly bad job. They have botched what has taken place out \nthere. The scientific community basically recognizes now it is a very \nbad idea to try to bury nuclear waste in Nevada.\n\n  One reason for that is not only is the science bad, but since 9/11, \nthink of trying to haul 70,000 tons of the most dangerous substance \nknown to man across our highways, our railways, past schools, homes, \nand businesses. This would be a field day for terrorists. Seventy \nthousand tons of the most dangerous substance known to man--plutonium--\nhauled from more than 100 nuclear generating facilities across this \ncountry, some more than 3,000 miles to Nevada. It hasn't happened and \nit will never happen. It will never happen.\n  So I rise today because some of my colleagues have introduced \nlegislation to salvage this dying project, a project that threatens the \nhealth and safety of Americans everywhere. The proposed Yucca Mountain \nnuclear waste dump is not a solution for our nuclear waste problems. \nThe science behind Yucca is corrupted with politics, and it doesn't \ntake into consideration the problem with the transportation of this \npoison.\n  The administration and the sponsors of this bill know that Yucca is a \nflawed and dangerous project and that it cannot move forward without \npassing legislation designed to circumvent existing laws. Many of the \nlaws are environmental laws. If Yucca was truly scientifically sound \nand safe, this administration would not need to gut laws that protect \nour environment, public health, transportation, and security. This \nlegislation exempts the Department of Energy from longstanding Federal \nlaws designed to make Americans safer. This is unacceptable to the \nSenate. It is unacceptable to our country. It is unacceptable to the \nSenate.\n  Senator Ensign and I have worked together on this project for many \nyears. That is why we introduced the Federal Accountability for Nuclear \nWaste Storage Act earlier this year. Under our proposal, the Department \nof Energy will take ownership of nuclear waste and store it safely at \nnuclear power plants where it is produced, as is happening as we speak. \nCalvert Hills, a short distance from here, is a nuclear generating \nfacility, and they store nuclear waste as Senator Ensign and I say they \nshould store it.\n  So I challenge all my colleagues who have concerns about this to sit \ndown with Senator Ensign or with me or with both of us, as many have \nalready done, to begin discussing a scientifically sound solution to \nour nuclear waste problems. Let's take the focus away from this dead-\nend project and find real solutions for our energy future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Hawaii \nwho has an amendment which I hope we will be able to consider and \naccept. I have talked briefly to the Senator from Arizona and others. I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator's amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1186 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself, Mr. Reid, \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. \n     Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 1186 to amendment \n     No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1186\n\n(Purpose: To exempt children of certain Filipino World War II veterans \n           from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXEMPTION FROM IMMIGRANT VISA LIMIT.\n\n       Section 201(b)(1) (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(1)) is amended by \n     inserting after subparagraph (G), as added by section 503 of \n     this Act, the following:\n       ``(H) Aliens who are eligible for a visa under paragraph \n     (1) or (3) of section 203(a) and who have a parent who was \n     naturalized pursuant to section 405 of the Immigration Act of \n     1990 (8 U.S.C. 1440 note).''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, my amendment seeks to address and resolve \nan immigration issue that, while rooted in a set of historical \ncircumstances more than seven decades old, remains unresolved to this \nday. I am happy to say I am joined by Senator Reid, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Boxer, Senator Murray, and Senator Cantwell. It \nis an issue of great concern to all American veterans and citizens with \nan interest in justice and fairness.\n  In 1941, on the basis of 1934 legislation enacted prior to Philippine \nindependence, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive order \nthrough which the President invoked his authority to:\n\n       Call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States all of the organized military forces of the \n     Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\n  This order drafted more than 200,000 Filipino citizens into the U.S. \nmilitary, and under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, Filipino \nsoldiers fought alongside American soldiers in the defense of our \ncountry.\n  The enactment of the First Supplemental Surplus Appropriations \nRescission Act of 1946 included a rider that conditioned an \nappropriation of $200 million on a provision that deemed that service \nin the Commonwealth Army should not be considered service in the Armed \nForces of the United States. The individuals impacted were those \nmembers of the organized military forces of the Commonwealth of\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\nthe Philippines called into the service of the U.S. Armed Forces in the \nFar East by President Roosevelt's 1941 Executive order.\n  The enactment of the Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriations \nRescissions Act included language that deemed that service in the New \nPhilippines Scouts had not been service in the U.S. military. The \nindividuals impacted were those Filipinos who had served with the U.S. \nArmed Forces from October 6, 1945 to June 30, 1947.\n  Of the 200,000 Filipinos who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during \nWorld War II, either as members of the Commonwealth's Army or New \nPhilippines Scouts, only 20,000 survive today--13,000 in the \nPhilippines and 7,000 in the United States.\n  In 1990, the World War II service of Filipino veterans was finally \nrecognized by the U.S. Government through the enactment of the \nImmigration Act of 1990, which offered Filipino veterans the \nopportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. There are currently 7,000 \nnaturalized Filipino World War II veterans residing in the United \nStates. The opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship was not extended to \nthe veterans' sons and daughters, approximately 20,000 of whom have \nbeen waiting for their visas for years.\n  While the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 raises \nthe worldwide ceiling for family-based visas to 567,000 per year until \nthe backlog in the family preference visa categories is eliminated, the \nfact remains that many of the naturalized Filipino World War II \nveterans residing in the United States are in their eighties and \nnineties. My amendment stresses the need to expedite the issuance of \nvisas to these veterans' children.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for \noffering this amendment. He offered this amendment in the last \nimmigration bill. We accepted it at that time. I am confident that will \nbe the case on this time, but given the hour of the evening, we are \nunable to get this cleared.\n  Basically, as he has expressed so well, he is talking about the \nimmediate family members of those who served with American forces in \nWorld War II. Under the broad scope of the underlying legislation, they \nwould be included to be able to come to the United States. Under the \nbill, it would take an 8-year period. What the Senator from Hawaii is \nsaying is these are older men and women who would otherwise be able to \ncome here. They are the brothers and sisters of those who fought with \nAmerican forces in World War II, and we want to move them up and have \nthem come more quickly, given the fact of their age. It is a very \ndecent thing to do. We would be entitled to do it under the underlying \nframework of the bill. It doesn't change the underlying framework of \nthe bill.\n  It is a humanitarian gesture. It is a noble gesture. It is typical of \nthe Senator from Hawaii to be thoughtful about this, always being \nconcerned not only about individuals but members of the Armed Forces. \nHe continues to be a champion on the Veterans' Committee. I speak for \nthe veterans of my State as well as in this case the veterans of World \nWar II for their immediate family, and I am very hopeful we can get \nthis cleared at an early time tomorrow. I wish to commend him for this \namendment. He had indicated to us early on that this was a matter of \nhigh importance to him, and it is, I think, and should be a high \npriority here.\n  So we would ask the Senator if we may move along, and I will try to \nget the clearance for that amendment on tomorrow, and we will notify \nhim when that happens. We thank him again for bringing this to the \nattention of the Senate and for being thoughtful about these \nextraordinary family members of those who served so nobly, \ncourageously, and heroically in World War II. So I thank the Senator. \nHe can be assured of my support and help and assistance and hopefully \nwe will have good news for him tomorrow on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think we have probably reached about as far as we \nare going to go this evening. We are examining in some detail Senator \nColeman's amendment, and we would like to try and see if we can't work \nthat out through the evening. There is one aspect of it I would like to \nunderstand more completely in terms of whether it deals with emergency \nservices and others. So I think we probably, for all intents and \npurposes, have gone about as far as we can go tonight.\n  We have a number of amendments. We are very much aware that we have \nthe supplemental that will be here. We have been told so by the \nmajority leader. But we will have a good opportunity in the morning \nthrough noontime and into perhaps the early afternoon to continue our \nprogress. We have made good progress today. I thank all the Members for \ntheir cooperation. We have several amendments which are lined up. We \nwill probably start with Senator Dorgan's amendment tomorrow. We have a \nnumber of amendments, including Senator Cornyn's amendment which he \noffered this evening, and there will probably be side-by-side \nconsideration sometime in the late morning. There are a number of other \namendments that have been brought to our attention. We are in the \nprocess of prioritizing those and notifying their sponsors to make sure \nthey can be here in a timely way so we will have a productive time and \nas few quorum calls as possible.\n  As I mentioned, we will continue on the Cornyn amendment and the \nDorgan amendment. There is a Feingold amendment on the study of \nrefugees; a Sanders amendment, scholarship for Americans in connection \nwith the H-1B program. There are some of the family amendments which \nMembers have talked with us about and the McCain amendment as well. So \nwe have talked to most of these Members, and we will do as much as we \npossibly can to move these along.\n  They are all important matters. I think, as far as today is \nconcerned, we are very grateful for the cooperation we have had from \nall Members. I think we have made some important progress. We look \nforward to making further progress in the morning.\n  I see my colleague here who would like to address the Senate on other \nmatters. We look forward to further consideration of the underlying \nlegislation tomorrow.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I regret that I could not join last night's \ndebate on amendments to the comprehensive immigration reform bill. Had \nI been present, I would have supported the amendment offered by \nSenators Dorgan and Boxer, which was designed to eliminate the bill's \nguest worker provision. Though it was not adopted, I salute its \nprinciples and hope that they will find their way, once again, into our \nnational debate on immigration.\n  The immigration bill was set to allow 400,000 foreign guest workers \ninto America each year, eligible for two-year stays, alternating with a \nyear in their home countries. In their eloquent remarks last evening, \nSenators Dorgan and Boxer rightly identified this provision's \nshortcomings.\n  First, as Senator Boxer observed, ``We are setting up a system of \nexploitation.'' I am concerned that the immigration bill offers \ninsufficient protection to guest workers, leaving them open to \nvictimization by low wages, long hours, and dangerous conditions. It \nthreatens to import into America a permanent underclass, rootless in \nour communities and ignorant of our language, valued for nothing more \nthan its muscle power. A labor system like that is suited to an empire, \nnot to a republic of opportunity and not to the principles of \nimmigration we have long honored in America.\n  No one denies that much of America's economy depends on immigrant \nlabor. But if we want to do more than exploit that labor--if we want to \nsew it into our social contract, if we want to treat immigrants with \njustice and dignity--a path to citizenship is a necessity. That brings \nme to the guest worker provision's second shortcoming: It lacks such a \npath. If we are willing to offer the opportunity of citizenship even to \nthose who entered our country illegally, it is inconsistent to deny it \nto those who come with our sanction.\n  Third and finally, the guest worker provision harms American workers. \nThreatened by outsourcing and globalization, their expenses for \nhealthcare and education skyrocketing even as their incomes fail to \nkeep pace, American workers now face 400,000 competitors, each year, in \ntheir own country, willing and able to do their jobs for lower wages. \nLast night, Senator Dorgan told us a moving story of\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nfurniture-makers in Pennsylvania whose jobs were eliminated and shipped \nto China. As their plant shut down, each one of those craftsmen signed \nthe bottom of the last piece of furniture their company would make in \nAmerica. As we import wage pressures onto our own shores, we will be \nhearing hundreds of similar stories in the years to come. The guest \nworker provision threatens to eat away at our middle class.\n  It has the potential to harm guest workers and American workers \nalike. Who, then, does it benefit? I don't think I need to tell my \ncolleagues the answer. But unless we reform our standards for guest \nworkers, we will be putting the demand for cheap labor above the \ndignity of immigrants and Americans alike.\n  I voted to strip the guest worker provision from last year's \nimmigration bill; and I supported stripping it this year. And while the \namendment offered by Senators Dorgan and Boxer did not pass, I am \nheartened that we adopted Senator Bingaman's amendment to limit the \nprogram to 200,000 guest workers per year. And as we move forward in \nthis debate, I hope that we will also have chance to strengthen \nprotections for guest workers and reduce wage pressure on Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6539-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I am going to talk about an energy \nissue. I am sure people listening, and my colleagues, might think I am \ntalking about an energy issue because gasoline is at the highest price \nit has ever been in the history of the country. I assure you I would be \ngiving these remarks even if the price of gasoline was only $1 a \nbarrel, because it involves, in an overview, testimony that was given \nby oil company executives before the Judiciary Committee some time ago. \nWhat is being reported are policies of oil companies. I have become \naware of an article in the Wall Street Journal. So I am going to be \nreferring, during my remarks, to evidence I got from the Wall Street \nJournal, letters that I have sent to the CEOs of major oil companies, \nand testimony that was given before the Judiciary Committee of the \nSenate--I might say that it was sworn testimony--and what I consider to \nbe some inconsistencies. I will be referring to that testimony from the \nrecord.\n  I will be referring to the letters I have sent to the CEOs. As an \noverview, I am going to be pointing out inconsistencies between sworn \ntestimony and what oil company executives say are their company \npolicies regarding ethanol, and particularly the 85-percent ethanol \nthat we call E85; and then, of course, letters I sent to the oil \ncompanies, raising questions that were raised because of this article, \nto have the oil companies give me their story, in case this article was \nwrong.\n  Across the country, American families and businesses are suffering \nfrom the economic impact of rising gasoline prices. As many families \nbegin to plan their summer vacations, they are being forced to dig \ndeeper into their pockets to fill up the family car.\n  The rising cost of gasoline is a result of many factors. Global \ndemand for crude oil and refined products is way up constantly, as a \nresult, driving up the price. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCompanies--what the people of this country know as OPEC--has curtailed \nsome production. Refineries are offline for maintenance or have \nexperienced outages. As a result, these refineries are operating at 5 \nto 10 percent below normal.\n  Once again, refinery outages have, coincidentally, occurred just as \nthe summer driving demand kicks into gear, and this has led to an \naverage price of over $3.15 a gallon as a national average. In my State \nof Iowa, I think it is $3.33 today.\n  The impact of these increased prices is being felt across the country \nby working families, farmers, businesses, and industry. The increased \ncost for energy has the potential to jeopardize our economic security, \nour economic vitality.\n  Because we are dependent upon foreign countries for over 60 percent \nof our crude oil, our dependence on them is a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  In recent years, many Members of the Senate have touted the value of \nincreasing our domestic energy resources. I have been one of those--\nparticularly for ethanol and particularly for biodiesel. In Iowa, I am \nthe father of the wind energy tax credit. Iowa is the third leading \nState in the production of electricity from wind energy.\n  Increasing domestic resources, whether it is ethanol, biodiesel, \nwind, biomass, you name it--all of these are from alternative sources \nthat are good for our economy and particularly good for our national \nsecurity. Diversity of supply can go a long way toward reducing the \nimpact of price spikes and volatility. That is why I have been such an \nardent supporter of the development of these domestic renewable fuels. \nEach gallon of homegrown, renewable ethanol or biodiesel is 1 gallon of \nfuel that we are not importing from countries such as Iran, or \nVenezuela, which are very unpredictable--or Nigeria, where we get 10 \npercent of our oil, which might be unpredictable because of \nrevolutionaries there kidnapping American workers, such as they did 2 \nweeks ago, or German workers over the period of the last year. It is a \nvery nervous environment we are in.\n  The supply from the Saudi oil wells to our gas tank is maybe a 17-day \ninventory. So any little thing happening, according to the business \npages of the newspaper, causes the price to spike. So I have been an \nardent supporter of these domestic renewable fuels.\n  In the past few years, domestic ethanol production has grown \ntremendously. Right now, we are consuming about 5 billion gallons of \nethanol annually. With all of the new ethanol biorefineries under \nconstruction, we will be producing as much as 11 billion gallons \nannually by 2009.\n  Ethanol's contribution is a significant net increase to our Nation's \nfuel supply. But as the industry grows, it is imperative that higher \nethanol blends be available to consumers. When I say higher ethanol \nblends, I mean beyond the 10 percent mixture that we have right now. We \neven have cars right now that can burn up to 85 percent ethanol. That \nis why we refer to it as E85. That is what we are talking about, \nincreasing the 10 percent as cars are manufactured, to be able to \nconsume it without hurting the engine. That is where the automobile \ncompanies are headed. That is where the ethanol industry is headed to \nback it up. But the point I will make in a minute is that the \ndistribution for E85 is a problem, and it looks to me like big oil is a \nmajor part of that problem. That is what I am going to point out.\n  We are quickly approaching a time when ethanol will be produced in a \nquantity greater than that needed for the blend market as we continue \ndown the road that has been pioneered by Brazil--and that is the best \nexample--to use cars that will, in fact, burn 100 percent ethanol. For \nsure, we must continue on this path of reducing foreign oil dependence \nand greater renewable fuel use.\n\n  To do that, then, it is critical that we develop the infrastructure \nand the demand for E85, an alternative fuel comprised of 85 percent \nethanol, 15 percent gasoline.\n  Our domestic auto manufacturers are leading the effort to expand what \nwe call the flex-fuel--meaning flexible fuel--market. Our domestic \nmanufacturers of automobiles are doing this. Our domestic automakers \nhave produced approximately 6 million flex-fuel vehicles over the past \ndecade. In fact, you might be driving a flex-fuel vehicle and don't \neven know it, burning 100 percent gasoline, or the 90/10 percent \nmixture of gasoline and ethanol. Look at your book. If you can burn \nE85, do it--if you can buy it. I am going to point out how that is a \nproblem--the distribution--and the oil companies' involvement in it.\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\n  In a visit to the White House in March of this year, the chief \nexecutive officers of Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler \ncommitted to double their production of E85 vehicles by 2010. By 2012, \nthey committed to have 50 percent of their production of vehicles E85 \ncapable. Listen, there is a big price difference here--$2.85 for E85 a \ngallon versus $3.33 for gasoline today. So when they get 50 percent of \ntheir production E85 capable, this is then, as they say, a highly \nachievable goal with very little impact on consumers because you can \nbuy these cars for as little as $200 in additional cost. So you can \nburn the E85 as well as 100 percent gasoline. If you would rather pay \nmore and buy the 100 percent gasoline, you can still burn it in the \nsame car. This is very inexpensive for the money that can be saved.\n  However, a very important component of the alternative fuel market is \nensuring that the fuel is available to the consumers. The ethanol \nindustry is working hard to increase production of ethanol, and they \nare on target to have 11 billion gallons in a little while.\n  The automobile makers are ramping up production of their vehicles. So \neverybody seems to be doing their part.\n  But where is the oil industry? I thought a year ago, when they \nappeared before the Judiciary Committee, they were on the road to \ncooperating with the distribution of E85, but I read in the Wall Street \nJournal quite a different story. So I think I can legitimately ask, if \nwe got the car manufacturers producing E85 cars that can burn that and \nthe ethanol industry producing it, where is the oil industry? Because \nthat is the distribution of this. There is not an independent \ndistribution of E85. You have to go to your filling station, where you \ncan buy 100 percent gasoline and have the alternative of filling up \nwith E85.\n  What have they done to ensure a robust growth of the alternative \nfuels market? Well, Mr. President, it appears they have been less than \nhelpful. I have referred to this article in the Wall Street Journal. It \ndetails many of the obstacles the major oil companies use to block \nservice stations from selling E85.\n  Now, imagine my surprise when I read this story, because just over a \nyear ago, I questioned many of the CEOs of the major oil companies on \nthis very issue when they appeared before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee about whether there was any sort of violation of antitrust \nlaws, any sort of collusion. There was a whole range of questions that \nwere being asked by the members of the Judiciary Committee, wanting to \nknow if the marketplace is working, because if the marketplace is \nworking, you cannot have any complaints. But if it is not working, we \nhave to do something about it. The CEOs of ExxonMobil, British \nPetroleum, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and others testified before this \nSenate Judiciary Committee under oath. The bottom part of this picture \ndepicts the CEOs I named from ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron, \nConocoPhillips--I will not name them all, the major oil companies \ntestifying, taking their oath, as they swore to tell the truth in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I remind my colleagues of another very famous group of CEOs on the \ntop of this picture back in 1994 taking the oath to tell the truth to a \nHouse committee. Those are the CEOs of the major tobacco companies. At \nthat hearing, our great colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, who was \nthen a Member of the other body, went down the line of these CEOs and \nasked each of them whether they believed nicotine or cigarettes were \naddictive. We all know how that hearing went, with each of the CEOs \ntestifying that nicotine was not addictive when, in fact, it is. There \nis the photo of those CEOs who got themselves in trouble a little bit \nlater when there was plenty of evidence brought out that they knew what \nthe situation was with tobacco being addictive and what they did to \nmake it addictive. Of course, the second photo is from March 2006, \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, of the chairmen of the major oil \ncompanies taking an oath to tell the truth as well.\n  Much like my colleague, Senator Wyden, when he was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives asking the tobacco company executives about \ntobacco being addictive, I questioned the oil company executives, in \nthe bottom picture, at the time of this hearing, about their policies \nregarding alternative fuels, meaning mostly ethanol. I was leading up \nto E85. I asked the CEOs quite clearly if they would commit to allowing \nindependent owners of branded stations to sell E85 or biodiesel, B20, \nwhich is a 20-percent mixture with petroleum diesel. Remember, as I was \nasking them questions, these folks were under oath.\n  I also asked them if they would allow those station owners to \npurchase the alternative fuel from any outlet because if they didn't \nsell it and oil companies are not selling ethanol but people who \nproduce it can, will they let their stations buy it from an independent \noutlet. Each of these CEOs, when I asked that question, testified that \nthey were perfectly willing to allow the sale of alternative fuels at \ntheir stations. ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson stated:\n\n       We've denied no request from any of our dealers who have \n     asked for permission to sell unbranded E85. We've granted \n     every request by our dealers who wanted to install separate \n     pump facilities under their canopy for E85.\n\n  Mr. David O'Reilly, the CEO of Chevron--I am referring to people who \ntook an oath to tell the truth, and we can see their picture here--Mr. \nDavid O'Reilly, CEO of Chevron, responded, similarly stating that E85 \nwas already available at Chevron stations and that it was available \nunder the canopy. He offered with pride that Chevron was probably the \nlargest seller of ethanol. According to the CEO for British Petroleum, \nall of BP's 8,900 independently owned stations are free to deploy E85. \nFinally, the CEO of ConocoPhillips simply associated himself with the \ncomments of the other witnesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the relevant pages of the \nMarch 14, 2006, Senate Judiciary Committee transcript be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Consolidation in the Oil and Gas Industry: Raising Prices?\n\n       Senator Grassley. I want to ask a question of any of you, \n     and this is in regard to alternative energy. And most of you \n     know I am a big promoter of ethanol. I have heard stores \n     after stories about independent owners of franchised or \n     branded stations who are prohibited from selling alternative \n     or renewable fuels, so I would like to hear from some of \n     you--will you commit to allowing independent owners of \n     branded stations who choose to sell E-85 or B-20 to do so? \n     Would you allow independent owners to produce alternative \n     fuels from any outlet so that they can puchase a fuel at the \n     lowest cost?\n       Mr. Tillerson. Senator, we have denied no request from any \n     of our dealers who have asked for permission to sell \n     unbranded E-85 at their sites. We have asked that they make \n     it clear that it is not an ExxonMobil product, that we do not \n     manufacture it, therefore we can't stand behind the quality. \n     But we have granted every request by our dealers who wanted \n     to install separate pump facilities under their canopy for E-\n     85.\n       Senator Grassley. I would like to hear from other \n     companies, maybe not all of you, but at least----\n       Mr. O'Reilly. Senator, I would be willing to say that we \n     have already asked for. It is already out there. It can be \n     under the canopy. Same quality issue. I would also add that \n     we are probably the largest, certainly one of the largest \n     sellers of ethanol today already.\n       Mr. Hofmeister. Senator, we are in the same position as has \n     been described. You may be aware that we are currently \n     launching a pilot in Chicago, in conjunction with one of the \n     automobile manufacturers, to test E-85. And I think that is \n     an important point. E-85 needs to be tested in the \n     marketplace before we go full-scale into E-85 supply. The \n     reason for that is we don't fully understand or know the \n     implications of E-85, and as a major brand, of course, the \n     provider of that fuel will often be considered liable for \n     such fuel. And until we understand it, I think we need to \n     really work at what are the conditions under which this \n     would be sold.\n       Senator Grassley. Most of the people I hear complaints from \n     will assume liability. You don't have to have that liability.\n       Other companies? Are you willing to cooperate with E-85?\n       Mr. Klesse. Senator, I would agree with what has been said.\n       Mr. Pillari. Senator, of our 9,300 stations, 8,900 of them \n     are independently operated and they are free to deploy E-85. \n     We are also running a test program on E-85 in California to \n     test its efficacy and its air pollution impacts, because \n     California restricts how much ethanol can be used in gasoline \n     today.\n       Mr. Mulva. Senator, we have the same comments that you have \n     heard from the responses from the others already.\n       Senator Grassley. My time is up, but this business of you \n     having to test something\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\n     when you have the president of--I think it is the CEO of Ford \n     on television all the time saying how they are promoting \n     their E-85 cars, it seems to me if you have the president of \n     a major corporation like that, that is all the test you need. \n     Leave it up to the consumer to make the decision.\n       Chairman Specter. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So the CEOs of the major integrated oil companies \ntestified under oath before the Judiciary Committee stating their \nwillingness to allow independent stations to offer E85. But the Wall \nStreet Journal told a much different story. It highlighted tactics used \nby the big oil companies to block alternative fuel. The obstacles \nincluded contracts restricting the purchase by the station owners of \nalternative fuel. They also required the installation of completely \nseparate pumps, sometimes far away from the main canopy, and in many \ncases station owners are prohibited from advertising the product or \neven posting the price of that fuel, E85. British Petroleum goes so far \nas to prohibit station owners from placing signs that include E85 on \ngasoline dispensers, perimeter signs, or light poles. These tactics \ndon't sound consistent with a company--meaning British Petroleum--with \na marketing slogan ``beyond petroleum.''\n  The big oil companies on many occasions cited ``customer confusion'' \nas the rationale for their policies or that they don't want to \n``deceive their customers'' about the product. I happen to believe that \nit has more to do with limiting the availability of a product that they \ndon't control and the sale of alternative fuels much more than it is \ncustomer deception.\n  After I read the Wall Street Journal article, which is so contrary to \nwhat I remember them telling me 1 year, 13 months before, I wrote \nletters to the CEOs who testified. Their picture is here. I pointed out \nthe contradictions in their testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the allegations that were made in the Wall Street \nJournal.\n  I wish to refer to these letters so my colleagues will know what I \nasked them based on this article.\n  I have a letter to Mr. Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil. I am not going to \nread the whole letter, but I am going to read what I am after here:\n\n       In fact, Exxon Mobil's standard contract bars Exxon \n     stations from buying fuel from anybody but Exxon--a fact you \n     chose not to disclose to our committee. It also appears that \n     even in cases where exceptions are made, Exxon requires those \n     station owners to install entirely separate dispensers. . . .\n\n  I refer to a letter I sent to Mr. Robert Malone, chairman of British \nPetroleum:\n\n       The Wall Street Journal article indicated that BP prohibits \n     branded stations from including E-85 on gasoline dispensers, \n     perimeter signs or light poles. Another obstacle employed by \n     your company is the prohibition of using pay-at-the-pump \n     credit card machines for E-85 purchases. . . .\n\n  That seems to be very contrary to what they told us, that they were \nallowing the sale of E85 at their stations.\n  Mr. James J. Mulva, ConocoPhillips:\n\n       The Wall Street Journal article indicated that Conoco \n     Phillips does not allow E-85 sales on primary islands under \n     the canopy. This policy directly contradicts the statement to \n     which you associated yourself during the March 2006 hearings.\n\n  And lastly, Mr. David J. O'Reilly, Chevron:\n\n        . . . Chevron's agreement with franchisees discourages \n     selling E-85 under the main canopy and includes policies that \n     are claimed to prevent franchisees from deceiving customers \n     as to the source of the product. The Wall Street Journal \n     article indicated that Chevron recommends that E-85 pumps be \n     outside the canopy and that Chevron prohibits branded \n     stations from including E85 on signs listing fuel prices.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters to ExxonMobil, British \nPetroleum, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2007.\n     Mr. Rex Tillerson,\n     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Exxon Mobil \n         Corporation, Irving, Texas.\n       Dear Mr. Tillerson: For many years, I've been supporting \n     and promoting ethanol and biodiesel fuels as a way to reduce \n     our dependence on foreign and traditional energy sources, and \n     increase our national security and rural economies. Our \n     nation is now consuming five billion gallons of ethanol \n     annually, and is estimated to produce as much as eleven \n     billion gallons annually by 2009.\n       In an effort to further reduce America's oil dependence, \n     it's imperative that higher ethanol blends be available to \n     consumers. While our domestic auto manufacturers are leading \n     the effort to expand the flex-fuel vehicle market, more must \n     be done to expand the fuel's availability. Of the 170,000 \n     stations nationwide, only 1,100 currently offer E-85. This \n     represents less than one percent of fuel stations.\n       As you may recall, on March 14, 2006, you testified under \n     oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, I \n     asked if you would commit to allow independent owners of \n     branded stations to sell E-85 or B-20, and if you would allow \n     those station owners to purchase the alternative fuel from \n     any outlet. For your benefit, I've enclosed a copy of the \n     hearing transcript.\n       In your response to me, you stated that Exxon Mobil has \n     denied no request from any dealers who sought permission to \n     sell unbranded E-85. In addition, you stated that every \n     request to sell the fuel under the canopy has been granted. \n     Your testimony before the committee clearly stated that Exxon \n     Mobil was perfectly willing to allow the sale of alternative \n     fuels at Exxon Mobil stations. However, a recent Wall Street \n     Journal article, which I've enclosed, detailed many of the \n     obstacles your company and other major integrated oil \n     companies apparently use to effectively prohibit or strongly \n     discourage the sale of alternative fuels.\n       In fact, Exxon Mobil's standard contract bars Exxon \n     stations from buying fuel from anybody but Exxon--a fact you \n     chose not to disclose to the committee. It also appears that \n     even in cases where exceptions are made, Exxon requires those \n     station owners to install entirely separate dispensers, for \n     the purpose of ``minimizing customer confusion,'' according \n     to an Exxon spokeswoman. It seems this policy has much more \n     to do with limiting the availability of alternative fuels \n     than customer confusion.\n       I would appreciate hearing your explanation as to why you \n     led me, the Judiciary Committee and the American people to \n     believe that Exxon Mobil supports making E-85 available to \n     your customers, yet your company is described by the Wall \n     Street Journal as a key obstacle to expanding the \n     availability of alternative fuels. I would appreciate knowing \n     exactly what Exxon Mobil is doing to grow the E-85 market, \n     and why you believe your tactics aren't simply obstacles, as \n     claimed by the Wall Street Journal.\n       I look forward to receiving your response not later than \n     May 25, 2007.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E.

At the hearing, I asked Mr. Pillari if BP would \n     commit to allow independent owners of branded stations to \n     sell E-85 or B-20, and if BP would allow those station owners \n     to purchase the alternative fuel from any outlet. For your \n     benefit, I've enclosed a copy of the hearing transcript.\n       In his response to me, Mr. Pillari stated that British \n     Petroleum was already allowing independently owned stations \n     to freely deploy E-85.

Grassley,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in my letters, I ask for an explanation \nof their policies that are seemingly used to block alternative fuels. I \nhope to get a thorough explanation as to why these CEOs led me, led the \nSenate Judiciary Committee members, and the American people to believe \nthey support making E85 available to their customers when there is \nplenty of evidence that they do not practice what they preach, that \nthey do not practice what they told our committee under oath.\n  What I am afraid of is that these companies are not serious about \nexpanding the availability and use of alternative fuels. I say this for \na couple reasons. First, if one takes a close look at the E85 stations \nin my home State of Iowa, it is rather telling. I have a map. What \nmight look like missiles are ears of corn because ethanol comes from \ncorn. We have 65 stations in Iowa selling E85 today. Only one of those \n65 stations selling is a major branded station, and it is down where \nthe yellow arrow is--only one of 65.\n  A second reason I am skeptical of big oil's claims comes straight \nfrom the words of their chief lobbyist, the head of the American \nPetroleum Institute. Red Cavaney recently stated that there is not \nenough ethanol or flex-fuel vehicles available to economically justify \nwidespread installation of E85 pumps.\n  For argument's sake, let's assume that is an accurate statement. Why, \nthen, would big oil undertake such an effort to block independent \nstation owners from deciding for themselves whether to invest in the \ninfrastructure? Let the station owners make that decision. Let's not \nhave, as this article in the Wall Street Journal implies, all these \nobstacles, particularly since we were led to believe when they \ntestified under oath before our committee that they were fully \ncooperating with allowing the installation of E85 pumps. If big oil \nsees no competitive threat from E85 pumps, why not just let the \nindependent-minded station owner decide if there is a demand for the \nproduct? The market will make that decision. Why erect all these \ndiscriminatory tactics if you believe there is no threat from \nalternative fuels?\n  When I get answers to my letters--and I am going to wait until I get \nall the answers back before I draw any conclusions--maybe they will say \nthe Wall Street Journal article is wrong. I hope that is what I find \nout and that they did not mislead us under oath when they testified \nbefore the committee.\n  All I can say is, as I conclude, if our Nation is serious about \nreducing our dependency on fossil fuels and imported crude oil, more \nmust be done to expand the infrastructure for ethanol and particularly \nE85. America's farmers are demonstrating daily their desire to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil by producing more corn in the United \nStates. More acres of corn were planted this year than any time since \n1944. And our ethanol industry has invested to make sure we can be less \ndependent on imported crude oil.\n  So I look forward to hearing from big oil companies on what they are \ndoing to help. I hope I get answers that are contrary to what the Wall \nStreet Journal said.\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6543-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MICHAEL BAROODY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the White House has just \nannounced the President has withdrawn the nomination of Michael Baroody \nto be the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I think \nthis is a wise move on the part of the White House because of the \nperceived conflict of interest of Mr. Baroody--an employee of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers being nominated to be the \nChairman of the very regulatory agency that governs the regulation and \nthe safety of the very products of the industry from which he comes.\n  It would be like, in my former life as the elected insurance \ncommissioner, if in a State where the Governor appointed the insurance \ncommissioner, a regulator, the Governor would pick an executive of an \ninsurance company to regulate the very industry he came from as the \ninsurance commissioner.\n  By the way, that happens with tremendous frequency in the 50 States, \nthat they appoint the insurance commissioner, and they are usually \nthere for less than a year. Then the revolving door turns again, and \nthey go right back into the very industry from which they came and of \nwhich they had just been the regulator.\n  Putting someone from the National Association of Manufacturers at the \nhead of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is a similar kind of \npotential conflict of interest.\n  I will give you another example. My former colleague and friend in \nthe House, Billy Tauzin--a distinguished public servant, Congressman \nformerly from Louisiana--now is the head of Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America. This would be like the White House appointing \nBilly Tauzin--the very head of an association in the industry--to \nregulate that industry by making him head of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the regulatory body that would regulate the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  Of course, I do not think the White House would even think of doing \nsuch a thing.\n  Well, a similar kind of conflict of interest arose. But a more \nserious note even arose than the potential conflict when it became \napparent there was a severance package that had been created for Mr. \nBaroody while he was still in the employ of the National Association of \nManufacturers that was for $150,000; and subsequently we learned of an \nadditional amendment to that severance package, after it was announced \nhe was nominated to be Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.\n  Mr. Baroody came in and we had a discussion about this issue. He had \nhis own explanation. I do not take anything from that explanation. So, \nnaturally, the next request that I made was that I think the Commerce \nCommittee ought to see the documents of the $150,000 severance package \nand its amendments, its subsequent modification.\n  Mr. Baroody said he would consider that request. Of course, the clock \nwas ticking because there was going to be a hearing in front of the \nCommerce Committee tomorrow on his nomination. But, in the meantime, \nthe White House has just announced it is having the President withdraw \nthe nomination.\n  I will conclude by saying we have a saying down in the South in \nregard to avoiding a conflict of interest. It is like putting a fox in \ncharge of the hen house, the very hen house with the hens you want to \nprotect. It is an apparent conflict of interest. I think the White \nHouse was well served to withdraw the nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6543-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to congratulate my \nfriend Senator Ted Stevens on becoming the longest serving United \nStates Republican Senator in the history of the Senate. He has had a \nlong and distinguished career in public service representing the State \nof Alaska in the Senate for over 39 years, casting over 14,000 votes, \nand never receiving less than 67 percent of the vote in any election.\n  My recollections of Ted Stevens, during the 27 years we have served \ntogether in the Senate, focus on his chairmanship of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, where he has done so much to promote our \nnational security. For example, his management of the $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 earned him high \npraise by President Bush during the signing ceremony.\n  Ted's temper is generally misunderstood except by those who know him \nwell. He doesn't lose it, but he does use it--and very effectively. \nHowever, it is true that on occasion he makes Vesuvius look mild. I \nrecollect one all-night session during Senator Howard Baker's tenure as \nmajority leader when Ted expressed himself in an unusually emphatic \nway. As I recall it, the debate arose over Senator Proxmire's comments \nabout submitting vouchers for travel expense in Wisconsin on his \ncontention that Washington, DC, was his home base. That prompted a \nreaction from Ted, who was aghast at the thought of Washington, DC, \nbeing any Senator's home when he had the majestic Alaska to claim as \nhis home.\n  Some thought that the middle-of-the-night incident might have cost \nhim a couple votes, which could have been decisive, on his election for \nmajority leader in November of 1984, when the count was 28 to 25 in \nfavor of Senator Dole, but it was reliably reported that his loss \noccurred because of the significant slippage in votes caused by the \ntobacco interests.\n  In any event, Senator Stevens has had a profound effect on the Senate \nand the Nation in his roles as chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, and as \nPresident pro tempore.\n  It is also important to note that Senator Stevens' career in public \nservice began even before he arrived in the U.S. Senate. He is a \ndistinguished veteran of the U.S. Army Air Corps, having flown support \nmissions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force during World War \nII, for which he was awarded numerous medals, including the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. He had a strong academic career, graduating \nfrom UCLA and Harvard Law School. In the 1950s, he practiced law in \nAlaska before moving to Washington, DC, to work in President \nEisenhower's administration. He subsequently returned to Alaska and was \nelected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964 and soon became \nmajority leader. Finally, in 1968, he was appointed U.S. Senator from \nAlaska and has represented his State ever since with pride and \ndevotion.\n  His recognition as ``Alaskan of the Century'' is a real tribute, and \nI have no doubt that when the passage of time calls for the designation \nof ``Alaskan of the Millennium,'' it will be Senator Ted Stevens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6543-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6543-S6544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Private First Class Jeffrey Avery\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to remember a Coloradan lost to us \nin Iraq.\n  Army PFC Jeffrey A. Avery was just 19 years old when he was lost to \nthis life late last month in Muqudadiyah, Iraq.\n  Jeffrey attended Coronado High School in 2005 and went on to attend \nPikes Peak Community College, where he was studying criminal justice \nwith the hopes of becoming a police officer. He enjoyed the outdoors \nand would spend his summers in California with his grandparents.\n  But instead of these pursuits, Jeffrey decided to answer his Nation's \ncall.\n  In Iraq, Specialist Avery served as a military police officer, \ntraining for his future. At the time he was killed, he was manning a \ncheckpoint, helping to keep others safe from harm.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said, ``Every area of trouble gives \nout a ray of hope, and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing \nis certain or unchangeable.''\n  Private First Class Avery embodied this hope with his service to our \nNation. He chose to put himself into the area of trouble and to assume \nthe responsibility of hope for millions of Iraqis and Americans.\n  He will be missed by all those around him, and he and his family will \nremain in our prayers.\n\n\n                     Corporal Christopher Degiovine\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to remember a fallen Marine \nCpl\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\nChristopher Degiovine of Lone Tree, CO. Corporal Degiovine lost his \nlife late last month in Fallujah, Iraq. He was just 25 years old.\n  Christopher Degiovine was a native of Essex Junction, VT, and had \nmade Colorado his home for only a few months. He majored in criminal \njustice at Champlain College, where he graduated in 2005, and was \nlooking to pursue a career in law enforcement.\n  After moving to Colorado, Christopher Degiovine answered his Nation's \ncall and joined the Marine Corps in December 2005. He was excited about \nthe opportunity, and proud to be serving his Nation. He was promoted to \ncorporal a year later, and had only just been sent to Iraq when he was \nkilled.\n  Christopher Degoivine's life was one of extraordinary promise cut far \ntoo short. His patriotism compelled him to a higher calling, and for \nthat every American is humbled and grateful. His service to each of us \nand his sacrifice on behalf of all us is a debt we can never repay.\n  Matthew 5:9 reminds us: ``Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall \nbe called the children of God.'' Corporal Degiovine was one of these \nvery peacemakers, and his place will always be reserved in our hearts. \nHe and his family will remain in my prayers, and those of the Nation, \ntonight and always.\n\n\n                         Corporal Wade Oglesby\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the memory of Army Cpl Wade \nOglesby, of Grand Junction, CO. Corporal Oglesby was killed late last \nmonth in Taji, Iraq. He was only 28 years old and was looking forward \nto returning home and joining the Mesa County Sheriff's Office.\n  Wade Oglesby's life was not an easy one. He was a young man who had \nto grow up far too soon. His father left his family when Wade was just \n5, and his mother relocated the family from Denver to the city Grand \nJunction, on the other side of the Great Divide.\n  As a sophomore in high school, Wade Oglesby's mother Linda fell \nterribly ill, and Wade left high school to care for his dying mother. \nAfter she passed on, Wade stayed with his younger sister Samantha until \nshe became an adult.\n  August 2004 was a turning point for Corporal Oglesby he found his \n``true calling in life,'' as his family said. He joined the Army and \nfound a place that he belonged. Wade's brother Richard observed that \nWade ``was a soldier long before joining the Army.''\n  In the Army, Corporal Oglesby found his mission. He was proud of his \nservice to his Nation. It makes perfect sense that serving his country \nfit so naturally to Corporal Oglesby's character: he had spent his \nwhole life in selfless service to those around him whom he loved. \nHelping and protecting others came naturally to him, and the Army \ncarried him on his way.\n  One newspaper in my home State reported that Wade Ogelsby's motto in \nlife was ``float on.'' Even as his life became heavy as a young man, \nCorporal Oglesby found a way to ``float on'' and to continue moving \nforward.\n  To his sister Samantha and brother Richard: As you mourn the loss of \nyour brother, know that our Nation mourns with you the loss of another \nexemplary soldier and American. He will live on our memories for his \ncourage, service, and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6544-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       specialist david w. behrle\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

While we try to prepare ourselves for the loss of \nlife that comes with war, it is impossible to prepare for the very \npersonal experience of losing a young life so close to home.

Mr. President, words and numbers are often used on this \nfloor to describe the ongoing war in Iraq. In recent weeks, we have \nfound ourselves debating the policy decisions that created the current \nclimate in Iraq, the current strategy in Baghdad, and the policy shifts \nthat need to occur to bring our men and women home. We frequently cite \nthe fast-rising numbers of military fatalities and injuries and the \ngrowing number of innocent civilian deaths.\n  A central element of this picture and of this discussion should \nalways be the sacrifices and the suffering of the families at home. \nVermont, small State that we are, bears the burden of the highest \nfatality rate in the country, with more deaths per capita in Iraq than \nany other State. These losses have left dozens of families searching \nfor comfort as they mourn their loved ones.\n  But in the darkest and saddest of times, a new Vermont family has \nemerged, brought together by the efforts of students at Norwich \nUniversity, the Nation's oldest military college, which calls \nNorthfield, VT, its home. ``Vermont Fallen,'' developed and produced by \nstudents at Norwich for a media course, profiles the journeys of \nfamilies from across our State as they grieve the loss of their sons, \nfathers, husbands, and friends. Many of these families, brought \ntogether by community screenings of the documentary, now are able to \nturn to each other for comfort.\n  With this remarkable project, these students from Norwich \nUniversity--many of whom have friends, family, and colleagues serving \non the front lines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--have given a \ngreat gift to these families and to us all. They have honored in this \nspecial way those from Vermont who have fallen and they have offered a \nglimpse into the searing and highly personal grief and mourning that \nhave touched thousands of American families and scores of American \ncommunities, across Vermont and across the country. They have produced \na tribute that speaks directly to each human heart.\n  NBC's ``Today'' recently aired a segment about ``Vermont Fallen.'' I \nask unanimous consent that the transcript be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                        NBC's Today--May 9, 2007\n\nClass project by students at Norwich University pays tribute to Vermont \n                 soldiers lost in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n       ANCHORS: DAVID GREGORY\n       REPORTERS: DAWN FRATANGELO\n       DAVID GREGORY, co-host:\n       Vermont has lost more soldiers per capita in Iraq than any \n     other state.

I don't know if I'll ever think rationally again.\n       FRATANGELO: There was something more here than just the raw \n     pain and tears you see on screen. It's about those behind the \n     camera, and the incredible bond that it formed.\n       So as young filmmakers, were you intimidated at all about \n     approaching these families?\n       Ms. AMANDA BENSON: Yes.

They're \n     students--college students at Norwich University in \n     Northfield, Vermont, the nation's oldest military school. The \n     film was their media project. But Amanda knew from that first \n     interview, this was more than just school work.\n       Ms. BENSON: So walking into it, I really didn't think too \n     much of it. But after about\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\n     maybe 25 minutes, you know, sitting right across from Marion, \n     she started crying, and then I would start crying.\n       Unidentified Woman #3: (From ``Vermont Fallen'') My last \n     words to him . . .\n       Ms. BENSON: No way did we think we'd be so emotionally \n     involved in the interview.\n       FRATANGELO: Word spread, and eventually the students, \n     guided by Professor Bill Estill . . .\n       Professor BILL ESTILL: Go frame by frame.\n       FRATANGELO: . . . had 50 hours worth of interviews with \n     families all over Vermont.

And he goes `What?' `I have to ask you for your \n     forgiveness.' And he said `Why?' And I said, `Because I \n     wasn't the mother I wanted to be.' All he did was hug me, and \n     he told me he loved me.\n       FRATANGELO: Patty Holmes, and her husband Scott would have \n     never guessed that simply taking part in this project would \n     help them heal.\n       Ms. HOLMES: I just felt that nobody knew how I felt, and \n     nobody could possibly understand. And meeting these other \n     families, they understand.\n       FRATANGELO: Because of a documentary, all the families get \n     together now for dinners, a trip to Washington, mostly for \n     support.\n       It's as though this--being involved in this gave you \n     permission to sort of let . . .\n       Mr. SCOTT HOLMES: Let your heart out. Let your heart--let \n     the world know how you feel.\n       FRATANGELO: And people are listening. The film is being \n     shown at the same high schools the fallen servicemen \n     attended.\n       While the students at Norwich were documenting the pain of \n     the Vermont families, they themselves were not immune to it. \n     Four of their classmates have been killed in Iraq.\n       Ms. BENSON: Thank you to both--for I guess, is the second \n     family for some of us.\n       FRATANGELO: All this talk about loss has made the young \n     filmmakers reflect on their own lives.

Mr. President, I wish to comment on the visit of Chinese \nVice Premier Wu Yi to Washington. This visit comes at an important time \nfor the U.S.-China relationship and highlights the enormous stakes \ninvolved.\n  As I have said in the past, China's rise offers great opportunity but \nalso poses serious challenges. It is critical the U.S. do all it can to \nensure that China's rise is peaceful and its trade practices fair, and \nunder those conditions, the United States should welcome China's \ncontinuing emergence and prosperity.\n  At the same time, we must remain prepared to respond should China's \nrise take a problematic turn. This means maintaining our military \npresence in the Asia-Pacific region, strengthening our alliances, and \nmaking clear to both Beijing and Taipei that a unilateral change in the \nstatus quo in the Taiwan Strait is unacceptable. Also, though today \nChina's military spending is one-tenth of ours, we must monitor closely \nChina's strategic capabilities while also pushing for greater \ntransparency of its defense activities.\n  Although we must remain vigilant in monitoring these potential \ndevelopments, our two nations also should strive to build a \nrelationship that broadens areas of cooperation where we share mutual \ninterests, as we have done to respond to the nonproliferation challenge \nposed by North Korea. And we should strengthen our ability to manage \nour differences effectively. While we must never hesitate to be clear \nand consistent with China where we disagree--whether on protection of \nintellectual property rights, the manipulation of its currency, human \nrights, or the right stance on Sudan and Iran--these differences, as a \ngeneral rule, should not prevent progress in areas where our interests \nintersect.\n  Trade and economic issues, the subject of the upcoming Strategic \nEconomic Dialogue, are one crucial example of the significant \nopportunities and challenges China's rise presents.\n  China is now the third largest economy in the world and is an \nincreasingly formidable commercial competitor. But China also is our \nfastest growing overseas market, fueling over $50 billion in U.S. \nexports that help support thousands of export-related jobs. Many \nAmericans also benefit from inexpensive Chinese products that keep down \nour cost of living, and China is an important link in the global supply \nchain that benefits U.S. commercial interests.\n  But none of that constitutes a reason to turn a blind eye to those \nares of the economic relationship that are troubling. China ran a trade \nsurplus with the United States of over $200 billion last year--the \nlargest ever between any two countries--accounting for nearly a third \nof our total global trade deficit. Neither America nor the world can \naccept such imbalances, and if they remain, it is inevitable that there \nwill be demands for protection in America and elsewhere.\n  I believe that the answer to the Chinese economic challenge is not to \nbuild walls of protection but to knock down barriers, demand fair \ntreatment for our products and services, and increase our own \ncompetitiveness.\n  Much of the hard work to be done lies at home. We must implement \npolicies to reduce our budget deficits and increase national savings--\nin order to reduce our dependence on borrowing to finance our deficits. \nWe must ensure that our companies and workers have the tools they need \nto compete in the global economy. Among other things, this means \nstepping up our investments in education, training, and science and \ntechnology. We must make sure those Americans whose livelihoods are \nthreatened by our changing economic relationship with China have access \nto the resources and support they need.\n  But China must bear a substantial share of the responsibility for \nrestoring greater balance in its economic relations with the United \nStates and the rest of the world. Just as the United States cannot \nunilaterally restore balance to China's economic relations, the United \nStates alone cannot mute protectionist demands. China must itself act \nto bring greater balance in its global trade, so that all countries \nbenefit from its growth.\n  I commend Treasury Secretary Paulson for pursuing a strategic \neconomic dialogue with China, but it must produce meaningful and \nlasting results. Even as we develop a better understanding of how \nChinese leaders view their own economic priorities, we need to confirm \nthat these same leaders understand how the policies they pursue affect \nthe United States and the global economy.\n  As a principal beneficiary of globalization, China needs to support \nand strengthen the international economic system as well. For example, \nit can and should take steps to increase consumption--drawing in more \nimports and reducing dependence on exports for growth. China needs a \nmodem financial system to achieve this. American companies can help \ndevelop such a system but not if the playing field is unfairly tilted \ntoward Chinese companies.\n  China can and should contribute to bolstering the world's economic \nsystem by allowing its currency, the renminbi, to be determined by \nmarket forces. Today, Beijing amasses as much as $20 billion a month in \nforeign currency, with the effects of keeping the renminbi \nsubstantially undervalued and giving China an undue advantage in trade. \nThe recent move to widen the currency trading band is useful, but China \nmust move more quickly toward a market-based currency.\n  China can and should contribute to the success of globalization by \nproviding stronger protection of intellectual property rights. The fact \nthat 80 percent of the pirated goods seized by U.S. Customs come from \nChina is unacceptable. It suggests just how much work needs to be done \nin this area.\n  China can and should contribute to the world's economic health by \naltering its energy policies--addressing the needs of its people at \nhome while not exacerbating problems abroad. Domestically, China's \npriority should be to increase energy efficiency. A system\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nthat requires twice as much energy as the United States to produce each \ndollar of economic growth is problematic.\n  At the same time, China needs to find cleaner sources of energy. \nSixteen of the twenty cities with the worst air in the world are in \nChina, and China is poised to overtake the United States in greenhouse \ngas emissions in 2 to 3 years. Just this week, a new report found that \nworldwide carbon dioxide levels have accelerated rapidly since 2000, in \npart because of China's reliance on coal.\n  China should rely on international energy markets to provide its oil \nand gas imports and work with the United States and others to develop \ncommon approaches to energy supplies and security. To continue seeking \nprivileged arrangements with countries such as Sudan and Iran--states \nthat commit gross human rights violations and that threaten to develop \nweapons of mass destruction--is to dramatically complicate efforts of \nthe international community to address these questions and, in effect, \nto ratify these deeply troubling practices.\n  I hope Treasury Secretary Paulson can persuade the Chinese to change \ntheir practices. We will all be better off with a China whose emergence \nstrengthens the international system rather than disrupts it.\n  China's economic growth is a good thing for China's 1.3 billion \npeople, and can be a good thing for the United States. China is \nincreasingly a constructive participant in the international system, \nand that trend should be supported and encouraged. But China cannot \nexpect the United States and its overseas partners to tolerate unfair \npractices and glaring imbalances triggered by its rise. China needs to \ntake steps that not only benefit its people but sustain the \ninternational system from which China itself benefits so greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6546-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL VETERANS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, when the Congress passed Public Law 106-50 \nin 1999, it was impossible to imagine the positive impact it would have \non all veterans and, in particular, all those young men and women now \nreturning from active duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Veterans \nCorporation, TVC, is a not-for-profit organization that amplifies \nbusiness opportunities and the tools our veterans need to start and \ngrow their businesses. Through unparalleled public and private sector \nbusiness, and strategic partnerships with the U.S. Department of \nDefense, the Veterans Affairs Administration, the Small Business \nAdministration, and the U.S. Department of Labor, veterans have the \nthree main ingredients for success: access to capital; access to \nbonding, and the important educational, mentorship and program case \nwork followup.\n  Today, more than ever, our Nation's veterans present an opportunity \nfor entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship based on the skills and \npracticed discipline they embraced as part of their service to our \nNation. Membership in TVC remains free to our veterans because the \nCongress invested wisely in this organization.\n  In partnership with the Surety and Fidelity Association of America, \nSFAA, we have a 50-State surety bonding program that includes a \ncomprehensive education curriculum and a three-step process for \nveterans to secure the bonding they need on government contracts. \nBonding is critical to service-disabled veteran entrepreneurs and to \nthe Federal Government if the 3-percent goal, mandated by the \nPresident's Executive Order, is to be achieved. TVC's partnership with \nSFAA provides a complete solution to the mandate by fulfilling the \nneeds for identification and qualification of service-disabled veteran-\nowned small businesses, along with casework followup as veteran \nentrepreneurs experience growth in their businesses.\n  Access to capital for both business start-up and infusion growth \nremains the number one need of veteran entrepreneurs. To address this \nissue, TVC has formed a strategic partnership with the National \nEconomic Opportunity Fund, NEOF. Through this partnership, TVC is able \nto assist veterans in obtaining micro-loans of $500 to $25,000 through \nACCION USA. PNC Bank has also begun accepting referrals from TVC and \nhas already funded one veteran-owned business. In addition, TVC is in \nthe process of finalizing partnerships with several banking \ninstitutions to provide veterans with larger loan programs for their \nincreasing business needs.\n  TVC's leadership has made extraordinary progress in addressing the \nbroad scope of issues facing veteran entrepreneurs. While embracing the \nexisting community networks of the Small Business Development Centers, \nthe Department of Labor's One Stop Centers, and the Procurement \nTechnical Assistance Centers, PTAC, TVC has been able to develop \nprograms that complement and enhance the resources already available to \ncurrent and aspiring business owners. By doing so, TVC is now providing \nthe programs and services most needed by the veteran community, \nincluding access to capital and bonding, and is more effectively \nmeeting the real needs of veteran entrepreneurs.\n  TVC's strength is in its ability to bring together the best in public \nand private entities to leverage scarce federal dollars in effectively \nand efficiently assisting veterans, service-disabled veterans, and \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves, who want to start or \npromote growth in small businesses. By benefiting from the strong \nresources already available from national business networks, and by \neliminating duplication of efforts through strategic partnerships, TVC \nhas the programming and the capacity to serve the needs of all veterans \nin 50 States.\n  TVC is working for our Nation's veterans and we have an obligation to \ncontinue funding programs that respond to all business entrepreneurial \nneeds. We must build a solid transition from active military service to \nveterans' entrepreneurship. I am confident TVC is that investment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6546-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6546-S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    WE THE PEOPLE HONORABLE MENTION\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I congratulate Caitlin Snaring, a \nbright young woman from my home State of Washington. Today, she won the \nNational Geographic Bee, a competition that starts with nearly 5 \nmillion students each year. Caitlin is from Redmond, WA, and this was \nher second time representing our State in the national competition held \nin Washington, DC.\n  On Monday, Caitlin and I sat near each other on the plane flight from \nSeattle to Washington, DC. While everyone else was reading magazines or \nwatching a movie, Caitlin was studying her notebooks and preparing for \nthe competition. I had a chance to talk with her, and I could see that \nshe was really determined and focused. I remember thinking to myself, \n``She's going places.''\n  After her victory today, I called her and said: ``Caitlin, I can tell \nthat when you decide what you're going to be and what you want to do, \nyou are going to achieve any dream you have.'' And I really believe \nthat.\n  Caitlin won a $25,000 college scholarship. I understand that she is \nthe second girl to win the geographic bee since the competition started \nin 1989 and the fifth winner from Washington State. In fact, Washington \nhas produced more national winners than any other State.\n  I want to congratulate Caitlin, her family, and friends on this great \nachievement and on the wonderful example she has set for young people \nin Washington State and around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6547-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING OAK ISLAND SEAFOOD, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize for the \nweek of May 20 an outstanding small business from my home State of \nMaine that will on May 31 receive the Maine Exporter of the Year Award \nfor 2007 from the Maine International Trade Center. Oak Island Seafood, \nInc., of Rockland, MA is a scallop processing company. In addition to \nproviding quality seafood products to U.S. retailers, Oak Island \nSeafood has expanded to include Europe and Asia in its distribution \nnetwork. Incredibly, 70 percent of its finished product is exported to \nother countries, most notably to nations within the European Union. \nClearly, Oak Island Seafood is a Maine company that has wide, \ninternational reach.\n  Oak Island Seafood, founded in 1995, has expanded to serve many \ncomers of the globe over the past 12 years, while simultaneously \nmaintaining its status as a unique small business. The company employs \nroughly 30 year-round employees in Rockland, an historic seaport \ncommunity in Maine's well-known midcoast region where Penobscot Bay \nconverges with the Atlantic Ocean. Their use of state-of-the-art \nequipment to deliver Maine seafood to the rest of the world exemplifies \nthe innovation that small businesses can use to do exceptional things.\n  With Maine's 5,500 miles of coastline, its fishing and seafood \nindustries are clearly vital to the State's economy. And while everyone \nknows Maine for its lobster--which I would argue is the best--Maine's \nfruitful portion of the Atlantic Ocean and our many waterways provide a \nvariety of delicious and often healthy fish and shellfish, including \nsalmon, shrimp, and scallops. Oak Island Seafood's commitment to \nproviding Maine seafood to not only the region but also to the rest of \nthe world is remarkable. As fish and other fresh and frozen seafood \nproducts comprise Maine's No. 4 export industry, it is crucial that we \nfind ways to continue augmenting the work that Oak Island Seafood and \nother companies do in seeking foreign markets to showcase Maine \nseafood. Equally necessary, we need to do all that we can to protect \nand preserve our seafaring families and the crucial work they \nundertake.\n  The Maine International Trade Center, which is presenting the Maine \nExporter of the Year award to Oak Island Seafood, is Maine's small \nbusiness link to the rest of the world. It is a public-private \npartnership between the State of Maine and its businesses. The center's \ngoal is to increase international trade in Maine and in particular to \nassist Maine's businesses in exporting goods and services. Clearly it \nsees in Oak Island Seafood the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation \nthat make Maine's small businesses so unique and successful.\n  I again congratulate Oak Island Seafood on being recognized Maine \nExporter of the Year and wish them well. The award, which will be \npresented to them on Thursday, May 31, at the 27th annual Maine \nInternational Trade Day, is truly something of which we can and should \nall be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6547-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6547-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/23/senate-section/article/S6547-5", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1525.

A bill to enhance the management and disposal of spent nuclear \nfuel and high-level radioactive waste, to assure protection of public \nhealth safety, to ensure the territorial integrity and security of the \nrepository at Yucca Mountain, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nI believe will place the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program \nback on\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\ntrack. I am joined by Senator Craig and others to introduce the Nuclear \nWaste Access to Yucca Bill, or Nu-Way Bill, which I believe will help \nto resolve the issue of nuclear waste once and for all.\n  As we all know, the history of the Yucca Mountain project has been \nrocky at best. The Yucca Mountain project has a very long pedigree, \nstarting back to the late 1950s when the National Academy of Sciences, \nNAS, reported to the Atomic Energy Commission that burying radioactive \nhigh-level waste in geologic formations should receive consideration. \nNAS stated that ``radioactive waste can be disposed of safely in a \nvariety of ways and at a large number of sites in the United States.''\n  In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act after a solid \nconsensus had been reached around the major elements of the approach \nbroadly outlined by President Carter. When President Reagan signed it \ninto law the following January, he called the Act ``a milestone for \nprogress and the ability of our democratic system to resolve a \nsophisticated and divisive issue.''\n  The Congress was quite optimistic then, so optimistic that we told \nthe Department of Energy, DOE, to enter into contracts with utilities \nto begin taking nuclear waste off their hands by 1998 in return for the \npayment of fees. Well, obviously that didn't happen, but the United \nStates government continues to collect the fee at 1mil/KWH electricity \ngenerated by nuclear plants. What did happen was that the utilities \nbegan to sue DOE for failing to meet its contractual obligation to \nremove spent nuclear fuel from storage at commercial reactor sites. DOE \nhas been negotiating with various reactor owners since 1999 over the \nmissed deadline for settlement agreements. The first agreement was \nreached in July 2000 which allowed DOE to pay PECO Energy Co. up to $80 \nmillion in nuclear waste fee revenues during the subsequent 10 years. \nHowever, other utilities sued DOE to block the settlement, contending \nthat nuclear waste fees may be used only for the DOE Waste Program and \nnot as compensation for missing the disposal deadline. The U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the 11th Circuit agreed that any compensation would have \nto come from general revenue or other sources than the waste fund.\n  Today, commercial spent nuclear fuel continues to be stored at plant \nsites, and DOE is facing more than $6 billion in judgments for failure \nto dispose the spent nuclear fuel. As for the nuclear waste fund, we \nnow have more than $19 billion of the ratepayer's money in principal \nand interest.\n  In addition to civilian spent nuclear fuel, the Department of Energy \nstores about 2,500 metric tons of defense waste, which includes \nunreprocessed spent nuclear fuel from its plutonium production \nreactors, naval propulsion reactors, and research reactors at Hanford, \nSavannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory.\n  While moving more slowly than planned, DOE's nuclear waste program \nhas made progress toward making the goal of a permanent geologic \nrepository for nuclear waste a reality. Originally, the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act required DOE to characterize more than one site for two \nrepositories. As the most promising site considered, the Yucca Mountain \nsite was selected by DOE to be the first site to be characterized. In \n1987, the act was amended and the Congress directed DOE to focus its \nsiting effort on Yucca Mountain alone and terminated the second \nrepository program.\n  On February 14, 2002, after carrying out the required ``appropriate \nsite characterization activities'' at Yucca Mountain to determine its \nsuitability, the President recommended Yucca Mountain to Congress as \nbeing ``qualified for application for a construction authorization for \na repository.''\n\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act provided the Governor of Nevada the \nopportunity to object to the site selection and to submit to Congress \nthe reasons. On April 8, 2002, the Governor of Nevada exercised this \nauthority and submitted his notice of disapproval and statement of \nreasons. Under the terms of the Act, the Governor's notice had the \neffect of terminating further consideration of the Yucca Mountain site \nuntil both Houses of Congress passed and the President signed into law \na joint resolution approving the site.\n  The State veto provisions of the act accomplished their intent, which \nwas to afford Congress another opportunity to review and determine if \nthe objection was sufficient to terminate the program. Based on expert \nopinion, both Houses concluded that the objection was not sufficient, \nand that the Yucca Mountain site is geologically suitable for \ndevelopment of the repository. In the national interest, Congress \napproved the Yucca Mountain site, and instructed DOE to file a license \napplication for the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nNRC. The decision has been made. All the scientific work performed to \ndate supports the decision.\n  With the siting decision made, it will now be up to the EPA to issue \ngeneral standards and for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license \nthe facility by evaluating the scientific data and determining whether \nthe repository will permanently, and safely, isolate nuclear waste.\n  Yucca Mountain is the cornerstone of our national comprehensive spent \nnuclear fuel management strategy for this country. Let me be clear: We \nneed Yucca Mountain. We must make this program work. I believe the bill \nintroduced today will do that.\n  This bill will remove unintended legal barriers that will allow DOE \nto meet its obligation to accept and store spent nuclear fuel as soon \nas possible, without prejudging the outcome of the NRC's repository \nlicensing decision.\n  The bill I am introducing today authorizes DOE to permanently \nwithdraw 147,000 acres of Federal land from public use currently \ncontrolled by the Bureau of Land Management, the Air Force, and the \nNevada Test Site, to satisfy a license condition of the NRC.\n  This legislation will repeal the arbitrary 70,000 metric ton \nstatutory limit on emplacement of radioactive material at Yucca \nMountain. The cap was imposed when Congress was considering two rounds \nof repositories. I believe that the capacity of the mountain should be \ndetermined by scientific and technical analysis, and not by political \ncompromises.\n  Today, the major facility at the Yucca Mountain site is an \n``exploratory studies facility'' with a 25-foot-diameter, 5-mile long, \ntunnel with ramps leading to the surface. This legislation will allow \nthe DOE to begin construction of needed infrastructure for the \nrepository and surface storage facilities as soon as they complete an \nenvironmental impact statement that evaluates these activities.\n  The ``Nu-Way'' bill also begins to consolidate the defense nuclear \nwaste and spent nuclear fuel from defense activities at the Yucca \nMountain site. The bill requires DOE to file for a permit to build a \nsurface receipt and storage facility at the Nevada Test Site at the \nsame time it files its license application for a repository at Yucca \nMountain.\n  As soon as the department receives the permit for the surface receipt \nand storage facility from the NRC, it may begin moving defense fuel and \nwaste to the Nevada Test Site. We are not giving DOE any new authority \nto move spent fuel. DOE currently has authority to transport and \nconsolidate defense waste at DOE facilities, with the sole exception of \nYucca Mountain site. The spent nuclear fuel from our Navy and defense \nactivities that kept us safe during the Cold War should be consolidated \nand stored securely at the Nevada Test Site. The defense waste is \ncurrently stored temporarily in Hanford, Idaho and Savannah River \nsites.\n\n  This legislation further provides that only after the NRC issues a \nconstruction permit for Yucca Mountain, may the Department of Energy \nbegin moving civilian spent fuel to the Nevada Test Site. This \nlegislation also lays the foundation to integrate Yucca Mountain \nRepository Program and Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, GNEP, by \nproviding that before civilian spent nuclear fuel is shipped to Yucca \nMountain, the Secretary of Energy must determine if it can be recycled \nwithin a reasonable time. I might add that the current plans for GNEP \ndo not include recycling all 55,000 metric tons of civilian spent fuel \nthat has already been generated. This proposal will would avoid moving \nwaste to Yucca Mountain Site that should be shipped instead to a GNEP \nfacility.\n  In the long run, this measure provides DOE with the authorities \nneeded to execute the Yucca Mountain project for long term emplacement \nand for the\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\nGNEP program to reduce the volume and toxicity of the material to be \nplaced in the repository, thereby eliminating the need for a second \nwaste repository.\n  This bill will also withdraw land for a rail route Yucca, a vital \ntransportation component. There is also a provision that provides that \nappropriations from the nuclear waste fund will not count against the \nallocations for discretionary spending. DOE will have access to the \nfull funds in the nuclear waste fund, moneys collected from electricity \nrate payers, our constituents, specifically for developing and \nconstructing the waste repository.\n  To address the liability problem created by Congress when DOE could \nnot remove spent nuclear fuel from the reactor sites, this legislation \nwill authorize DOE to revise the standard contract to accept waste from \nnew nuclear reactors at a more reasonable schedule. By doing all of \nthese things, this bill will establish a comprehensive program that \nwill provide confidence that our Nation's nuclear waste will be managed \nsafely both for current and future reactors.\n  The issue of Yucca Mountain has been addressed repeatedly by Congress \nand Presidents. The legislation I am introducing today will not \ncircumvent any environmental standards or regulations, nor will it \npreempt any State or local government rights.\n  Despite the great advances that we have made in this Nation on \nnuclear energy, we are still faced with challenges. EIA estimates that \neven with a projected increase in nuclear capacity and generation in \nlarge, the nuclear share of total electricity is estimated to fall from \n19 percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2030. This is because our energy \nneeds will be great over the next 25 years. For energy security \nreasons, economic reasons and environmental reasons, we must make \nnuclear energy a larger part of our mix. To meet the challenge of \nreducing carbon emissions in order to address climate change, we need \nnuclear energy. And, if we need nuclear energy, we need Yucca Mountain.\n  Solving nuclear waste is in the national interest. We can solve this \nproblem and I hope we can move forward together in a new way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 38. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a program for the provision of readjustment and mental health \nservices to veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Enduring Freedom, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nObama to introduce the Veterans' Mental Health Outreach and Access Act. \nThis bill will require the Secretary of Veteran's Affairs to establish \na program for the provision of readjustment and mental health services \nto veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nEnduring Freedom, with a particular emphasis on those soldiers who \nserved in the National Guard and Reserves.\n  Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF, \nare unique in their extensive use of National Guard and Reserve troops \nand their reliance on repetitive deployments. More than 1,500 National \nGuard and Reservists from New Mexico have been deployed in support of \nOIF and OEF. Several hundred of these soldiers have been deployed \nmultiple times. This is a new era for our National Guard and for the \nReserve. The role of these organizations in defending our national \nsecurity has significantly increased. Guard and Reserve members are \nseeing significant combat action and we know that a number of these \nsoldiers will return with mental and physical wounds suffered in these \nwars, including post traumatic stress disorder, depression, brain \ninjuries and other traumatic illnesses.\n  Virtually all returning veterans and their families will face \nreadjustment problems. These soldiers and their families deserve the \nbest care and treatment possible, but where do our National Guard and \nReserve soldiers fit into the military and veterans' systems of care? \nThese ``citizen-soldiers'' are not returning to military bases, but \nrather to communities that are frequently remote from VA medical \ncenters and clinics.\n  We're quick to urge that VA provide veterans needed treatment for \nservice-related mental health problems, but we also need to do more to \nremove the barriers such as travel and distance that oftentimes will \nprevent a veteran from seeking and continuing treatment. The Domenici-\nObama bill calls on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a \nnational program to reach vets who can't or won't seek VA care. It \nrequires the Secretary to mount a national program to train a cadre of \nreturning servicemembers for positions as peer outreach workers and \npeer-support specialists. In any remote area of the country in which \nthe VA determines there is inadequate access to a VA medical center, \nthe bill directs the Secretary of the VA to contract with community \nmental health centers and other qualified entities to provide peer \noutreach and support services, readjustment counseling and mental \nhealth services. However, any resulting contracts would require centers \nto first train and adhere to the VA's expertise and standards of care \nin mental health. It also will require any contract-provider to hire a \ntrained peer specialist as well as have its clinicians participate in a \ntraining program to be certain they'll provide ``culturally competent'' \nservices.\n  This bill also gives needed attention to the toll these military \noperations have on the mental health needs of our veterans' families. \nThese deployments are causing great stress for the spouses and children \nof these soldiers. Yet despite the recognition of the mental health \nneeds of the family members of the returning veterans, current law \nlimits the ability of the VA to work with these family members. This \nbill will expand access to mental health services for the immediate \nfamily of the veteran so that they may help the veteran recover in the \ncase of injury or illness incurred during deployment. It will also help \nexpand access to services so that the family can better help the \nveteran adjust back to civilian life, and also help the readjustment of \nthe family to the return of the veteran.\n  Lastly, this bill will extend the eligibility for health care \nservices from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans who \nserved in combat from 2 years to 5 years. Two years is often \ninsufficient time for symptoms related to PTSD and other mental illness \nto manifest. In many cases, it takes years for symptoms to present \nthemselves, and the difficulty is often compounded by the fact that \nmany servicemembers do not immediately seek the care that they need. \nFive years provides a more adequate window to address these risks.\n  Outreach and access to treatment are essential to prevent \nreadjustment problems for our returning veterans and their families. \nLeft untreated, mental disorders like PTSD and depression can become \nchronic and debilitating. We need systems in place to ensure that OEF/\nOIF veterans who are returning to their homes have access to the \nservices they need. It is my hope that this legislation will help close \nthe gaps we currently have in our service delivery systems and provide \nhelp to those who have experienced mental health problems as a result \nof their service to their country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 38\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the protection of mail delivery on \ncertain postal routes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since it was created the U.S. Postal \nService has provided trusted, reliable delivery to tens of millions of \nhouseholds throughout the country. Today, the USPS stands as the second \nlargest employer in the country with over 700,000 employees and is the \nmost efficient postal service in the world. Last year, the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act was passed and signed into law, \nensuring the sustainability of the USPS for years to come.\n  However, recent decisions by the Postal Service have put the success \nand reliability of mail delivery in jeopardy. Postal delivery managers \nare now being encouraged to contract out delivery services for all new \ndeliveries, of which there are approximately 1.8 million per year.\n  Outsourcing the mailman bypasses the process that ensures that only \nqualified people handle America's mail, leaving open the possibility \nthat convicted felons, identity thieves, or other undesirable workers \ncould have access to the mail stream.\n  Furthermore, it limits the ability of the Postal Service to prevent, \ninvestigate, and prosecute mail theft, mail fraud, and other illegal \nuses of the mail.\n  The USPS employs dedicated postal employees who earn solid middle-\nclass wages and have health benefits and pension plans. The quality of \nservice and reliability that the USPS has been known for is threatened \nif our mail carriers are replaced by low-paid, short-term workers.\n  This is why I am introducing the Mail Delivery Protection Act of \n2007. This bill would prevent the USPS from contracting out the \ndelivery of mail to postal patrons to private individuals and firms.\n  Each day millions of sensitive materials, including financial \nstatements, credit cards, Social Security checks, passports, and \nballots, pass through the mail stream. We cannot afford to allow the \nsafe delivery of these personal, private documents to be granted to the \nlowest bidder.\n  In 2006, 379 Members of the House of Representatives voted against a \npilot program testing the feasibility of contracted delivery.\n  However, postal management has increasingly chosen to contract out \nthe delivery of mail, therefore outsourcing their core service \nfunction. A fancy restaurant would not contract out its chefs to a \ncheap fast-food chain to save money. Why should the Post Office \noutsource its delivery?\n  We must remember that this is the U.S. Postal Service. This bill will \nensure that the safety and reliability we have all come to know from \nour local mail carriers will continue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MAIL DELIVERY PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Mail \n     Delivery Protection Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Mail Delivery Protection.--Section 5212 of title 39, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``The Postal Service may''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b)(1) Except as provided under paragraph (2), the Postal \n     Service may not enter into any contract under this section \n     with any motor carrier or other person for the delivery of \n     mail on any route with 1 or more families per mile.\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) any contract described under that paragraph in effect \n     on the date of enactment of the Mail Delivery Protection Act \n     of 2007--\n       ``(i) shall remain in effect until terminated under the \n     terms of such contract or as otherwise provided by law; and\n       ``(ii) may be renewed 1 or more times; and\n       ``(B) service on a rural route may be converted to contract \n     delivery service when such route no longer serves a minimum \n     of 1 family per mile.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1459. A bill to strengthen the Nation's research efforts to \nidentify the causes and cure of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, \nexpand psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data collection, study\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\naccess to and quality of care for people with psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Psoriasis \nand Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2007. According \nto the National Institutes of Health, as many as 7.5 million Americans \nare affected by psoriasis, a chronic, inflammatory, painful, \ndisfiguring and disabling disease for which there are limited \ntreatments and no cure. In my State of New Jersey, the National \nPsoriasis Foundation estimates that 219,000 people have psoriasis.\n  Ten to thirty percent of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic \narthritis, which causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around the \njoints. Moreover, of further concern is that people with psoriasis are \nat elevated risk for a myriad other comorbidities, including but not \nlimited to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and mental health \nconditions. Despite the serious adverse effects that psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis have on individuals, families and society, \npsoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are underrecognized and underfunded \nby our Nation's research institutions and public health agencies. At \nthe historical and current rate of psoriasis funding, NIH funding is \nnot keeping pace with research needs. For that reason, I am introducing \nlegislation to boost psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis research, \nimprove and expand psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data collection, \nincrease access to care and treatment for these diseases, and help \ndebunk the myths associated with psoriasis.\n  I know that this legislation will go a long way in achieving these \nimportant public policy goals. The bill calls on the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, to convene a summit of researchers, \npublic health professionals, representatives of patient advocacy \norganizations and policymakers to review current efforts in psoriasis \nand psoriatic arthritis research, treatment, and quality-of-life being \nconducted by Federal agencies whose work involves psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis related \ncomorbidities. The legislation also calls on the Secretary of HHS to \ncommission a study from the Institutes of Medicine, IOM, to evaluate \nand make recommendations to address health insurance and prescription \ndrug coverage as they relate to medications and treatments for \npsoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Lastly, the bill directs the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention to develop a patient registry to \ncollect much-needed longitudinal data on psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis so we can begin to understand the long-term impact of these \nconditions and evaluate the effects of various therapies.\n  I would like to thank the National Psoriasis Foundation for all of \nits efforts and leadership over the last four decades and am grateful \nto the Foundation and its members and staff for their ongoing \ncommitment to improving quality of life for people with psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis. Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research Cure, and \nCare Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Psoriasis and Psoriatic \n     Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       The table of contents for this Act is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title.\nSec. 2. Table of contents.\nSec. 3. Findings.\nSec. 4. Expansion of biomedical research.\nSec. 5. National patient registry.\nSec. 6. National summit.\nSec. 7. Study and report by the Institute of Medicine.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune-\n     mediated, chronic, inflammatory, painful, disfiguring, and \n     life-altering diseases that require life-long sophisticated \n     medical intervention and care and have no cure.\n       (2) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis affect as many as 7.5 \n     million men, women, and children of all ages and have an \n     adverse impact on the quality of life for virtually all \n     affected.\n       (3) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it \n     does not cause death. Psoriasis is commonly and incorrectly \n     considered by insurers, employers, policymakers, and the \n     public as a mere annoyance, a superficial problem, mistakenly \n     thought to be contagious and due to poor hygiene. Treatment \n     for psoriasis often is categorized, wrongly, as ``life-\n     style'' and not ``medically necessary''.\n       (4) Psoriasis goes hand-in-hand with a myriad of co-\n     morbidities such as Crohn's disease, diabetes, metabolic \n     syndrome, obesity, hypertension, heart attack, cardiovascular \n     disease, liver disease, and psoriatic arthritis, which occurs \n     in 10 to 30 percent of people with psoriasis.\n       (5) The National Institute of Mental Health funded a study \n     that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and \n     mental disability as other major diseases, including cancer, \n     arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n     depression.\n       (6) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n     depression and suicidal ideation.\n       (7) Each year the people of the United States lose \n     approximately 56 million hours of work and spend $2 billion \n     to $3 billion to treat psoriasis.\n       (8) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis \n     may help prevent irreversible joint damage.\n       (9) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a \n     challenge for patients and their health care providers \n     because no one treatment works for everyone, some treatments \n     lose effectiveness over time, many treatments are used in \n     combination with other treatments, and all treatments may \n     cause a unique set of side effects.\n       (10) Although new and more effective treatments finally are \n     becoming available, too many people do not yet have access to \n     the types of therapies that may make a significant difference \n     in the quality of their lives.\n       (11) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a \n     significant national health issue that deserves a \n     comprehensive and coordinated response by State and Federal \n     governments with involvement of the health care provider, \n     patient, and public health communities.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices from imposing penalties against a State under the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families program for failure to satisfy minimum \nwork participation rates or comply with work participation verification \nprocedures with respect to months beginning after September 2006 and \nbefore the end of the 12-month period that begins on the date the \nSecretary approves the State's work verification plan; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a simple bill \nto try and provide some fairness to States as they struggle to try and \nimplement the new, stringent standards of the welfare reform \nreauthorization imposed as part of the Deficit Reduction Act on 2007. \nAs a former member of the West Virginia State Legislature and as a \nGovernor, I know that implementation of such mandates can take time.\n  Let me share the timeline that States face in coping with the new \nrules on welfare reform, or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, \nTANF. Most of the pending legislation on TANF, including President \nBush's plan had a multiyear phase in proposals for tougher work \nrequirements.\n  But the legislation that passed was a stark change with no time for \nStates to develop new policy and no time for State legislature to react \nto new policy. Additionally States could be penalized for their policy \neven before they get guidance from officials at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, that their work verification plan is \napproved. This is just not fair.\n  Here is the history. In October of 2005, the House Workforce \nCommittee passed legislation to phase-in higher work standards.\n  In November of 2005, the Senate approved a budget reconciliation bill \nwithout new work requirements. Later that month, the House approved a \nreconciliation bill that phased-in higher work requirements.\n  On December 19, 2005, the conference agreement on the Deficit \nReduction Act imposed tougher work standard that will take effect on \nOctober 1, 2007. States will also face penalties if they do not meet \nnew, unpublished work verification requirements.\n  The President signed the bill into law in February 2006.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services did not issue regulations \nto define work activities and outlining the requirements for work \nverification plans until June 29, 2006.\n  States had just 3 months to develop their work verification plans \nbased on the new regulations, and the plans are due on September 30, \n2006.\n  On October 1, 2006, the tougher work standards as measured by work \nverification took effect.\n  Today, May 22, 2006, no State has received approval of their work \nverification plans submitted over 7 months ago. But States could be \npenalized for failing participation standards today before they have \ngotten guidance from HHS that their work verification plans are \napproved, and they know what is expected of them.\n  This is just not fair. States need to know what the rules are for \nwork, and what they can count for work before any penalties should be \nassessed, even if they are not due until a future date. Some of the \npotential penalties are harsh, including a 5 percent cut in the State's \nblock grant in the first year, and a requirement to increase State \nmatching funds. Such cuts could be imposed when the value of TANF block \ngrant has shrunk by more than 20 percent since 1996.\n  My bill is simple fairness. It states that no financial penalties can \nbe imposed on a State until 12 months after a State gets official \napproval by HHS of its work verification plans. This allows each State \na year to come into compliance. States are trying, but they do not yet \nknow what officially counts as work so they should not face any \npenalties until after the rules are clear.\n  Welfare reform is not supposed to be about penalties and pushing \nfamilies off the caseload. Welfare reform is supposed to be about \npromoting responsibility and self-sufficiency. States, and the \nfamilies, on the program deserve to know with certainty what it takes \nto ``play by the rules.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1462. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to promote the adoption of children with special needs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAdoption Equality Act of 2007. This legislation is an issue of \nfairness. It clearly states that every special needs child who needs \nadoption assistance in order to gain a safe, permanent home deserves \nit.\n  Throughout my career in the Senate, I have sought to strengthen and \nimprove policies for the most vulnerable children, children who are at-\nrisk of abuse and neglect in their own homes. While foster care is able \nto provide for the basic needs of these children, we must ultimately be \nable to provide them with a safe permanent home.\n  Congress demonstrated their dedication to this when they passed the \n1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, which led to the number of \nnationwide adoptions nearly doubling. But even with\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nthese significant gains we cannot forget over 100,000 children in \nfoster care are waiting for adoption. In West Virginia, there are 94 \nchildren waiting for adoption. For some of these children, described as \nhaving ``special needs,'' placement in a safe permanent home is \nespecially difficult. Special needs children face increased obstacles \nin adoption due to factors such as their age, disability, or status as \npart of a group of siblings needing to be placed together.\n  In an effort to offer additional support to those in foster care who \nhave the most difficulty finding a safe and permanent home, adoption \nsubsidies are provided to encourage the adoption of ``special needs'' \nchildren. These subsidy payments provide essential income support to \nhelp families finance the daily basic costs of raising these children, \nas well as support for special services like therapy, tutoring, or \nspecial equipment for disabled children.\n  Yet, the current law does not make these Federal subsidies available \nto all families adopting ``special needs'' children. Under this law, \nonly a fraction of the children waiting to be adopted would qualify for \nsupport. Federal subsidies are only given to families who adopt special \nneeds children whose biological family would have qualified for welfare \nbenefits. This is, simply, wrong. A child's eligibility for these \nimportant benefits should not be dependent on the income of his or her \nbiological parents, these are the parents whose legal rights to the \nchild have been terminated, the parents who have abused or neglected \nthe child.\n  It is time to create a Federal policy that levels the playing field \nand gives all children with special needs an equal and fair chance at \nbeing adopted. The Adoption Equality Act of 2007 will do this by \nremoving the requirement that an income eligibility determination be \nmade in regard to the child's biological parents, thereby making all \nchildren who meet the definition of ``special needs'' eligible for \nFederal adoption subsidies. The bill would also give States an \nincentive to make additional improvements to their welfare systems by \nrequiring that States reinvest the moneys they save as a result of this \nbill back into their State child abuse and neglect programs.\n  The lack of modest financial resources to support these adoptions is \noften the only barrier that stands between an abused child and a safe, \nloving home. This bill is a wise investment if we want to truly help \nour most vulnerable children find a permanent home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Casey, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1464. A bill to establish a Global Service Fellowship Program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nGlobal Service Fellowship Program Act. This important bill would \nprovide more Americans the opportunity to volunteer overseas and \nstrengthen our existing Federal international education and exchange \nsystem. I believe the U.S. government needs to be taking a greater \nleadership role in providing opportunities for U.S. citizens to \nvolunteer overseas and my bill will enhance U.S. efforts to be a global \nleader in people-to-people engagement.\n  People-to-people engagement is one of the United States' most \neffective public diplomacy tools and, today more than ever, we need to \nbe investing in every opportunity to improve the perception of the U.S. \noverseas. Bad policy decisions by this administration have led to an \nalarming increase in negative opinions of the United States and we have \nnot done enough to reverse this trend.\n  Studies have shown that, in areas where U.S. citizens have \nvolunteered their time, money, and services, opinions of the United \nStates have improved. A 2006 Terror Free Tomorrow poll found that, ``In \nIndonesia, almost two years after the tsunami, American aid to tsunami \nvictims continues to be the single biggest factor resulting in \nfavorable opinion towards the United States. Almost 60 percent of \nIndonesians surveyed nationwide in August 2006 said that American \nassistance made them favorable to the United States. This number has \nremained solid following tsunami relief, despite a growing number of \nIndonesians who oppose American-led efforts to fight terrorism.''\n  Greater investment in volunteer opportunities has significant \npotential to improve the image of the U.S. overseas and while we have \nimportant programs already in place, the Peace Corps and programs \nadministered through the Department of State's Bureau of Education and \nCultural Affairs, we can and should be doing more.\n  My bill would not only provide more opportunities for people-to-\npeople engagement, but it reduces barriers that the average citizen \nfaces when trying to volunteer internationally. First of all, my bill \nwould reduce financial barriers by awarding fellowship awards designed \nto defray some of the costs associated with volunteering. The \nfellowship awards can be applied towards airfare, housing, or program \ncosts, to name a few examples. By providing financial assistance, the \nGlobal Service Fellowship program opens the door for every American to \nbe a participant, not just those with the resources to pay for it.\n  Secondly, my bill reduces volunteering barriers by offering \nflexibility in the length of the volunteer opportunity. I often hear \nfrom constituents that they do not seek opportunities to participate in \nFederal volunteer programs because they cannot leave their jobs or \nfamily for years at a time. The Global Service Fellowship Programs \noffers volunteers the opportunity to volunteer on a schedule that works \nfor them, a month up to a year. My bill provides a commonsense approach \nto the time limitations of the average American.\n  Not only does this bill open the door for any U.S. citizen to apply \nfor fellowship consideration, it calls on Congress to be part of the \ndecision-making process. The Global Service Fellowship Program \nintegrates members of Congress by calling on them to nominate volunteer \napplicants to the Department of State for consideration. Through this \nprocess, Congress will see firsthand the benefit international \nvolunteering brings to their communities and the nation.\n  My bill would cost $150 million, which is more than offset by a \nprovision that would require the IRS to deposit all of its fee receipts \nin the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. CBO has estimated that this \noffset will save $559 million over 5 years for net deficit reduction of \napproximately $409 million.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators Coleman, Voinovich, Casey, \nMenendez, and Lautenberg have joined me in introducing this bill. This \nprogram would be a valuable addition to our public diplomacy and \nhumanitarian efforts overseas and I encourage my colleagues to support \nthe bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1467. A bill to establish an Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment \nDemonstration Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early Federal \nPell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program Act of 2007.\n  This legislation addresses some of the disparities in our current \nsystem with an innovative way to clear the hurdles that lack of \ninformation and high costs often form to prevent low-income students \nfrom planning for a college education. A recent report by the Urban-\nBrookings Tax Policy Center concluded that grant programs ``that are \nwell targeted and have more predictable and larger awards tend to have \nlarger impacts on college-going rates.'' This bill, I am pleased to \nsay, establishes such a program.\n  Right now, students do not find out if they are eligible for Federal \naid until their senior year, much less how much they will receive. If \nyou have ever put kids through college, like I have, you know that this \ntime frame doesn't allow much leeway for planning ahead. An earlier \npromise of Federal aid will begin the conversation about college early \nand continue it through high school. That way, students and their \nfamilies can visualize college in their future, and this goal can \nsustain them through the moment they open their letter of acceptance. \nThis promise can be especially important in changing the expectations \nof low-income students whose future plans often don't include college.\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\n  My bill would provide funding for a demonstration in four states, \neach of which would work with two cohorts of up to 10,000 eighth grade \nstudents; one in school year 2007-2008, and one in school year 2008-\n2009. By using the same eligibility criteria as the National School \nLunch Program, students would be identified based on need in the eighth \ngrade. Eligible students would qualify for the Automatic Zero Expected \nFamily Contribution on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, \nFAFSA, guaranteeing them a maximum Pell Grant. Local educational \nagencies with a National School Lunch Program participation rate above \n50 percent would be eligible for the program.\n  The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program would \nalso provide funding for states, in conjunction with the participating \nlocal educational agencies, to conduct targeted information campaigns \nbeginning in the eighth grade and continuing through students' senior \nyear. These campaigns would inform students and their families of the \nprogram and provide information about the cost of a college education, \nState and Federal financial assistance, and the average amount of aid \nawards. A targeted information campaign, along with a guarantee of a \nmaximum Pell grant, would allow families and students to plan ahead for \ncollege and develop an expectation that the future includes higher \neducation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1467\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nburial benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veterans Burial \nBenefits Improvement Act.\n  We must honor our U.S. soldiers who died in the name of their \ncountry. These service men and women are America's true heroes and on \nthis day we pay tribute to their courage and sacrifice. Some have given \ntheir lives for our country. All have given their time and dedication \nto ensure our country remains the land of the free and the home of the \nbrave. We owe a special debt of gratitude to each and every one of \nthem.\n  Our Nation has a sacred commitment to honor the promises made to \nsoldiers when they signed up to serve our country. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I fight hard each year to make sure \npromises made to our service men and women are promises kept. These \npromises include access to quality, affordable health care and a proper \nburial for our veterans.\n  I am deeply concerned that burial benefits for the families of our \nwounded or disabled veterans have not kept up with inflation and rising \nfuneral costs. We are losing over 1,000 World War II veterans each day, \nbut Congress has failed to increase veterans' burial benefits to keep \nup with rising costs and inflation. While these benefits were never \nintended to cover the full costs of burial, they now pay for only a \nfraction of what they covered in 1973, when the federal government \nfirst started paying burial benefits for our veterans.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nworking with me in the 107 Congress. Together, we were able to increase \nmodestly the service-connected benefit from $1,500 to $2,000, and the \nplot allowance from $150 to $300. While I believe these increases are a \nstep in the right direction, they are not a substitute for the amounts \nincluded in my bill.\n  That is why I am again introducing the Veterans Burial Benefits \nImprovement Act. This bill will increase burial benefits to cover the \nsame percentage of funeral costs as they did in 1973. It will also \nprovide for these benefits to be increased annually to keep up with \ninflation.\n  In 1973, the service-connected benefit paid for 72 percent of \nveterans' funeral costs. Today, this benefit covers just 39 percent of \nfuneral costs. My bill will increase the service-connected benefit from \n$2,000 to $4,100, bringing it back up to the original 72 percent level.\n  In 1973, the nonservice connected benefit paid for 22 percent of \nfuneral costs. It has not been increased since 1978, and today it \ncovers just 6 percent of funeral costs. My bill will increase the \nnonservice connected benefit from $300 to $1,270, bringing it back up \nto the original 22 percent level.\n  In 1973, the plot allowance paid for 13 percent of veterans' funeral \ncosts. Yet it now covers just 6 percent of funeral costs. My bill will \nincrease the plot allowance from $300 to $745, bringing it back up to \nthe original 13 percent level.\n  Finally, the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act will also \nensure that these burial benefits are adjusted for inflation annually, \nso veterans won't have to fight this fight again.\n  This legislation is just one way to honor our Nation's service men \nand women. I want to thank the millions of veterans, Marylanders, and \npeople across the Nation for their patriotism, devotion, and commitment \nto honoring the true meaning of Memorial Day. U.S. soldiers from every \ngeneration have shared in the duty of defending America and protecting \nour freedom. For these sacrifices, America is eternally grateful.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\n                                S. 1468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the closure of the Department of Defense \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am offering legislation to close \nthe U.S. military presence at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There is remarkable \nagreement on the need to find a way to close this prison. Our closest \nallies have all urged that Guantanamo be closed, as have many leaders \nfrom across the political spectrum in the United States.\n  Last June, after three detainees committed suicide in a single day, \nPresident Bush acknowledged that the prison has damaged America's \nreputation abroad. The President said:\n\n       No question, Guantanamo sends a signal to some of our \n     friends--provides an excuse, for example, to say that the \n     United States is not upholding the values that they're trying \n     to encourage other countries to adhere to.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       I'd like to close Guantanamo.\n\n  More recently, Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Rice \nhave urged that the prison be shut down. On March 23, the Washington \nPost, citing ``senior administration officials,'' reported Secretary \nGates had ``repeatedly argued that the detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba, had become so tainted abroad that legal proceedings at \nGuantanamo would be viewed as illegitimate.'' According to the Post, \nSecretary Gates ``told President Bush and others that it should be shut \ndown as quickly as possible.''\n  Make no mistake, current detainees at Guantanamo include a number of \nextremely dangerous terrorists with the determination and the ability--\nif they are given the opportunity--to inflict grave harm on the United \nStates and its citizens. Among the detainees are 14 senior leaders of \nal-Qaida, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has confessed to being \none of the masterminds of the September 11 attacks, plus others. We \nmust, and we can, hold these enemy combatants in maximum security \nconfinement elsewhere.\n  But the critics are right. The 5-year-old prison at Guantanamo is a \nstain on the honor of this country. By holding people at Guantanamo \nwithout charge, without judicial review, without appropriate legal \ncounsel, and--in the past--subjecting many of them to torture, we have \nforfeited the moral high ground and we stand as hypocrites in the eyes \nof the world.\n  Perhaps most seriously, from a pragmatic standpoint, maintaining the \nprison at Guantanamo is simply counterproductive. It has become a \npropaganda bonanza and recruitment tool for terrorists. It alienates \nour friends and allies. It detracts from our ability to regain the \nmoral high ground, and rally the world against the terrorists who \nthreaten us.\n  The administration has repeatedly described detainees at Guantanamo \nas ``the worst of the worst'' or, as former Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld once described them, the ``most dangerous, best-trained, \nvicious killers on the face of the earth.'' Unquestionably, some of the \ndetainees fit these descriptions. However, an exhaustive study of \nGuantanamo detainees conducted by the nonpartisan, highly respected \nNational Journal last year came to the following conclusions: A large \npercentage, perhaps the majority, of the detainees were not captured on \nany battlefield, let alone on ``the battlefield in Afghanistan,'' as \nthe President once asserted. Fewer than 20 percent of the detainees \nhave ever been al-Qaida members. Many scores, and perhaps hundreds, of \nthe detainees were not even Taliban foot soldiers, let alone al-Qaida \nmembers. The majority were not captured by U.S. forces but, rather, \nhanded over by reward-seeking Pakistanis, Afghan warlords, and by \nvillagers of highly dubious reliability. For example, one of the \ndetainees is a man who was conscripted by the Taliban to work as an \nassistant cook. The U.S. Government's ``evidence'' against this \ndetainee consists in its entirety of the following:\n  One, the detainee admits he was a cook's assistant for Taliban forces \nin Narim, Afghanistan, under the command of Haji Mullah Baki.\n  Two, the detainee fled from Narim to Kabul during the Northern \nAlliance attack and surrendered to the Northern Alliance.\n  This person is still sitting in Guantanamo.\n  The situation at Guantanamo, I must add, reminds me of an earlier \nepisode in this Senator's life. In July of 1970, I was a staff \nassistant to a House committee in the House of Representatives. I was \nworking with a congressional delegation on a factfinding trip to \nVietnam. I brought back photographs of the so-called tiger cages at Con \nSon Island, off the coast of Vietnam, where Viet Cong and some North \nVietnamese prisoners, as well as civilian opponents of the war, were \nall being held together, held incommunicado, tortured and killed, with \nthe full knowledge, support, and sanction of the United States \nGovernment. We had heard reports about the possible existence of these \ntiger cages. But our State Department vehemently denied their \nexistence. They dismissed all of these claims as communist propaganda.\n\n  Well, I looked into this and believed the reports were credible. I \nwas determined to investigate further to see if they did exist. Thanks \nto the courage of Congressman William Anderson of Tennessee, \nCongressman Augustus Hawkins of California, Don Luce, an American \nworking for a nongovernmental organization, and a brave, young \nVietnamese man who risked his life and his brother's life, who was \nstill held on Con Son in the tiger cages, who drew us the maps and \nshowed us how to find the tiger cages at these prisons--Nguyen Caoli \nwas the young man's name. He risked it all by trusting us. Thanks to \nhis maps and telling us how to find them, we were able to expose the \ntiger cages on Con Son Island in July of 1970.\n  Supporters of the war claimed the tiger cages were not all that bad. \nBut then Life Magazine and other magazines around the world published \nthe pictures I had surreptitiously taken on Con Son, and the world saw \nthe horrific conditions, as I said, with Vietnamese guerrillas, as well \nas civilian opponents\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nof the war, all crowded together in these cages, in clear violation of \nthe Geneva Conventions, and in violation of the most fundamental \nprinciples of human rights.\n  At the time, the United States Government had been insisting the \nNorth Vietnamese abide by the Geneva Conventions in their treatment of \nUnited States prisoners in North Vietnam. Yet, here we were condoning, \nfunding, and even supervising the torture of Vietnamese prisoners and \ncivilians, whose only crime was protesting the war, all in clear \nviolation of the Geneva Conventions.\n  There are disturbing parallels between what transpired on Con Son \nIsland nearly four decades ago and what happened at Guantanamo in \nrecent years. In both cases, prisons were deliberately set up on remote \nislands, clearly with the intention of limiting scrutiny and \nrestricting access. In both cases, detainees were not classified as \nprisoners of war, expressly to deny them the protections of the Geneva \nConventions. In both cases, detainees were deprived of any right of due \nprocess, judicial review, or a fair trial.\n  They were simply held indefinitely in isolation, in limbo. In both \ncases, when the mistreatment of detainees was exposed, the United \nStates stood accused of hypocrisy, of betraying its most sacred values, \nand of violating international law.\n  So you can see why I have watched what has transpired at Guantanamo, \nand I have thought back to that episode in my life when all of this \ncame out about the tiger cages and the inhumane treatment of these \nseveral hundred prisoners who were there at the time. There was a happy \nending to that event. Because of the international outcry, the tiger \ncages were closed down, the prisoners were released, and people went \nback to their homes.\n  Many of them who were in the tiger cages I met later on in life. One \nbecame the mayor of Saigon, several became successful businesspeople, \nand others went on with their lives. But watching what happened at \nGuantanamo and seeing that many of these people were swept up in a war \nwhich some of them--many of them--well, the National Journal says a \nmajority of them were not even engaged.\n  So it is time to close it down. We need to reverse the damage \nGuantanamo has done to America's reputation and to our ability to wage \nan effective fight against the terrorists who attacked us on September \n11, and the essential first step must be to close the prison at \nGuantanamo as expeditiously as possible. The bill I am introducing \ntoday offers a practical approach to accomplishing this within 120 days \nof enactment of the law.\n  As I said, there are known hardcore terrorists at Guantanamo, such as \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, who must continue to be held in maximum-\nsecurity conditions. Under my bill, these prisoners will be transferred \nto the U.S. detention base at Fort Leavenworth, KS. This is a state-of-\nthe-art maximum-security facility just opened in 2002. It has adequate \ncapacity to receive these prisoners from Guantanamo. Under my bill, the \nremaining prisoners, some 365 in number, would have their legal status \nresolved. In each case, the administration will determine whether the \nprisoner planned or committed hostile acts against the United States. \nThose who did plan or commit hostile acts would be charged and \ntransferred to Fort Leavenworth. Those who did not would be released to \nthe custody of their home country or, where necessary, to a country \nwhere they would not face torture.\n  There is a pending bill, S. 1249, to close the prison at Guantanamo. \nHowever, that bill gives the administration too much leeway to maintain \nthe status quo in terms of the detainees' legal status. It allows an \nenemy combatant to be detained indefinitely without charge--that is \nwhat is getting us into trouble in the first place--and it does not \nrequire that the administration abide by the Convention Against \nTorture, nor does it give detainees a forum in which to lodge credible \nclaims of torture or abuse. The bill I am introducing does all of that.\n  The United States has lost its way, both in Iraq and at Guantanamo. \nWe need to wage a smarter, more focused, and more effective fight \nagainst the terrorists who threaten us, and we must do so in ways that \ndo not give credence to their anti-American propaganda and do not rally \nmore recruits to their cause. To that end, we must close the prison at \nGuantanamo as soon as possible. The legislation I am offering today \nwill accomplish this.\n  This legislation has the enthusiastic endorsement of Human Rights \nWatch, Human Rights First, Amnesty International, and the American \nCivil Liberties Union. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unamimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide States with the resources needed to rid \nour schools of performance-enhancing drug use; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Drug \nFree Varsity Sports Act of 2007. This bill would provide States with \nthe resources they need to rid our schools of steroids and other \nperformance-enhancing drugs.\n  I believe steroid use doesn't begin at the professional level. I am \nvery concerned about performance-enhancing\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\ndrug use among young athletes, specifically high school athletes. \nSteroid use among high school students is on the rise. It more than \ndoubled among high school students from 1991 to 2003, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, a study by the \nUniversity of Michigan shows that the percentage of 12 graders who said \nthey had used steroids some time in their lives rose from 1.9 percent \nin 1996 to 3.4 percent in 2004. This is unacceptable and a health risk \nto our children.\n  In 2004, the Polk County School District became the first in Florida \nto establish random testing for high school athletes, and the Florida \nHouse passed a bill that would have made Florida the first State to \nrequire steroid testing for high school athletes. That bill stalled in \nthe Senate, but now Florida and other States are considering a similar \nlaw. Currently, less than 4 percent of U.S. high schools test athletes \nfor steroids, and no State requires high schools to test athletes. \nSchools and States say that cost is usually the reason they don't test.\n  In response, I am introducing this legislation to help States with \nthe resources they need to curb the use of steroids and other \nperformance-enhancing drugs. My legislation would provide federal \ngrants directly to States so that they can develop and implement \nperformance-enhancing drug testing programs.\n  The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2007 would authorize $20 million \nin grants to States to create statewide pilot drug testing programs for \nperformance-enhancing drugs. States that receive the grants would be \nrequired to incorporate recovery, counseling, and treatment programs \nfor those students who test positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n  Stopping the use of performance-enhancing drugs goes beyond testing. \nThat is why my legislation also would require States that receive \ngrants to allocate no less than 10 percent of the funding to establish \nstatewide policies to discourage steroid use, through educational or \nother related means.\n  There is no simple solution to the issue of steroids in sports. \nCongress can do its part by enacting the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act \nof 2007. But the sports leagues, their players, coaches, and parents \nall must play an active role.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Free Varsity Sports Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Inouye) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. \n1348, to provide for comprehensive immigration reform and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n         TITLE __--STUDY OF WARTIME TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PEOPLE\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Salazar for his \ncourtesy. I want to share a few thoughts tonight. In particular, I wish \nto talk about the Grassley amendment that deals with the granting of \nvisas, which, by error or inadvertence, could in fact involve \nindividuals who are very dangerous, who would get into our country on a \nvalid visa, and then it be determined that they should never have been \nissued that visa.\n  That happens quite often. The State Department is concerned about it. \nThe FBI is concerned about it. The Grassley amendment would help fix \nthat in a significant way. In any comprehensive immigration reform, it \nis my view that should be a part of it.\n  We have talked about this for a number of years, but somehow we never \ngot around to getting it done. I am glad he has offered it. If we are \ngoing to pass immigration reform, it certainly should be a part of it.\n  I think one of the problems we have had in our thinking throughout \nthis process is an insufficient understanding that we as Senators \nshould place our national interests first, and we should set policy \nthat serves our laws, that serves our financial interests, and should \nvalidate those who follow the law properly and have consequences for \nthose who do not follow the law.\n  In 1986, there was this discussion that led to immigration reform. It \nwas admitted to be amnesty, and it was supposed to be the last amnesty \nof all time, a one-time amnesty, and we are going to enforce the law in \nthe future. They promised.\n  Of course, the amnesty took place immediately and the promises of \nenforcement and funding and enough Border Patrol agents and all the \nthings necessary to have enforcement never occurred for two main \nreasons. No President of the United States cared to do anything about \nlawlessness at the border, and the Congress didn't. Congress, every now \nand then, would rise up and suggest that something should be done, and \nsome Congressman or Senator would talk about it, but nothing ever \nreally got done.\n  Now we are at a point where we have perhaps 12, maybe 20 million \npeople here illegally, and they desire amnesty. What will happen next? \nHow many years will it be until the next time?\n  I have a simple view that goes to the core of what this bill fails to \ndo, and that is to affirm the rule of law. My view is that a \ncompassionate and kind and very generous thing to do for persons who \ncame into our country illegally, who have not been forced to stay here \nbut stay here because they choose to stay here--presumably the life and \nthe pay and the benefits they have here are sufficient that they would \nchoose to stay here rather than where they came from--that those \npersons, as a result of coming here illegally and of their own \nvolition, should not be given every single benefit that we would give \nto persons who come to America legally. That is just it. We said that \nin 1986 and this will be a defining moment about whether we mean it.\n  We could take two positions. One is, this is not amnesty and maybe we \ncan go on and the same thing would be prepared to happen a few years \nfrom now, 15 years from now. Or we can say: No, sir, nobody from 1986 \nand forever hereafter who comes to our country illegally will be given \nthe full panoply of benefits we give to persons who come to our country \nlegally.\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\n  I just want to mention two or three things I think about that. One is \ncitizenship. You don't get citizenship if you break into this country \nillegally. You don't receive some of the benefits we would give, such \nas the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit was \ndesigned to help people with families, who are poor, but who do work. \nIt was an idea that went back to the Nixon days. The theory was there \nwas not enough distinction between the income you could get staying \nhome on welfare and actually going out and working. So they tried to \nincentivize and encourage poor people to see the advantage of work and \nwould give them the earned-income tax credit, which a lot of people do \nnot know is $41 billion a year in expenditures, which is a lot of money \ndesigned to help poor people.\n  Conservatives talk about it, others talk about it, but fundamentally \nit was designed to incentivize work for American working poor, \nparticularly if they had children. The average recipient of the earned-\nincome tax credit in America receives from $1,700 to $2,000 a year. \nThat is designed to help them work.\n  But if somebody comes to our country illegally, I see no reason they \nshould be rewarded with the earned-income tax credit; nor should they \nget Social Security benefits if they paid benefits over a false Social \nSecurity number, working under a fraudulent name in a business where \nthey were illegal. They should not get those benefits.\n  One cannot, in America today, go to court and enforce an illegal \ncontract. If a person promises to pay a drug dealer money for dope and \nthat person doesn't pay the drug dealer, the drug dealer can't sue that \nperson in court. It is an illegal contract, a contract for dope.\n  It is an illegal contract. When a person comes here and pays money \nusing a fake name or fake Social Security number, that person is not \nentitled to receive any benefits, in addition to the problems we would \nhave in determining who paid what money under what number and where and \nwhen. Fraud would be rampant, so we should not do that.\n  I am worried about this legislation. I think it has some containment \nof the Social Security, a good bit better than last year, although I am \nnot sure it is real tight. But there is no containment of the earned-\nincome tax credit. Those are some things we need to think about as we \nanalyze the cost of the legislation that is before us today.\n  With regard to the Grassley amendment, this amendment would revise \nthe current law related to visa revocations for visa holders who are on \nU.S. soil. Under the current law, visas approved or denied by consular \nofficers in foreign countries are nonreviewable. In other words, if you \ngo into the consular office, as I did with Senator Specter last summer \nin the Dominican Republic, and happened to meet one and talked with him \nabout how his day was and what it was like--they make decisions. The \nconsular officers ask for information. If they think somebody has a \nscheme to go into the United States with a visa and never to return \nback to the Dominican Republic, or whichever country is involved, they \ndeny the visa. The alien whose visa was denied doesn't get to sue the \nconsular officers. That alien doesn't get to complain. This is a \ndiscretionary act by a designated agent of the United States of \nAmerica, a sovereign nation. A sovereign nation gets to decide who gets \ninto its country, who does not get into its country, and under what \nconditions they come into their country. That is fundamental.\n  You don't get to sue over it, if you were denied by the consular \nofficial in Cyprus or Poland or the Dominican Republic. That's just it. \nOK.\n  However, if you are approved by a consular official, but that is \nlater revoked and that individual has now landed on American soil \nalready, the consular official's decision to revoke is turned into a \nbig court case. The practice has made visa revocations ineffective, in \nfact, as an antiterrorism tool.\n  This amendment, the Grassley amendment, would treat visa revocations \nsimilar to visa denials because the right of a person to be in the \nUnited States would expire once the visa is revoked, regardless of \nwhether that person is in the United States.\n  I think that is something the 9/11 Commission has suggested we should \ndo. That is a very important issue that I will talk about in a little \nbit.\n  At a judiciary hearing in March of this year the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, said this:\n\n       The fact is that we can prevent someone who is coming in as \n     a guest. We can say you can't come in from overseas. But once \n     they come in, if they abuse the terms and conditions of their \n     coming in, we have to go through a very cumbersome process. \n     That strikes me as not particularly sensible. People who are \n     admitted as guests, like guests in my house, if a guest \n     misbehaves, I tell them to leave. They don't go to court over \n     it.\n  In 2003, the General Accounting Office reported that suspected \nterrorists could stay in this country after their visas had been \nrevoked because of a legal loophole in the wording of revocation \npapers. GAO found the FBI and the intelligence community suspected ties \nof terrorism in hundreds of visa applications but did not always share \nthat information with consular officials properly so that the \napplication could be rejected. So the consular officers granted the \nvisa, not knowing that the applicant may have connections to terrorist \norganizations. Had the consular officials known that, they would not \nhave granted the visa. Maybe the FBI was tardy in giving it to them; \nmaybe it was a product of sensitive information they were not at \nliberty to reveal; maybe they did not discover the terrorist \nconnections until the person got into our country. By the time they got \nthe derogatory information, it was often too late; the visa had been \nissued. Immigration officials could not do a thing about it if the \nperson had already arrived here. We were handicapped from locating the \nvisa holders and deporting them, even if they were terrorists or there \nwere other serious reasons to deny the visa.\n  Revocation of a visa is not a thing done lightly, although as a \nmatter of law, I cannot think there is any constitutional requirement \nthey have any kind of extended procedure. But we have established \nstrong procedures on revocation decisions. To revoke a visa is not done \nlightly. If a consular officer wants to revoke a visa, the case is \nthoroughly vetted. In fact, the final decision cannot be made by the \nconsular official in the Dominican Republic or Cypress or Poland; it \nmust be made by a higher official in Washington.\n  Revocation cannot be based on suspicion. It must be based on an \nactual finding that the alien is ineligible for the visa; in other \nwords, they should not have received the visa. They had the power to \nsay no to begin with. Once the alien is in our country, without \njudicial review, you cannot revoke a visa.\n  The consular official gives the visa holder an opportunity to explain \ntheir case. They may have the visa holder come down to the embassy and \ndefend their position. So when a visa is revoked, it is serious \nbusiness. It takes a good bit of time. But current law handicaps our \nenforcement and makes it nearly impossible to deport the alien if they \nhave already made it to the United States. Current law allows aliens to \nrun to the steps of our country's courts to take advantage of the \nlitigation system. There is no reason for special treatment of those \nwhose visas we revoke simply because they happen to be on land here \nafter we figured out that their permission to come should have been \ndenied.\n  Allowing judicial review of revoked visas, especially on terrorism \ngrounds, jeopardizes classified intelligence that led to the \nrevocation. It can force agencies such as the FBI and CIA to be \nhesitant to share information.\n  Current law could be reversing this very process we set up after 9/11 \nso we could share information more readily among agencies. Our poor \nvisa policies contributed to the events of September 11.\n  Nineteen hijackers used 364 aliases. Two of the hijackers may have \nobtained passports from family members working in the Saudi passport \nmission, in other words, fraudulent passports.\n  Nineteen hijackers applied for 23 visas and obtained 22 visas. The \nhijackers lied on their visa applications in detectable ways. The \nhijackers violated the terms of their visas. They came and went at \ntheir convenience. The 9/11 Commission pointed out the obvious by \nstating that:\n\n       Terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United \n     States if they are unable to enter the country.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended that we intercept terrorists and \nconstrain their mobility. This amendment\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\nwould do that. Allowing aliens to remain on U.S. soil with a revoked \nvisa or petition is a national security concern. It is something we \nshould do something about.\n  Think about it. An individual came into America, approved for a visa, \nand it is now discovered the individual had ties to terrorist \norganizations, may well be deeply connected in some dangerous way where \nthey could threaten the security of the United States, and all we can \ndo is revoke their visa, eventually ask the person to leave, and they \nfile petitions and object and go to court and turn it into a big \nprocess.\n  It is this kind of thing that has the capacity to overwhelm and flood \nour courts and to create circumstances such that the immigration laws \nbecome unenforceable. It is a realistic concern. We have to go back to \nthe basics of immigration and see what this process is all about.\n  A person who comes into any sovereign nation, the United States \ncertainly being one, comes at the pleasure of the United States, at the \nsufferance of the United States. Without a right to stay here, but as a \nfree gift that can be taken away or rejected at any time. An alien is \nnot entitled to stay here. An alien does not have a constitutional \nright to stay here. An alien has no legal right to stay here if he or \nshe is not in compliance with the rules and regulations of the United \nStates. We have designated officials, agents, and officers with the \nprocedures and plans to make those decisions about visas, and we can't \nhave all of those revoked visas turning into lawsuits. I mean, there \nare not enough hours in the day. It can subject our Nation to threats \nin many different and terrible ways.\n  What I would suggest to my colleagues is, let's think about the \nbasics of what immigration is about. It is not a matter of the right of \nsomebody wants to come here. Nobody has a constitutional right, a legal \nright, or a moral right, for that matter, to enter the United States. \nIt is a decision we make based on policies that presumably serve the \nnational interests of the United States.\n\n  If a person is not in compliance after they get here, if a person did \nnot meet the standards when they were admitted, if the person did not \nmeet the standards when they first applied, they should be rejected \nwithout a court hearing or a lawsuit. If they get into this country and \nwe find additional information that would have prohibited them from \ncoming, they can be asked to leave without going through a big trial, \nbecause they do not have that property right or legal right that would \njustify such an action.\n  This is something I have dealt with for some time. I think we can do \nbetter about this area of the law. This was a request from the State \nDepartment which deals with this every day. We need to do better to \nsupport the State Department.\n  When I met with the consular official in the Dominican Republic, he \ntalked about the fraud they see, and it is pretty common. Frequently \npeople produce fraudulent marriage licenses. Sometimes people actually \npretend to be married. Sometimes they just produce documents; they say \nthey are married when they are not married. That makes people eligible \nto come.\n  You know what he said? In all of the time he has been working on it, \nnobody has ever prosecuted someone for a fake marriage license to get \nentry into the United States.\n  When I was U.S. attorney, I prosecuted one or two, anyway. I remember \npeople who created fraudulent marriages to set up to get in the \ncountry. For one reason or another it came to our attention and we \nprosecuted the case. It is a violation of Federal law.\n  What we have got, our guess is, there are so many that people do not \nhave time to do it. But if a person says they are married and they come \nhere to the country, and you find out they are not married, they should \nbe able to depart without having a big trial. You can try them, as I \ndid, and convict them and send them to jail, or give them a \nprobationary sentence for filing a false claim to the Government or \nfalse document to the Government or false claim for entry into the \nUnited States. All that would be criminal, but it takes a tremendous \namount of time, effort, and money to prosecute a case like that, more \nthan probably we can afford to do today. So the better thing is to give \nour people the power to make that decision and move people out if they \nare here on a visa.\n  Now, if they have legal permanent residence or citizenship, of \ncourse, that is not so. If you get a legal permanent resident status, \nthen you have certain rights that go beyond what I described.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership and for \nworking on this amendment. I think it would be a critically important \naspect of any comprehensive reform. I thank the Chair for his patience \nlate into the evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.)
