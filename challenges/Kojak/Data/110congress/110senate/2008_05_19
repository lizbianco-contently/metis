Madam President, I received a call early Saturday morning \nthat Senator Kennedy had taken ill. Since that time, we have heard only \nencouraging words from his doctors and his family. I spoke to Vicki, \nhis wonderful wife, a couple hours ago. He is resting comfortably. He \nis having some more tests run today. He is doing very well. Vicki tells \nme Senator Kennedy is not only up moving around, but over the weekend \nhe was able to watch some movies, but, more importantly, he was able to \nwatch some Red Sox games. I would note in passing, it cannot hurt his \nrecovery that the Red Sox have won three games in a row.\n  Anyone who knows Senator Kennedy and his tremendous work ethic \nrealizes no one is more eager to get back to work than Senator Kennedy.\n  So to my good friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, I say: Rest and \nget well. All of your friends and colleagues in the Senate wish you the \nvery best and look forward to your quick return because there is a lot \nof work we are depending on you to do. We have a number of things, of \ncourse, we were working on together last week.\n  I talked to him Friday at some length. I am going to give a couple \nspeeches--actually three--on Wednesday because we are having \ncelebrations here in the Capitol on the 100th birthday of Senator, \nMajority Leader, and President Johnson. It was interesting to hear \nSenator Kennedy--who had worked with him in all of his capacities, as \nSenator, majority leader, Vice President, and President--some of the \ncomments he had about President Johnson.\n  So we look forward to Ted being back as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4291-6", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I expect the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Steven Agee to a Virginia seat on the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\n  Judge Agee is currently a member of the Virginia Supreme Court. His \nnomination to the Federal bench is supported by both Senators Webb and \nWarner, and I am confident he will be confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  Several weeks ago, I pledged my best efforts to have, by the Memorial \nDay recess, three circuit court nominations completed--by Memorial Day, \nas I said. I explicitly said at that time that ``I cannot guarantee'' \nthree confirmations because the outcome would depend on factors that \nare certainly beyond my control. Still, Senator Leahy and I have worked \nhard to move three appellate nominees this month. Judge Agee is one of \nthose three. The next two it appears, in line are Sixth Circuit \nnominees Raymond Kethledge and Helene White, both of Michigan.\n  These nominees are the product of an agreement between the White \nHouse and Senators Levin and Stabenow. It took about 5 or 6 years to \nwork out this agreement, but we now have a chance to fill the vacancies \non that circuit.\n  Senator Leahy expedited consideration of the Michigan nominees in \nlight of the pledge I made. I did that with the full understanding of \nSenator Leahy. Unfortunately, though, Senators on the Republican side \non the Judiciary Committee have delayed consideration of Judge White.\n  I do not know what you would say about what took place at our \nhearing. Senators have a right to ask questions. They can ask \nquestions. There is certainly leeway. They can basically ask anything \nthey want, and they did. They, following the hearing, asked a total of \n73 separate written questions, and some of them were very, very time \nconsuming. As I said, every Senator has a right to ask questions of a \nnominee, but the number and nature of the questions posed to Judge \nWhite suggest there was more to it than just the questions. They went \ninto some things very personal in nature that I am not certain were \nprobative as to this good woman's ability to be a circuit court judge.\n  In addition, Republicans have insisted that the nomination not move \nforward until Judge White's ABA review is complete. That is fine with \nus. They have that right. But in this case, it is ironic they would \nmake that request since she was rated qualified by the ABA 10 years ago \nwhen Republicans blocked her nomination from moving forward. Since that \ntime, she has been a sitting Michigan appellate court judge.\n\n  It is still possible the Senate will consider these two Michigan \nnominees before the recess. But if it does not happen, it will be \ndespite my best efforts. I indicated I want to do everything I can to \ncomplete this. But we have to have the ABA report, and these questions, \nas I have indicated, have to be completed.\n  It is pretty clear these 34 numbered questions I have talked about--a \nnumber of them were compound questions, and that is how we arrived at \nthe number 73--some of these are straightforward questions about \njudicial philosophy, but there are a number of others that are very \ntime consuming and I am not sure bear on her qualifications. But they \nhave a right to ask those questions.\n  For example, Senator Sessions asked Judge White to compile her \ncaseload statistics as compared with other judges on her court, \nincluding the median time intervals between case filing and date of \ndisposition. Think about that. That is a lot of work, a lot of math. \nSenator Specter asked her to supply names and addresses of the groups \ninvolved in panel discussions, conferences, and meetings she attended, \nas well as numerous unpublished opinions.\n  These are not unreasonable questions, but they are time consuming and \nthey were submitted right before the deadline for submitting written \nquestions to the nominee.\n  In contrast, Republicans asked Mr. Kethledge--the so-called \nRepublican nominee--the other Michigan nominee, only seven questions, \nand they were all pretty easy; none of them burdensome questions.\n  Republicans preferred that Chairman Leahy, I guess, consider other \nnominees before the Michigan nominees, but nothing in my pledge \nregarding judicial nominations deprives Chairman Leahy of his \nprerogative to determine the sequence of nominations that would come \nbefore his committee.\n  No one presumed to instruct Senator Specter about the sequence of \nnominations during the years he served as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. And certainly Senator Hatch exercised the chairman's \nprerogatives freely during the years in which more than 60 of President \nClinton's nominees were denied hearings or floor consideration.\n  Chairman Leahy and I will continue to process judicial nominations in \ndue course, consistent with the Senate's constitutional role. \nConsideration of Judge Agee's nomination tomorrow is consistent with \nthat goal.\n  Madam President, is there going to be a period of morning business \nnow?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this week is a very important week for \nthe United States of America and for the Senate because we will begin \nour dialog about where we are in Iraq today and where we are going in \nIraq in the future; where we are in Afghanistan today and where we are \ngoing in Afghanistan in the future.\n  As part of this dialog we will engage in here in the Senate over the \nnext few days, we will also engage in a major discussion about how it \nis that our Nation should treat those veterans from both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, those veterans who have served our country since our \ncountry was attacked on 9/11.\n  It is important at the outset, as we begin this discussion, to first \nof all pause to remember that there has been a great deal of sacrifice \non the part of Americans in terms of life and blood in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We must remember these warriors, these fighters who have \nbeen fighting for the cause of their country. We must do that every day \nso their contribution is never forgotten.\n  As of today, in Iraq there have been 4,078 Americans who have given \ntheir lives carrying out the orders of their Commander in Chief. In \nIraq, as of today, since the beginning of that war, there have been \n30,004 members of our armed services who have been wounded in Iraq. Let \nme repeat that number one more time: 30,004 members of our armed \nservices who have been wounded in Iraq. In Afghanistan, where we have \nnow been for 7 years, fighting a just war, going after the Taliban--an \neffort that spearheaded and should have succeeded in going after Osama \nbin Laden--in Afghanistan there have been 4,097 Americans who have been \nkilled and 1,044 who have been wounded. For these brave men and women \nwho have served our country and who have given their lives or who have \nbeen wounded in the cause that has been assigned to them, we should \ndedicate the debate we will have on the floor of the Senate in the days \nahead.\n  Today, as we begin that debate, I want to speak about two things. \nFirst, with respect to Iraq, it has been my view for the last several \nyears that we need to have a new direction in Iraq. In December of \n2006, when the Iraq Study Group, headed up by Congressman Lee Hamilton \nand former Secretary of State James Baker, came forward with\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nthe bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations, they came forward with \na coherent set of recommendations about how we ought to move forward in \nthe transition of the mission in Iraq. That was more than a year and a \nhalf ago when those recommendations were coming together.\n  Since then, some of those recommendations have been implemented, but \nby and large the bulk of those recommendations--in what the heart of \nthe recommendations was really all about in the Iraq Study Group \nreport--have not been implemented. The heart of those recommendations \nwas, if the United States did some things right, we would be able to \ntransition in the spring of 2008--which is right now, the spring of \n2008--from a mission of combat over to a mission of support, of \ntraining the Iraqi forces, of providing protection to the American \ninterests in Iraq, making sure we had special forces on the ground to \nchase al-Qaida and other terrorist elements.\n  That is the transition of mission which was called for by the Iraq \nStudy Group, now some time ago, where they said this transition should \nbe completed by the spring of 2008.\n  We are not there yet. One of the things on which we will engage in a \ndebate on the floor this week is where we ought to go. In my view, that \ntransition of mission is something we should require by law. We should \nrequire it because it is the only way in which ultimately we are going \nto be successful in Iraq. It is the only way in which the baton and \nmantle of responsibility which the United States of America has assumed \nfor security in Iraq can be handed over and given to the Iraqi \nGovernment. It is time for the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people to \nstand up for their own nation. The time for the United States of \nAmerica to be doing it on behalf of the Iraqi people has come to an \nend. It will be coming to an end.\n  I hope this debate leads us to find that new direction in Iraq in the \ndays and weeks and months ahead. But there is another element to this \ndebate that we will have this week, and that is how we, as a grateful \nnation, honor the 1.6 million veterans who have served this country \nsince September 11, 2001, when this country was attacked. This week we \nwill have an opportunity to stand for our veterans in a way that walks \nthe walk, not just talks the talk about how great our veterans are--\nbecause they are--but allows us an opportunity to send them an \nunmistakable signal that we, as a grateful nation, are willing and \nwanting to pay them for that sacrifice they have made for our country.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in his second Inaugural Address on March 4, 1865, \nsaid the following:\n\n       With malice toward none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the \n     nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may \n     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves \n     and with all nations.\n\n  Today we will begin the discussion about how we move forward with \nwhat will be known in time as the 21st century GI bill of rights.\n  It is, in our parlance, S. 22, which is a formulation of this 21st \ncentury GI bill of rights which has been put together by none other \nthan Senator Jim Webb from Virginia, who himself has been a great \ncontributor to so many causes for American veterans and who, through \nhis own pen and through his own writing and his own work, has taken the \nlead in making sure we are providing this honor to our veterans who \nhave served since September 11, 2001. For his work, and the work of \ncolleagues who will join him in this effort, we need to pay him tribute \nfor making sure he is making America walk the walk in honoring our \nveterans.\n  I also wish to applaud the great leadership of Senator Hagel, who \ndoes so much to bring that voice of independence and authenticity to \nthe floor of the Senate; to Senator John Warner, who is oftentimes the \nMoses, with his voice leading us out of the wilderness on tough issues \nhere in the Senate; to Senator Lautenberg, who himself was a \nbeneficiary of the GI bill of rights as a World War II veteran and who \ntoday speaks so eloquently on behalf of the veterans and the military \npolicy of our country. And also to all of the other Senators, the 58 \nSenators who have joined us in this legislation, along with Senator \nAkaka, who is the chairman of our Veterans Affairs' Committee, who so \noften is standing to make sure we do not forget what the veterans have \ndone here for us in America, along with Senator Inouye, Senator \nStevens, and others who have been so much a part of this effort.\n  I am pleased that the bill that was reported out of the \nAppropriations committee with the 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, \nincludes provisions to help a new generation of veterans receive the \neducational benefits they have earned through their service in wartime. \nThe 1.6 million soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines who have \nserved in Iraq or Afghanistan over the last 7 years, often with \nmultiple deployments which last up to not only a year but 15 months, \nhave given more than their country could have expected of them. It is \nright and it is proper that their country honor them with the benefits \ncommensurate with their service and with their sacrifice.\n  The GI bill the Congress passed after World War II proved to be one \nof the greatest ideas this country has ever had. That GI bill was based \non a simple but powerful premise: If you served your country in \nwartime, your country would pay for your education. If you served your \ncountry during wartime, your country would pay for your education--a \nsimple but powerful premise.\n  For the 7.8 million World War II veterans who took advantage of the \nGI bill, this great idea opened the doors of opportunity in civilian \nlife. It eased the difficult transition from wartime service to \npeacetime employment and equipped the greatest generation--the greatest \ngeneration--with the education and skills to lead our country into an \nera of prosperity and into an era of growth.\n  Over the last half century, the educational benefits we offer our \nveterans have evolved from the wartime service benefits of the World \nWar II GI bill to a more limited set of educational benefits known as \nthe Montgomery GI bill. Designed primarily for peacetime, the \nMontgomery GI bill helps defray the cost of tuition, but it does not \ncover the full cost of education. Today, almost 7 years into the war in \nAfghanistan and more than 5 years into the war in Iraq, the educational \nbenefits we offer our veterans should reflect the magnitude of the \nsacrifices they are making on our behalf.\n  The 21st century GI bill does this by restoring the principle of the \nfirst wartime GI bill. Under S. 22, servicemembers who have answered \nthe call of duty since September 11 will receive an educational benefit \nthat will cover the full cost of a 4-year public education. The benefit \nwill be available to not only the Active-Duty component but also to \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve, proportional to their amount \nof Active-Duty service since September 11, 2001. It is fitting and it \nis proper that they be included in this benefit.\n  Now, in an unfathomable and incomprehensible way, to me, I know there \nare critics of this bill, including the President of the United States, \nwho said that this bill is too expensive--that this bill is too \nexpensive. To them, I say that providing our servicemembers a \ncomprehensive educational benefit is simply a cost of war.\n  Since 2003, we have spent over $525 billion in Iraq alone--that is \n$525 billion in Iraq alone. This year, we will spend nearly $150 \nbillion in Iraq, over $12 billion a month every month. Compare that to \nthis 21st century GI bill of rights. It will cost between $2.5 billion \nand $4 billion a year--$2.5 billion to $4 billion a year. Think of \nthat. The cost of this new GI bill is about the same as a cost of \nconducting the war in Iraq for 10 days--for 10 days.\n  As we have a duty to provide our men and women in uniform the \nequipment they need to do their jobs, so, too, we as a nation and the \nSenate have a duty to provide them the educational benefits that will \nassist their transition back to civilian life. This should not even be \na close question. This should not even be a debate.\n  In addition to all the opportunities this bill will create for \nAmerica's newest veterans, this bill is a smart investment for both our \nmilitary and our economy. The educational benefits under this \nlegislation would help us rebuild our military.\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\n  Over the last several years, the Army has consistently been missing \nits recruiting goals. As a result, the Army has relaxed its enlistment \npolicies, lowered the standards for signing up new soldiers, and \nimplemented a stop-loss policy to keep soldiers in beyond their \ncontract obligation. This formula is symptomatic of a military in \nAmerica which today is under severe strain. It is a formula that will, \nover time--and it already has--erode the quality of our armed services. \nThe benefits under this 21st century GI bill will reverse this trend by \nattracting a new generation of high-quality recruits who come to the \nservice of their country for the promise of an education in return.\n  S. 22 is a powerful recruitment tool. It is also a very smart \neconomic investment. Each month it seems we read a new report \ndescribing how America is falling behind in education and losing its \nglobal competitiveness. With tuition costs rising, more and more young \nAmericans are finding college out of reach. Ask those young Americans \nin college today or ask their parents today about how far out of reach \ncollege has become for them.\n  Veterans who in another era would have been able to use their \nMontgomery GI bill to pay for college now find their benefits have not \nkept pace with tuition growth. After years of service to their country \nand multiple deployments, college remains out of reach.\n  By making college accessible again to those who have answered the \ncall since September 11, we will be making one of the smartest \ninvestments we can possibly make. By giving veterans a clear path from \nthe military to the classroom, we will be equipping them with the \nskills and knowledge they need to lead our world. We will be helping \nthem fulfill their destiny as the greatest generation of their time, \nleaders in their community, leaders in business, and leaders for \nAmerica and the world in the 21st century.\n  I am proud of all of my colleagues who are behind this bill. I am \nproud of the leadership of Senator Danny Akaka, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. I am proud of Senator Webb, who has led \nthis. I am proud of Senator Hagel, whose principled voice serves our \nsoldiers so well; Senator Warner, whose wisdom and leadership on the \nArmed Services Committee has been so valuable for so many years; and \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Akaka, who both attended college under \nthe GI bill in World War II. I thank each of them for their leadership.\n  I am proud the 21st century GI bill is included in this fiscal year \n2008 supplemental. I am proud we have resisted efforts to weaken the \nbill. I am proud we have the opportunity to honor the service of our \nveterans with this GI bill to better reflect their sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak in support of a new GI \nbill for the 21st century.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and as one of \nthe 8 million veterans who took advantage of the opportunity to attend \ncollege on the original World War II GI bill, I know first-hand the \nvalue of this benefit. It is one of the reasons why I am here today in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Without the generous support I received from the GI bill and the \nmaturity and discipline I gained from my military experience, I am \ncertain that my life would have turned out much differently. Being able \nto attend the University of Hawaii--with all expenses covered--and \nreceiving an allowance of $113.50 a month--gave me the start in life \nthat led to me standing here in this body today.\n  Now we should give that same opportunity to those young people--\nstepping forward--who put themselves in harm's way for our country. \nThat is why I have given my enthusiastic support to the provisions that \nwill come before the Senate later this week in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that would establish a new program of educational \nassistance for veterans and servicemembers.\n  Those provisions are drawn from S. 22,--the proposed Post 9/11 \nVeterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007, which was introduced by my \ngood friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, who serves with \nme on the committee. This is a bipartisan measure that has already been \napproved by the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation will give thousands of young men and women who \nsacrificed for our country the opportunity to return to civilian life \nand pursue a full-time college education without worrying about what \nthey will live on. It makes good on our promise of an education in \nreturn for volunteering to serve in our military and for honorable \nservice.\n  To those who have concerns about the impact that this proposal might \nhave on the Armed Forces ability to recruit and retain quality \npersonnel, there are a number of points which must be made.\n  First, this new GI bill for the 21st century would be a powerful \nrecruitment tool for our military. Our bright, college-bound high \nschool seniors will see this as an attractive way to pay for their \nadvanced education. By completing a 3-year commitment, they will earn a \nbenefit that will allow them to attend school without accumulating \nthousands of dollars of debt.\n  As for retention, the armed services cannot retain those who they do \nnot recruit.\n  In addition, this proposal incorporates a number of tools that the \nmilitary can use to make longer commitments attractive, including \nretention kickers and the option of transferring benefits to family \nmembers.\n  I believe that those who would rely on transferability as an \nincentive to longer service would be disappointed. In 2006, the Army \nbegan offering this option to certain soldiers in critical skill areas. \nLess than 2 percent of the 17,000 soldiers who were given an option to \ntransfer benefits to a spouse accepted it. Now the program has been \nexpanded to permit transferability to children, but much more \nexperience is needed before anyone can positively say that this benefit \nwould have the desired impact on retention.\n  Finally, I want to say a few words to those who are concerned about \nthe cost of the program. I have long said caring for veterans is a \ncontinuing cost of war. This Nation will be paying for the conflicts in \nIraq and Afghanistan for many years. The cost of this program is a very \nsmall portion of the total funds that have already been spent and will \ncontinue to be incurred in the future. As others have pointed out, this \nprogram would be an extremely small percentage of what these conflicts \nare costing us each day.\n  I have worked very closely with Senator Webb in developing this \nlegislation. I take this opportunity to thank both Senator Webb and his \nstaff, especially Phillip Thompson and William Edwards, for their \ncooperation and collaboration. I also thank Senator Johnson and \nAppropriations Committee staff, Chad Schulken, as well as Senator Hagel \nand his staff member, Sarah Pullen for their cooperation and \nassistance.\n  I believe that what the Appropriations Committee has reported, and \nthat will be before us later this week, is a workable and effective \nproposal and I urge my colleagues to support it and the President to \nsign it into law.\n  It is time for a new GI bill for the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4294-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4294-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the out-of-\ncontrol oil prices we are seeing and what we can do about it right now. \nI see we have reached another record in gas prices with the national \naverage topping $3.79 a gallon, and today is the 13th day in a row we \nhave seen an increase in gas prices.\n  It is time Congress be more aggressive at trying to solve this \nproblem. We have taken some action in the last week, both on the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and on the farm bill, trying to put more \nteeth into the CFTC. But we need to do more.\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\n  Democrats certainly want to police the oil and gas markets. We want \nto make sure we are doing a better job at policing these markets and \nrestoring the authority the CFTC once had, and in making sure the CFTC \ndoes its job in preventing fraud, excessive speculation, and market \nmanipulation. But many of my colleagues may not remember exactly how we \ngot to this point after we substantially deregulated the energy futures \nmarket. While the oil futures market may seem like an issue that many \nmay not understand in America, I guarantee my colleagues that oil \nfutures affect the price of gasoline today. In fact, oil futures out to \n2015 are already over $100 a barrel and certainly affect the price of \ngas at the pump. But on a dark December night in 2000--in fact, it was \nDecember 15, the last day of the 106th Congress--an amendment was put \non the Omnibus appropriations bill that received little attention and \nbasically deregulated the energy futures market. That amendment that \nderegulated the energy futures market--the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act--was added quietly to the 11,000-page must-pass \nOmnibus appropriations bill, right when Congress was adjourning. This \nderegulation has had a major impact on what we now lack in the \noversight of markets.\n\n  In fact, we had one analyst, Gretchen Morgenson, being quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       The Commodities Futures Exchange Act was an early Christmas \n     gift to a company that had worked hard to persuade Members of \n     Congress that the electronic energy exchanges and all the \n     trades made on them should be exempt from regulators' prying \n     eyes. The company was Enron.\n\n  So while many of my colleagues may not have realized in 2000 exactly \nwhat was happening, it was clear Enron knew exactly what it was \nlobbying for in getting the Commodities Futures Modernization Act \nattached to the Omnibus appropriations bill. In fact, Enron spent close \nto $2 million lobbying to make sure we deregulated the energy market. I \ncan't tell my colleagues--besides what has happened with the electronic \ntrading of electricity--how much this has impacted the rest of our \nenergy markets that some of my colleagues may not understand.\n  What this CFMA bill did is it substantially deregulated the energy \nfutures market. It did that because it allowed energy futures trading \non dark, opaque markets, it substantially relaxed existing regulation \nof energy trading, and it wholly excluded volatile financial \nderivatives which are at the center of today's credit crisis--credit \ndefault swaps.\n  At that point in time, there were many who were arguing that the CFTC \nshould have had an aggressive role in regulating credit swaps, and that \nbill that was passed, again, on December 15, 2000, at 7 p.m. at night, \non an 11,000-page omnibus bill, basically prevented any regulation \nwhatsoever of credit default swaps. I think many understand now exactly \nhow detrimental it has been not to have more insight into credit \ndefault swaps and the impact they have had on the credit crisis.\n  We had good consumer protection tools in place before deregulation. I \nwish to make sure my colleagues understand that. We had good consumer \nprotection tools in place prior to this deregulation. On all energy \nfutures exchanges, we required records be kept for all trades. Large \ntrades on all exchanges had to be reported to the CFTC, which means \nthat if somebody had a large position in a particular futures or \nderivative contract, they had to report that to the CFTC. There were \nspeculation and position limits required on all exchanges. The CFTC had \nto review all trading for fraud and manipulation and for excessive \nspeculation. That was one of their responsibilities. Also, traders had \nlicensing and registration requirements.\n  So all those things were a part of the regulatory framework the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission used to make sure that all \nenergy markets were not being manipulated and to make sure that \nparticularly on large trades, people weren't using large positions in \nthe marketplace to affect prices. In fact, it led the chairman of the \nCFTC at the time to say:\n\n        . . . Large Trader information system is one of the \n     cornerstones of the CFTC surveillance program and enables \n     detection of concentrated and coordinated positions that \n     might be used . . . to attempt manipulation.\n\n  So here is the chair of the CFTC basically saying that large trader \ninformation is most critical to policing the futures market. Yet that \nis exactly what we gave up on certain exchanges when we deregulated the \nfutures markets. We ended up deregulating large trades reporting to the \nCFTC.\n  So that is what the chairman said about the key tool one uses as a \ncornerstone. Basically, we threw it out and said you don't have to do \nthis anymore--a big mistake and part of the reason we don't have more \ninsight into why oil company executives are saying oil should be $50 to \n$60 a barrel. Yet we are seeing $127 a barrel, and no one can justify, \nbased on supply and demand, why we are here. What we need to ask \nourselves is why we deregulated these markets and are not putting more \nteeth into protecting consumers.\n  So what has happened since deregulation? Well, we created dark \nmarkets with no transparency. That means that trading happens without \ninsight, without those rules I mentioned before. There is no U.S. \nrequirement to keep records. There is no large trader reporting. There \nare no speculation limits. There is a high risk for manipulation and \nexcessive speculation.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what would happen if we did something \nsimilar to other areas of our financial markets and organizations. Many \npeople think of the stock market today and they say: Well, the stock \nmarket must have some oversight. We hear stories all the time about \npeople who have violated SEC rules.\n  Well, that is right. The Securities and Exchange Commission oversees \nthe stock market and uses some of those same tools I mentioned to make \nsure there is oversight. Yes, there is oversight of the stock market.\n  Many people have heard of NYMEX--the New York Mercantile Exchange--\nand wonder whether it meets certain rules such as whether you have to \nregister to be a trader there, whether somebody looks at large trading \npositions, and whether there is excessive speculation. The answer is \nyes, in this case we do have a Federal agency that oversees those \nthings and we do have oversight. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is \nanother trading platform that is instrumental particularly in \nagricultural commodities and agricultural futures. The CFTC oversees \nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange for those same things: trading \npositions; large traders maybe doing untoward things; people have to \nregister; speculation limit; all those things.\n  But now all of a sudden we have a new trading platform called the \nInterContinental Exchange, or ICE, that is largely unregulated. Back in \n2000, Enron helped promulgate this idea that they don't have to meet \nthose same requirements. So here we are. The stock market, including \nNYMEX and Chicago Mercantile Exchange and others, are all subject to \nCFTC oversight requirements. But then a trading platform where energy \nfutures are traded without proper oversight gains a huge market share \nbecause we deregulated that type of over-the-counter exchange in 2000.\n  I can tell my colleagues we need to go back to policing this area of \nenergy futures markets. We are not going to give the consumer the \nconfidence they need to make sure these markets aren't being \nmanipulated or that the price of oil isn't being driven up by hedge \nfund investors and others who happen to have no oversight as our other \nfinancial trading platforms do.\n  So to be clear, ICE is a dark market. That means it doesn't have the \ntransparency. There is no direct CFTC review of trading for fraud, \nmanipulation or excessive speculation. They don't do any of that. They \nalso failed to stop Amaranth, which was a big hedge fund trading in \nnatural gas futures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use such time \nas I might consume.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I was thinking I was \nsupposed to speak at 4 o'clock and the Senator was to speak after me. I \ndon't know how long it might be if she continues. I have a conflict \ncoming on my\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nschedule too. I need about 10 minutes. So my inquiry, before I object, \nmight be how long the Senator might expect to proceed.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I expect to go for probably about another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't object to that, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  So to continue on this point, Amaranth actually tried to make some of \nthese energy futures trades on the NYMEX exchange. What happened is \nNYMEX said: No, you can't hold such large positions on this exchange. \nNYMEX wouldn't allow Amaranth to do it. Instead, they just went to the \nICE exchange--again, without the transparency--and promulgated some of \nthese things which ended up costing consumers billions of dollars.\n  Another product is traded on the ICE, but on an exchange they own in \nLondon, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract, which is a \nbenchmark for crude oil prices. It is interesting because West Texas \nOil does give us some indication about what oil futures are going to be \nand what the price of oil is going to be. Since it started trading on \nICE in February of 2006, the price of crude oil has doubled. So we can \nsee it has had a big impact.\n  I wish to make sure people understand because Amaranth is an example. \nWe had Enron, which had many impacts on the electricity markets in the \nWest. It cost billions of dollars in our State and throughout the west \ncoast. Many of my consumers were greatly impacted by that. Amaranth \ncame along in the natural gas markets and there was similar \nmanipulation. So we saw it in electricity, we saw it in natural gas, \nand now we want to make sure oil markets are being policed. But \nAmaranth, as I said, was told to reduce its positions because the NYMEX \ndidn't like the fact it had large trading positions. Instead of doing \nthat, they switched over to this dark market that is unregulated and \ncontinued to hold these large positions which caused volatility and \nagain, as I said, cost consumers over $9 billion.\n  So where are we today? Well, we have in the farm bill taken a good \nstep forward in trying to put some teeth back into the CFTC, but we \nneed to do more. We need to ensure consistent market rules are there \nfor all U.S. oil trading. We need to make sure our U.S. oil-trading \nplatform has the type of transparency and the bright light of day on \nit. We need to make sure it is subject to U.S. trading exchanges, that \nthose trading exchanges have the oversight of CFTC, and that energy \ntraders can't simply justify any exemption and say the burden of proof \nis on the CFTC.\n  So what are we talking about? Some people say because the West Texas \noil contract is being traded on ICE's London exchange it is an \ninternational exchange. But the crude oil we are talking about being \ntraded is produced in the United States, it is delivered in the United \nStates, it is consumed in the United States, and it is traded in the \nUnited States. The only question we have is if it is regulated in the \nUnited States, and the answer is no, it is being regulated by the \nFinancial Services Authority in the U.K. It is a big question mark as \nto what is causing gas prices to be at $127 a barrel, when energy \nanalysts and oil company executives will tell you it should be between \n$50 and $60 a barrel.\n\n  So if somebody wants to tell you this product is not a U.S. product \nand should be on this exempt ICE exchange, that is buying something \nthey should not be buying. What is important about this is that since \nthis deregulation, we have seen explosive growth in the oil futures \nmarket. In fact, this is 2002, where you can see this on the chart. I \nhope we can get some numbers for 2000. I guess we will probably see \nsomething that is a little more parallel.\n  Look at this futures market, this explosive growth in derivatives \nnow--this huge growth compared to where the stock market is today. So \npeople are investing all this money in what is a dark market--not all \nof it, but a big portion in what is the dark market. Here, again, is \nwhat oil prices were. We created the Enron loophole and then the ICE \nstarted changing the West Texas intermediate oil and the price went up. \nWhen the dark market--the lack of transparency of trading oil futures--\nhappened, the price shot up.\n  We need to get back to the basics. One of the CFTC commissioners \nsaid:\n\n       I am generally concerned about the lack of transparency and \n     the need for greater oversight and enforcement of the \n     derivatives industry by the [United Kingdom's Financial \n     Services Authority.]\n\n  We know that another analyst involved in oil trading said:\n\n       Oil's price records are less due to fundamental changes \n     than the increasing proportion of investor demand driving \n     prices higher. I think we'll achieve a price of $150 in the \n     coming six months.\n\n  That was Eugene Weinberg who said that. The people in Washington \nState cannot afford gas coming from $150 a barrel, and I am sure other \nconsumers across the country cannot either.\n  One of the analysts who spent a lot of time reporting on this said:\n\n       Where is the CFTC now that we need [speculation] limits? It \n     seems to have deliberately walked away from its mandated \n     oversight responsibilities in the world's most important \n     traded commodity, oil.\n\n  I think it is time we get back to the CFTC and their responsibility. \nI will send a letter this week, along with my colleagues--Senator Snowe \nand others--to basically ask the CFTC to reverse its no-action letter \nthat allows trade of crude oil, home heating oil, and gasoline futures \ncontracts on ICE to be exempt from U.S. oversight and ask the CFTC to \nreinstate the authority it has to look at these dark markets.\n  One of the law professors who testified before the committee said:\n\n       The ICE [oil trading] loophole could be ended immediately \n     by the CFTC without any legislation.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join in signing a letter that says \nbasically these markets cannot continue to remain dark. We need, as in \nthe stock market, recordkeeping. We need to have large trade reporting \nso we know who is moving large trading volume and impacting the market. \nWe need speculation limits and we need monitoring for trade and \nmanipulation. These are things we can get the CFTC to do tomorrow.\n  It is time to pop the oil price bubble. It is not based on market \nfundamentals of supply and demand. We owe it to our consumers to make \nsure we are policing energy markets. We are going to do all we can to \nmake sure we restore whatever is the proper oversight to these markets \nto make sure the deregulation that happened in 2000 is put back into \nplace to give consumers more confidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think most of my colleagues may not \nyet be aware, and would probably be shocked to learn, that late \nThursday afternoon during the Appropriations Committee markup, 110 \npages of controversial immigration provisions were added to the war \nsupplemental package in the form of four very significant Senate \namendments to the House messages. It has been less than a year since \nthe resounding defeat of the Senate immigration bill on June 28 of last \nyear, where cloture failed by a vote of 46 to 53. The proponents of \nthat legislation hoped to get 60 votes, and we walked down there in \nfront of the American people and only 46 voted for it and 53 voted \nagainst it.\n  Yet the amnesty proponents--those who want to enact legislation that \nlegalizes their status and forgives criminal activity, as opposed to \ncreating a lawful system of immigration--are obviously continuing their \ndetermined effort to override the will of the American people and \nlegalize the illegal alien population, without Congress acting to \nfulfill its responsibility to secure the border and create a lawful \nsystem of immigration.\n  That is what it is all about. This is a determined effort to push \nthrough the amnesty and the legalization status for people who have \nentered this country illegally subsequent to our 1986 bill, in which we \nsaid we would never have amnesty again, and they continue to seek ways \nto do that. So now they are seeking to attach their plan to a bill that \nprovides necessary funds for our soldiers in Iraq. The 110 pages of \nimmigration provisions now hidden in the supplemental war bill are \noffered in the\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\nform of several amendments. Together, these amendments would legalize \napproximately 3 million illegal alien workers and their family members. \nThey called it AgJOBS light. It is very bad policy, bad legislation, \nand should not become law. I don't think most of the Senators know \nthis, and I ask that you pay attention to this. It would increase by up \nto fivefold the number of low-skilled temporary workers who will come \nto the United States over the next 3 years--5 times the current legal \nrate of 66,000 workers under that H-2B program.\n\n  Some way, we have been allowing more in under that program. Yes, when \nthe economy was booming, we did get up to about 120-some-odd-thousand. \nThis was on that basis even to be at least 2\\1/2\\ times the highest \namount we have ever admitted under H-2B, at a time when people are \nbeing laid off. I understand the experts expect maybe today or tomorrow \na higher unemployment rate to be demonstrated in our country. So why \nare we going to increase 2\\1/2\\ times the immigration under that bill?\n  It would also increase the number of employment-based green cards \nthat will be given out over the next few years by 218,000. It is called \ngreen card recapture. I note that a green card, in effect, gives \npermanent legal status to a person who has a green card, and a \nguaranteed path to citizenship, as long as they don't have some felony \noffense. It would reauthorize the Foreign Investor Visa Program. That \nprogram probably deserves consideration for renewal and \nreauthorization. I just thought we certainly have not discussed it in \nthe Judiciary Committee, where I think it is supposed to be coming \nforward. No hearings have been held on it. It was stuck in while the \nappropriators were considering funding our military men and women in \nIraq and in other places. It was stuck into that without any real \ndebate.\n  The merits of each of these provisions, I suggest, are worthy of \ndiscussion. I have proposed--and I think Senator Saxby Chambliss has \nagreed with me--a genuine temporary AgJOBS worker program that I think \ncould be the foundation for improvement in this area. But that has been \nflatly rejected by those in the West, who seem to be obsessed with a \nprogram that guarantees people a permanent residence in America, and \nmaybe even a pathway to citizenship--those who came here illegally. We \nhave not had hearings on this in the Judiciary Committee, the committee \nof jurisdiction, of which I am a member.\n  I guess the question is, why would they do this? I think it is like \nwe have had time and again--and I hate to say it. It is an effort to \nbury major alterations in our policy of immigration in legislation that \nis rushed through the floor of the Congress, without full consideration \nby the Senators and a full evaluation by the American people. That has \nbeen the problem. They tried to bring up the bill last summer in 1 \nweek. We were able to demand and have some votes and some amendments \nand discussion. When the American people found out what was in it, they \nput an end to it. So many phone calls came in, the entire Senate \nswitchboard shut down. That is when votes started changing from aye to \nnay.\n  I think it is distressing, and it is one reason there is a lack of \npublic confidence in the Congress, because we say one thing in public, \nand we say something else in committee meetings when, apparently, \npeople are not looking so closely.\n  Last summer, the words were: We got the message, America. We \nunderstand now that you do want a legal system of border security \nfirst, before we go through an amnesty proposal. That was what we \ntalked about. That was what I think everybody on both sides seemed to \nagree was the message of that debate. It was the right answer. That is \nwhat the American people instinctively favored. The American people \nwere fundamentally correct on that all along. It was Congress that was \nout of step with morality, law, and propriety. The American people \nspoke to them last summer, and I thought we had gotten the message. But \noh, no, here we come again.\n  You don't see any amendments slipped into these appropriations bills \nthat would actually help us improve the legal system in America, that \nwould actually help this country establish a system of immigration that \nis generous and fair and serves the national interests. Those are not \nintroduced. It is always a way to do a back-door amnesty.\n  Let me say this. We provide each year over a million green cards to \npeople who want to become American citizens. A green card gives them a \nguaranteed permanent residence in America. It puts them on a path to \ncitizenship if they avoid any serious difficulties in the next several \nyears and answer a few English and history questions. This is a \ngenerous nation. We have temporary worker programs that work pretty \nwell. But why is it we seem to be incapable of going on and closing the \nloop and creating a lawful system that actually works? It is \nfrustrating to me. This is not acceptable. This is not an acceptable \nway to do business. We do not need to have the war supplemental tied up \nin this kind of controversial debate. I hope my colleagues will see \nwhat they can do to make sure our troops are funded in a way that does \nnot create an AgJOBS lite legislation that is fundamentally \nunacceptable.\n\n  What does this AgJOBS do? It is 101 pages. It passed by a 17-to-12 \nvote. It would grant 3 million illegal aliens--1.35 million workers, \nplus approximately 1.62 million family members--a 5-year amnesty, or if \nyou would rather call it so, a 5-year legalization to live and work in \nthe United States. For almost all legal purposes, the amendment \nrequires that these legalized illegal aliens be treated as lawful \npermanent residents. They get basically the same status as green card \nholders do, except they do not have guaranteed permanency.\n  Illegal aliens who qualify for the 5-year amnesty are those--get \nthis; this is all it takes to qualify, that you perform agricultural \nemployment for 863 hours or 150 days, 3 months' worth of work, have \nearned $7,000 from agricultural employment over the course of a 4-year \nperiod, anytime from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007. That is \njust last year. This is just last December 31.\n  It is particularly galling to me--just think about this--this Nation \nsays it is serious about controlling illegal entry into America. Every \nSenator I know has repeatedly said: I am for a legal system; I am not \nfor illegal entry into America, I don't approve of that. But we would \npropose legislation--get this--that if you came in last July, and you \nwere able to break through the border barriers that have been put up, \nthe fences, or avoided the National Guard and got into our country \nillegally, you will be given a 5-year legal status in America. See what \nthis is as a matter of consistency and morality? It is an undermining \nrespect of law at its most basic level. It indicates we have not gotten \nthe message from the American people.\n  There is no requirement in this amendment that the illegal alien \nprove they paid their taxes on the wages they obtained when they were \nhere. Examples of who would qualify for this legalization includes any \nillegal alien who arrived as of the end of 2007 and earned $7,000 in \nagriculture that year. Mr. President, $7,000; what is that, 3 or 4 \nmonths?\n  Also covered are illegal aliens who arrived as recently as July of \n2007 and worked 150 days in agriculture before 2008. It covers illegal \naliens who arrived years ago and earned a mere $1,750 for a 4-year \nperiod in agricultural employment. They will qualify. It covers aliens \nwho arrived illegally years ago and worked a mere 37.5 days in \nagriculture a year for 4 years. It will not matter that for the other \n327 days a year, they were not working at all or they were competing \nillegally and improperly with American workers for other jobs that \nmight be available in the economy.\n  I have seen these bills time and time again. We point out these \nloopholes in the legislation. But I just want to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I am pretty well convinced now, having seen it time and time \nagain, that this is no drafting error. This was a deliberate attempt to \nprovide a huge number of persons the opportunity to obtain legal \nstatus, even though they had a most peripheral connection to \nagricultural labor.\n  It also allows spouses and children to receive 5-year visas, allowing \nthem to live and work--and work--in the United States. Illegal aliens \nwhose spouses and children are not already illegally present in the \nUnited States\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nwould be encouraged under this amendment to come to the United States. \nThey would be encouraged to bring them to the United States because the \napplication period does not start for 7 months after enactment.\n  Spouses and children who are in the United States by the time the \nillegal alien applies for and receives this amnesty will also qualify. \nDo you see? So a person makes the application, and he has a powerful \nincentive to bring in his family.\n  Astonishingly, if the spouse or child is caught crossing the border \nillegally--we have to think about this in terms of our commitment to \nthe rule of law. I ask my colleagues to think about it. If a spouse or \na child is caught crossing the border trying to come into America \nillegally in violation of our laws, the bill actually prohibits them \nfrom being deported, as long as they make a claim they are eligible for \nthis amnesty also.\n  Spouses will be given permission to work in the United States in any \njob, not just AgJOBS, even if they were not previously working. The \namendment's flaws are not cured by the fact that the visa sunsets in 5 \nyears. They say: Don't worry, it is only a 5-year amnesty, a 5-year \nlegalization. I can ask seriously, I say to my colleagues and friends \nin the Senate, what will Congress do 5 years from now when a person has \nnow brought their family here for 5 years, they have had 5 years in the \nschool and it will become far more painful to confront their \ncircumstance than if we had not created this legal status to begin \nwith?\n  A real temporary worker program, which I think we can establish and \nis important for America, would allow workers to come for less than a \nyear, but without their families, and to work for a period of time but \nwill return home. That is a temporary worker program, and we could make \nthat feasible. But, no, that is not what this is. It is 5 years with \nyour family, digging and putting down roots, and it is not going to be \nanything Congress wants to wrestle with to ask them then to leave \nAmerica. They will have quite a number of arguments why they should \nstay.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Robert Byrd, \nwas correct when he stated in the committee markup: ``This amounts to \namnesty.''\n  Although the amendment stopped short of giving all illegal aliens who \nget the 5-year amnesty visa an automatic pathway to citizenship, it \nspecifically--get this. This really must be a great lobbying group. We \nneed to find out who lobbies for these people. It stopped short of \ngetting most of the illegal aliens who get the amnesty visa an \nautomatic pathway to citizenship, but it specifically creates a pathway \nto citizenship for sheepherders, goat herders, and dairy workers.\n  Why were they picked out, please tell me? Does this make sense? They \nwould get a 3-year visa which converts to a green card, which is a \npermanent resident status, and with the right within a few years to \napply for citizenship.\n  It is most distressing, and most distressing to me at the most \nfundamental level. We have to think about this. This is just another \nattempt to take action that will eviscerate the rule of law, will \neviscerate the respect we have gradually been gaining. And we could \nhave done it a lot more, but we have made some progress in convincing \nthe world that our border is not open, that it is a lawful system, and \nif they want to come to America, they must come lawfully.\n  I think this is bad national policy because it undermines respect for \nlaw. It says to the rest of the world: Yes, we say we have the National \nGuard there, we say we are building fences, we say we put more Border \nPatrol agents down on the border, but we really don't care. If you can \njust get in and work here a few days, then you are guaranteed to stay \nwith your family, if you can get them in. Even after you apply for this \n5-year amnesty, you can bring your family, and then maybe we will talk \nabout what will happen to you 5 years from now.\n  I note also that one of the key points that ought not to be dismissed \nby the American people is that there is not one provision--not one \nprovision--in this AgJOBS lite to further enforcement--not one--but \neverything there is about ignoring and erasing the consequences that \nnaturally flow from violating the laws of America. That is most \ndistressing.\n  I will take a minute to encourage my colleagues to be aware of the H-\n2B returning worker provisions that have been made a part of the war \nsupplemental, also that have no business being part of that bill. It \nallows any person who has worked in the United States as an H-2B \nworker--that is a low-skilled, nonagricultural foreign worker--in the \npast 3 years to return for another year without counting against the \n66,000 annual numerical cap.\n  The exemption would last through 2011, which is important, and the \nresult could easily be a very large increase in the number of low-\nskilled workers who enter the United States over the next 3 years, and \nthese are not agricultural workers. They will be competing for jobs \nwith American workers.\n  Under the current law, a total of 198,000 workers will enter the \nUnited States on H-2B visas over the next 3 years, 66,000 per year. If \nthis amendment becomes law, the number of low-skilled foreign workers \ninvited into the United States will soar. Up to 300,000 H-2B workers \nwill enter the United States in fiscal year 2009 alone, up to 366,000 \nwill enter in 2010, and up to 432,000 will enter in fiscal year 2011, \nfor a total of up to 1 million workers entering over the next 3 years. \nThat is more than a fivefold increase over the number expected under \ncurrent law. These workers will be competing with American workers in \nconstruction, food production, manufacturing industries, and any other \nindustries of that nature in a time when we have a softening economy \nand job market.\n  Some say we have expanded those numbers to 66,000 and we have gotten \nup to 120,000 some-odd workers, so this is not such a huge increase. It \nis about 2\\1/2\\ times in a time when the unemployment rate is going up \nin America.\n  How did this get in? Did we have any hearings on it? Was the American \ncommunity asked whether they think it is healthy? Did we have any \nexperts talk about what an impact it might have on wages? No, it was \njust slipped in.\n  Hopefully, somehow we can move the war supplemental in a way that \ndoes not create a debate over immigration in the Senate. I don't think \nit is the right thing to do. This legislation should not be attached to \nit. I oppose the AgJOBS lite as vigorously as possible, and I believe \nthe H-2B returning worker number is far larger than it needs to be. I \nhave discussed trying to work out something of a reasonable nature \npreviously, but I was surprised to see this broad piece of legislation \nbe attached to the war supplemental.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4298-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4298-S4301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 JUDGES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to respond to a \nstatement made earlier today by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, on \nthe judge issue. I heard about 25 or 30 minutes ago that Senator Reid \nhad spoken. I pulled together some materials and asked my staff to \nnotify Senator Reid's staff that I would be coming to the floor to \nspeak on this issue, which is my practice when I am going to mention \nanother Senator by name. Senator Reid, in his speech, mentioned me by \nname, stating that I had delayed the nomination of Judge Helene White, \nwho is a nominee to the Sixth Circuit. My preference would have been to \nhave had notice. I have been in the Senate complex since late morning, \nand I invited Senator Reid to come. And, perhaps he can come to the \nfloor now. I would prefer to have this discussion face to face, but we \ncan do it by long distance, through the record, or really short \ndistance--Senator Reid's office is right across the hall from the \nChamber.\n  What is involved here is a very important issue, and that is the \nconstitutional responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent on \nthe nomination of Federal judges. Regrettably, it has been a very sore \nspot in Senate proceedings for the last 20 years. In the last 2 years \nof the Reagan administration, when Republicans controlled the White \nHouse and Democrats the Senate, nominations were delayed; the same \nduring the last 2 years of the administration of President George H.W. \nBush--again, Republicans controlled\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\nthe White House and the Democrats the Senate. Then, during the last 6 \nyears of President Clinton, the situation was worse--exacerbated. Each \nstep along the way, the situation has gotten worse.\n  I voted for President Clinton's qualified nominees and said on this \nfloor that the Republican caucus was wrong to delay them, in a variety \nof ways. But, just as my caucus was wrong then, my caucus is right now. \nWhat the Democrats are doing to President Bush's nominees is wrong.\n  In 2005, this Chamber, this historic Chamber, almost came apart with \na challenge on the traditional right of filibuster with the so-called \nconstitutional or nuclear option. And, now we have a situation where \nthere is, again, a great imbalance. I will not go through the \nstatistics again as to how many more nominees President Clinton got in \nhis 8 years contrasted with President Bush in his 8 years. Those \nnumbers have been on the record too often. I hasten to add on the \nsubject that you can take the statistics in many directions, but let me \nfocus on the specific matter we have at hand.\n  What we have at hand is the nomination of Michigan State Court judge \nHelene White for the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I do not \nthink anybody in the Senate needs to be reminded, but some people \nwatching on C-SPAN2--if there are any--would be well advised to \nunderstand the importance of a circuit court nomination.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States reviews decisions from the \ncircuits, but very few cases are reviewed by the Supreme Court because \nit is very busy. And so, that panel review by three judges on the \ncircuit court is usually the last word on a matter, unless there is a \ncourt en banc. I will not go into details, but that is when all the \njudges of the circuit sit in unusual circumstances. The other unusual \ncircumstance is when the Supreme Court grants certiorari or takes the \ncase, which again is unusual. So, opinions of far-ranging importance \nare decided by the courts of appeals. Very frequently, these decisions \nare 2-to-1 decisions, so one circuit judge has a lot of power to make \nimportant law affecting a lot of people. The interests of individuals, \ncompanies, corporations, the Government, even international affairs are \ndecided by these judges, and these are lifetime appointments.\n  There has been considerable concern and debate in this body about the \ntime the Senate has to consider these matters. Ordinarily, many weeks \npass after the President submits a nomination before a nominee is voted \non here. For example, Peter Keisler had a hearing, and his nomination \nhas been pending for over 690 days. Judge Robert Conrad has waited more \nthan 300 days for a hearing. Steve Matthews--also for the Fourth \nCircuit, from South Carolina--has waited over 250 days for a hearing.\n  Contrast that with what has happened with Judge White. Judge White \nwas nominated to the Sixth Circuit on April 15, 2008, and had a hearing \non May 7, 22 days later. Her hearing record was held open until May 14 \nto receive questions. Her responses to the questions are due by May 23, \nwhich is the last day of the session. If she were to be confirmed soon, \nshe would probably break all speed records. It would probably be the \nequivalent of an Olympic record. I can't be sure of that because I have \nnot checked all the records. I have only had a few minutes to prepare \nto come over here to make this presentation, but, what we do know is \nwhat the attitude of the Democrats was when the shoe was on the other \nfoot.\n  Back in 2001, when Senator Leahy became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, he said:\n\n       There will be an American Bar Association background check \n     before there is a vote.\n\n  Let the record show that there has been no American Bar Association \nevaluation on Judge White up to the present time, and the projection is \nthat it will not be obtained before the Senate adjourns this week.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter dated May 6, 2008, to \nChairman Leahy and myself printed in the Record following the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In 2006, when a hearing was scheduled for Peter Keisler, \n33 days after the nomination, all of the Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee, signed a letter to me in my capacity as chairman asking me \nto ``postpone'' the hearing, citing the concern that:\n\n     . . . the ABA has not even completed its evaluation of this \n     nominee.\n\n  The lack of an ABA rating did not seem to bother the Democrats this \ntime. They ran roughshod right over that practice and held the hearing \n22 days after the nomination was submitted before it was possible for \nthe ABA to complete its rating. We did not have the benefit of the ABA \nevaluation, which is important before the hearing.\n  There have been exceptions on district court nominees. I suppose you \ncould go through the record and find exceptions. You can do that on \nabout everything. But, with a circuit court nominee who is \ncontroversial, where there are questions about her qualifications, it \nis obviously a very bad practice.\n  When the objections were raised to the timing on the Keisler \nnomination, Senator Leahy made the point to me as chairman--through the \nletter from all of the Democrats--that we should not be scheduling \nhearings for nominees before the committee has received their ABA \nratings. I would note that the ABA rating for Keisler was received \nprior to his hearing. So what is good for the goose is, apparently, not \ngood for the gander--bad practice for Keisler equals good practice for \nJudge White.\n  Here is what Senator Schumer had to say about scheduling Keisler's \nhearing within 33 days:\n\n       So, let me reiterate some of the concerns we expressed \n     about proceeding so hastily on this nomination. First, we \n     have barely had time to consider the nominee's record. Mr. \n     Keisler was named to a seat 33 days ago, so we are having \n     this hearing with astonishing and inexplicable speed. The \n     average time from nomination to hearing for the last 7 \n     nominees to that court is several times that long.\n\n  A practice decried in very strong terms by Senator Schumer seems to \nbe okay for Judge White.\n  Without going into very great detail, let the record show that Judge \nWhite has a very extensive record on the state court--many cases to \nconsider and analyze--contrasted with the record of Mr. Keisler, who \nhad never been on the court. But, the mathematics of the situation is \nconclusive.\n  Now Judge White's nomination comes to the floor in the context of an \nagreement having been reached by the leaders of the Republican and \nDemocratic Parties, breaking a stalemate which existed for a long time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The agreement, as accurately stated by Senator Reid \nearlier today, was in this form:\n\n       I cannot guarantee three confirmations because that outcome \n     would depend on factors beyond my control. Still, Senator \n     Leahy and I have worked hard to move three appellate nominees \n     this month. Judge Agee is one of the three. The next two \n     nominees in line are Sixth Circuit nominees, Raymond \n     Kethledge and Helene White of Michigan.\n\n  Well, if Judge White and Raymond Kethledge and even Judge Agee were \nthe only circuit court nominees available, that comment would have some \nrelevance, but there are others who have been waiting a long time. \nPeter Keisler, as I noted before, had a hearing but has been waiting on \nthe committee docket for over 690 days. He could be confirmed easily in \nthe time allotted. When the arrangement was made on April 15, Judge \nRobert Conrad, who had been waiting for a hearing for over 300 days, \ncould have been processed and confirmed. Steve Matthews, who had been \nwaiting for over 250 days, could have been processed and confirmed.\n  So, Senator Reid had plenty of alternatives to deal with. He did not \nhave to move to Judge White and force this phenomenal effort on a rush \nto judgment. Senator Reid sought to rebut that fact in his statement \nsaying:\n\n       No one presumed to instruct Senator Specter about the \n     sequence of nominations during the years he served as \n     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Well, let me point out that no one had to instruct Senator Specter on \ncomity, on courtesy, on consultation with the Democrats. As Chairman, \nnot\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nonly did I never try to ram anything down the Democrats' throat, I went \nout of my way to see to it that they were consulted, that their views \nwere taken into account, and that they were followed in many important \nconsiderations.\n  The White House wanted to have the Roberts confirmation process start \non August 28. I consulted with Senator Leahy, then ranking member. He \nthought that was a bad time, and we discussed it. I came to the \nconclusion--and candidly, would have had it in any event--but consulted \nwith him before going back to the White House and saying: It cannot be \ndone. It is going to be after Labor Day. If you bring back Senators \nduring a recess, before children go back to school after Labor Day, it \nis a bad practice.\n  The hearing was scheduled in a way which comported with what Senator \nLeahy had to say. Nobody consulted me about the scheduling of Judge \nWhite or the other two judges. Next, the White House wanted Justice \nAlito confirmed before Christmas. He had a big record; he had been on \nthe bench for 15 years. I think Judge White has been on the bench at \nleast comparable time, maybe even longer. It was unrealistic to go \nthrough his record in that time frame.\n  I said to the White House and to the President personally: It can't \nbe done realistically.\n  I said: Mr. President, you have the great advantage of never having \nbeen a Senator.\n  And, as a result, those hearings were held in January. Again, before \nthe decision was made, I consulted with Senator Leahy extensively. He \nthought it was a bad idea to confirm before Christmas, and I listened. \nHere again, absent Senator Leahy's view, which I was pretty sure about \nbefore I consulted him, I would have had the same conclusion, but he \nwas consulted, and consulted in advance.\n  So, when Senator Reid says: No one presumed to instruct Senator \nSpecter about the sequence of nominations when he was chairman, he is \nright, but then no one had to.\n  Then we come to the part where Senator Reid mentions me, which, as I \nsaid, was without advanced notice.\n  He said:\n\n       Unfortunately Republican Senators on the Judiciary \n     Committee have delayed consideration of Judge White. They \n     badgered her at her confirmation hearing and then followed up \n     by asking a total of 73 separate written questions, including \n     some that will be particularly time consuming.\n\n  Well, I am not going to take the time to go through the many hearings \nthat I have sat through on that committee for the last 28 years, but \nthe questioning of Judge White was firm, polite, professional, and much \nless intense than many hearings--the Alito hearings, for example, or \nfrom some of the Democratic Senators who questioned Roberts. She was \nnot badgered. Let anybody take a fair reading or review of the video, \nand that can be easily confirmed.\n  Then Senator Reid goes on to say:\n\n       Every Senator has this right to ask questions of a nominee, \n     but the number and nature of the questions posed to Judge \n     White suggest that the Republicans intended to delay the \n     nomination.\n\n  There is not a scintilla of fact to back that up. The need to have \ntime to consider this nomination in this time sequence is obviously \napparent on its face.\n  Senator Reid goes on:\n\n       In addition, Republicans have insisted that the nomination \n     not move forward until Judge White's ABA review is complete.\n\n  Well, having an ABA rating is very fundamental and very basic \nprocedure for every judge.\n  Senator Reid goes on to say again:\n\n       That is their right. But in this case, it is ironic they \n     would make that request since she was rated qualified by the \n     ABA 10 years ago when Republicans blocked her nomination from \n     moving forward.\n\n  Well, that argument is not so specious that it answers itself. A 10-\nyear-old evaluation obviously has to be updated.\n  Now, when Senator Reid objects to the questions we asked her, I take \nissue. We asked her the questions because her answers to the \nquestionnaire were incomplete. She was given a questionnaire shortly \nafter nomination on April 15. It was received by the committee on April \n25. One of the questions in the questionnaire was to give ``copies'' of \nspeeches given.\n  And it further said:\n\n       If you do not have a copy of the speech or a transcript of \n     the tape recording, please give the name and address of the \n     group before whom the speech was given, the date of the \n     speech and the subject matter.\n\n  Her response was:\n\n       Over the years, I have participated as a member of various \n     panel discussions at bench, bar or State or local bar \n     association conferences and meetings. None of these have been \n     recorded or transcribed to my knowledge. I have not retained \n     any notes or outlines.\n\n  But, she has not answered the question as to whom she spoke to or \nbefore. That was the question asked, and it is a relevant question and \nis the standard question for everyone.\n  Next, she was asked to provide unpublished opinions when she was \nreversed. Now, that is a very important question. When a judge is \nreversed, that is a particular area worthy of inquiry. And, again, she \ndid not answer the question by providing the opinions. She certainly is \nin the best position to have those opinions and speeches.\n  Now, how can we confirm a judge where we do not have an opportunity \nto review all the information requested by the Senate questionnaire? \nAnd a good bit of this is not Judge White's fault. A good bit of this \nis the fault of the scheduling, which was determined by the Democrats.\n  So here we have a situation where there was a commitment, albeit with \nlimitations, to confirm three circuit judges before Memorial Day, and \ntoday Senator Reid comes to the floor, with adjournment later this week \nfor the Memorial Day recess, and he is in effect saying: The commitment \nwill not be completed due to circumstances beyond my control, beyond \nthe Democrats' control. It is all the fault of the Republicans.\n  Well, I ask fair-minded Americans, and Americans are fair-minded, \nwhether this is appropriate. I have sought to avoid any \ncharacterizations or any of the vituperative language which has \ncharacterized this body in modern times, as we have had so much \nbickering which the American public is so sick and tired of. I have \ntried to avoid that with a strict factual analysis as to how the \nschedule proposed by Senator Reid is an unconscionable rush to \njudgment, is in violation of the standing practices and procedures of \nthe Committee and the Senate, does not give an opportunity for a proper \nevaluation as to what her record is, and why she should not be \nnominated for a lifetime position on this state of the record.\n  There has been a lot of talk about what the consequences will be of \nthe tactics of the Democrats overall. That is going to be a question \nfor the Republican caucus.\n  At this point, I make only one commitment, and that is, to present it \nto the Republican caucus tomorrow. I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida for waiting. I would say patiently waiting, but only he \ncan characterize his waiting.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                     Idaho Falls, ID, May 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: On behalf of the \n     American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \n     Judiciary, I write to express our concern that you have \n     decided to proceed with the confirmation hearings of Helene \n     N. White to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit and \n     Stephen Joseph Murphy III to be U.S. District Judge for the \n     Eastern District of Michigan, currently scheduled for May 7, \n     before completion of the Standing Committee's evaluation of \n     these nominees. Our evaluations provide a unique window into \n     the nominee's professional strengths and weaknesses, and \n     offer members of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate a \n     unique perspective on the nominees that otherwise would not \n     be available. You and your colleagues have noted at numerous \n     confirmation hearings that the Standing Committee's \n     evaluation is important to what you do.\n       As you know, barring unusual circumstances, the expectation \n     is that the Standing Committee will complete its evaluation \n     and submit its rating within 35 days of receiving a nominee's \n     personal data questionnaire from the Department of Justice \n     and a waiver from the nominee that allows a review of \n     important records. A supplemental evaluation of a nominee \n     whose nomination has been withdrawn or returned and then \n     subsequently resubmitted by the President may require less \n     time to complete.\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\n       The Standing Committee's investigations of these two \n     nominees are under way. Under our normal timetable, it would \n     be reasonable for you to expect to receive our evaluations by \n     the close of this month. It is unfortunate that, during the \n     confirmation hearing, your committee members will not have \n     the benefit of the Standing Committee's comprehensive review.\n       Despite these developments, I assure you that the Standing \n     Committee will continue its work evaluating both nominees and \n     will make every effort to expedite the process without \n     compromising the thoroughness or quality of its evaluation. \n     This is consistent with our previous practice when, on rare \n     occasions, we have been confronted with a similar situation. \n     Our evaluation of each nominee will be submitted to your \n     committee and to the Administration as soon as reasonably \n     possible. We sincerely hope that the Judiciary Committee will \n     defer further consideration of, and that the Senate will take \n     no action on, these two nominees until our evaluations are \n     submitted and can help inform your critical deliberations.\n       It is our belief that by evaluating the integrity, \n     professional competence and judicial temperament of each \n     nominee, the ABA helps to ensure confirmation of the best \n     qualified individuals for lifetime appointments to the \n     federal bench. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \n     Judiciary looks forward to continuing to work with you in \n     pursuit of that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                C.

Madam President, and, of course, to my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, this Senator certainly did \nnot mind waiting because it was a matter of great concern. And it was \nobvious to this Senator in the elevator that the Senator from \nPennsylvania had a matter of great weightiness that was something that \nhe wanted to share with the Senate.\n  I shall always defer to the eminent scholar of the Senate, and I am \nglad that the Senator has spoken, and spoken his mind. This Senator \nwould like to speak his mind on a subject that is heavy on the hearts \nof the American people; that is, what is the future of their health \ncare.\n  It is clear people are concerned because health care has become \nsomething that dominates someone's thinking, if they do not have the \nassurance of having that health care. The number of insured has reached \n47 million people. It looks like that number is going to increase, \nparticularly as we are going into an economic downturn that plagues us \nand seems it will continue to do so. In the meantime, the American \npeople also know health care costs are increasing at a rate much higher \nthan their average paycheck. So that worries the American people.\n  It is a fact that Americans spend more money on health care than any \nother country in the world. Sometimes we don't have as good results. \nFor example, one recent study says life expectancy among certain groups \nof women in the United States is actually going down due to the \nprevalence of growing chronic disease.\n  In Florida, the problems are no less severe: 19 percent of all \nchildren in Florida are uninsured, one of the highest rates in the \ncountry; 25 percent of all nonelderly Floridians are uninsured, a \nquarter of the nonelderly Floridians, those not covered on Medicare. Of \ncourse, the people are getting concerned because we in Washington are \nunable, between the executive and the legislative branches, to strike a \nsolution.\n  The long and short of it is, there are some solutions that are \nstarting to percolate to the top. There is one that has 7 Democrats and \n7 Republicans, 14 of us, bipartisan cosponsors. What it does is, it \ninsures everybody universal coverage, the 47 million people who now do \nnot have health insurance who, by the way, get health care because they \nget it at the most expensive place when they get sick, which is the \nemergency room, and they get it at the most expensive time, because \nthey haven't had preventive care, when the sniffles turn into pneumonia \nso the treatment is all the more expensive, so the most expensive place \nat the most expensive time. Guess who all is paying for it. The rest of \nus are paying for it because they do not pay and do not have the health \ninsurance that goes into the overall absorption of those costs.\n  The rest of us, who are fortunate to have health insurance, pay in \nthe rates we pay for the care we get. That is one important principle \nof what this group of 14 bipartisan Senators, led by Senator Wyden and \nSenator Bennett, have come out with.\n  The next important principle of this proposal for completely \nrevamping and reforming the health insurance delivery system is that \nyou let the principle of insurance work for you. That is, to get the \nlargest possible group--in other words, millions of people--over which \nto spread the health risk. So if you spread that health risk over \nmillions of people who are representative of the whole population, \nyoung and old, sick and well, you are going to bring down the per-unit \ncost for the premium per policyholder. That is in significant contrast \nto the fact of a small group, where the actuarial soundness in order to \nset the premiums for a small group--let's say 5 or 10 people, just a \nfew lives over which to spread that health risk--is extremely high.\n  That is one of the reasons why in taking that principle of insurance, \nyou have to decouple from saying that insurance should be organized on \nthe basis of an employer. If an employer is large, with 100,000, a \ncouple hundred thousand lives, then, in fact, you have a large \npopulation over which to spread the health risk. However, if the \nemployer is a mom-and-pop grocery store, with only a handful of lives, \nyou see the prohibitive cost of that insurance and, therefore, what is \nhappening is, employers are at the point that they are not able to \nafford it anymore. More and more people of those 47 million in this \ncountry who are not insured, in fact, are adding to those rolls.\n  So what this bipartisan bill, called the Healthy Americans Act, is \nattempting to do is to say: We are going to bring in all those people \nout there who are uninsured so we spread the base, and we are going to \norganize the private marketplace upon which private insurance companies \nwill compete for that business. We are going to organize it ideally \naround millions of people. The way the bill is structured, it organizes \nit around the State. But if that State is a small one, there is nothing \nthat would prohibit that State from joining with several other small \nStates to create a sizable population that the health insurance \ncompanies would, in fact, compete for.\n  Then, the next principle in this insurance is that the consumer will \nhave choice. The basic underpinning of the minimal value of a health \ninsurance policy is the same kind we have. We, as Federal employees, \nhave a minimal health benefit package from the Federal Government. We \nspread our insurance cost over 9 million Federal employees and Federal \nretirees. Therefore, we can get the economies of scale and let the \nFederal size work for us. So, too, the reorganization in this bill, the \nHealthy Americans Act, to allow the greater numbers to bring down that \nper-unit cost or the cost, in other words, of what the individual \npolicyholder makes.\n  It is a very complicated system, how you transition out from an \nemployer. There is a certain amount that the employer has to pay into \nthe system, according to the size and the payroll. Individuals would \nhave the responsibility of paying for their health insurance. They \nwould pay for that by deductions from the Federal income tax, just like \nwithholding tax is deducted now. By decoupling from their employer's \ninsurance, if they chose to do that--and if they wanted to stay with \nthe employer, they could, but by decoupling, they would not get less \nmoney because there would be the so-called cashing out of the employee, \nso the employee would get the same financial benefit from the employer \nthey got before, when the employer was paying for their health \ninsurance premiums. It is all very complicated.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has done a cost analysis and says \nunder this law the Federal Government will break even financially in \nthe year 2014, when it is implemented, if it were to first be \nimplemented starting this year. So it basically requires the \nresponsibility on the individual, the employers, and the Government to \ncome together to make this funding for health care work. You get the \nefficiencies of competition in the private marketplace. You get the \neconomy of scale. That economy of scale is not only brought in by \nexpanding the pools\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nover which that insurance is applied but expanding those pools even \nmore by bringing in the 47 million uninsured.\n  The bill emphasizes prevention to improve the health of Americans. It \ncertainly improves their access to care, once they get sick, and also \naccess to care by giving them preventive incentives to go in and do the \nkind of things with medical advice before they would ever get sick in \nthe first place.\n  There are things in the bill that, as we continue to discuss it, \ncertainly I wish to see. I wish to make absolutely sure that those \ncurrently covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nwould be folded into this, as well as Medicaid, which would be folded \ninto the program, I wish to make sure they receive affordable insurance \nof quality comparable to or better than what they currently receive. \nThere are other concerns that will come up from time to time.\n  There is no one who has filed this legislation who thinks it is going \nto be enacted or seriously taken up this year, but there has to be a \nstarting point. A great responsibility will rest on the shoulders of \nthe next President because the American people are not only crying out \nfor health care reform, they are demanding it. Because the cost of that \nhealth care is extending beyond their reach, it is incumbent upon us to \nbe visionary and creative. It is certainly incumbent upon the next \nPresident to be visionary and creative and cooperative, cooperative \nwith the Congress so we can forge a solution to help America solve her \nhealth insurance problem.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Although not part of the official \n     budget request, and therefore not reflected as such in the \n     tables accompanying this report, the Committee finds merit in \n     many of the proposals and has recommended funding for them.\n       Iraq and Afghanistan.--The administration's request for \n     military construction funding in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \n     locations in the Central Command Area of Responsibility \n     totals $1,590,950,000, of which $976,150,000--61 percent--is \n     for construction in Iraq alone.\n       Given the pressing need for infrastructure investment \n     within the United States, the Committee has closely examined \n     the entire CENTCOM construction request, with particular \n     attention to Iraq. The Committee is mindful of the ongoing \n     operational requirements and continued security concerns \n     facing U.S. military personnel in Iraq, and has recommended \n     funding for projects that reflect these priorities. With the \n     exception of funding for certain items, such as landfills and \n     incinerators, intended to expedite the closure of U.S. bases \n     in Iraq, the Committee has continued to limit military \n     construction funding to those bases in Iraq that are intended \n     to be enduring locations.\n       The Committee remains strongly opposed to the permanent \n     basing of U.S. military forces in Iraq, and has again \n     included bill language prohibiting the obligation of funds \n     appropriated for military construction in Iraq until the \n     Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committee that none of \n     the funds are to be used to establish permanent military \n     bases in Iraq. The Committee is also concerned with the \n     impact that a future Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq \n     could have on the current strategic plans and associated \n     construction program to consolidate U.S. forces in Iraq into \n     eight enduring locations. In an effort to provide a blueprint \n     on which to establish a basing agreement, the Secretary of \n     Defense is directed to provide to the Committee, no later \n     than 30 days after enactment of this act, an updated Master \n     Plan for U.S. basing in Iraq, including an inventory of \n     installations that have been closed; those that are scheduled \n     to close and the timeline for their closure; and a finite \n     list of enduring locations describing the mission, military \n     construction requirements, and projected U.S. military \n     population of these locations.\n       Child Development Center Initiative.--Recognizing the \n     importance of quality child care resources for military \n     families, the Committee has been very supportive of \n     accelerating the construction of child development centers on \n     military installations. In the Fiscal Year 2008 Military \n     Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, Congress added more than $100,000,000 \n     over the President's budget request to fund 13 additional \n     child development centers at U.S. military bases. The \n     Committee, therefore, supports the Department's proposal to \n     use emergency supplemental funding to advance the \n     construction of 20 child development centers currently \n     programmed for construction in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. \n     The Committee further recommends that the 11 child \n     development centers included in the President's fiscal year \n     2009 budget request also be advanced into the supplemental \n     funding bill to ensure that the most urgently needed centers \n     are among the first to be funded.\n       Army Barracks Improvements.--The Committee is deeply \n     concerned about the deplorable conditions that have been \n     uncovered in some permanent party Army barracks, including \n     those which house soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan. The Army created a Permanent Party Barracks \n     Modernization Program in 1994 to eliminate inadequate \n     barracks. However, this program is not projected to be \n     completed until 2013. Given this timeline, it is unacceptable \n     that the Army has allowed existing permanent party barracks \n     to fall into such abject disrepair. This is not the way the \n     Committee expects the Army to treat its soldiers returning \n     from combat. While many of the repairs and upgrades to \n     existing barracks can be accomplished with Sustainment, \n     Restoration, and Modernization [SRM] funds, the Committee \n     believes that additional Military Construction funds should \n     be allocated to address urgent major renovations and barracks \n     upgrades. The Committee therefore recommends an appropriation \n     of $200,000,000 for the Army to undertake major improvements \n     to existing barracks and accelerate the construction of new \n     barracks. The funding is provided subject to the development \n     of an expenditure plan to be submitted to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.\n\n                      Military Construction, Army\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$3,927,893,000\n2008 supplemental estimate................................1,440,750,000\nCommittee recommendation..................................1,170,200,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $1,170,200,000 for Military \n     Construction, Army, instead of $1,440,750,000 as requested. \n     In addition to funding projects directly in support of the \n     wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the recommendation includes \n     $137,200,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012, \n     for the construction of 15 child development centers at U.S. \n     Army installations as proposed by the administration.

The Committee \n     endorses the position of the authorizers, that the \n     construction of powerplants at these locations is premature \n     and of primarily long-term benefit, and does not recommend \n     funding for them. The Committee also recommends no funding \n     for several additional Army requests for Iraq, including a \n     warehouse and helicopter parking apron at Camp Speicher, \n     totaling $66,000,000, and $72,000,000 for several projects, \n     including a gym, dining hall, base exchange, and housing \n     units, intended to upgrade Camp Delta in southeastern Iraq to \n     an enduring Contingency Operating Base [COB]. The Committee \n     questions the justification for increasing the number of \n     enduring U.S. military bases in Iraq from eight to nine at a \n     time when the goal of U.S. military and administration \n     officials is to reduce the level of U.S. troops in Iraq as \n     security conditions permit. The Committee also notes that the \n     original description of the request, included in the February \n     4, 2007, budget submission, was for Facilities Replacements \n     at various existing COBs, and it was not until May 5, 2008, \n     that the Central Command provided Congress with the revised \n     justification data for projects requested to establish a new \n     COB. Based on the process, assumptions, and justification \n     data on which these requests are based, the Committee \n     believes they are premature and do not meet the standard of \n     urgent requirements.\n\n              Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$2,187,837,000\n2008 supplemental estimate..................................237,505,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................300,084,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $300,084,000 for Military \n     Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, instead of $237,505,000 \n     as requested.

However, the \n     Committee recognizes that basic utility and operational \n     ground infrastructure is required to execute the current \n     expeditionary mission at Camp Lemonier, and therefore \n     recommends funding three projects that were authorized but \n     not funded in the regular fiscal year 2008 military \n     construction appropriations act.

Operating under a \n     national memorandum of agreement with the Department of \n     Defense [DOD], VA polytrauma rehabilitation centers have \n     provided treatment and rehabilitation care to severely \n     injured combat personnel requiring polytrauma inpatient \n     rehabilitation.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs currently operates four \n     Level 1 polytrauma rehabilitation centers within existing VA \n     hospital facilities. In fiscal year 2007, Congress provided \n     emergency funding for the VA to establish a fifth Level 1 \n     polytrauma rehabilitation center. The care that the VA is \n     providing military personnel wounded in combat is \n     exceptional. However, space in the existing facilities is \n     generally inadequate, with cramped quarters and treatment \n     facilities scattered throughout hospital campuses. These \n     inefficiencies are particularly difficult for patients with \n     mobility issues, compromised immune systems, and those \n     suffering from psychological wounds. In an effort to \n     accelerate the VA's planned expansion and consolidation of \n     polytrauma rehabilitation centers on existing hospital \n     campuses as outlined in the department's February 2008 Five \n     Year Capital Plan, the Committee recommends providing \n     $437,100,000 to fully fund the design and construction of \n     these crucial projects.\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 1301. Provides an additional appropriation to Military \n     Construction, Army, for the acceleration and completion of \n     child development center construction.\n       Sec. 1302. Provides an additional appropriation to Military \n     Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, for the acceleration and \n     completion of child development center construction.\n       Sec. 1303. Provides an additional appropriation to Military \n     Construction, Air Force, for the acceleration and completion \n     of child development center construction.\n       Sec. 1304. Provides an additional appropriation to Military \n     Construction, Army, for the acceleration of barracks \n     improvements at Department of the Army installations.\n       Sec. 1305. Prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from \n     collecting certain debts owed to the United States by members \n     of the Armed Forces and veterans who die as a result of an \n     injury incurred or aggravated on active duty in a combat \n     zone.\n\n                               CHAPTER 4\n\n     Subchapter A--Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2008\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The budget request totals $6,547,408,000 in emergency \n     supplemental funds for fiscal year 2008, and the State, \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     161) provided $1,473,800,000 for immediate requirements. The \n     Committee recommendation for Department of State and Foreign \n     Operations totals $5,254,608,000, which is $181,000,000 above \n     the pending budget request.\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n                   Administration of Foreign Affairs\n\n\n                    DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$5,322,719,000\n2008 supplemental estimate................................1,708,008,000\nCommittee recommendation..................................1,413,700,000\n\n       The budget request included $2,283,008,000 for Diplomatic \n     and Consular Programs, of which $575,000,000 was appropriated \n     in the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-161) for operations and security at the \n     United States Embassy in Iraq.\n       The Committee recommends an additional $1,413,700,000 for \n     Diplomatic and Consular Programs, which is $294,308,000 below \n     the pending request. Within the amount provided, $212,400,000 \n     is for worldwide security protection. Funds for diplomatic \n     and consular programs are to be allocated as follows:\n\n                                        DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS\n                                            [In thousands of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Pending         Committee       Change from\n                          Activitiy                                request       recommendation      request\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIraq Diplomatic Operations...................................        1,545,608        1,095,000         -450,608\nAfghanistan--Operations and Worldwide Security Protection....          162,400          195,200          +32,800\nPakistan--Operations.........................................  ...............            7,500           +7,500\nTibet........................................................  ...............            5,000           +5,000\nWestern Hemisphere Travel Initiative.........................  ...............            1,000           +1,000\nWorldwide Security Protection................................  ...............           50,000          +50,000\nCivilian Workforce Initiative................................  ...............           60,000          +60,000\nPublic Diplomacy.............................................  ...............            5,000           +5,000\n                                                              --------------------------------------------------\n      Total, Diplomatic and Consular Programs................        1,708,008        1,413,700         -294,308\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Afghanistan.--The Committee recommends $195,200,000, which \n     is $32,800,000 above the request, for necessary expenses for \n     diplomatic and security operations in Afghanistan. Of this \n     amount, $162,400,000 is for enhanced security operations, \n     including additional high threat protection teams, increased \n     overhead cover and physical security measures, replacement of \n     armored vehicles, and local guard service. In addition, \n     $14,000,000 is for the establishment of a Department of \n     State-managed air transport capability in Afghanistan for \n     Department of State and United States Agency for \n     International Development [USAID] personnel, primarily for \n     medical evacuation and other security-related operations. \n     Finally, $18,800,000 is for support of operations and \n     personnel for Provincial Reconstruction Teams [PRTs] in \n     Afghanistan.\n       Iraq.--The Committee recommends $1,095,000,000 for the \n     diplomatic and security operations of the United States \n     Embassy in Iraq, which is $450,608,000 below the pending \n     request. The cost of operations of the United\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\n     States Embassy in Iraq totals $2,086,000,000 for fiscal year \n     2008 including $1,095,000,000 provided in this act, \n     $575,000,000 provided as bridge funding in Public Law 110-161 \n     and $416,000,000 in funds carried over from prior year \n     appropriations. Of this amount, nearly $900,000,000 is for \n     supporting security requirements for diplomatic and \n     development personnel in Iraq.\n       The Committee provides funding for Embassy operations, \n     security, logistics support, information technology and \n     operations of PRTs. Congress has provided an additional \n     $196,543,000 since fiscal year 2006 for additional facilities \n     requirements identified by the Department of State, as \n     follows: extend the perimeter wall; construct a dining \n     facility; construct additional housing; construct a tactical \n     operations center for Diplomatic Security; construct a static \n     guard camp; and construct overhead cover. The actual cost of \n     building the New Embassy Compound [NEC] has reached a total \n     of $788,543,000 to date.\n       The number of permanent and temporary personnel assigned to \n     Iraq, with the exception of USAID, should be decreased to \n     accommodate all personnel within the NEC and any improvements \n     which can be made with previously appropriated funds. USAID \n     will play a critical role in assisting the Government of Iraq \n     in effectively allocating its budgetary resources.\n       The additional $43,804,000 requested for follow-on projects \n     for the NEC in Baghdad is not included. At least $77,027,000 \n     in prior year funding programmed for follow-on projects is \n     available for obligation and these funds should be used to \n     provide secure housing for a smaller number of personnel.\n       None of the funds provided under this heading in this act \n     shall be made available for follow-on projects, other than \n     the proposed funding for overhead cover. The Department \n     should include a detailed plan for the use of funds for \n     follow-on projects as part of the spending plan required by \n     this act.\n       Due to an extended accreditation and verification process \n     and the addition of follow-on projects, occupancy of the NEC \n     offices and housing has been delayed. This rigorous process \n     to address and validate whether the NEC was constructed to \n     code and contract specifications was supported. Now that the \n     process is complete, occupancy of the offices and housing \n     should proceed without delay in order to provide the maximum \n     protection to United States personnel.\n       The benefits of co-location of the Departments of State and \n     Defense in the NEC is recognized. However, the proposed New \n     Office Building and the Interim Office Building \n     reconfigurations are projected to delay occupancy of NEC \n     offices by up to 1 year. Given the difficult security \n     environment in Baghdad, this lengthy delay is not acceptable. \n     The Departments of State and Defense are expected to consult \n     with the Committees on Appropriations on options for moving \n     forward with limited co-location plans in the most \n     accelerated, secure, and cost effective manner. Any future \n     construction in Iraq shall be subject to the Capital Security \n     Cost Sharing Program, in the same manner as all other embassy \n     construction projects worldwide.\n       There is a concern that private security contractors have \n     been utilized without the necessary authority, oversight, or \n     accountability. The Department of State is directed to \n     provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations not \n     later than 45 days after enactment of this act on the \n     implementation status of each of the recommendations of the \n     October 2007 report of the Secretary of State's Panel on \n     Personal Protective Services. The Department of State is \n     encouraged to aggressively review security procedures and \n     seek the necessary authority to ensure that increased \n     security is achieved with effective oversight and \n     accountability.\n       Pakistan.--The Committee recommends $7,500,000 for \n     operations, security, and personnel engaged in diplomatic and \n     economic development activities in the Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas along the Pakistan and Afghanistan border.\n       Sudan.--The Committee provides resources to support the \n     diplomatic mission in Sudan including the United States \n     Special Envoy for Sudan.\n       Tibet.--The Committee recommends up to $5,000,000 for the \n     establishment of a U.S. Consulate in Lhasa, Tibet, and \n     directs that the Department of State shall not consent to the \n     opening of a consular post in the United States by the \n     People's Republic of China until such time as such United \n     States Consulate is established.\n       The Committee directs that not later than 90 days after \n     enactment of this act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing efforts \n     taken by the Department of State to establish a U.S. \n     Consulate in Lhasa, Tibet and a description of actions by the \n     Government of the Peoples Republic of China to undermine \n     support for Tibet in the United States, including in the \n     media, academia, and political arenas.\n       Local Guard Forces--Worldwide Security Protection.--The \n     Committee recommends $50,000,000 above the request for \n     worldwide security protection. The amount provided is \n     available to restore 100 positions in the global diplomatic \n     security guard force that were redirected to Iraq to address \n     urgent security requirements for United States personnel \n     elsewhere in the world.\n       Civilian Workforce Initiative.--The Committee recommends \n     $60,000,000 to increase the civilian diplomatic capacity of \n     the Department of State to meet the increasing and complex \n     demands of diplomacy in the 21st century. Within the total, \n     $30,000,000 is for the initial development and deployment of \n     a civilian capacity to respond to post-conflict stabilization \n     and reconstruction challenges and $30,000,000 is to \n     strengthen capabilities of the United States diplomatic corps \n     and promote broader engagement with the rest of the world, \n     including expanding training and enhanced interagency \n     collaboration.\n       The Committee provides funds to replace Foreign Service \n     positions worldwide which were previously moved to Iraq and \n     to increase the number of positions participating in critical \n     needs foreign language training. The Department of State has \n     transferred approximately 300 Foreign Service positions from \n     embassies around the world to Iraq and to associated language \n     training, leaving key posts understaffed. These funds are to \n     be used to support United States foreign policy in priority, \n     understaffed regions, particularly South and East Asia, the \n     Western Hemisphere, and Africa.\n       Funds made available for the civilian stabilization \n     initiative are for the Active and Standby Response Corps \n     portion of the initiative and to enhance operations of the \n     Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and \n     Stabilization. In addition to the funds provided to the \n     Department of State, $25,000,000 is appropriated in this act \n     under the heading, ``Operating Expenses of the United States \n     Agency for International Development'' to implement the USAID \n     portion of the civilian stabilization initiative. The funding \n     request for the Civilian Response Corps will be considered as \n     part of the fiscal year 2009 appropriations process and none \n     of the funds provided in this act are to be used to implement \n     the Civilian Response Corps portion of the initiative.\n       Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.--The Committee \n     recommends not less than $1,000,000 to expand public outreach \n     efforts related to implementation of the Western Hemisphere \n     Travel Initiative [WHTI]. With WHTI implementation occurring \n     as early as June 2009, there is concern with the lack of a \n     comprehensive, coordinated plan between the Department of \n     State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United \n     States Postal Service to broadly disseminate information to \n     the traveling public concerning the final WHTI implementation \n     requirements at the Nation's land and seaports. The \n     Department of State is encouraged to provide significantly \n     increased outreach to border communities, including through \n     radio, print media, and additional passport fairs.\n       Buying Power Maintenance Account.--The Committee provides \n     authority to transfer funds available in this act, and in a \n     prior act, to the Buying Power Maintenance Account in \n     accordance with section 24 of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act, to manage exchange rate losses in fiscal \n     year 2008.\n       Public Diplomacy.--The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for \n     the Office of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs to expand \n     new media for targeted Arabic language television programs \n     for the purpose of fostering cultural, educational, and \n     professional dialogues through indigenous Arabic language \n     satellite media.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n2008 appropriation to date..................................$33,733,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................12,500,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $12,500,000 for \n     Office of Inspector General at the Department of State, which \n     is $12,500,000 above the pending request. Of the total, \n     $5,000,000 is to enhance the Department of State Inspector \n     General's oversight of programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     $2,500,000 is for operations of the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction [SIGIR], and $5,000,000 is for \n     operations of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction [SIGAR].\n       The Inspectors General of USAID, the Department of State, \n     the Department of Defense, the Government Accountability \n     Office, SIGIR, and SIGAR, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     should coordinate and de-conflict all activities related to \n     oversight of assistance provided for Iraq and for Afghanistan \n     security, stability, and reconstruction. Oversight of funding \n     provided in this act and prior acts for assistance for Iraq \n     through the foreign operations accounts shall be primarily \n     the responsibility of the SIGIR. The Department of State OIG \n     shall have responsibility for oversight of funding provided \n     for diplomatic operations and facilities. The Department of \n     State or the USAID Office of Inspector General should be \n     designated as the lead for any investigations or audits of \n     worldwide programs as they relate to the specific programs in \n     Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\n               EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$501,347,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................10,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $10,000,000 for \n     Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs. These funds shall \n     be used to expand educational and cultural exchange \n     opportunities through youth programs, especially to learn \n     English, and undergraduate and graduate academic exchange \n     programs, including with community colleges, in order to \n     reach a greater number of underserved, disadvantaged young \n     people in Africa and the Western Hemisphere.\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\n            EMBASSY SECURITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$1,425,574,000\n2008 supplemental estimate..................................160,000,000\nCommittee recommendation.....................................76,700,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $76,700,000 for \n     urgent Embassy security, construction, and maintenance costs, \n     which is $83,300,000 below the request. The funds are to \n     construct 300 secure apartments and a secure office building, \n     including the necessary perimeter security, utility, and \n     dining facilities, for United States Mission staff in \n     Afghanistan. Currently, there are a small number of permanent \n     construction apartments and the majority of diplomatic and \n     Mission personnel live in structures with limited protection. \n     Additional funds for this purpose are provided in subchapter \n     B.\n\n                      International Organizations\n\n\n              CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$1,343,429,000\n2008 supplemental estimate...................................53,000,000\nCommittee recommendation.....................................66,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $66,000,000 for \n     Contributions to International Organizations, of which, \n     $53,000,000 is for United States contributions to the U.N. \n     Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the U.N. Assistance \n     Mission in Iraq, as requested. Funding is also provided to \n     meet fiscal year 2008 assessed dues to organizations whose \n     missions are critical to protecting United States national \n     security interests, including the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n\n\n        CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$1,690,517,000\n2008 supplemental estimate..................................333,600,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................383,600,000\n\n       The budget request included $723,600,000 for contributions \n     for International Peacekeeping Activities, of which \n     $390,000,000 of funds designated as an emergency was provided \n     in the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-161) for the United States contribution to \n     the United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping mission \n     to Darfur [UNAMID].\n       The Committee recommends an additional $383,600,000 for \n     assessed costs to U.N. peacekeeping operations. Within the \n     total under this heading, not less than $333,600,000 is \n     provided for UNAMID, equal to the request. The Committee \n     recommends $50,000,000 to meet fiscal year 2008 assessed dues \n     for the international peacekeeping missions to the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti, Lebanon, \n     Liberia, and southern Sudan.\n\n                             RELATED AGENCY\n\n                    Broadcasting Board of Governors\n\n\n                 INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $3,000,000 for \n     International Broadcasting Operations to continue increased \n     broadcasting to Tibet.\n\n                     BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n                  Funds Appropriated to the President\n\n\n                   INTERNATIONAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$429,739,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................240,000,000\n\n       The budget request included $80,000,000 for International \n     Disaster Assistance. The State, Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161) provided \n     $110,000,000 for emergency humanitarian requirements.\n       The Committee recommends $240,000,000 for International \n     Disaster Assistance, which is $240,000,000 above the pending \n     request. These funds should be used to respond to urgent \n     humanitarian requirements worldwide, including in Burma, \n     Bangladesh, China and countries severely affected by the \n     international food crisis.\n       The Committee directs USAID to urgently and substantially \n     increase food assistance for Haiti to address critical food \n     shortages and malnutrition. Preventing hunger and combating \n     poverty in Haiti should be a USAID priority.\n       The Committee also includes funds under the heading \n     ``Development Assistance'' in subchapter B to help address \n     the international food crisis.

In \n     addition, $29,000,000 is included to increase support for \n     staffing, security, and operating needs in Afghanistan and \n     Sudan, and $19,500,000 in Pakistan.\n       The Committee also recommends $25,000,000 to support the \n     development and deployment of a civilian capacity to respond \n     to post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction needs. \n     Funds made available for the civilian stabilization \n     initiative are for the Active and Standby Response Corps \n     portion of the initiative and none of the funds provided in \n     this act may be used to develop the Civilian Response Corps. \n     Additional funding for this initiative is provided in the \n     ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs'' account for the \n     Department of State portion of the initiative.\n       In addition, the Committee recommends $35,000,000 to enable \n     USAID to hire above attrition in fiscal year 2008. The \n     administration's request for fiscal year 2009 includes \n     $92,000,000 for hiring 300 USAID foreign service officers as \n     part of a 3-year initiative. Funding provided in this act is \n     intended to support the hiring of at least 100 additional \n     Foreign Service officers in fiscal year 2008 in order to \n     begin rebuilding the capacity of the Agency to carry out its \n     mission. USAID is directed to consult with the Committees on \n     Appropriations on the use of these funds and to recruit mid-\n     career personnel. As USAID seeks to strengthen its workforce, \n     USAID is encouraged to consult with the Department of Defense \n     on ways to benefit from the experience of retiring officers, \n     including establishment of a transition program.\n\n\n   OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL \n                              DEVELOPMENT\n\n                    OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n2008 appropriation to date..................................$37,692,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation......................................4,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $4,000,000 for the \n     United States Agency for International Development Office of \n     Inspector General to support increased oversight of programs \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n                  Other Bilateral Economic Assistance\n\n\n                         ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$2,974,959,000\n2008 supplemental estimate................................2,009,000,000\nCommittee recommendation..................................1,962,500,000\n\n       The budget request included $2,217,000,000 for Economic \n     Support Fund [ESF], of which $208,000,000 was provided in the \n     State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public \n     Law 110-161) for emergency requirements in the West Bank and \n     in North Korea, as requested.\n       The Committee recommends an additional $1,962,500,000 for \n     ESF, which is $46,500,000 less than the request.

Recent findings of a March 18, 2008 \n         USAID Inspector General audit (E-267-08-001-P) of \n         possible fraud and misuse of some CSP funds are of \n         concern.

The Government of Iraq should assume \n         increasing responsibility for the cost of these \n         activities.\n       --Operations and Maintenance of Key United States \n         Government-funded Infrastructure.--The Committee \n         recommends $10,000,000 for Operations and Maintenance of \n         key United States Government-funded infrastructure, which \n         is $124,000,000 below the request. These functions should \n         be funded by the Government of Iraq and this act includes \n         funding to allow the United States to provide technical \n         assistance and training. In addition, the Committee \n         recommendation conditions the funds on the signing and \n         implementation of an asset transfer agreement between the \n         United States and Iraq.\n       Afghanistan.--The Committee recommends an additional \n     $899,000,000 for Afghanistan, which is $65,000,000 above the \n     request.\n       USAID is directed to review its reconstruction efforts in \n     Afghanistan; focus its assistance, including capacity \n     building, through local Afghan entities; give greater \n     attention to accountability and monitoring to minimize \n     corruption; and emphasize programs which directly improve the \n     economic, social, and political status of Afghan women and \n     girls.

The request \n         includes funding for gas and diesel power projects and \n         there is a concern that diesel generators are costly to \n         maintain and will exacerbate Kabul's already heavily \n         polluted air. The completion of the north-south \n         transmission line to enable Afghanistan to purchase \n         electricity from its northern neighbors for distribution \n         to other areas of the country is supported. Funding for \n         the Northern Electrical Power System or the Shebergan \n         Gas-Fired Plant is not included. The World Bank should \n         play a larger role in financing such infrastructure \n         projects. It is noted that Afghanistan has considerable \n         potential for small hydro and solar power development to \n         service Afghanistan's many remote communities that have \n         no other access to electricity. The Committee directs \n         that not less than $15,000,000 of the funds be used for \n         renewable energy projects in rural areas.\n       --Roads.--The Committee recommends $200,000,000 for roads, \n         which is $129,000,000 below the request.\n       Bangladesh.--The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for \n     assistance for Bangladesh for cyclone recovery and \n     reconstruction assistance.\n       Central America.--The Committee recommends $40,000,000 for \n     Central America in fiscal year 2008, in addition to funds \n     otherwise made available for assistance for countries in \n     Central America for a program to be called the ``Economic and \n     Social Development Fund for Central America'', to be \n     administered by USAID in consultation with the Department of \n     State. The purpose of the program is to promote economic and \n     social development and good governance in low-income areas, \n     including rural communities, that are vulnerable to drug \n     trafficking and related violence and organized crime. These \n     funds should support programs that emphasize community \n     initiatives and public-private partnerships. United States \n     funds should be matched with contributions from other public \n     and private sources to the maximum extent practicable. USAID \n     is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropriations \n     prior to the obligation of these funds.\n       Democratic Republic of the Congo.--The Committee recommends \n     $15,000,000 for assistance for eastern Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo for urgent conflict mitigation and recovery \n     programs and for programs relating to sexual violence against \n     women and girls. Of this amount, $1,000,000 is to establish \n     and support a training center for health workers who provide \n     care and treatment for victims of sexual violence, and \n     $2,000,000 is for training military and civilian \n     investigators, prosecutors, and judges to bring the \n     perpetrators of such crimes to justice.\n       Jordan.--The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for economic \n     assistance to Jordan, which is $150,000,000 above the \n     request. The Government of Jordan remains a key ally and has \n     played a leading role in supporting peace initiatives in the \n     Middle East. Programming of these funds should be done in \n     consultation with the Government of Jordan and refugee relief \n     organizations and should be used to meet the needs of Iraqi \n     refugees. The Committee directs the Secretary of State, after \n     consultation with the Government of Jordan, the United \n     Nations, and\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n     international organizations and non-governmental \n     organizations with a presence in Iraq, to submit a report to \n     the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after \n     enactment detailing (1) short and medium term options the \n     United States and other countries and organizations could \n     pursue to assist Iraqis in Jordan maintain their educational \n     and vocational skills and earn income; and (2) longer-term \n     options that the United States and the Government of Jordan \n     can take to address the economic, social, and health needs of \n     refugees from Iraq, including the feasibility of extending \n     temporary residence status for Iraqis registered with the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n       Kenya.--The Committee recommends $12,000,000 for assistance \n     for Kenya for political, ethnic and tribal reconciliation \n     activities.\n       Nepal.--The Committee recommends $7,000,000 for assistance \n     for Nepal to strengthen democracy and support the peace \n     process, including the demobilization and reintegration of \n     ex-combatants, and for economic development programs in rural \n     communities affected by conflict.\n       North Korea.--The Committee recommends up to $53,000,000 \n     for energy-related assistance for North Korea in support of \n     the goals of the Six-Party talks, which is the same as the \n     request. This is in addition to the $53,000,000 appropriated \n     in division J of Public Law 110-161.\n       Pakistan.--The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for \n     assistance for Pakistan, which is the same as the request.\n       The Philippines.--The Committee recommends $15,000,000 for \n     assistance for the Philippines for programs to further peace \n     and reconciliation in the southern Philippines, and \n     recognizes the shared interest between the United States and \n     the Philippines in ending terrorism in this region.\n       Sri Lanka.--The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for \n     assistance for Sri Lanka to be provided through USAID to \n     support economic development programs in the eastern region \n     of Sri Lanka to solidify recent gains against the Liberation \n     Tigers of Tamil Eelam. These funds should be used to assist \n     Tamil and Muslim minorities in Sri Lanka.\n       Sudan.--The Committee recommends $45,000,000 for assistance \n     for Sudan to support election-related activities.\n       Thailand.--The Committee recommends $2,500,000 for \n     assistance for Thailand to address economic and social \n     development needs in southern Thailand. The Department of \n     State is directed to consult with the Committees on \n     Appropriations prior to the obligation of these funds.\n       Uganda.--The Committee recommends $22,000,000 for \n     assistance for northern Uganda. These funds should be used to \n     support economic development, governance, assistance for war \n     victims, and reintegration of ex-combatants.\n       Vietnam.--The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for \n     assistance for Vietnam to continue environmental remediation \n     and health activities at former United States military sites \n     in Vietnam that are contaminated by dangerously high levels \n     of dioxin. The Department of State is directed to consult \n     with the Committees on Appropriations on the uses of these \n     funds.\n       West Bank.--The Committee recommends not more than \n     $200,000,000 for economic assistance for the West Bank, which \n     is the same as the request. The Department of State is \n     directed to provide a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations not later than 90 days after the enactment of \n     this act on how United States economic assistance for the \n     West Bank supports the larger Palestinian Reform and \n     Development Plan as well as a description of other donor \n     support of this plan. The report should describe how \n     assistance from the United States and other donors will \n     improve conditions in the West Bank, including through job \n     creation and housing programs.\n       Zimbabwe.--The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for \n     assistance for Zimbabwe to support political reconciliation \n     activities.\n\n                          Department of State\n\n\n                             DEMOCRACY FUND\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$162,672,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................76,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $76,000,000 for \n     Democracy Fund programs, requested under the heading \n     ``Economic Support Fund'', to be made available as follows:\n       Chad.--The Committee recommends $1,000,000 for democracy \n     activities in Chad.\n       Iraq.--The Committee recommends $75,000,000 for democracy \n     activities in Iraq.

Funding for prison construction is not included.\n       Central America.--The Committee recommends $50,000,000 for \n     assistance for Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, \n     Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, and an additional \n     $10,000,000 for Haiti and the Dominican Republic under the \n     Merida Initiative. Impunity within the military and police \n     forces of several of these countries is of concern, and their \n     justice systems are corrupt and ineffective. The Secretary of \n     State is directed to submit a report, prior to the obligation \n     of funds, on mechanisms to ensure adequate monitoring of \n     these funds.\n       The Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a \n     report not more than 90 days after enactment of this act \n     detailing efforts by the Guatemalan Government to propose and \n     promote legislation to raise the necessary revenues in \n     Guatemala to fund comprehensive judicial and law enforcement \n     reform.\n       The omission of Haiti and the Dominican Republic from the \n     request for the Merida Initiative makes it more likely that \n     these vulnerable countries would become increasingly favored \n     transit routes for drug traffickers. The Committee recommends \n     $5,000,000 for Haiti and $5,000,000 for the Dominican \n     Republic to support counternarcotics, border security, anti-\n     corruption and rule of law programs.\n       Mexico.--The Committee recognizes there is a shared \n     responsibility between the United States and Mexico to combat \n     drug trafficking and related violence and organized crime. \n     The Committee provides $350,000,000 to support programs to \n     enable the Government of Mexico to respond to these threats \n     in accordance with the rule of law, a portion of which is \n     funded with unobligated balances from the Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund.\n       The Committee also recognizes that corruption and impunity \n     within Mexico's military and police forces are pervasive. \n     Additionally, Mexican law enforcement and intelligence \n     agencies have frequently persecuted legitimate groups for \n     engaging in peaceful dissent. Recommendations of the National \n     Human Rights Commission are often ignored and investigations \n     of violations of human rights by Mexican military and police \n     forces rarely result in convictions. The recommendation \n     requires the Secretary of State to report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that \n     mechanisms are in place to ensure proper vetting of \n     recipients of United States assistance. Additionally, the \n     Committee provides that a comprehensive database for vetting \n     military and police forces shall be established by the United \n     States Embassy in Mexico City and continually updated.\n       There is concern with the failure to investigate and \n     prosecute the police officers responsible for human rights \n     violations, including rape and sexual violence against women, \n     at San Salvador Atenco on May 3-4, 2006, and in Oaxaca \n     between June and December 2006. These and other such \n     violations by members of the Mexican military and police \n     forces have been documented and require thorough, credible \n     and transparent investigation and prosecution by the Mexican \n     Attorney General. The State and Federal investigations into \n     the October 27, 2007, killing in Oaxaca of American citizen \n     Bradley Will have been flawed and the Secretary of State is \n     directed, not later than 45 days after enactment of this act \n     and 120 days thereafter, to submit a report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations detailing progress in conducting a \n     thorough, credible, and transparent investigation to identify \n     the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice.\n       One of the benefits of the Merida initiative is that the \n     wireless radio equipment and identification systems being \n     provided will enable the Government of Mexico to more closely \n     collaborate with United States agencies like the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, \n     and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. To maximize the \n     potential for collaboration, the Committee recommends that \n     any equipment and technology purchases should be \n     interoperable based on open standards with the equipment and \n     technology being used by their United States Government \n     counterparts.\n       West Bank.--The Committee provides $25,000,000 for ongoing \n     training of vetted units of the Palestinian National Security \n     Forces, which is the same as the request.\n\n\n                    MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$1,023,178,000\n2008 supplemental estimate...................................30,000,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................330,500,000\n\n       The budget request included $230,000,000 for Migration and \n     Refugee Assistance, of which $200,000,000 was provided in the \n     State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public \n     Law 110-161) for emergency refugee requirements in Iraq and \n     the West Bank.\n       The Committee recommends an additional $330,500,000 for \n     Migration and Refugee Assistance, which is $300,500,000 above \n     the pending request. Funds should be made available to meet \n     unmet global refugee needs, including to assist Iraqi \n     refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and the \n     surrounding region, as well as internally displaced persons \n     in Iraq. Funds may also be used, if necessary, for the \n     admissions costs of Iraqis granted special immigrant status \n     under the Special Immigrant Visa program\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\n     authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008. \n     In addition, funds may be used to offset administrative costs \n     associated with the expanded requirements of the Iraqi \n     refugee program, in consultation with the Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       The humanitarian crisis involving Iraqi refugees and \n     internally displaced persons is of concern and the Government \n     of Iraq has dedicated insufficient resources to assist this \n     most vulnerable segment of the Iraqi population. The \n     Department of State is directed to urge the Government of \n     Iraq to provide a substantial increase in funding for \n     humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi refugee population \n     residing in the region and within the country. In addition, \n     the Secretary of State should ensure that the Senior \n     Coordinator for Iraqi Refugee Issues gives particular \n     attention to the needs of vulnerable minority groups.\n       The welfare and security of the 7,900 Lao Hmong in the Thai \n     military camp in Petchaboon, northern Thailand is of concern \n     and the Government of Thailand is urged to support a \n     transparent screening process to identify those who have a \n     legitimate fear of return to Laos. Any attempt to force the \n     return of Hmong refugees to Laos is strongly opposed.\n\n\n     UNITED STATES EMERGENCY REFUGEE AND MIGRATION ASSISTANCE FUND\n\n2008 appropriation to date..................................$44,635,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................36,608,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $36,608,000 for the \n     United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund \n     to prevent depletion of this emergency fund.\n\n\n    NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$483,055,000\n2008 supplemental estimate....................................5,000,000\nCommittee recommendation.....................................10,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $10,000,000 for \n     Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related \n     Programs, which is $5,000,000 above the request.\n       Of these funds, $5,000,000 is for presidential protective \n     service support in Afghanistan, which is the same as the \n     request, and $5,000,000 is for a United States contribution \n     to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty International Monitoring \n     System.\n\n                          MILITARY ASSISTANCE\n\n                  Funds Appropriated to the President\n\n\n                        PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$261,381,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................10,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $10,000,000 for \n     Peacekeeping Operations in the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo [DRC]. These funds are made available to support \n     infantry battalions of the DRC armed forces, to protect \n     vulnerable civilians in the eastern region of the country, \n     and should be made available in accordance with thorough \n     vetting procedures. The Department of State should ensure \n     that trained units are being provided professional \n     leadership, appropriate training in human rights, and \n     adequate pay.\n\n     Subchapter B--Bridge Fund Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2009\n\n       The budget request totals $3,605,000,000 in emergency \n     supplemental funds for fiscal year 2009.

Within this amount, $78,400,000 is \n     available for worldwide security protection and not more than \n     $500,000,000 is available as a bridge fund for Iraq \n     operations.\n       To meet increased security and personnel requirements, the \n     Committee provides $87,400,000 for Afghanistan, $7,000,000 \n     for Pakistan, $3,000,000 for Somalia, and $15,000,000 for \n     Sudan. In addition, the Committee provides $40,000,000 to \n     continue support of new positions to develop language and \n     other critical skills of the diplomatic corps and for \n     civilian post-conflict stabilization initiatives.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The Committee recommends $57,000,000 for the Office of the \n     Inspector General at the Department of State, of which, \n     $15,500,000 is to continue oversight of programs in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and the Middle East.\n       Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     [SIGIR].--The Committee recommends $36,500,000 for the SIGIR \n     for continued oversight of United States reconstruction \n     programs in Iraq, as authorized by section 3001 of Public Law \n     108-106.\n       Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction \n     [SIGAR].--The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the SIGAR, \n     for which no funds were requested, and which is authorized by \n     section 1229 of Public Law 110-181.

None of the funds shall be used to duplicate \n     investigations that have been conducted or to support offices \n     or systems of inspectors general at the Department of State \n     or USAID. The SIGAR should co-locate staff and ``back \n     office'' support systems with other inspectors general to the \n     extent feasible.\n\n\n            EMBASSY SECURITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE\n\n       The Committee recommends $41,300,000 for urgent Embassy \n     security, construction and maintenance costs.

The Committee directs FDA to \n     provide quarterly reports through December 31, 2009, on the \n     status of the funding, including, but not limited to, \n     expenditures and hiring by program, and significant \n     accomplishments, including operations in foreign countries, \n     enhanced inspection activities, scientific advances, and \n     information technology improvements.\n       Of the amount recommended, $125,000,000 shall be used for \n     activities related to food protection. The funding shall be \n     used to open additional FDA offices overseas and improve \n     FDA's capacity to identify risk factors and more rapidly \n     mitigate any food safety problems. This includes more rapid \n     detection of contamination and more rapid trace back \n     abilities to determine the source of any outbreak of food \n     borne illness. Further, this funding will be used to hire \n     additional foreign and domestic inspectors to increase the \n     number of import food exams, the number of foreign food \n     facility inspections and the number of domestic food safety \n     inspections; and to create a new communication system to more \n     rapidly inform the public of any outbreak of food borne \n     illness.\n       Of the amount recommended, $100,000,000 shall be used for \n     activities related to drug, device, and biologics safety. The \n     funding shall be used to increase foreign and domestic \n     facility inspections, improve laboratory infrastructure and \n     rapid analysis tools, implement the safety requirements \n     outlined in\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\n     the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, and upgrade \n     the agency's information technology to enable data sharing \n     and enhanced analysis of adverse events.\n       Of the amount recommended, $40,000,000 will be used to \n     enhance science programs across the agency, with specific \n     focus on areas of emerging science where the FDA currently \n     lacks the expertise necessary to regulate complex products \n     under development. This will include funding for research, \n     science training and professional development for current FDA \n     staff, and efforts to recruit additional scientific staff to \n     the agency.\n\n\n                        Buildings and Facilities\n\n       The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for FDA to bring \n     agency laboratories outside of the Washington region in line \n     with public health safety standards.\n\n                               CHAPTER 2\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n                          Bureau of the Census\n\n\n                     PERIODIC CENSUSES AND PROGRAMS\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$1,027,406,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................210,000,000\n\n       The bill includes $210,000,000 for increased costs \n     associated with the poor management of the 2010 decennial \n     census. Within the funds provided, not less than $50,300,000 \n     shall be used to restore funding associated with the approved \n     March 26, 2008 reprogramming within the Bureau of Census. \n     Funds transferred pursuant to the reprogramming to address \n     immediate shortfalls within the Field Data Collection \n     Automation contract from the American Community Survey, \n     Census Coverage Measurement activities, and other census \n     activities may result in increased risk and other unintended \n     consequences to other parts of the census. The $50,300,000 \n     shall be available solely to complete previously planned \n     activities and address vacancies in the aforementioned areas \n     in order to reduce risk and ensure a successful 2010 \n     decennial census.\n       The Census Bureau shall submit to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, within 30 days of enactment of this act, a \n     detailed plan showing a timeline of milestones and \n     expenditures for the 2010 decennial census, and shall include \n     a quantitative assessment of the associated risk to the \n     program as it is currently constituted. In addition, the \n     inspector general shall submit quarterly reports to the \n     Committees on Appropriations, until the conclusion of the \n     2010 decennial census, detailing the progress of the revised \n     plan for the execution of the 2010 decennial census and any \n     unanticipated slippages from the revised 2010 milestones, as \n     well as reassessing the associated risk to the program. The \n     Census Bureau is directed to provide the inspector general \n     with any required information so that the quarterly reports \n     can begin 60 days after submission of the plan.\n       Because rising costs associated with the 2010 decennial \n     census and the Department's and the Bureau's lack of contract \n     oversight are cause for particular concern, the \n     recommendation includes not less than $3,000,000 for the \n     Department's Office of the Inspector General for census \n     contract oversight activities and not less than $1,000,000 \n     solely for a reimbursable agreement with the Defense Contract \n     Management Agency to review and improve Census contract \n     management.\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n                     United States Marshals Service\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$866,523,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................50,000,000\n\n       In order to implement and enforce the Adam Walsh Child \n     Protection and Safety Act (Public Law 109-248), the United \n     States Marshals Service requires funding to hire and equip at \n     least 200 Deputy Marshals and at least 25 associated \n     administrative personnel each year for the next 5 years. This \n     funding is critical and necessary to establish the National \n     Sex Offender Targeting Center, improve the information \n     technology backbone, and reinforce the agency's \n     infrastructure so that Deputy Marshals have timely, accurate \n     investigative information to track down and arrest those who \n     prey on our Nation's children. The Committee is deeply \n     concerned that no additional resources have been requested or \n     provided by the Department of Justice to undertake this \n     mission as required under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and \n     Safety Act.\n\n                         Federal Prison System\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n2008 appropriation to date...............................$5,050,440,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................178,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $178,000,000 for additional costs \n     of the Bureau of Prisons [BOP] related to the custody and \n     care of inmates and the maintenance and operation of \n     correctional and penal institutions. The BOP has been \n     chronically underfunded in recent budget requests, due to \n     consistently underestimated growth in inmate populations and \n     inadequate funding requests for medical expenses. As a \n     result, BOP facilities face rising staff-to-inmate ratios, \n     placing corrections officers and inmates at unacceptable risk \n     of violence. The bill includes funding for FCI Pollock \n     activation costs and for inmate drug abuse treatment required \n     by law. The administration is urged to re-estimate BOP fixed \n     costs and prisoner population for fiscal year 2009 and to \n     provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations \n     with those estimates no later than May 31, 2008. Further, the \n     BOP is directed to notify the Committees of current staff-to-\n     inmate ratios at all Federal prisons on a monthly basis.\n\n                       Office of Justice Programs\n\n\n               STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n2008 appropriation to date.................................$170,433,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................590,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $490,000,000 for Edward Byrne \n     Memorial Justice Assistance Grants. Byrne grant funding is \n     the single most important Federal resource for cops-on-the-\n     beat in our States and local communities. This funding goes \n     by formula to State and local police forces to help them \n     prevent, fight, and prosecute crime.\n       The Committee notes that the President's annual budget \n     requests have repeatedly proposed to cut drastically and \n     eliminate Byrne grant funding. Each time, the Committee has \n     rejected the President's proposals. In fiscal year 2008, the \n     Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, Science [CJS] bill provided \n     $660,000,000 for Byrne grants. But because of the President's \n     veto threats, Byrne funding was reduced to just $170,000,000 \n     in the final 2008 omnibus bill, $350,000,000 below the 2007 \n     level, and $490,000,000 below the level included in the \n     Senate-passed CJS bill for 2008. The Committee has heard from \n     State and local police around the country that the \n     consequences of these funding cuts will be fewer cops on our \n     streets fighting gangs, drugs, and child predators and fewer \n     prosecutions of criminals. This is unacceptable given that \n     communities around the country--from suburbs and small towns \n     to large cities--have faced rising crime rates. The Committee \n     therefore recommends $490,000,000 in Byrne grant funding, and \n     directs the Department of Justice to obligate these funds by \n     formula no later than 30 days after enactment of this act.\n       In addition, the Committee recommends $100,000,000 for \n     competitive grants for programs that provide assistance and \n     equipment to local law enforcement along the Southern border \n     or in High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas to combat \n     criminal narcotic activity stemming from the Southern border, \n     of which $10,000,000 shall be for the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Project Gunrunner.\n\n                                SCIENCE\n\n             National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n\n                            Return to Flight\n\n2008 appropriation to date-............................................\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation...................................$200,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $200,000,000 to address costs \n     associated with the return to flight of the space shuttle. As \n     a result of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, NASA has \n     experienced significant costs associated with the repair of \n     the remaining shuttle fleet. This has caused serious budget \n     and programmatic disruption to NASA's core programs. The \n     Committee has provided transfer authority to the \n     Administrator to fund programs that were cut as a result of \n     shifting budget priorities related to the return to flight. \n     The Administrator shall submit a spending plan to the \n     Committee for this funding within 30 days of enactment of \n     this act.\n\n                      National Science Foundation\n\n\n                    Research and Related Activities\n\n2008 appropriation to date-..............................$4,821,474,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................150,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for research and \n     related activities at the National Science Foundation [NSF]. \n     The Committee strongly supports the need to increase funding \n     for all research disciplines at NSF and believes that it will \n     maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide \n     security, and enhance the quality of life. Within the \n     recommendation the Committee provides $10,000,000 for the \n     National Academic Research Fleet which is experiencing \n     reduced research capacity due to rising fuel costs.\n\n\n                     Education and Human Resources\n\n2008 appropriation to date-................................$725,600,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation.....................................50,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $50,000,000 for science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM] scholarship \n     programs at the National Science Foundation [NSF]. STEM \n     education is critical to our future economic prosperity. The \n     National Academy of Sciences' report ``Rising Above the \n     Gathering Storm'' recommended increasing the number of \n     students earning degrees in the physical sciences in order to \n     energize America for a brighter economic future. The \n     recommendation includes an additional: $20,000,000 for the \n     Robert Noyce Scholarship program to expand the program as \n     authorized by the America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110-69); \n     and $24,000,000 for Graduate Research Fellowships; $5,000,000 \n     for Graduate\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\n     Teaching Fellowships; and $1,000,000 for Federal Scholarship \n     for Service.\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISION--THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 2201.

The Committee is aware that the final fiscal year \n     2008 appropriation was essentially flat with fiscal year 2007 \n     in many areas of the Science budget. The result of flat \n     funding shows up in reduced hours of operation of equipment \n     and facilities, reduced service to users, staff layoffs, \n     reductions to education and training programs, and other \n     negative impacts. This increase to fiscal year 2008 funding \n     will restore the jobs of 10 to 30 people who were terminated \n     and prevent the reduction of 200 additional employees.\n       Specifically, $55,000,000 is for Fusion Energy Sciences and \n     $45,000,000 is for High Energy Physics.\n\n               Environmental and Other Defense Activities\n\n\n                     DEFENSE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP\n\n2008 appropriations to date..............................$5,349,378,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation....................................243,000,000\n\n       The Committee recommends an additional $243,000,000 for \n     Defense Environmental Cleanup.

The \n     Committee believes that the three authorized projects can be \n     constructed as a coherent hurricane protection system without \n     modifying the individual project authorizations or cost \n     shares resulting in a Federal share of $3,047,000,000 and a \n     non-Federal share of $1,315,000,000 that will be initially \n     federally funded. This $4,362,000,000 shall not be available \n     until October 1, 2008. The Committee has recommended \n     $1,657,000,000 for the Lake Ponchartrain and Vicinity \n     project; $1,415,000,000 for the West Bank and Vicinity \n     Project; and $1,290,000,000 for the Southeast Louisiana \n     projects. These three projects are to be initially federally \n     funded with non-Federal shares estimated to be $497,000,000; \n     $495,000,000; and $323,000,000 respectively. The non-Federal \n     shares are to be repaid in accordance with section 103(k) of \n     the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-\n     662) over a period of 30 years. While the Committee has \n     recommended specific statutory dollar amounts for the three \n     projects, statutory language has been included that would \n     allow the administration to request a reprogramming of funds, \n     if required. However, the Committee believes that the Corps \n     should use this reprogramming ability sparingly.\n       The Committee has recommended $604,745,000 hurricane and \n     storm damage reduction, flood damage reduction and ecosystem \n     restoration along the gulf coast of Mississippi. This \n     $604,745,000 shall not be available until October 1, 2008. \n     The Committee recommendation includes $173,615,000 for the \n     Turkey Creek, Bayou Cumbest, Dantzler, Admiral Island, \n     Franklin Creek, and Deer Island Environmental Restoration \n     projects; $4,550,000 for the Moss Point Municipal Relocation \n     project; $5,000,000 for the Waveland Floodproofing project; \n     $150,000 for the Mississippi Sound Sub Aquatic Vegetation \n     Project; $15,430,000 for the Coast-Wide Dune Restoration \n     Project; $397,000,000 for the Homeowners Assistance and \n     Relocation Project; and $9,000,000 for the Forrest Heights \n     Hurricane and Storm Damage Reduction project. These projects \n     are generally described in the Mobile District Engineer's \n     Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program Comprehensive Plan \n     Report. The non-Federal share of $211,661,000 is to be repaid \n     in accordance with section 103(k) of the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662) over a period of \n     30 years. While the Committee has recommended specific \n     statutory dollar amounts for the listed projects, statutory \n     language has been included that would allow the \n     administration to request a reprogramming of funds, if \n     required. However, the Committee believes that the Corps \n     should use this reprogramming ability sparingly.\n       Due to recent natural disasters, the Corps of Engineers has \n     identified a number of projects that are currently under \n     construction that have been damaged by storm and flood \n     events.

However, for consistency, the funding has \n     been recommended in the same elements as requested by the \n     administration and appropriated in Public Law 109-234 rather \n     than as a lump sum as proposed by the administration for this \n     request. This $2,926,000,000 shall not be available until \n     October 1, 2008. The Committee has recommended $704,000,000 \n     to modify the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue \n     drainage canals and install pumps and closure structures at \n     or near the lakefront; $90,000,000 for storm-proofing \n     interior pump stations to ensure the operability of the \n     stations during hurricanes, storms, and high water events; \n     $459,000,000 for armoring critical elements of the New \n     Orleans hurricane and storm damage reduction system; \n     $53,000,000 to improve protection at the Inner Harbor \n     Navigation Canal; $456,000,000 to replace or modify certain \n     non-Federal levees in Plaquemines Parish to incorporate the \n     levees into the existing New Orleans to Venice hurricane \n     protection project; $412,000,000 for reinforcing or replacing \n     flood walls, as necessary, in the existing Lake Pontchartrain \n     and Vicinity project and the existing West Bank and Vicinity \n     project to improve the performance of the systems;\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\n     $393,000,000 for repair and restoration of authorized \n     protections and floodwalls; and $359,000,000 to complete the \n     authorized protection for the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity \n     Project and for the West Bank and Vicinity Project. While the \n     Committee has recommended specific statutory dollar amounts \n     for the three projects, statutory language has been included \n     that would allow the administration to request a \n     reprogramming of funds, if required. However, the Committee \n     believes that the Corps should use this reprogramming ability \n     sparingly.\n       The Committee remains concerned that plans under \n     development for permanent pumping of storm water in the New \n     Orleans metropolitan area do not fully account for the \n     operational challenges that arise during major storm events \n     and are not, therefore, fully protective of public safety.\n       After reviewing the report furnished in response to section \n     4303 of Public Law 110-28, the Committee has concluded that \n     Option 1, as presented therein, presents unacceptable risks \n     given that it relies on old equipment and technology that is \n     less reliable, it requires synchronized operation of multiple \n     pump stations by both local and Federal agencies during high \n     flood flow or storm events creating operational complexity \n     and requires operation and maintenance of more systems that \n     would be true in Option 2.\n       In the report the Corps states that ``Option 2 is generally \n     more technically advantageous and may be more effective \n     operationally over Option 1 because it would have greater \n     reliability and further reduces the risk of flooding.'' The \n     Corps further states that ``Discharge of storm water directly \n     to the Mississippi River (Option 2a) would reduce the size of \n     the new pump station required at the lake and would reduce \n     the magnitude of the canal modifications required to \n     accommodate gravity flow in the 17th Street system.''\n       Given these conclusions and the severe consequences of a \n     failure relating to loss of life and property, the Corps is \n     directed to continue the NEPA alternative evaluation of all \n     options with particular attention to Options 1 and 2 and 2a \n     and within 90 days of enactment of this act provide the House \n     and Senate Appropriation Committees cost estimates to \n     implement Options 1, 2 and 2a of the above cited report.\n       The Committee recommendation includes $348,000,000 for \n     barrier island restoration and ecosystem restoration along \n     the Mississippi gulf coast. This $348,000,000 shall not be \n     available until October 1, 2008. This restoration will help \n     to restore the historic levels of storm damage reduction to \n     the Mississippi gulf coast that these islands once provided. \n     These funds are provided at full Federal expense as these \n     islands are a part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and \n     are publicly owned and managed by the Department of the \n     Interior.\n       Due to recent natural disasters, the Corps of Engineers has \n     identified a number of projects that have been damaged by \n     storm and flood events. The Committee has recommended \n     $94,400,000 for the Corps to prepare for flood, hurricane and \n     other natural disasters and support emergency operations, \n     repairs, and other activities in response to flood and \n     hurricane emergencies, as authorized by law; to repair and \n     rehabilitate eligible projects that were affected by natural \n     disasters; and to fund claims processing and discovery costs \n     associated with Hurricane Katrina lawsuits.\n\n\n                            GENERAL EXPENSES\n\n2008 appropriations to date................................$175,046,000\n2008 supplemental estimate.............................................\nCommittee recommendation......................................1,500,000\n\n       Funds totaling $1,500,000 are recommended for additional \n     oversight and management costs associated with Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita.\n\n                               CHAPTER 4\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISION--THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 3401.

These provisions require a statement of how the \n     emergency provisions contained in the bill meet the criteria \n     for emergency spending as identified in the budget \n     resolution.\n       The Committee recommends emergency funding for fiscal year \n     2008 for overseas deployments and other activities, for \n     hurricane recovery in the gulf coast region, and other \n     natural disasters, and for other needs. The funding is \n     related to unanticipated needs and is for situations that are \n     sudden, urgent, and unforeseen, specifically the global war \n     on terror and the hurricanes of 2005 and other natural \n     disasters. The recommendation also funds the costs of ongoing \n     military deployments and other requirements through the \n     beginning months of the next fiscal year.

The recommendations in this \n     chapter are based on the initial budget request, an update to \n     that request, formal hearings, and numerous briefings and are \n     intended to address emergency, high-priority needs of the \n     United States military and intelligence community. In some \n     cases, funding has been reduced or eliminated for certain \n     activities that are either not emergency in nature; that \n     cannot be obligated and/or executed in a timely fashion; or \n     which involve new policy and program decisions that should be \n     addressed in the regular authorization and appropriations \n     bills for fiscal year 2009.\n       The following table summarizes by appropriation account or \n     general provision, the recommendation:\n\n                        [In thousands of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Committee\n                                                         recommendation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      CHAPTER 1\n \n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY\n \n                  Military Personnel\n \nMilitary Personnel, Army (emergency).................        12,216,715\nMilitary Personnel, Navy (emergency).................           894,185\nMilitary Personnel, Marine Corps (emergency).........         1,826,688\nMilitary Personnel, Air Force (emergency)............         1,355,544\nReserve Personnel, Army (emergency)..................           304,200\nReserve Personnel, Navy (emergency)..................            72,800\nReserve Personnel, Marine Corps (emergency)..........            16,720\nReserve Personnel, Air Force (emergency).............             5,000\nNational Guard Personnel, Army (emergency)...........         1,369,747\nNational Guard Personnel, Air Force (emergency)......             4,000\n                                                      ------------------\n      Total, Military Personnel......................        18,065,599\n \n              Operation and Maintenance\n \nOperation & Maintenance, Army (emergency)............        17,223,512\nOperation & Maintenance, Navy (emergency)............         2,977,864\n    (Transfer out) (emergency).......................

Major \n     initiatives in the recommendation include:\n       --Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization \n         [FSRM].--The recommendation includes an additional \n         $500,000,000 for FSRM at Army and Marine Corps \n         facilities;\n       --Department of Defense Identified Operation & Maintenance \n         Shortfalls.--The recommendation includes $3,617,308,000 \n         to address the increasing price of fuel and other \n         petroleum products;\n       --Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program.--The recommendation \n         includes $65,400,000 to support the Yellow Ribbon \n         Reintegration program to help members of the National \n         Guard and Reserve transition from combat to civilian \n         life.

They meet important force protection, equipment and \n     personnel needs, while fully funding the operational \n     requirements to conduct the global war on terror.\n\n\n                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX\n\n       The recommendations for intelligence activities are \n     published in a separate and detailed classified annex. The \n     intelligence community, Department of Defense and other \n     organizations are expected to fully comply with the \n     recommendations and direction in the classified annex \n     accompanying this act.\n\n\n                         REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to \n     the congressional defense\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\n     committees within 30 days of enactment of this act on the \n     allocation of the funds within the accounts listed in this \n     chapter. The Secretary shall submit updated reports 30 days \n     after the end of each fiscal quarter until funds listed in \n     this chapter are no longer available for obligation. The \n     Secretary is directed that these reports shall include: a \n     detailed accounting of obligations and expenditures of \n     appropriations provided in this chapter by program and \n     subactivity group for the continuation of military operations \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan and a listing of equipment procured \n     using funds provided in this chapter. It is expected that, in \n     order to meet unanticipated requirements, the Department of \n     Defense may need to transfer funds within these appropriation \n     accounts for purposes other than those specified in this \n     statement. The Department of Defense is directed to follow \n     normal prior approval reprogramming procedures should it be \n     necessary to transfer funding between different \n     appropriations accounts in this chapter.\n       Additionally, the Department of Defense is directed to \n     submit monthly supplemental execution reports to the \n     congressional defense committees that include the following \n     information by appropriation: funding appropriated, funding \n     allocated, monthly obligations, monthly disbursements, \n     cumulative fiscal year obligations, and cumulative fiscal \n     year disbursements.\n\n\n                 CIVIL SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITIES REPORT\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide a report on the \n     progress of the Department of Defense efforts to plan for and \n     provide support to civil authorities during incidents of \n     national significance as required by sections 1814 and 1815 \n     of Public Law 110-181. The report shall be provided to the \n     Committees on Appropriations and other congressional defense \n     committees no later than 60 days after enactment of this act. \n     Specifically the report shall provide a projected timeframe \n     for completing the determination of requirements requested in \n     sections 1814 and 1815, milestones for implementation of \n     planning and readiness improvements, and any available \n     information on the Department of Defense's current state of \n     readiness and gaps in readiness for each of the National \n     Planning Scenarios. In addition, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall include in the report an explanation on how the \n     Department's civil support and homeland defense \n     responsibilities are incorporated into the validation and \n     prioritization of the services' equipment requirements.\n\n\n                              CONTRACTING\n\n       There is concern over the numerous instances of waste, \n     fraud, and abuse that have occurred in Department of Defense \n     contracting activities in support of contingency operations. \n     The Department and the military services did not properly \n     address the necessary personnel, training, and technology \n     requirements over the years, but are now taking steps to \n     improve their capabilities. This recommendation includes \n     additional funds to further many of the initiatives and \n     increased personnel requirements identified by the Department \n     of Defense and outside reviews such as the Gansler report. \n     The recommendation also calls for enhanced reporting \n     requirements to ensure improved oversight over the Iraq and \n     Afghanistan Security Forces Funds, and the Commander's \n     Emergency Response Program. Finally, it provides funding for \n     the Department of Defense Inspector General to improve its \n     antiquated tracking system for the Criminal Investigation \n     Service.\n\n\n                       OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM\n\n       The recommendation provides additional resources to aid \n     U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and to strengthen the \n     Afghanistan Security Forces. Afghanistan Security Forces are \n     critical to the stability of Afghanistan and essential to our \n     fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. To \n     increase our efforts to train and equip these forces, the \n     recommendation funds additional trainers for the Afghan \n     National Army and the Afghan National Police. It also doubles \n     the Commander's Emergency Response Program [CERP] in \n     Afghanistan from fiscal year 2007 levels to address critical \n     small scale humanitarian efforts. Included in this amount are \n     the necessary resources to support the CERP program for the \n     additional marines in Afghanistan. These and other efforts \n     related to Afghanistan are discussed elsewhere in this report \n     and in the classified annex.\n\n\n     CASE MANAGEMENT AND DISABILITY EVALUATION FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS\n\n       The recommendation includes $94,900,000 in the Operation \n     and Maintenance, Defense-Wide; Procurement, Defense-Wide; \n     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide; and \n     the Defense Health Program appropriation accounts to address \n     gaps identified by the President's Commission on Care for \n     America's Returning Wounded Warriors. The funding will enable \n     improvements in case management, data sharing, and the \n     disability evaluation system [DES]. Additionally, the funding \n     will support the ongoing DES Pilot program, information \n     technology development, support for case management, and \n     improvement of Department of Defense and Department of \n     Veterans Affairs data sharing gateways, and distribution of \n     wounded warrior care and benefits informational handbooks.\n\n\n                    DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\n       The recommendation includes a total appropriation of \n     $1,488,864,000 for the Defense Health Program. This funding \n     will provide medical and dental services to active forces and \n     mobilized Reserve Components, as they support Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, and their family \n     members. The funding also provides for costs associated with \n     the treatment of combat-related injuries.\n       The recommendation also provides $293,023,000 for \n     facilities sustainment, restoration and maintenance; \n     $1,000,000 for the Center of Excellence for Eye Injuries; \n     $70,000,000 for the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative \n     Medicine and $47,100,000 in various budget activities for \n     disability evaluation system and case management.\n\n\n         FUNDING FOR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION\n\n       Research, Development, Test and Evaluation has historically \n     not been funded in large amounts in emergency supplemental \n     appropriations. Generally, funding has been provided for \n     items that have been funded in prior supplemental \n     appropriations, or that can be developed and fielded in a \n     timely manner to impact the global war on terror.\n\n                           MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n       An appropriation of $18,065,599,000 is recommended for \n     Military Personnel.\n       The recommendations for each military personnel account are \n     shown below:\n\n                        [In thousands of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

  COMMANDER'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n       The recommendation includes $1,226,841,000 for the \n     Commander's Emergency Response Program [CERP]. Included in \n     this amount is $479,900,000 for CERP in Afghanistan and \n     $2,000,000 to support our ongoing efforts in the global war \n     on terror in the Philippines. Small scale, humanitarian \n     projects led by the Joint Interagency Task Force--Philippines \n     should have a tremendous impact on combating the spread of \n     terrorist cells in the Philippines. However, the provision of \n     these funds does not represent an invitation to expand CERP \n     beyond its current mission and application.\n       CERP projects are also currently benefiting the 2.7 million \n     internally displaced Iraqis. The Iraqi Government should \n     devote more of its own resources to returning them to their \n     homes, or resettling them permanently in functioning \n     communities. However, recognizing that CERP is an effective \n     tool for meeting urgent humanitarian needs, the Secretary of \n     Defense is urged to encourage commanders to give priority to \n     humanitarian and reconstruction projects that respond to the \n     needs of internally displaced Iraqis who have settled in \n     their area of responsibility.\n       CERP has proven beneficial to both U.S. commanders and the \n     Iraqi people, but there is concern over the Department's \n     growing requests for these funds. Since its inception in \n     2004, this program has grown exponentially, from $180,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 2004 to $956,400,000 in fiscal year 2007. The \n     total fiscal year 2008 level of $1,726,841,000 as \n     recommended, represents an 80 percent increase for the \n     program. Congress provided $500,000,000 in the fiscal year \n     2008 supplemental bridge appropriation but the Department is \n     obligating funds for this program at a rate that would exceed \n     the authorized level of $977,441,000 before the end of the \n     fiscal year.\n       While there is a need to maintain commanders' flexibility \n     and control in administering CERP funds, there is concern \n     that, in the absence of any minimum standards for project \n     monitoring or specific performance indicators, commanders \n     exercise varying levels of oversight and typically compile \n     only anecdotal evidence on the impact of projects. \n     Furthermore, CERP funds are administered at the battalion \n     level, often by troops whose Military Operational Specialty \n     has little or no connection to program or acquisition \n     management. The limited information provided to Congress \n     about CERP projects makes it difficult to conduct thorough \n     oversight over how this program is administered, what its \n     actual impact is on the Iraqi people, and how it fits into \n     our overall strategy for Iraq.\n       To provide Congress sufficient visibility over the use of \n     funding provided for CERP, the Department is directed to: (1) \n     establish minimum guidelines for commanders to follow in \n     monitoring project status and performance indicators to \n     assess the impact of CERP projects, (2) provide more complete \n     information in its quarterly reports to Congress, including: \n     listings of projects by province; project status, such as \n     completed and being used, completed but not sustained, \n     destroyed, vandalized, or not found; the source of each \n     individual initiative, whether it was generated by a local \n     national or the command; the name of the authority or \n     organization who serves as the primary local partner for each \n     project; and the number of local citizens who will benefit \n     from the project, including the number who will be employed \n     in implementing it, and if it directly benefits internally \n     displaced Iraqis. In addition, the report should include \n     information on the nature of the Government of Iraq's \n     commitment to sustain projects requiring government support, \n     and on the impact of CERP projects, individually and \n     collectively, in assisting the United States to carry out its \n     strategy in Iraq.\n       So Congress may better understand how troops are trained to \n     administer CERP funds, the Secretary of Defense is directed \n     to submit to the congressional defense committees, within 45 \n     days of enactment of this act, a detailed report on the \n     training provided to troops authorized to manage or disperse \n     CERP funds. The report should include the duration of the \n     training, its primary objectives, and a syllabus of the \n     training course.\n       For greater clarity on how commanders incorporate the use \n     of CERP funds into their operational planning, the Secretary \n     of Defense is directed to provide a report to the \n     congressional defense committees, no later than September 4, \n     2008, on operational planning for the use of CERP. The report \n     should include plans from each of the current Multinational \n     Division [MND] commands in Iraq and each of the current Task \n     Force commands in Afghanistan, to include information on the \n     criteria used for prioritizing individual CERP projects and \n     how the use of CERP funds is intended to advance the tactical \n     and strategic objectives.\n\n\n                           CONTRACT SERVICES\n\n       The continued lack of transparency and accountability with \n     regard to contracts and contractors serving in both theaters \n     of operation (Iraq and Afghanistan) is concerning. The \n     Department of Defense has indicated a need for approximately \n     $40,000,000,000 of operation and maintenance funding for \n     contracted services in this supplemental appropriation. This \n     includes $6,000,000,000 for the Army-managed Logistics Civil \n     Augmentation Program [LOGCAP], which provides for a spectrum \n     of services to include power generation, management of \n     facilities, dining operations, latrines, water systems, fire \n     protection and laundry services. Approximately $5,400,000,000 \n     was expended by the Army on LOGCAP contracts in 2007.\n       Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Secretary of \n     Defense is directed to submit a comprehensive report to the \n     House and the Senate Committees on Appropriations that \n     provides the following information for each existing \n     operations and maintenance contract in excess of $1,000,000: \n     contractor name; amount; purpose; start and end date; type of \n     contract; and amount of awards per fiscal year, if \n     applicable.\n       This report should also identify the Department of Defense \n     organization responsible for oversight of the contracts and \n     should reflect the type of services provided, such as vehicle \n     maintenance, food service, security, information technology \n     support, reconstruction, analysis, and other relevant \n     information.\n       This report should also include a discussion of the roles \n     and responsibilities of the following organizations and how \n     they work collaboratively to ensure appropriate contract \n     oversight in theaters of operation for Iraq and Afghanistan: \n     LOGCAP; AFCAP; Defense Reconstruction Support Office; Joint \n     Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan; Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary--Army (Policy\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\n     and Procurement)--Iraq and Afghanistan; and Project and \n     Contracting Office, Washington.\n       Further, the report should include the number of Department \n     of Defense military and Federal civilian personnel assigned \n     to each of these offices, the number of contractors assigned \n     to each office and the roles the contractors perform.\n       As part of this report, should the Department of Defense \n     determine that it has insufficient in-house capability to \n     effectively monitor these contracts, it should then develop a \n     robust staffing proposal and submit it to the House and the \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations for consideration in the \n     fiscal year 2009 Defense Appropriations Act. The report shall \n     be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a \n     classified annex.\n\n\n                         SUBSISTENCE CONTRACTS\n\n       The Army requested $987,000,000 to fund purchases of \n     subsistence items in support of Department of Defense \n     civilian employees and contractors deployed to the Iraq and \n     Afghanistan areas of operations. This also includes \n     subsistence that is provided to these individuals within the \n     Department of Defense dining facilities.\n       The Army estimates that 5,000 Department of Defense \n     civilians and 73,000 contractor personnel constitute the \n     population of ``Department of Defense authorized personnel''. \n     This is an average cost for subsistence of nearly $13,000 per \n     individual per year.\n       There are significant unanswered questions regarding the \n     management of this overall process, as well as the absence of \n     appropriate internal control procedures. For example, how the \n     Department manages access to the dining facilities; the \n     number of civilian employees and contractors who dine in \n     Department of Defense dining facilities; why the cost per \n     person is so high; and the number of contractors and \n     subcontractors who provide subsistence to the Department of \n     Defense in this theater of operations.\n       Based on these unresolved issues, the recommendation \n     includes a 10 percent reduction to the nearly $1,000,000,000 \n     request for this program to encourage better management and \n     accountability of subsistence funds. Currently the \n     Department's Cost of War Report does not account for \n     obligation of funds for subsistence. The Secretary of Defense \n     is directed to, within 90 days of enactment of this act, \n     submit a comprehensive report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House and the Senate which: (1) \n     Identifies the number of contractors dining in the Department \n     of Defense facilities in and around the Iraq and Afghanistan \n     theaters of operations and a description of the method for \n     charging the subsistence cost back to the contractor; (2) \n     Lists the total cost and the cost elements in the prior and \n     current years for subsistence for Department of Defense \n     civilians and contractors deployed to the Iraq and \n     Afghanistan areas of operations and dining in DOD facilities; \n     (3) Cites the Department's policy on the movement of freight \n     in general and subsistence items specifically in and around \n     the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of operation; the method \n     for ensuring the best value subsistence contracts are \n     awarded; and describes the method for ensuring the most fuel \n     efficient and effective mode of transportation is used; (4) \n     Identifies the number of contractors and subcontractors \n     supplying subsistence items to contractors and civilians \n     deployed to the Iraq and Afghanistan areas of operations (by \n     location); the number and types of subsistence contracts from \n     local vendors in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the method and \n     factors used to determine local vs. non local purchase of \n     these items in and around the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters \n     of operation; and (5) Provides the Department's policy on \n     access to dining facilities in the theaters of operations and \n     associated internal control procedures.\n\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PUBLIC-PRIVATE COMPETITIONS\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget's [OMB] influence over \n     the Department of Defense's public-private competitions is \n     concerning. Section 325 of the 2008 National Defense \n     Authorization Act (Public Law 110-181) prohibits OMB from \n     directing or requiring any initiation, continuation, or \n     completion of a public-private competition or the Department \n     taking action based on such an OMB direction or requirement. \n     Questions have been raised as to whether this provision is \n     being implemented. If OMB continues to influence public-\n     private competitions and contracting out of Federal employees \n     at the Department of Defense stronger provisions may be \n     warranted.\n\n\n            SUPPORT TO GLOBAL REPOSITIONING OF GROUND FORCES\n\n       The impact to the Army and Marine Corps of rebasing \n     activities, particularly as large numbers of service members \n     return from overseas bases to the continental United States \n     [CONUS], must be addressed. The recommendation provides \n     $408,000,000 to the Army's Facilities Sustainment, \n     Restoration, and Modernization program and $92,000,000 to the \n     Marine Corps' Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and \n     Modernization program to offset the growing infrastructure \n     costs associated with the global repositioning of forces. \n     These funds will be used to repair barracks, improve child \n     care facilities, and enhance community services at Army and \n     Marine Corps bases throughout the United States.\n\n\n                            OPERATING TEMPO\n\n       The supplemental funding requested in the operation and \n     maintenance accounts is largely a function of anticipating \n     operating tempo for continuation of military operations in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq through September 2008. The actual \n     operating tempo in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 has differed \n     from the estimated levels. Therefore, the recommendation \n     provides operation and maintenance funding to account for the \n     actual operating tempo.\n\n\n                            THE JOINT STAFF\n\n       The recommendation includes no funding for the Combating \n     Terrorism Readiness Fund because the requirement was funded \n     through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-116).\n\n\n      SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND \n                   RECONNAISSANCE [ISR] ACCELERATION\n\n       The recommendation includes an additional $76,450,000 in \n     Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide to accelerate the \n     fielding of ISR capabilities to Special Operations Command \n     for use in missions pertaining to high value targets. The \n     Secretary of Defense is urged to include sustainment costs \n     for these items in future budget requests.\n\n\n          DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY: LITHIUM BATTERIES SUPPLIES\n\n       Primary lithium batteries have been and remain a critical \n     consumable warfighting asset for our military. A reliable and \n     sustainable U.S. manufacturing source for these supplies is \n     critical to maintaining the full warfighting capability of \n     our military forces. The Defense Logistics Agency is \n     encouraged to take the necessary actions to ensure that at \n     least one supplier of LiSO2 batteries and one \n     supplier of LiMnO2 batteries continue \n     manufacturing in the United States with a reasonable \n     sustaining rate of production.\n\n\n                    DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY\n\n       The recommendation includes no funding for NIMBLE ELDER \n     because the requirement was funded through the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-116).\n\n\n                        FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM\n\n       The recommendation includes $50,000,000 for family advocacy \n     programs to provide counseling and family assistance \n     including child psychologists, Parents as Teachers and other \n     intervention efforts. This funding will enhance the \n     activities of the Family Advocacy Program [FAP] and provide \n     for children and families managing the difficult challenges \n     of military service. There is concern about the growing need \n     for family members to have access to professional counseling \n     to help alleviate the mental stresses associated with \n     deployments. These activities provide programs, products and \n     services to help mitigate the disruption and stress in the \n     military family when a service member is deployed, killed or \n     seriously wounded.\n\n\n                    DEFENSE HUMAN RESOURCES ACTIVITY\n\n       The recommendation includes no funding for Homeland \n     Security Presidential Directive 12 because the requirement \n     was funded through the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-116).\n\n\n                  DEFENSE SECURITY COOPERATION AGENCY\n\n       The recommendation includes $800,000,000 for coalition \n     support funds and $200,000,000 for lift and sustainment in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. It also includes an additional \n     $150,000,000 for the Global Train and Equip Program. The \n     Department of State is tasked to train and equip allied \n     nations for counterterrorism operations, yet the Department \n     of Defense continues to request funds to augment these \n     efforts due to the global war on terror. Training allied \n     nations is primarily the responsibility of the Department of \n     State. As such, the administration is urged to request the \n     appropriate level of funding for the Global Train and Equip \n     Program entirely within the Department of State in the next \n     fiscal year.\n\n\n                   OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\n       There is deep concern over the waste, fraud, and abuse that \n     has occurred in the Department's contracting activities that \n     support contingency operations overseas. The Office of the \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \n     Logistics [USD(AT)] is tasked with contractor oversight in \n     forward areas of operations. In an effort to further many of \n     the initiatives developed by USD(AT), the recommendation \n     includes additional resources to fully fund these \n     requirements, including: $8,000,000 for the Synchronized \n     Predeployment and Operational Tracker [SPOT], $2,500,000 for \n     the Joint Contingency Contract Support Office [JCCSO], \n     $2,000,000 for Military Non Contracting Officer Training, and \n     $400,000 for the Materiel Readiness Board [MRB]. The \n     recommendation also includes $3,000,000 for the Wartime \n     Contracting Commission, established by the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), \n     and $1,200,000 for the WMD Commission.\n\n\n                           IRAQ FREEDOM FUND\n\n       The recommendation includes $50,000,000 for the Iraq \n     Freedom Fund only for the Task Force to Improve Business and \n     Stability Operations--Iraq to execute the Factory Restart \n     Program.\n\n\n                  AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ SECURITY FORCES\n\n       Reprogramming.--The Department of Defense has been provided \n     significant flexibility in executing this program in the past \n     but new reprogramming procedures are required at this \n     juncture. With respect to the Iraq Security Forces Fund and \n     the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Department is \n     directed to submit prior approval reprogramming requests to \n     the congressional\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n     defense committees for proposed transfers of funds in excess \n     of $20,000,000, to the Infrastructure subactivity groups or \n     other construction related projects.\n       Infrastructure.--The Department of Defense is directed to \n     provide the congressional defense committees with a detailed \n     report by August 1, 2008 on current and future infrastructure \n     requirements for the Iraq and Afghanistan Security Forces. \n     The report shall detail all infrastructure projects that have \n     been previously funded, projects that are planned, and \n     projects that require future funding from either the United \n     States or the Governments of Iraq and Afghanistan. The \n     projects shall be broken out by Ministry of Defense and \n     Ministry of Interior requirements, year or projected year of \n     funding, source of funding, and current status of project.\n       Logistics.--The Iraq Security forces will not be able to \n     operate independent of coalition support unless they have an \n     organic logistics capability of their own. The Department of \n     Defense is directed to provide the congressional defense \n     committees with a report no later than 30 days after \n     enactment of this act, on the plan for an independent \n     logistics capability within the Iraq Security Forces. The \n     plan should address required support facilities at the \n     national, regional, and base levels, motor transport \n     capabilities, life support self sufficiency, logistics \n     training, mechanics training, ammunition re-supply \n     (decentralization, distribution, and security), fuel \n     (decentralization, distribution, and security), medical \n     supply and services, and depot warehousing, maintenance, and \n     capacity. The report should also include a resource plan to \n     reach these goals.\n       Trainers.--There is deep concern that the Department of \n     Defense has only been able to resource 44 percent of the \n     required trainers for the Afghan National Army and only 39 \n     percent for the Afghan National Police. While progress is \n     being made on training and equipping these forces, the \n     shortfall of capable trainers severely hampers our ability to \n     further this momentum. There are enormous demands for this \n     low density skill to support this mission, and the \n     recommendation provides the Department $50,000,000 for \n     additional contract personnel to address this shortfall, \n     including: $25,000,000 for the training of the Afghanistan \n     National Army for mentors at the corps and brigade levels for \n     intelligence, communications, operations, and force \n     protection, for contract mobile training teams, and for \n     contract Counter Insurgency Academy instructors; and \n     $25,000,000 for the training of the Afghanistan National \n     Police to include contract logistics system mentors, and \n     contractors for the Afghanistan National Police National \n     Training Center.\n\n\n           PISTOLS FOR AFGHAN ARMY AND AFGHAN NATIONAL POLICE\n\n       Poor quality pistols were provided to the Afghan National \n     Police and the Afghan National Army in 2005 and 2006. While \n     they have no record of manufacturing defects in service, the \n     5,000 pistols purchased for the Afghan National Army, and the \n     51,175 purchased for the Afghan National Police, under the \n     U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, through the U.S. Army \n     Security Assistance Command, lack important features desired \n     in a quality service pistol. A key missing feature is a \n     positive external safety mechanism, although the pistol does \n     have a trigger safety. It appears that there were two \n     prominent motivations for selection of the current 9mm \n     pistol. The first was cost, and for the Afghan National \n     police, the second key consideration was the fact that the \n     pistol already was in service with the Afghan National Army. \n     Based on concerns expressed by U.S. trainers, ongoing \n     procurements of pistols under 2007 and 2008 contracts are \n     delivering a pistol manufactured with the desired features \n     that were lacking in the pistols procured in 2005 and 2006. \n     Future purchases will be made by competitive bid and the \n     requirements will specify features consistent with the U.S. \n     M9 service pistol. The government agencies of the United \n     States and Afghanistan are commended for having made these \n     appropriate adjustments in the acquisition of pistols for the \n     Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police. They are \n     cautioned that haste and incomplete definition of \n     requirements, and inadequate testing, can lead to acquisition \n     of military equipment that once in use by the military may \n     prove to be inadequate in performance, reliability and \n     safety. Finally, the Department of Defense and the Department \n     of State are urged to work cooperatively to ensure that \n     programs for the provision of equipment to the Afghan \n     National Army and Afghan National Police employ rigorous \n     requirements definition and disciplined contracting \n     procedures, and that the Secretary of Defense initiate a \n     review of the utility of pistols provided to the Afghan \n     National Army and Afghan National Police under U.S. Foreign \n     Military Sales transactions and assist where necessary in the \n     replacement and demilitarization of inferior pistols.\n\n\n                              PROCUREMENT\n\n       An appropriation of $42,006,355,000 is recommended for \n     Procurement.\n       The recommendations

Accordingly, the recommendation provides additional \n     funding as follows: $30,000,000 for UH-60A to UH-60L \n     modifications, to remanufacture 30 aircraft; $14,650,000 for \n     UH-60 aircraft safety enhancements; $38,000,000 for Kiowa \n     Warrior Safety Enhancement program; and $196,100,000 for Army \n     fixed and rotary wing aircraft survivability enhancements in \n     infrared countermeasures.\n       There is strong support for the Army plan to replace the \n     aging Kiowa Warrior fleet with Armed Reconnaissance \n     Helicopters [ARH] as soon as possible. However, the funding \n     provided in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n     2008 fully funded the ARH production capacity for fiscal year \n     2008. Accordingly, the recommendation includes no additional \n     funding for the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program.\n\n\n                               M4 CARBINE\n\n       Numerous concerns have been raised about continued \n     procurement of the M4 carbine. These concerns range from \n     performance issues (such as jamming in dusty environments) to \n     the current sole source contract. The Army recently conducted \n     tests on the M4 and similar weapons in the same class to \n     assess its performance. The Army is also evaluating the \n     capability of the M4 and other weapons to determine if a new \n     performance requirement is needed. To allay the concerns \n     regarding performance and competition in contracting, the \n     Secretary of the Army is directed to provide a report to the \n     congressional defense committees no later than June 15, 2008, \n     on the findings of the recent comparative capability \n     assessment and with a determination as to whether a change in \n     the acquisition strategy is needed.\n\n\n                   FAMILY OF MEDIUM TACTICAL VEHICLES\n\n       The recommendation includes $793,600,000 for the Family of \n     Medium Tactical Vehicles program. This funding level includes \n     $94,000,000 to reimburse the program for funds that were used \n     under rapid acquisition authority to procure Sky Warrior \n     intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\n       SINGLE CHANNEL GROUND AND AIRBORNE RADIO SYSTEM [SINCGARS]\n\n       The recommendation includes $500,347,000 for the \n     procurement of SINCGARS radios, which will fully fund Army \n     SINCGARS radio requirements for fiscal year 2008. However, \n     the Army has yet to fully address certain issues including \n     concerns of the Army Science Board regarding SINCGARS \n     compatibility with the Joint Tactical Radio System [JTRS], \n     encryption modernization, and compatibility with local first \n     responder radios. The Army is urged to move forward with a \n     plan that addresses these and other urgent tactical radio \n     issues.\n       The Army has recently updated the acquisition strategy for \n     the SINCGARS family of radios and has released a market \n     survey seeking sources of supply that are compliant with the \n     operational requirements. The Army is encouraged to implement \n     ``best value'' selection criteria in any upcoming competition \n     where the operational requirements are stated as the minimum \n     needed and advanced capabilities and features would be \n     evaluated according to the value they bring above that \n     minimum functionality level. Not more than 60 days after \n     enactment of this act, the Secretary of the Army shall \n     provide a report and briefing to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     addressing the acquisition objective; encryption \n     modernization and capability enhancement; alignment with the \n     JTRS program; and a procurement plan that includes a strategy \n     for full, fair and open competition.\n\n\n                        MARITIME PATROL AIRCRAFT\n\n       The Navy has recently grounded 39 P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol \n     Aircraft due to wing cracking discovered during inspections. \n     These aircraft have logged significant hours flying in \n     support of the Global War on Terror. To keep these aircraft \n     flying until the replacement Multi-Mission Aircraft (P-8A \n     Poseidon) is fielded, $313,900,000 is provided for the \n     procurement and installation of wing repair kits.\n\n\n                MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT DEFENSIVE WEAPONS\n\n       Marine Corps aircraft deployed in theater should have a \n     capable self defense system. Some of the deployed Marine \n     Corps aircraft have less than capable or outdated defensive \n     systems. To improve the capability of deployed Marine Corps \n     aircraft, $15,000,000 is provided for the procurement of \n     defensive weapons for V-22 aircraft and $3,500,000 is \n     provided for the procurement of defensive weapons for CH-46 \n     aircraft.\n\n\n                      GROW THE FORCE--MARINE CORPS\n\n       The recommendation provides funds identified by the Marine \n     Corps associated with growing the size of its force, to \n     include $26,400,000 for lightweight 155mm howitzers, \n     $12,000,000 for weapons, $43,000,000 for trailers and \n     $144,000,000 for armored vehicle sets.\n\n\n   MARINE CORPS GROUND-BASED OPERATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM [G-BOSS]\n\n       The fiscal year 2008 supplemental request included \n     $640,000,000 for G-BOSS, a capability that will provide \n     updated base security for the Marine Corps. Public Law 110-\n     161 provided $340,000,000 of that total program requirement. \n     Briefings with the Marine Corps and the Joint Improvised \n     Explosive Device Defeat Organization [JIEDDO] indicate that \n     JIEDDO will fund the remaining G-BOSS requirement of \n     $300,000,000.\n\n\n                            C-17 GLOBEMASTER\n\n       In light of increases to both the Army and Marine Corps \n     end-strength and the emerging lift needs of the Future Combat \n     System, the Department of Defense has not adequately assessed \n     strategic lift requirements. The need for an accurate \n     assessment is critical because the C-17 aircraft production \n     line is facing shut-down in the very near-term. As a prudent \n     course of action to avoid plant shutdown before the \n     requirement is fully assessed, the recommendation provides \n     $3,604,500,000 to procure 15 C-17 aircraft.\n\n\n                        C/KC/MC-130J PROCUREMENT\n\n       An appropriation of $2,469,700,000 is recommended for the \n     procurement of 34 C/KC/MC-130J aircraft. Given the age and \n     usage of the C-130, KC-130 and MC-130 fleets, it is \n     justifiable to acquire replacement aircraft faster and in \n     higher quantities in order to drive down unit acquisition \n     costs and operating costs. Therefore, the recommendation \n     fully funds 18 C-130J aircraft, seven MC-130J aircraft and \n     nine KC-130J aircraft. These funds are provided with the \n     expectation that the Department of Defense will proceed \n     expeditiously with negotiations to enter into a follow-on \n     joint multi-year procurement contract in order to lock in \n     lower acquisition prices. It is anticipated that the savings \n     achieved with a multi-year procurement contract will be \n     applied to the associated economic order quantity \n     requirement.\n\n\n            LARGE AIRCRAFT INFRARED COUNTERMEASURES [LAIRCM]\n\n       The fiscal year 2007 supplemental provided $112,400,000 to \n     install LAIRCM on C-37 aircraft at an estimated cost of \n     $11,200,000 per aircraft. Due to discounts offered by the \n     vendor and installer for subsequent aircraft, each additional \n     aircraft modification was approximately 50 percent of the \n     original estimate, resulting in a savings of $55,000,000. The \n     Secretary of the Air Force is directed to use the savings to \n     fund the LAIRCM modification for C-20B and C-20H aircraft. \n     These aircraft are not currently tasked for missions into \n     areas where man-portable, shoulder-fired, infrared seeking \n     anti-aircraft missile countermeasures are required. \n     Passengers are transferred to combat aircraft such as the C-\n     130 and C-17 that are equipped with countermeasure equipment. \n     These modifications will allow the C-20B/H aircraft to be \n     tasked for missions directly into areas\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\n     where countermeasures are required and, thus, negate the need \n     for combat aircraft to be diverted for these missions.\n\n\n                          HANDGUN REPLACEMENT\n\n       The recommendation includes no funding for the Air Force to \n     replace its handgun. $5,000,000 was provided in fiscal year \n     2007 to perform a study on replacing the handgun that was not \n     executed because there was no validated requirement for a new \n     handgun. This remains an unsubstantiated need for fiscal year \n     2008 supplemental funds and the Air Force is urged to request \n     funds in the baseline account if it intends to pursue this \n     program in the future.\n\n\n                  NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE EQUIPMENT\n\n       The recommendation for the National Guard and Reserve \n     Equipment Account is $825,000,000. Of this amount, \n     $675,000,000 is for the Army National Guard and $150,000,000 \n     is for the U.S. Army Reserve to meet urgent equipment needs \n     that may arise this fiscal year. This funding will allow the \n     Army Guard and Army Reserve to procure high priority items \n     such as: AH-64 helicopter modifications from A model to D \n     model for the Army Guard; HH-60 Blackhawk medical evacuation \n     helicopters for the Army Reserve; UH-60 helicopter model A to \n     L conversions; HMMWV utility vehicles; Heavy Expanded Mobile \n     Tactical Trucks; Liquid Logistics Storage and Distribution \n     Systems; sniper detection devices; MILSATCOM, NAVSTAR GPS, \n     and other communications equipment; Night Vision equipment; \n     psychological operations equipment; Water Purification \n     Systems; Air Traffic Control Simulator Systems; Light Medium \n     and Medium Tactical Vehicles; trucks, tractors, and line haul \n     equipment; Armored Security Vehicles; Joint Service \n     Transportable Decontamination Systems -Small Scale [JSTDS-\n     SS]; Logistics Automation Systems [SAMS-E, CAISI, and VSAT]; \n     and tactical bridging and power generating equipment.\n\n               RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION\n\n       An appropriation of $1,745,483,000 is recommended for \n     Research, Development, Test and

FACILITIES SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION AND MODERNIZATION\n\n       The recommendation includes an additional $293,023,000 for \n     sustainment, restoration and modernization of military \n     medical projects for the Army, Navy and Air Force. The \n     average ``recapitalization rate'' (aggregate investment in \n     infrastructure) for civilian hospitals is 21 years and the \n     current Department of Defense medical facility \n     recapitalization rate exceeds 75 years. This funding is only \n     a temporary band-aid for certain facilities and the \n     Department is urged to request the necessary military \n     construction funds.\n\n\n              JOINT MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n       The recommendation includes $5,000,000 in the Information \n     Management budget activity group within operation and \n     maintenance and $25,000,000 in procurement for the \n     advancement of real time interoperability of medical images \n     and data. This project enables real-time interoperability for \n     the Theater Medical Information Program [TMIP] and other \n     Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and \n     civilian medical systems to provide life saving capabilities \n     to our service men and women. TMIP applications are currently \n     deployed all the way down to our field medics to record \n     patient encounter data, usually at the point of injury. \n     Department of Defense medical application data is not \n     currently in a common data format; Veterans Affairs data is \n     entered as text, preventing the data from being computable. \n     Integration and processing of data is not done in real-time; \n     utilizing data in this manner can require days, even weeks. \n     This project enables real time interoperability for life \n     saving data to Emergency Operations Centers for the Army, Air \n     Force and Navy Combatant Commands, eliminating life \n     threatening situations where medical assets are potentially \n     not available to those that need them. Without those medical \n     assets being available, the lives, health and safety of our \n     forces are at stake.\n\n\n           UNFUNDED FISCAL YEAR 2008 PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\n       The recommendation includes an additional $62,000,000 for \n     unfunded procurement requirements for the Army and Navy. The \n     Air Force does not have any unfunded procurement requirements \n     for fiscal year 2008. Providing the most advanced medical \n     equipment is essential for the care of our service members \n     and their families and the Services have a limited ability to \n     procure critical medical technology because of the \n     exponential cost growth for medical equipment and the \n     restrictions on the service medical accounts. Additional \n     procurement resources have been provided to the Services for \n     the past 2 years and the Department must make a concerted \n     effort to reflect these requirements in future budget \n     submissions for the Defense Health Program.\n\n\n           BATTLE CASUALTY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH RESEARCH\n\n       The recommendation includes an additional $273,800,000 to \n     address prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and mitigation of \n     deployment-related injuries and psychological health \n     concerns. These funds are targeted to accelerate ongoing \n     programs and are for peer reviewed research into emergent \n     approaches and technologies. These funds are directed toward \n     the following research areas: final development of medical \n     devices for use in theater (including portable suction \n     machines and EKGs for theater hospitals); blood safety and \n     blood products; burns (including tissue viability and fluid \n     resuscitation); orthopedic and other trauma treatment and \n     rehabilitation (including face, visual/ocular and nerve \n     damage, dental, and auditory systems); suicide prevention and \n     counseling (including reducing nurse stress and fatigue at \n     military treatment facilities); traumatic brain injury and \n     psychological health (including Post Traumatic Stress \n     Disorder); injury prevention; wound infection and healing; \n     treatment for severe cutaneous leishmaniasis; and wound \n     infection vaccines. These funds shall be executed through the \n     Army's Medical Research and Materiel Command. The Army is \n     directed to work in conjunction with the Navy and the Air \n     Force to augment all Department of Defense research efforts \n     in these areas. The Department is directed to provide a \n     report with a detailed plan for the use of these funds and \n     timeline for execution by August 1, 2008.\n\n\n           CENTER FOR NEUROSCIENCE AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE\n\n       The recommendation includes an additional $70,000,000 to \n     increase investigators and research capabilities in Traumatic \n     Brain Injury and regenerative medicine across the Armed \n     Forces. The focus of this initiative is an intramural start-\n     up for the study of blast injury to the brain and post \n     traumatic stress by studying actual combat casualties cared \n     for at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Naval \n     Medical Center and using sophisticated neuroimaging \n     technology at the National Institute of Health's Clinical \n     Center.\n\n\n       POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise available to the Defense \n     Health Program, $75,000,000 is available to continue work for \n     traumatic brain injury and psychological health.\n\n         Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense\n\n       An appropriation of $65,317,000 is recommended for Drug \n     Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense for \n     operations in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, \n     Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkmenistan.\n\n                    Office of the Inspector General\n\n       An appropriation of $6,394,000 is recommended for the \n     Office of the Inspector General. This is an increase of \n     $2,000,000 in research, development, test and evaluation \n     funding for the development of an Investigative Data System \n     for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS CHAPTER\n\n       The recommended bill includes the following general \n     provisions for this chapter:\n       Section 11101 establishes the period of availability for \n     obligation for appropriations provided in this chapter.\n       Section 11102 provides that funds made available in this \n     chapter are in addition to amounts provided elsewhere for the \n     Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008.\n       Section 11103 provides for special transfer authority of up \n     to $2,500,000,000 of funds in\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n     this chapter, subject to the terms and conditions in section \n     8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008.\n       Section 11104 provides that of the funds made available for \n     the Department of Defense, $1,226,841,000 may be used to \n     execute programs under the Commander's Emergency Response \n     Program for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Philippines.\n       Section 11105 provides for transfer of funds to the Defense \n     Cooperation Account to appropriations or funds as determined \n     by the Secretary of Defense.\n       Section 11106 provides that not to exceed $20,000,000 of \n     funds made available under ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-\n     Drug Activities, Defense'' may be used to support counter-\n     drug activities of certain governments, and that such support \n     is in addition to support provided under any other provision \n     of law.\n       Section 11107 provides for up to 20 heavy and light armored \n     vehicles for force protection purposes in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and up to 21 vehicles from funds previously \n     appropriated.\n       Section 11108 provides for the transfer of funds to the \n     Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund.\n       Section 11109 provides up to $150,000,000 to support the \n     development of foreign national counterterrorism \n     capabilities.\n\n                               CHAPTER 2\n\n            BRIDGE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY\n\n                                Overview\n\n\n                             Recommendation\n\n       On May 2, the administration presented a request of \n     $65,960,936,000 for supplemental appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense, not including military construction. \n     The recommendation in title XI, chapter 2, is \n     $65,921,157,000.\n       The following table summarizes by appropriation account or \n     general provision, the recommendation:\n\n                        [In thousands of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Committee\n                                                         recommendation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Chapter 2\n \n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY\n \n                  Military Personnel\n \nMilitary Personnel, Army (emergency).................           839,000\nMilitary Personnel, Navy (emergency).................            75,000\nMilitary Personnel, Marine Corps (emergency).........            55,000\nMilitary Personnel, Air Force (emergency)............            75,000\nNational Guard Personnel, Army (emergency)...........           150,000\n                                                      ------------------\n      Total, Military Personnel......................         1,194,000\n \n              Operation and Maintenance\n \nOperation & Maintenance, Army (emergency)............        37,300,000\nOperation & Maintenance, Navy (emergency)............         3,500,000\n    (Transfer out) (emergency).......................

The \n     intelligence community, Department of Defense and other \n     organizations are expected to fully comply with the \n     recommendations and direction in the classified annex \n     accompanying this act.\n\n\n                         REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to \n     the congressional defense committees within 30 days of \n     enactment of this act on the allocation of the funds within \n     the accounts listed in this chapter. The Secretary shall \n     submit updated reports 30 days after the end of each fiscal \n     quarter until funds listed in this chapter are no longer \n     available for obligation. The Secretary is directed that \n     these reports shall include: a detailed accounting of \n     obligations and expenditures of appropriations provided in \n     this chapter by program and subactivity group for the \n     continuation of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \n     and a listing of equipment procured using funds provided in \n     this chapter. It is expected that, in order to meet \n     unanticipated requirements, the Department of Defense may \n     need to transfer funds within these appropriation accounts \n     for purposes other than those specified in this report. The \n     Department of Defense is directed to follow normal prior \n     approval reprogramming procedures should it be necessary to \n     transfer funding between different appropriations accounts in \n     this chapter.\n       Additionally, the Department of Defense is directed to \n     submit monthly supplemental execution reports to the \n     congressional defense committees that include the following \n     information by appropriation: funding appropriated, funding \n     allocated, monthly obligations, monthly disbursements, \n     cumulative fiscal year obligations, and cumulative fiscal \n     year disbursements.\n\n\n                MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLES\n\n       The recommendation includes $1,700,000,000 for the Mine \n     Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund. This funds \n     requirements for ballistic testing, sustainment and \n     transportation of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, \n     as identified by the Department. The Department shall \n     continue to adhere to the execution and reporting \n     requirements contained in section 8122 of Public Law 110-116. \n     Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is directed to include \n     future requests for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle \n     sustainment in the base budget starting with the fiscal year \n     2010 President's budget request submission.\n\n                           MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n       An appropriation of $1,194,000,000 is recommended for \n     Military Personnel.\n       The recommendations for each military

ADMISSION OF TEMPORARY H-2A WORKERS.\n\n       [(a) Conditions for Approval of H-2A Petitions.--\n       [(1) A petition to import an alien as an H-2A worker (as \n     defined in subsection (i)(2)) may not be approved by the \n     Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the \n     Secretary of Labor for a certification that--\n       [(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, \n     willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time \n     and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved \n     in the petition, and\n       [(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services \n     will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of \n     workers in the United States similarly employed.\n       [(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a \n     condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee \n     to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications \n     for certification.\n       [(b) Conditions for Denial of Labor Certification.--The \n     Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under \n     subsection (a) with respect to an employer if the conditions \n     described in that subsection are not met or if any of the \n     following conditions are met:\n       [(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor \n     dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such \n     certification.\n       [(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period \n     employed H-2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has \n     determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that \n     the employer at any time during that period substantially \n     violated a material term or condition of the labor \n     certification with respect to the employment of domestic or \n     nonimmigrant workers.\n       [(B) No employer may be denied certification under \n     subparagraph (A) for more than three years for any violation \n     described in such subparagraph.\n       [(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with \n     satisfactory assurances that if the employment for which the \n     certification is sought is not covered by State workers' \n     compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to \n     the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out \n     of and in the course of the worker's employment which will \n     provide benefits at least equal to those provided under the \n     State workers' compensation law for comparable employment.\n       [(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not \n     made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region \n     of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary \n     finds that there are a significant number of qualified United \n     States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make \n     themselves available for work at the time and place needed. \n     Positive recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, \n     and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the \n     circulation through the interstate employment service system \n     of the employer's job offer. The obligation to engage in \n     positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on \n     the date the H-2A workers depart for the employer's place of \n     employment.\n       [(c) Special Rules for Consideration of Applications.--The \n     following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and \n     consideration of an application for a labor certification \n     under this section:\n       [(1) Deadline for filing applications.--The Secretary of \n     Labor may not require that the application be filed more than \n     45 days before the first date the employer requires the labor \n     or services of the H-2A worker.\n       [(2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies.--\n       [(A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven \n     days of the date of filing if the application does not meet \n     the standards (other than that described in subsection \n     (a)(1)(A)) for approval.\n       [(B) If the application does not meet such standards, the \n     notice shall include the reasons therefor and the Secretary \n     shall provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a \n     modified application.\n       [(3) Issuance of certification.--\n       [(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 30 \n     days before the date such labor or services are first \n     required to be performed, the certification described in \n     subsection (a)(1) if--\n       [(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for \n     certification (including criteria for the recruitment of \n     eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and\n       [(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been \n     provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals \n     who have indicated their availability to perform such labor \n     or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which \n     meets the requirements of the Secretary. In considering the \n     question of whether a specific qualification is appropriate \n     in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the normal and \n     accepted qualifications required by non-H-2A-employers in the \n     same or comparable occupations and crops.\n       [(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective \n     date of this section, labor certifications shall remain \n     effective only if, from the time the foreign worker departs \n     for the employer's place of employment, the employer will \n     provide employment to any qualified United States worker who \n     applies to the employer until 50 percent of the period of the \n     work contract, under which the foreign worker who is in the \n     job was hired, has elapsed. In addition, the employer will \n     offer to provide benefits, wages and working conditions \n     required pursuant to this section and regulations.\n       [(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any \n     employer who--\n       [(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the \n     preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of \n     agricultural labor, as defined in section 3(u) of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203 (u)),\n       [(II) is not a member of an association which has \n     petitioned for certification under this section for its \n     members, and\n       [(III) has not otherwise associated with other employers \n     who are petitioning for temporary foreign workers under this \n     section.\n       [(iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period \n     described in clause (i), the Secretary of Labor shall \n     consider the findings of the report mandated by section \n     403(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n     1986 as well as other relevant materials, including evidence \n     of benefits to United States workers and costs to employers, \n     addressing the advisability of continuing a policy which \n     requires an employer, as a condition for certification under \n     this section, to continue to accept qualified, eligible \n     United States workers for employment after the date the H-2A \n     workers depart for work with the employer. The Secretary's \n     review of such findings and materials shall lead to the \n     issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional \n     policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless \n     there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are \n     able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service \n     needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or \n     services will not adversely affect the wages and working \n     conditions of workers in the United States similarly \n     employed. In the absence of the enactment of Federal \n     legislation prior to three months before the end of the 3-\n     year period described in clause (i) which addresses the \n     subject matter of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall \n     immediately publish the findings required by this clause, and \n     shall promulgate, on an interim or final basis, regulations \n     based on his findings which shall be effective no later than \n     three years from the effective date of this section.\n       [(iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an \n     association shall be allowed to refer or transfer workers \n     among its members: Provided, That for purposes of this \n     section an association acting as an agent for its members \n     shall not be considered a joint employer merely because of \n     such referral or transfer.\n       [(v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant \n     to clause (iv) of this subparagraph shall not be treated \n     disparately.\n       [(vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under \n     section 655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or any successor regulation) with respect to an \n     H-2A worker who is displaced due to compliance with the \n     requirement of this subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor \n     certifies that the H-2A worker was displaced because of the \n     employer's compliance with clause (i) of this subparagraph.\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\n       [(vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly \n     withhold domestic workers prior to the arrival of H-2A \n     workers in order to force the hiring of domestic workers \n     under clause (i).\n       [(II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a \n     violation of subclause (I) has occurred the Secretary shall \n     immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the \n     receipt of the complaint issue findings concerning the \n     alleged violation. Where the Secretary finds that a violation \n     has occurred, he shall immediately suspend the application of \n     clause (i) of this subparagraph with respect to that \n     certification for that date of need.\n       [(4) Housing.--Employers shall furnish housing in \n     accordance with regulations. The employer shall be permitted \n     at the employer's option to provide housing meeting \n     applicable Federal standards for temporary labor camps or to \n     secure housing which meets the local standards for rental \n     and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation: Provided, That in the absence of \n     applicable local standards, State standards for rental and/or \n     public accommodations or other substantially similar class of \n     habitation shall be met: Provided further, That in the \n     absence of applicable local or State standards, Federal \n     temporary labor camp standards shall apply: Provided further, \n     That the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations which \n     address the specific requirements of housing for employees \n     principally engaged in the range production of livestock: \n     Provided further, That when it is the prevailing practice in \n     the area and occupation of intended employment to provide \n     family housing, family housing shall be provided to workers \n     with families who request it: And Provided further, That \n     nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer to \n     provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to \n     it under the temporary labor certification regulations in \n     effect on June 1, 1986.

If the employer asserts \n     that any eligible individual who has been referred is not \n     able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to establish that the individual referred is not \n     able, willing, or qualified because of employmentrelated \n     reasons.\n       [(f) Violators Disqualified for 5 Years.--An alien may not \n     be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural \n     worker if the alien was admitted to the United States as such \n     a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien \n     during that period violated a term or condition of such \n     previous admission.\n       [(g) Authorizations of Appropriations.--\n       [(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each \n     fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, $10,000,000 for \n     the purposes--\n       [(A) of recruiting domestic workers for temporary labor and \n     services which might otherwise be performed by nonimmigrants \n     described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), and\n       [(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such \n     nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same \n     employers) are employed in the United States.\n       [(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such \n     actions, including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking \n     appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of \n     contractual obligations, as may be necessary to assure \n     employer compliance with terms and conditions of employment \n     under this section.\n       [(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each \n     fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as \n     may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of \n     Labor to make determinations and certifications under this \n     section and under section 212(a)(5)(A)(i).\n       [(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each \n     fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as \n     may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to carry out the Secretary's duties and \n     responsibilities under this section.\n       [(h) Miscellaneous Provisions.--\n       [(1) The Attorney General shall provide for such \n     endorsement of entry and exit documents of nonimmigrants \n     described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii) as may be necessary to \n     carry out this section and to provide notice for purposes of \n     section 274A.\n       [(2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section \n     214 and the provisions of this section preempt any State or \n     local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.\n       [(i) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       [(1) The term ``eligible individual'' means, with respect \n     to employment, an individual who is not an unauthorized alien \n     (as defined in section 274A(h)(3) with respect to that \n     employment.\n       [(2) The term ``H-2A worker'' means a nonimmigrant \n     described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a).]\n\n     SEC. 218.

Conversely, no job \n     offer may impose on\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\n     United States workers any restrictions or obligations which \n     will not be imposed on the employer's H-2A workers.\n       (b) Minimum Benefits, Wages, and Working Conditions.--\n     Except in cases where higher benefits, wages, or working \n     conditions are required by the provisions of subsection (a), \n     in order to protect similarly employed United States workers \n     from adverse effects with respect to benefits, wages, and \n     working conditions, every job offer which shall accompany an \n     application under section 218(b)(2) shall include each of the \n     following benefit, wage, and working condition provisions:\n       (1) Requirement to provide housing or a housing \n     allowance.--\n       (A) In general.--An employer applying under section 218(a) \n     for H-2A workers shall offer to provide housing at no cost to \n     all workers in job opportunities for which the employer has \n     applied under that section and to all other workers in the \n     same occupation at the place of employment, whose place of \n     residence is beyond normal commuting distance.\n       (B) Type of housing.--In complying with subparagraph (A), \n     an employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.

An employer may require a worker found to \n     have been responsible for damage to such housing which is not \n     the result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (G) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (i) In general.--If the requirement set out in clause (ii) \n     is satisfied, the employer may provide a reasonable housing \n     allowance instead of offering housing under subparagraph (A). \n     Upon the request of a worker seeking assistance in locating \n     housing, the employer shall make a good faith effort to \n     assist the worker in identifying and locating housing in the \n     area of intended employment. An employer who offers a housing \n     allowance to a worker, or assists a worker in locating \n     housing which the worker occupies, pursuant to this clause \n     shall not be deemed a housing provider under section 203 of \n     the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 1823) solely by virtue of providing such housing \n     allowance. No housing allowance may be used for housing which \n     is owned or controlled by the employer.\n       (ii) Certification.--The requirement of this clause is \n     satisfied if the Governor of the State certifies to the \n     Secretary of Labor that there is adequate housing available \n     in the area of intended employment for migrant farm workers \n     and H-2A workers who are seeking temporary housing while \n     employed in agricultural work. Such certification shall \n     expire after 3 years unless renewed by the Governor of the \n     State.\n       (iii) Amount of allowance.--\n\n       (I) Nonmetropolitan counties.--If the place of employment \n     of the workers provided an allowance under this subparagraph \n     is a nonmetropolitan county, the amount of the housing \n     allowance under this subparagraph shall be equal to the \n     statewide average fair market rental for existing housing for \n     nonmetropolitan counties for the State, as established by the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to \n     section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit and an \n     assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n       (II) Metropolitan counties.--If the place of employment of \n     the workers provided an allowance under this paragraph is in \n     a metropolitan county, the amount of the housing allowance \n     under this subparagraph shall be equal to the statewide \n     average fair market rental for existing housing for \n     metropolitan counties for the State, as established by the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to \n     section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit and an \n     assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n\n       (2) Reimbursement of transportation.--\n       (A) To place of employment.--A worker who completes 50 \n     percent of the period of employment of the job opportunity \n     for which the worker was hired shall be reimbursed by the \n     employer for the cost of the worker's transportation and \n     subsistence from the place from which the worker came to work \n     for the employer (or place of last employment, if the worker \n     traveled from such place) to the place of employment.\n       (B) From place of employment.--A worker who completes the \n     period of employment for the job opportunity involved shall \n     be reimbursed by the employer for the cost of the worker's \n     transportation and subsistence from the place of employment \n     to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening \n     employment, came to work for the employer, or to the place of \n     next employment, if the worker has contracted with a \n     subsequent employer who has not agreed to provide or pay for \n     the worker's transportation and subsistence to such \n     subsequent employer's place of employment.\n       (C) Limitation.--\n       (i) Amount of reimbursement.--Except as provided in clause \n     (ii), the amount of reimbursement provided under subparagraph \n     (A) or (B) to a worker or alien shall not exceed the lesser \n     of--\n\n       (I) the actual cost to the worker or alien of the \n     transportation and subsistence involved; or\n       (II) the most economical and reasonable common carrier \n     transportation charges and subsistence costs for the distance \n     involved.\n\n       (ii) Distance traveled.--No reimbursement under \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be required if the distance \n     traveled is 100 miles or less, or the worker is not residing \n     in employer-provided housing or housing secured through an \n     allowance as provided in paragraph (1)(G).\n       (D) Early termination.--If the worker is laid off or \n     employment is terminated for contract impossibility (as \n     described in paragraph (4)(D)) before the anticipated ending \n     date of employment, the employer shall provide the \n     transportation and subsistence required by subparagraph (B) \n     and, notwithstanding whether the worker has completed 50 \n     percent of the period of employment, shall provide the \n     transportation reimbursement required by subparagraph (A).\n       (E) Transportation between living quarters and worksite.--\n     The employer shall provide transportation between the \n     worker's living quarters and the employer's worksite without \n     cost to the worker, and such transportation will be in \n     accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n       (3) Required wages.--\n       (A) In general.--An employer applying for workers under \n     section 218(a) shall offer to pay, and shall pay, all workers \n     in the occupation for which the employer has applied for \n     workers, not less (and is not required to pay more) than the \n     greater of the prevailing wage in the occupation in the area \n     of intended employment or the adverse effect wage rate. No \n     worker shall be paid less than the greater of the hourly wage \n     prescribed under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) or the applicable State \n     minimum wage.\n       (B) Limitation.--Effective on the date of the enactment of \n     the Emergency Agriculture Relief Act of 2008 and continuing \n     for 3 years thereafter, no adverse effect wage rate for a \n     State may be more than the adverse effect wage rate for that \n     State in effect on January 1, 2008, as established by section \n     655.107 of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (C) Required wages after 3-year freeze.--If Congress does \n     not set a new wage standard applicable to this section before \n     March 1, 2012, the adverse effect wage rate for each State \n     beginning on March 1, 2012 shall be the wage rate that would \n     have resulted under the methodology in effect on January 1, \n     2008.\n       (D) Deductions.--The employer shall make only those \n     deductions from the worker's wages that are authorized by law \n     or are reasonable and customary in the occupation and area of \n     employment. The job offer shall specify all deductions not \n     required by law which the employer will make from the \n     worker's wages.\n       (E) Frequency of pay.--The employer shall pay the worker \n     not less frequently than twice monthly, or in accordance with \n     the prevailing practice in the area of employment, whichever \n     is more frequent.\n       (F) Hours and earnings statements.--The employer shall \n     furnish to the worker, on or before each payday, in 1 or more \n     written statements--\n       (i) the worker's total earnings for the pay period;\n       (ii) the worker's hourly rate of pay, piece rate of pay, or \n     both;\n       (iii) the hours of employment which have been offered to \n     the worker (broken out by hours offered in accordance with \n     and over and above the \\3/4\\ guarantee described in paragraph \n     (4);\n       (iv) the hours actually worked by the worker;\n       (v) an itemization of the deductions made from the worker's \n     wages; and\n       (vi) if piece rates of pay are used, the units produced \n     daily.\n       (G) Report on wage protections.--Not later than December \n     31, 2010, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     prepare and transmit to the Secretary of Labor, the Committee \n     on the Judiciary of the Senate, and Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives, a report that \n     addresses--\n       (i) whether the employment of H-2A or unauthorized aliens \n     in the United States agricultural workforce has depressed \n     United States farm worker wages below the levels that would \n     otherwise have prevailed if alien farm workers had not been \n     employed in the United States;\n       (ii) whether an adverse effect wage rate is necessary to \n     prevent wages of United States farm workers in occupations in \n     which H-2A workers are employed from falling below the wage \n     levels that would have prevailed in the absence of the \n     employment of H-2A workers in those occupations;\n       (iii) whether alternative wage standards, such as a \n     prevailing wage standard, would be sufficient to prevent \n     wages in occupations in which\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\n     H-2A workers are employed from falling below the wage level \n     that would have prevailed in the absence of H-2A employment;\n       (iv) whether any changes are warranted in the current \n     methodologies for calculating the adverse effect wage rate \n     and the prevailing wage; and\n       (v) recommendations for future wage protection under this \n     section.\n       (H) Commission on wage standards.--\n       (i) Establishment.--There is established the Commission on \n     Agricultural Wage Standards under the H-2A program (in this \n     subparagraph referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (ii) Composition.--The Commission shall consist of 10 \n     members as follows:\n\n       (I) Four representatives of agricultural employers and 1 \n     representative of the Department of Agriculture, each \n     appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (II) Four representatives of agricultural workers and 1 \n     representative of the Department of Labor, each appointed by \n     the Secretary of Labor.\n\n       (iii) Functions.--The Commission shall conduct a study that \n     shall address--\n\n       (I) whether the employment of H-2A or unauthorized aliens \n     in the United States agricultural workforce has depressed \n     United States farm worker wages below the levels that would \n     otherwise have prevailed if alien farm workers had not been \n     employed in the United States;\n       (II) whether an adverse effect wage rate is necessary to \n     prevent wages of United States farm workers in occupations in \n     which H-2A workers are employed from falling below the wage \n     levels that would have prevailed in the absence of the \n     employment of H-2A workers in those occupations;\n       (III) whether alternative wage standards, such as a \n     prevailing wage standard, would be sufficient to prevent \n     wages in occupations in which H-2A workers are employed from \n     falling below the wage level that would have prevailed in the \n     absence of H-2A employment;\n       (IV) whether any changes are warranted in the current \n     methodologies for calculating the adverse effect wage rate \n     and the prevailing wage rate; and\n       (V) recommendations for future wage protection under this \n     section.\n\n       (iv) Final report.--Not later than December 31, 2010, the \n     Commission shall submit a report to the Congress setting \n     forth the findings of the study conducted under clause (iii).\n       (v) Termination date.--The Commission shall terminate upon \n     submitting its final report.\n       (4) Guarantee of employment.--\n       (A) Offer to worker.--The employer shall guarantee to offer \n     the worker employment for the hourly equivalent of at least \n     \\3/4\\ of the work days of the total period of employment, \n     beginning with the first work day after the arrival of the \n     worker at the place of employment and ending on the \n     expiration date specified in the job offer. For purposes of \n     this subparagraph, the hourly equivalent means the number of \n     hours in the work days as stated in the job offer and shall \n     exclude the worker's Sabbath and Federal holidays. If the \n     employer affords the United States or H-2A worker less \n     employment than that required under this paragraph, the \n     employer shall pay such worker the amount which the worker \n     would have earned had the worker, in fact, worked for the \n     guaranteed number of hours.\n       (B) Failure to work.--Any hours which the worker fails to \n     work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the \n     job offer for a work day, when the worker has been offered an \n     opportunity to do so, and all hours of work actually \n     performed (including voluntary work in excess of the number \n     of hours specified in the job offer in a work day, on the \n     worker's Sabbath, or on Federal holidays) may be counted by \n     the employer in calculating whether the period of guaranteed \n     employment has been met.\n       (C) Abandonment of employment, termination for cause.--If \n     the worker voluntarily abandons employment before the end of \n     the contract period, or is terminated for cause, the worker \n     is not entitled to the ``\\3/4\\ guarantee'' described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (D) Contract impossibility.--If, before the expiration of \n     the period of employment specified in the job offer, the \n     services of the worker are no longer required for reasons \n     beyond the control of the employer due to any form of natural \n     disaster, including a flood, hurricane, freeze, earthquake, \n     fire, drought, plant or animal disease or pest infestation, \n     or regulatory drought, before the guarantee in subparagraph \n     (A) is fulfilled, the employer may terminate the worker's \n     employment. In the event of such termination, the employer \n     shall fulfill the employment guarantee in subparagraph (A) \n     for the work days that have elapsed from the first work day \n     after the arrival of the worker to the termination of \n     employment. In such cases, the employer will make efforts to \n     transfer the United States worker to other comparable \n     employment acceptable to the worker. If such transfer is not \n     effected, the employer shall provide the return \n     transportation required in paragraph (2)(D).\n       (5) Motor vehicle safety.--\n       (A) Mode of transportation subject to coverage.--\n       (i) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (iii) and \n     (iv), this subsection applies to any H-2A employer that uses \n     or causes to be used any vehicle to transport an H-2A worker \n     within the United States.\n       (ii) Defined term.--In this paragraph, the term ``uses or \n     causes to be used''--\n\n       (I) applies only to transportation provided by an H-2A \n     employer to an H-2A worker, or by a farm labor contractor to \n     an H-2A worker at the request or direction of an H-2A \n     employer; and\n       (II) does not apply to--\n\n       (aa) transportation provided, or transportation \n     arrangements made, by an H-2A worker, unless the employer \n     specifically requested or arranged such transportation; or\n       (bb) car pooling arrangements made by H-2A workers \n     themselves, using 1 of the workers' own vehicles, unless \n     specifically requested by the employer directly or through a \n     farm labor contractor.\n       (iii) Clarification.--Providing a job offer to an H-2A \n     worker that causes the worker to travel to or from the place \n     of employment, or the payment or reimbursement of the \n     transportation costs of an H-2A worker by an H-2A employer, \n     shall not constitute an arrangement of, or participation in, \n     such transportation.\n       (iv) Agricultural machinery and equipment excluded.--This \n     subsection does not apply to the transportation of an H-2A \n     worker on a tractor, combine, harvester, picker, or other \n     similar machinery or equipment while such worker is actually \n     engaged in the planting, cultivating, or harvesting of \n     agricultural commodities or the care of livestock or poultry \n     or engaged in transportation incidental thereto.\n       (v) Common carriers excluded.--This subsection does not \n     apply to common carrier motor vehicle transportation in which \n     the provider holds itself out to the general public as \n     engaging in the transportation of passengers for hire and \n     holds a valid certification of authorization for such \n     purposes from an appropriate Federal, State, or local agency.\n       (B) Applicability of standards, licensing, and insurance \n     requirements.--\n       (i) In general.--When using, or causing to be used, any \n     vehicle for the purpose of providing transportation to which \n     this subparagraph applies, each employer shall--\n\n       (I) ensure that each such vehicle conforms to the standards \n     prescribed by the Secretary of Labor under section 401(b) of \n     the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 1841(b)) and other applicable Federal and State \n     safety standards;\n       (II) ensure that each driver has a valid and appropriate \n     license, as provided by State law, to operate the vehicle; \n     and\n       (III) have an insurance policy or a liability bond that is \n     in effect which insures the employer against liability for \n     damage to persons or property arising from the ownership, \n     operation, or causing to be operated, of any vehicle used to \n     transport any H-2A worker.\n\n       (ii) Amount of insurance required.--The level of insurance \n     required shall be determined by the Secretary of Labor \n     pursuant to regulations to be issued under this subsection.\n       (iii) Effect of workers' compensation coverage.--If the \n     employer of any H-2A worker provides workers' compensation \n     coverage for such worker in the case of bodily injury or \n     death as provided by State law, the following adjustments in \n     the requirements of subparagraph (B)(i)(III) relating to \n     having an insurance policy or liability bond apply:\n\n       (I) No insurance policy or liability bond shall be required \n     of the employer, if such workers are transported only under \n     circumstances for which there is coverage under such State \n     law.\n       (II) An insurance policy or liability bond shall be \n     required of the employer for circumstances under which \n     coverage for the transportation of such workers is not \n     provided under such State law.\n\n       (c) Compliance With Labor Laws.--An employer shall assure \n     that, except as otherwise provided in this section, the \n     employer will comply with all applicable Federal, State, and \n     local labor laws, including laws affecting migrant and \n     seasonal agricultural workers, with respect to all United \n     States workers and alien workers employed by the employer, \n     except that a violation of this assurance shall not \n     constitute a violation of the Migrant and Seasonal \n     Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n       (d) Copy of Job Offer.--The employer shall provide to the \n     worker, not later than the day the work commences, a copy of \n     the employer's application and job offer described in section \n     218(a), or, if the employer will require the worker to enter \n     into a separate employment contract covering the employment \n     in question, such separate employment contract.\n       (e) Range Production of Livestock.--Nothing in this \n     section, section 218, or section 218B shall preclude the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Secretary from continuing to apply \n     special procedures and requirements to the admission and \n     employment of aliens in occupations involving the range \n     production of livestock.\n\n      SEC. 218B.

Russian \n     Federation that is imported into the United States for use in \n     the initial core of a new nuclear reactor.\n       (4) Annual adjustment.--\n       (A) In general.--Beginning in the second calendar year \n     after the calendar year of the completion of the Russian HEU \n     Agreement, the Secretary of Energy shall increase or decrease \n     the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported in a \n     calendar year under paragraph (2) (including the amount of \n     low-enriched uranium that may be imported for each kilogram \n     of highly enriched uranium downblended under paragraph \n     (2)(B)(i)) by a percentage equal to the percentage increase \n     or decrease, as the case may be, in the average amount of \n     uranium loaded into nuclear power reactors in the United \n     States in the most recent 3-calendar-year period for which \n     data are available, as reported by the Energy Information \n     Administration of the Department of Energy, compared to the \n     average amount of uranium loaded into such reactors during \n     the 3-calendar-year period beginning on January 1, 2011, as \n     reported by the Energy Information Administration.\n       (B) Publication of adjustments.--As soon as practicable, \n     but not later than July 31 of each calendar year, the \n     Secretary of Energy shall publish in the Federal Register the \n     amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported in the \n     current calendar year after the adjustment under subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (5) Authority for additional adjustment.--In addition to \n     the annual adjustment under paragraph (4), the Secretary of \n     Commerce may adjust the import limitations under paragraph \n     (2)(A) for a calendar year if the Secretary--\n       (A) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \n     determines that the available supply of low-enriched uranium \n     from the Russian Federation and the available stockpiles of \n     uranium of the Department of Energy are insufficient to meet \n     demand in the United States in the following calendar year; \n     and\n       (B) notifies Congress of the adjustment not less than 45 \n     days before making the adjustment.\n       (6) Equivalent quantities of low-enriched uranium \n     imports.--\n       (A) In general.--The import limitations described in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) are expressed in terms of uranium \n     containing 4.4 percent uranium-235 and a tails assay of 0.3 \n     percent.\n       (B) Adjustment for other uranium.--Imports of low-enriched \n     uranium under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall count against the \n     import limitations described in such paragraphs in amounts \n     calculated as the quantity of low-enriched uranium containing \n     4.4 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the total amount \n     of uranium-235 contained in such imports.\n       (7) Downblending of other highly enriched uranium.--\n       (A) In general.--The downblending of highly enriched \n     uranium not of weapons origin may be counted for purposes of \n     paragraph (2)(B) or (8)(B), subject to verification under \n     paragraph (10), if the Secretary of Energy determines that \n     the highly enriched uranium to be downblended poses a risk to \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (B) Equivalent quantities of highly enriched uranium.--For \n     purposes of determining the additional low-enriched uranium \n     imports allowed under paragraph (2)(B) and for purposes of \n     paragraph (8)(B), highly enriched uranium not of weapons \n     origin downblended pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall count \n     as downblended highly enriched uranium of weapons origin in \n     amounts calculated as the quantity of highly enriched uranium \n     containing 90 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the \n     total amount of uranium-235 contained in the highly enriched \n     uranium not of weapons origin downblended pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (8) Termination of import restrictions after downblending \n     of an additional 300 metric tons of highly enriched \n     uranium.--The provisions of this subsection shall terminate \n     on the later of--\n       (A) December 31, 2020; or\n       (B) the date on which the Secretary of Energy certifies to \n     Congress that, after the completion of the Russian HEU \n     Agreement, not less than an additional 300 metric tons of \n     Russian highly enriched uranium of weapons origin have been \n     downblended.\n       (9) Special rule if importation under russian heu agreement \n     terminates early.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no low-enriched uranium produced in the Russian \n     Federation that is not derived from highly enriched uranium \n     of weapons origin, including low-enriched uranium obtained \n     under contracts for separative work units, may be imported \n     into the United States if, before the completion of the \n     Russian HEU Agreement, the Secretary of Energy determines \n     that the Russian Federation has taken deliberate action to \n     disrupt or halt the importation into the United States of \n     low-enriched uranium under the Russian HEU Agreement.\n       (10) Technical verifications by secretary of energy.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall verify the \n     origin, quantity, and uranium-235 content of the highly \n     enriched uranium downblended for purposes of paragraphs \n     (2)(B), (7), and (8)(B).\n       (B) Methods of verification.--In conducting the \n     verification required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary \n     of Energy shall employ the transparency measures provided for \n     in the Russian HEU Agreement for monitoring the downblending \n     of Russian highly enriched uranium of weapons origin and such \n     other methods as the Secretary determines appropriate.\n       (11) Enforcement of import limitations.--The Secretary of \n     Commerce shall be responsible for enforcing the import \n     limitations imposed under this subsection and shall enforce \n     such import limitations in a manner that imposes a minimal \n     burden on the commercial nuclear industry.\n       (12) Effect on other agreements.--\n       (A) Russian heu agreement.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to modify the terms of the Russian HEU \n     Agreement, including the provisions of the Agreement relating \n     to the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported \n     into the United States.\n       (B) Other agreements.--If a provision of any agreement \n     between the United States and the Russian Federation, other \n     than the Russian HEU Agreement, relating to the importation \n     of low-enriched uranium into the United States conflicts with \n     a provision of this section, the provision of this section \n     shall supersede the provision of the agreement to the extent \n     of the conflict.\n       (d) Downblending of Highly Enriched Uranium in the United \n     States.--The Secretary of Energy may sell uranium in the \n     jurisdiction of the Secretary, including downblended highly \n     enriched uranium, at fair market value to a licensed operator \n     of a nuclear reactor in the United States--\n       (1) in the event of a disruption in the nuclear fuel supply \n     in the United States; or\n       (2) after a determination of the Secretary under subsection \n     (c)(9) that the Russian Federation has taken deliberate \n     action to disrupt or halt the importation into the United \n     States of low-enriched uranium under the Russian HEU \n     Agreement.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\nAMERICAN COMPETITVENESS IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ACT OF 2000, PUBLIC \nLAW

Madam President, the current newspaper-broadcast cross-\nownership rule prohibits the coownership of a newspaper and a broadcast \nstation in the same market. This rule is the only local ownership rule \nthat has not been modified by the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, since the ownership rules went into place over 30 years ago. \nDespite massive innovation in the media marketplace, the advocates of \nS.J. Res. 28, the Dorgan resolution, want to preserve an archaic rule \nthat is no longer relevant or useful in today's media world.\n  On December 18, 2007, the FCC issued an order to provide a modest \nrelaxation of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership prohibition in \nthe top 20 markets. To ensure that one company doesn't control the \nlocal media, the prohibition is only relaxed if there are eight \nindependent television stations in the market. The rule change only \napplies to the acquisition of a television station not ranking in the \ntop four in any market, which essentially excludes network affiliated \nstations. The FCC's order further mandates that all proposed newspaper-\nbroadcast combinations be reviewed by the Commission on a case-by-case \nbasis with the opportunity for public comment. Simply put, the new FCC \nrule provides a modest relief in a limited number of markets and \nensures that any changes are carefully scrutinized.\n  After 18 months of review and more than 150,000 filed comments, 10 \nempirical studies, and 6 field hearings, the FCC fully vetted its \ndecision to relax the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule. It \ndetermined that the ``harm'' envisioned by cross-ownership is directly \ncontradicted by simple facts. Currently, there are a number of \nnewspaper-broadcast station ownership combinations that are exempt from \nthe ban through grandfathers and waivers. These combinations have \nserved the needs of the local communities well.\n  The FCC also found that the ban on newspaper-broadcast combinations \nwas established at a time when communications in any town consisted of \na newspaper and, at best, a handful of local television and radio \nstations. The rule is antiquated in today's media world where there are \nmultiple sources of news and viewpoints, such as the Internet, \nsatellite radio, blogs, cable, and other forms of communication.\n  Finally, upholding the ban would also largely ignore the dire \nfinancial condition of the newspaper industry. Due to the multiple news \nand information outlets available to consumers, local newspapers are \nfinding it harder to make a profit. What is at stake here is the long-\nterm health of newspapers and their ability to provide the kind of \njournalism that has served our democratic society well for more than \n200 years. Permitting cross-ownership with broadcast stations allows \ngreater financial efficiency in the market, allowing some newspapers to \nsurvive.\n  For all of these reasons, I will not support the Dorgan resolution. \nThe FCC's narrow rule will not lead to mass consolidation, and I would \nencourage my colleagues to consider the ramifications of reversing the \nFCC's order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4372-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I rise to honor those officers from my \nhome State of North Carolina who have lost their lives in the line of \nduty.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating \nMay 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date \nfalls as National Police Week. During this week, tens of thousands of \nlaw enforcement officers come to Washington for events that honor their \nfallen comrades.\n  Police officers are our country's first line of defense. They \ndedicate their lives to making our Nation safer. While our \nservicemembers are fighting enemies abroad, our law enforcement \nofficers are protecting our cities and towns here at home.\n  Sometimes this duty calls for the ultimate sacrifice, and, over the \npast year, North Carolina lost nine heroic officers: Charles Johnson \nAdcock Callemyn of Durham; Jason Christian Campbell of Greenville; Sean \nRobert Clark of Charlotte; James Heath Hardin of Hope Mills; Howard \nJoseph Plouff II of Winston-Salem; Jeffry Ryan Shelton of Charlotte; \nAlan Christopher Silver of Rocky Mount; Shawn Joshua Dean Williams of \nOld Fort; and Bobby Lee Cox of Burke County.\n  North Carolina, and indeed the whole country, is forever indebted to \nthese and all of the Nation's police officers who have lost their lives \nin the line of duty. May God bless the families of these brave men and \nwomen and comfort them with the fact that their loved one's service has \nmade America a better, safer place.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n                            ARMED FORCES DAY\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, over the course of this Nation's \nhistory, generations of Americans have made tremendous sacrifices to \nprotect the freedoms we hold dear. Every May, we honor these courageous \nAmericans on Armed Forces Day.\n  Just a few years after the close of World War II, President Harry S. \nTruman led the effort for this holiday. It was at the end of August, \n1949, that Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson announced the creation of \nArmed Forces Day to replace separate days of celebration for the Army, \nNavy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.\n  This is a day for all of us as Americans to come together to \nrecognize our brave military men and women for their service, \nsacrifice, and dedication to our Nation. On this Armed Forces Day, we \nare reminded of the important contributions our service men and women \nare currently making overseas to help others come to know the freedom \nwe enjoy.\n  Let us not only remember all of the service men and women who have \nserved our country so bravely, let us appreciate those serving at home \nand their families who sacrifice so much. On this day we thank members \nof our military for their selfless dedication to working everyday to \nprotect our liberty and freedom.\n  As the home to more than 20 military installations and nearly 2 \nmillion veterans, this past Saturday was a proud day for many \nFloridians. I salute all those who have given up so much for our \nNation, and express my tremendous gratitude for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4373-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Isaac Palomarez\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of Army \nSergeant Isaac Palomarez of Loveland, CO. Sergeant Palomarez was killed \nlast Friday in Kapisa Province, Afghanistan. He and his unit were \nworking to root out Taliban cells and insurgent networks when his \npatrol ran across a roadside bomb and was then attacked with grenades \nand small arms. Isaac Palomarez was 26 years old.\n  Those who knew Sergeant Palomarez describe him as a gifted student, a \nspirited competitor and successful athlete, and a soldier committed to \nhonoring his country and fulfilling his duty.\n  He was an honor student at Loveland High School who excelled in math, \nwas an avid reader of military history, and filled his free time with \nsports. He helped Loveland High School's football team win a State \nchampionship in 2000, using his talent, work ethic, and heart to \noutcompete opponents who outweighed him by 50 or a hundred pounds.\n  After graduating from high school in 2001, Isaac took classes at \nColorado State University, but was uncertain about which path to \nchoose. In 2004, sensing a responsibility to serve his country and his \ncommunity, he enlisted in the Army, following in the footsteps of his \nfather. He was assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division, out of Fort Campbell, KY.\n  Sergeant Palomarez's first deployment was to Iraq, in 2005. After a \nyear, he returned safely, in answer to the prayers of his family and \nfriends.\n  Earlier this year he deployed again, this time to Afghanistan. Kapisa \nProvince, in northwest Afghanistan, remains an outpost for Taliban and \ninsurgent forces, and is a strategic link between the border regions \nand Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. Sergeant Palomarez was working with \nhis unit and coalition forces to deny extremists a foothold in this \ncritical area. It was a dangerous mission in an unforgiving place.\n  Sergeant Palomarez served in the finest tradition of America's \nsoldiers. He was professional, compassionate, and committed to his \ncountry, community, and family. Shortly before he was killed, he \nborrowed a cell phone from another soldier, called his mother, and \nwished her a happy Mother's Day in advance. It was the last time he \nspoke with his family--news of Isaac's death reached his family before \nMother's Day arrived.\n  The sense of duty and purpose that inspired Sergeant Palomarez's \nservice is fundamental to our Nation's liberty and our democracy. The \nstrength of our union stems from the willingness of American citizens \nto work and fight for the rights and freedoms of others, no matter the \ndanger or the cost.\n  This was the message that William Allen White, the famous newspaper \neditor, delivered to Northwestern University graduates in 1936 as the \nspecter of fascism loomed over Europe and Asia. ``Liberty, if it shall \ncement man into political unity,'' said White, ``must be something more \nthan a man's conception of his rights, much more than his desire to \nfight for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively sense \nof the rights of others and a fighting conviction that the rights of \nothers must be maintained. Only when a people have this love of \nliberty, this militant belief in the sacredness of another man's self-\nrespect, do races and nations possess the catalyzer in their political \nand social organism which produces the chemical miracle of crystallized \nnational unity and strength. We Americans have had it for three hundred \nyears on this continent. It was in the blood of our fathers. It was the \nbasis of our faith in humanity when we wrote our constitution.''\n  In Isaac Palomarez's honorable service we find the same love of \nliberty that has bound our union, generation after generation. In his \ncourage and commitment to helping others, we are inspired to a greater \nfaith in humanity. And in his sacrifice, we are humbled and indebted.\n  To Sergeant Palomarez's parents, Elma and Candido, to his three older \nbrothers, and to all his friends and family, I know no words that can \nassuage the pain you feel. I hope that in time your grief will give way \nto the pride you must feel for your son, to the joy that he stirred \namong those who knew him, and to the knowledge that his country will \nalways honor his legacy. He will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4373-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING CHARLES RUCH\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I wish to recognize the \ncontributions of Dr. Charles Ruch to my home State of South Dakota.\n  I have known Dr. Ruch since he became president of the South Dakota \nSchool of Mines and Technology in 2003. During his tenure, technology, \ninnovation, and collaboration were continually the focus, and the \nSchool of Mines and the students there are the beneficiaries of Dr. \nRuch's commitment to this vision. Dr. Ruch was instrumental in bringing \nthe School of Mines and the community together to increase \nopportunities for research, scholarship, and economic development in \nRapid City and across the State of South Dakota.\n  Dr. Ruch's emphasis on collaboration led to the Black Hills \nDevelopment Center being located on the campus and the campus coming \ntogether to achieve the goals that were established in the Strategic \nAgenda of the School of Mines. I was consistently impressed by his love \nof the school, as well as his desire to improve programs and research \nopportunities for students and professors. Dr. Ruch is leaving the \nSchool of Mines just as funding commitments have been made to support \nthe new Chemical and Biological Engineering building. The new building \nwas one of the School of Mines' goals when Dr. Ruch arrived in 2003, \nand it is only fitting that the project is being realized as Dr. Ruch \nretires. As South Dakota established the Sanford Laboratory and we work \nwith the National Science Foundation to establish a Deep Underground \nScience Laboratory, Dr. Ruch leaves the South Dakota School of Mines \nwell-equipped to partner in these research projects.\n  Dr. Ruch has been an exceptional partner in improving collegiate \nopportunities in my home State and constantly sought new innovative \nprograms, research grants, and post-graduate opportunities for students \nat the School of Mines. I would like to thank Dr. Ruch for his \nexcellent service to students, the school, and the State of South \nDakota. We all congratulate him on a very successful 5 years. His \nvision and enthusiasm for the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4373-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4373-S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KENNETH L.

Ken is a \ntrue leader, and his commitment to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is \nmore than worthy of recognition.\n  Ken began his career at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in March \n1965 as a medical technologist in the laboratory. He worked his way up \nthe ranks and in 1990 was promoted to his current position, senior vice \npresident of operations. Under his direction, Newark Beth Israel \nMedical Center has enjoyed a consistently prestigious record of \ncontributions to the medical field. It is one of the largest hospitals \nin New Jersey and provides unique and highly specialized services \nincluding heart transplants, kidney transplants, lung transplants, \nneonatal and pediatric critical care. For over 43 years, Ken has \nenjoyed a distinguished reputation among his peers within the New \nJersey hospital industry, the Saint Barnabas Health Care System and the \nNewark Beth Israel Medical Center family.\n  Ken Tyson is a 1965 graduate of Rutgers, the State University of New \nJersey, with a bachelor of science in medical technology. He then \nearned a master's degree in business administration from the Rutgers \nGraduate School of Business in 1977. Ken also served his alma mater as \nan adjunct instructor in the medical technology program for 9 years and \nlater taught clinical laboratory sciences at the University of Medicine \nand Dentistry of New Jersey for over 19 years. He is currently \naffiliated with the American College of Health Care Executives and the \nAmerican Society of Clinical Pathology.\n  Ken has dedicated his long and illustrious career to improving health \ncare services for the residents of New Jersey and beyond.

Madam President, last week was National Tourism \nWeek, established by Congress in 1983 and celebrated annually since May \n1984. To mark this 25th celebration, I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments of the Blackstone Valley, which recently won \ninternational recognition for its sustainable tourism program.\n  Last month, the World Travel and Tourism Council recognized only one \ndestination in America, the Blackstone Valley of Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts, with the Destination Award for 2008. This honor was \nbestowed upon the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council to recognize the \norganization's trailblazing destination stewardship approach to tourism \ndevelopment, including its work to preserve the area's natural, \ncultural, and historical heritage.\n  At the heart of the valley is the Blackstone River, which runs from \nWorcester, MA, to Providence, RI. The river's waters once powered the \nSlater Mill in Pawtucket, which was America's first successful textile \nmill and the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in this country. \nWhile this transition from farm to factory brought many years of \nprosperity, by the 1970s, the valley's economy had declined as industry \nmoved on from the area, leaving behind a tarnished facade and \nenvironmental damage.\n  Today, thanks to the coordinated efforts of the Blackstone Corridor \nCommission, the National Park Service, the Blackstone Valley Tourism \nCouncil, businesses, environmental organizations, 24 municipalities, \nand the States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the valley has made a \nremarkable resurgence as a living landscape of natural and historic \ntreasures.\n  The Blackstone Valley Tourism Council has shown that eco-friendly \ntourism can revitalize a weakened economy, restore natural \nsurroundings, and revive residents' pride in their communities. Through \ninnovative programs like the Sustainable Tourism Development and \nPlanning Laboratory, the tourism council has created a model for \ndestinations around the country to follow. It is a notable achievement \nfor any river to be at the center of a revolution; but it is a rare \nfeat for the Blackstone River to have spawned two.\n  I congratulate the people of the Blackstone Valley and the Tourism \nCouncil for spearheading an economic redevelopment strategy that has \nmade great strides in improving the quality of life in the \narea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/19/senate-section/article/S4374-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \n RESPECT TO BURMA, AS RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MAY \n                            16, 2008--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 3033. A bill to protect investors by fostering transparency and \naccountability of attorneys in private securities litigation; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nSecurities Litigation Attorney Accountability and Transparency Act. The \nBill promotes transparency and court oversight in the selection and \ncompensation of class counsel in securities class action litigation. As \na result, this legislation helps to ensure that the lawyer for \nshareholder plaintiffs in securities class action lawsuits truly and \nfaithfully represents the interests of the entire class, and not just \ntheir own interests and those of the large investors who are the lead \nplaintiffs. It has been said that the lead attorney in a class action \nsuit serves a quasi-governmental role in that he seeks to enforce the \nlaw on behalf of a broad group of ordinary citizens and the investor \ncommunity at large. Bringing transparency and accountability to \nsecurities class action litigation is important to protect the rights \nand interests of every American who owns stock.\n  When a class action lawsuit is brought against a company for \ndefrauding shareholders, one of the first steps is the selection of the \nlead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff is the shareholder who will actually \nsit in the courtroom and represent the interests of all of the \nshareholders in the litigation. The lead plaintiff selects the lawyer \nwho will represent the class in the lawsuit, subject only to approval \nby the court.\n  Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the lead \nplaintiff is supposed to be the shareholder ``that the court determines \nto be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class \nmembers.'' 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). The PSLRA creates a presumption \nthat, in general, the lead plaintiff should be the plaintiff with the \n``largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class.'' 15 \nU.S.C. 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(bb). The theory behind this rule is that the \nparty with the most at stake will most vigorously defend the interests \nof the entire class. In general, this theory has proven true, and the \nPSLRA is a substantial improvement over the law before the PSLRA, in \nwhich the lead plaintiff was generally whoever first filed the lawsuit.\n  However, as recent events have shown, the PSLRA has itself proven \nsubject to abuse. The Bill that I introduce today has been made \nnecessary by recent scandals in which lawyers entered secret \narrangements with lead plaintiffs to keep an unfair amount of\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\nthe lawsuit's proceeds between them, while shutting out ordinary \ninvestors. Essentially, the lead plaintiff agreed to an unreasonably \nhigh attorneys' fee, with the understanding that the law firm would \nfunnel a portion of that fee back to the lead plaintiff. Thus, the \nlawyers were overcompensated and the lead plaintiffs received a \ndisproportionate share of the proceeds of the lawsuit. Ordinary \ninvestors, who the class action system is designed to protect, bore the \ncosts of these illegal arrangements.\n  Today, William Lerach, once a name partner at the law firm of \nMilberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach LLP, reports to the United \nStates Penitentiary in Lompoc, California, after pleading guilty to \nentering into this type of illegal kickback arrangement with lead \nplaintiffs. Next month, his former law partner Melvyn Weiss will be \nsentenced for the same crime. But there is reason to believe that this \ncriminal activity is not limited to a few bad actors. Indeed, Mr. \nLerach, unrepentant about having defrauded thousands of investors out \nof millions of dollars, has tried to defend himself on the basis that \n``everybody does it.'' ``Believe me,'' Mr. Lerach told the Wall Street \nJournal, ``it was industry practice.''\n\n  There have been many calls for reform to address this potentially \nwidespread criminal practice. Last month, The Washington Post \neditorialized in response to the Milberg Weiss scandal that ``What is \nneeded now is a sober discussion about how best to achieve a fairer, \nmore balanced legal system through comprehensive tort reform.... Smart \nand ethical businesspeople and lawyers--and, yes, there are many who \nfit the bill--would be wise to start working together to craft such a \nfix.'' This bill opens that discussion.\n  The bill that I introduce today seeks to prevent securities \nlitigation abuse by making two major reforms that directly address the \ntwo core problems that have led to this scandal--the potential for \nbackdoor arrangements between lead plaintiffs and class counsel, and \nthe resulting risk that lead plaintiffs will enter fee agreements that \npay the lawyers more than the market rate.\n  The bill would require sworn certifications from lead plaintiffs and \ntheir attorneys disclosing: (a) any payments or promises of payment \nmade by the attorney to the plaintiff in connection with the action; \n(b) any other legal representations of the plaintiff by the attorney; \n(c) any campaign contributions the attorney has made to any elected \nofficial with authority to retain counsel for the plaintiff; and (d) \nany other conflicts of interest. This disclosure would put an end to \nsecret agreements where plaintiffs' lawyers pay kickbacks to the lead \nplaintiffs who retain them. These secret arrangements divorced the \ninterests of both the lawyers and the lead plaintiffs from the \ninterests of the class as a whole. Full disclosure will prevent this \nsituation from recurring.\n  The bill would also require courts to employ a competitive bidding \nprocess as one of the criteria in the approval of the lead class \ncounsel. In current practice, courts usually defer to the lead \nplaintiff's choice of class counsel after reviewing the prospective \nlead counsel's prior work on the case, experience, knowledge, and \nresources. The bill would require that courts also consider the \nprospective lead counsel's fees, and have courts solicit competitive \nbids so that those fees are based on market rates. The class members \ndeserve to be represented at a reasonable market rate. Money that goes \nto the lawyers is money that never makes it to the ordinary \nshareholders who are the victims of securities fraud. Currently, courts \nreview attorneys' fees for reasonableness before the fees are paid at \nthe conclusion of the case. This provision would allow courts to \nnegotiate a reasonable fee at the threshold of the litigation.\n  Finally, the bill would commission a study of the last 5 years of fee \nawards in securities class actions to determine the average hourly rate \nfor lead counsel. Courts may be able to use this information to better \nrein-in excessive attorneys' fees.\n  It is important that corporations be held accountable through \nsecurities fraud litigation when they cheat ordinary shareholders out \nof their hard-earned money. But it is equally important that attorneys \nbe held accountable when they do the same thing. The recent securities \nlitigation kickback scandals ought to spur Congress to action, \nespecially because, at least according to Mr. Lerach, defrauding \nshareholders has become ``industry practice'' for securities \nplaintiffs' lawyers. Fortunately, Mr. Lerach and Mr. Weiss have been \nbrought to justice, but their shareholder victims will never see all of \nthe money out of which they were cheated by these attorneys' crimes. \nThe Securities Litigation Attorney Accountability and Transparency Act \nwill help prevent these crimes against ordinary Americans from being \nrepeated in the future.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United \n     States, and the brave members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States were called to the defense of the Nation.\n       (2) Service on active duty in the Armed Forces has been \n     especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The United States has a proud history of offering \n     educational assistance to millions of veterans, as \n     demonstrated by the many ``G.I. Bills'' enacted since World \n     War II. Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n     supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n       (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n     grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n     Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n     shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n     percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n     shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n       (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n     workers should have access to education and support from \n     their employers to participate in educational and training \n     opportunities.\n       (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n     healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n     sources which can meet these needs and address the\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n     nursing shortage and provide quality care as the American \n     population ages.\n       (b) Purposes of Grant Program.--It is the purpose of this \n     section to authorize grants to--\n       (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n     comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n     (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n     Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) \n     for incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n       (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n     increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n     through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n     organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools \n     of nursing; and\n       (3) provide training programs through education and \n     training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n     providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n     organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n     healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n     schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n       (c) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     partnership grant program to award grants to eligible \n     entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide \n     education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \n     incumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance \n     their careers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (d) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section an entity shall--\n       (1) be--\n       (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly administered by a \n     healthcare employer and a labor union representing the \n     healthcare employees of the employer and that carries out \n     activities using labor management training funds as provided \n     for under section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (18 U.S.C. 186(c)(6));\n       (B) an entity that operates a training program that is \n     jointly administered by--\n       (i) one or more healthcare providers or facilities, or a \n     trade association of healthcare providers;

or\n       (C) a State training partnership program that consists of \n     non-profit organizations that include equal participation \n     from industry, including public or private employers, and \n     labor organizations including joint labor-management training \n     programs, and which may include representatives from local \n     governments, worker investment agency one-stop career \n     centers, community based organizations, community colleges, \n     and accredited schools of nursing;
