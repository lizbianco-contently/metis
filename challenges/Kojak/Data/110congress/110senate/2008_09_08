Mr. President, I had the good fortune last month to go to \nAfghanistan. It was, of course, tremendously educational. We had the \nopportunity--a number of five Senators, Democrats and Republicans--to \nvisit with our allies in Kurdistan and Kazakhstan. It was a good trip. \nThen, of course, we completed our trip by going to look--which I had \nnot done--at medical facilities in Germany. All of the troops who are \ninjured or hurt in any way in Iraq or Afghanistan go through that \nfacility. So it was a good trip.\n  It made it very apparent to me that we should do everything within \nour power to pass the Defense authorization bill because 7 years after \n9/11, we all recognize that our No. 1 enemy, Osama bin Laden, is still \nfree, and al-Qaida has rebuilt its safe haven, it appears, in Pakistan. \nThe central front of the war on terror, we have learned, cannot be won \nin Iraq. Yet that is where our troops are located. Our treasure and our \nstrategic focus remains in Iraq, but it should be other places. That is \nwhy it is so critical to pass a Defense authorization bill that not \nonly supports our troops and our families but also takes a step toward \na smarter war on terror.\n  The Defense authorization bill gives the troops a much needed pay \nraise of almost 4 percent. It also renews a number of special pay \nincreases provided to troops who fill high-skilled areas that were so \nundermanned. We all know because of what has happened with the Bush and \nnow McCain efforts, troops are in Iraq and our resources are in Iraq. \nAfghanistan has seen a surge in violence and suicide attacks are up. We \nhave more coalition forces being killed in Afghanistan than in Iraq, \nroadside bombings have increased, and opium production is up with \nAfghanistan producing 93 percent of the world's opium. So we have to \nrefocus on Afghanistan.\n  Our troops have done a tremendous job in Iraq and, of course, in \nAfghanistan. It does your heart a lot to be able to visit with those \ntroops in the battlefield as we did. So it is time we get this Defense \nauthorization bill passed. We have to do that. We need the funds for \nthe programs in Afghanistan that are critical to winning the peace that \nhave been ignored for far too long.\n  This legislation increases the size of the Army to 532,000; the \nMarine Corps, 194,000; along with other steps to improve readiness and \nreduce the strain and improve the capabilities of our Armed Forces. We \nhave had other occasions with our Republican allies to pass a Defense \nauthorization bill in the Senate, but we haven't been successful in \ndoing that. So I hope we are allowed to go to the bill.\n  I have had a number of conversations with Senator Levin, the chairman \nof the committee. Each conversation I have with him, he tells me he is \ngoing to confer with Senator Warner, the former chairman and now \nranking member of that most important committee. We want to get on the \nbill. We want to get the bill passed. This bill is not an opportunity \nfor people to vent their frustration on all of the issues that are \nfloating around this country. This is a bill that deals with the safety \nand security of our Nation and the well-being of our troops. So when we \nget on the bill, I hope we can move forward and complete legislation on \nthis\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nmost important part of what we are trying to do.\n  This is the first issue we are going to take up when we get here. So \nmy goal is to do what we have to do to work on the Defense bill this \nweek.\n  We have an energy summit this Friday. It has been requested by a \nsignificant number of Senators, including the gang of 10, which I am \ntold is now up to a gang of 22--or if it is not 22, last week it was \n16. It is a lot of Senators. So we are going to have the energy summit \nthis Friday. It doesn't mean we will not have votes this Friday, but at \nleast starting at 9:30 on Friday morning we are going to have an energy \nsummit. My desire is to spend next week dealing with energy.\n  We have a piece of legislation we have had the opportunity to move \nto. It was a bill on speculation which was very important. I would \nthink it could be a vehicle to work with. If our Republican colleagues \nwish to get rid of the speculation part of it, in an effort to be \ncooperative and show some degree of conciliation on our side, what we \nwould be willing to do is have that as a vehicle.\n  The first amendment to be offered on that piece of legislation would \nbe the Bingaman-Baucus legislation, which is a Democratic proposal that \nhas been on the calendar, the only difference being there is a drilling \nprovision in it. The second amendment would be the gang of whatever it \nis--now we are up to 22--and then I would hope we could have some kind \nof an agreement if the Republicans are not satisfied with the Bingaman-\nBaucus amendment or the gang of 22 amendment; if they want to come up \nwith an amendment dealing with legislation, fine. That would be the \nnext amendment in order. I hope we can agree on a limited number of \namendments dealing with energy on this Energy bill. It is my \nunderstanding--and I understand this fairly well--that both the \nBingaman amendment and the gang of 22 amendment have drilling \nprovisions. So I hope we can move forward. We have attempted in the \npast, as everyone knows, to do energy legislation, including that with \ndrilling. But, so there is no confusion or consternation on anyone's \nbehalf, next week we should be able to do the drilling votes and other \nvotes as they relate to energy.\n  The state of the economy is very desperate, for lack of a better \ndescription. Oil and gas are just part of our economic crisis. Since we \nleft for our recess and the conventions are over, we have only more bad \nnews, which means we should look forward also during this work period \nto see if we can do an economic stimulus bill. Why is one necessary?\n  Well, the Bush economy has lost jobs every month this year. Just last \nmonth alone 84,000 jobs were lost. A total of more than 600,000 jobs \nhave been lost this year alone. The total number of jobless Americans \nis now about 10 million. A number of people are out of work also, but \nthey stopped keeping track of the unemployment after they had been on \nthe rolls for a certain period of time. Housing values have decreased \nby almost 20 percent. The unemployment rate has soared now to over 6 \npercent.\n  American workers are holding up their end of the deal because one of \nthe interesting things through all of this is that productivity by our \nwork force is up by 20 percent since 2000, but wages have not kept pace \nwith productivity.\n  Then, finally, the news of Freddie and Fannie--these two huge \nfinancial operations that have been so important since the 1930s in our \ncountry--are now in trouble, and the Federal Government is taking them \nover, which is certainly another strong piece of evidence about the \ndisastrous shape of our economy. I hope we can move on and do something \nwith an economic stimulus package. To this point, Senator McCain has \nbeen unwilling to do that. Let's hope this string of bad news items \nwill bring him back to saying we need to do something with the \nstimulus.\n  We have--I am sure Senator McConnell has, and I know my colleagues, \nthe counterparts on the Democratic side of the Congress--received calls \nfrom Secretary Peters. We have tried in the past on a number of the \nbills we have put forth to put money in the highway trust fund to \nreplenish it. We were thwarted from doing that. We have to do \nsomething. Secretary Peters said now States are only getting part of \ntheir money. Eighty percent of them have dropped; 50 percent have \nbasically dropped to nothing. We can pass the highway trust fund \nreplenishment bill immediately. We have a bill from the House that \nstarts doing that on October 1. We would have to move the date forward. \nWe are willing to pass it today. Democrats are willing to pass this \ntoday. I say to the Bush administration, to Secretary Peters, we are \nwilling to do this today. She said it needed to be done immediately. I \ntalked to her over the weekend. I acknowledge that is the case.\n  For this $8 billion, we will create eight times 47,500 high-paying \njobs for people. So we should do that. I would hope we can get my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to move forward by unanimous \nconsent today to pass that. What we would like to do, as I have \nindicated, is move the time forward from October 1. Secretary Peters \nsaid we need to do that. It passed the House by a 387-to-37 vote. I \nhope we can do that. In effect, what we could do is transfer $8 billion \nfrom the general fund to the highway trust fund.\n  There is a funding shortage looming, and we hear strong support from \nboth Democrats and Republicans, with now Secretary Peters. I am \nconfident she speaks for the administration. So we could pass this \nlegislation immediately.\n  There are other priorities we need to work on this work period. If we \nhave time to do that, we certainly will do that. We have the tax \nextenders. Without going through the list, I look forward to working \nwith my friend, Senator McConnell, to see what we can do to move \nforward on these things.\n  Finally, before we leave here, we must find some way to fund the \nGovernment. If the Republicans want to do it on a week-by-week basis, \nthat is fine. If they want to wait to do it until after the election so \nwe have to come back for a lameduck, we are willing to do that. If they \nwant to do it sometime in February, we are willing to do that. We are \nnot interested in games being played on the CR. We simply want to make \nsure Government is allowed to function. There have been Republicans on \nthe other side of the Capitol--in the House--saying they want to close \ndown the Government. I hope some of those people have read recent \nhistory where Gingrich tried to do that and it didn't work out well for \nthe Republicans and certainly not for this country.\n  I look forward to this short work period we have left to show the \nAmerican people we can get some things done. I hope that is, in fact, \nthe case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8102-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 3430\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I welcome my good friend the majority \nleader back to Washington. I hope he is renewed after the August break.\n  These past several weeks have been extremely instructive for me, as I \nam sure they were for a lot of the rest of our colleagues. I talked to \na lot of Kentuckians, and not a single one suggested that I come back \nto Washington and do nothing until the November election.\n  America faces a number of daunting challenges. Very few of them were \nunknown to us when we all showed up here in January of 2007. Very few \nof them have been addressed, but there is still time to do significant \nwork in the next weeks. I am still hopeful that we will.\n  We can protect millions of Americans from the alternative minimum tax \nand extend a host of expired and expiring tax incentives, including the \nrenewable energy tax credits that drive much needed investment in \nalternative energy sources such as solar and wind. We should come \ntogether and agree to a long-term extension of these important tax \nincentives before the end of this year.\n  So far, Congress has been unable to come together on a comprehensive \nsolution to our Nation's energy crisis. But the book hasn't closed yet \non the 110th Congress. There is still time to act on this issue. And we \nshould. We must work to provide much needed relief for Americans across \nthe country who are struggling with the high price of gas at the pump. \nCongress can still show that we are responsive to the needs of the \nAmerican people by doing something about the crisis now.\n  Some might disagree. One Senator on the other side recently said that \nhe thinks frustration over the high price of gas has ``peaked.'' But I \nhave seen no evidence of this whatsoever in my State. In fact, I am \nconfident, after spending the past month away from Washington, that if \nwe did little else these next few weeks but pass a serious response to \nhigh gas prices, fund the Government, and protect taxpayers, the \nAmerican people would view these next few weeks as extremely \nproductive.\n  Americans want us to act to increase offshore exploration. There is \nnothing to fear in this. We can and should increase domestic energy \nexploration, even as we encourage the use of alternative energy sources \nand new conservation measures. There is no good reason we cannot all \nget behind a balanced approach that would allow us to find more and use \nless at the same time.\n  We also need to do our basic duty of funding the Government by \npassing appropriations bills. Over the last 25 years, no other Congress \nhas failed to pass a single appropriations bill this late in the year. \nEven the infamous do-nothing Congress of 1948 had passed more than a \ndozen appropriations bills at this point on the legislative calendar. \nThis is certainly not a record to be proud of. But it is not a record \nthat has to stand. We still have time to change course. And we should.\n  While at war, we have yet to fund the troops, homeland security, and \ncritical domestic programs. We have yet to fund veterans hospitals, \neducation, transportation, and national parks. These are the basics. We \nshould take them on. The upcoming election is no excuse to put off our \nresponsibilities for another day. Americans have held a regularly \nscheduled election every 2 years for more than two centuries. The work \nof Government must go on regardless of how strong the partisan currents \nflow. It always has, and this year should be no exception.\n  We still have a few more weeks to do right by the American people. \nLet's not just mark time. Let's make a difference and do something \nconstructive to help the American people in a difficult economic time. \nLet's put political games aside for a few weeks and do what is expected \nof us. This is not too much to ask, and I, for one, remain hopeful that \nwe can rise to the occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8103-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8103-S8104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might pose a question to the \nleadership. Senator Levin and I just met in preparation to move \nforward, hopefully, on the annual authorization bill. This would be the \n30th bill Senator Levin and I have worked on together. In the interim \nperiod, over the summer, our staffs have done a lot of very valuable \nwork in terms of trying to sort through reconciliation between the \nHouse and Senate provisions. But it is our recommendation to the \nleadership that we try to obtain a UC to enable the amendments that \nwould be brought forward to be relevant to the work of the committee, \nor the text of the bill.\n  I am just wondering, what do the respective leaders have to guide the \nSenator and myself on this issue?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia that I \nhope we can work out something. We have this week to do it. It will be \nthe last week that we have an opportunity to finish this most important \npiece of legislation. I think we owe it to our troops to work out \nsomething. We can get hung up on germane and relevant. One thing we \ncould do--and I know we have had a problem here with people wanting to \noffer amendments on everything, as they have said, ``like we used to do \nin the Senate.''\n  Mr. President, I have been through a number of Presidential \nelections, and we have one coming up in about 60 days. We have to do \nthings a little differently. I hope we can come up with some way to \nmove forward on that. One of the suggestions made is maybe we could \ncome up with something where the Senator from Virginia and Senator \nLevin can look at the amendments first related to the bill. We need to \nfinish the Defense bill. Next week, we are going to be able to \nlegislate our hearts out on energy. People have been wanting to do that \nfor a long time. Let's get rid of this piece of legislation, which is \nimportant. I hope we can figure out a way to move forward on it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we talked about this a couple of times \nbefore the August break. I know he is concerned because this bill has \nfrequently been targeted for nongermane amendments. I can recall that, \nas recently as last year, a nongermane amendment was offered by a \nmember of the majority and actually adopted and became a complication \nin trying to complete the legislation.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, I don't know what is possible. I \njust got in from the airport. I will meet with the Republican \nleadership later this afternoon to discuss with our colleagues what we \nmight be able to achieve. I am certainly open to trying to move the \nmeasure along. I will consult with everybody on our side to see whether \nthat is possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the leaders. I only say that \nSenator Levin and I are ready, beginning tomorrow morning, if this \nprocedural motion this afternoon at 5:30 is carried, to go to work. \nHopefully, we can waive any 30-hour requirement, or whatever might be \nattached to this, and proceed directly to the bill. We both have \namendments that can be brought up, and we welcome amendments from our \ncolleagues. Again, the issue of relevancy is imperative if we hope to \ncomplete this bill this week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we don't have to use the 30 hours. We \ncan start working on this tomorrow. There are amendments, as the \nSenator has indicated, members of the committee want to offer which \nrelate to the bill. We should do that. Now, I hope we don't have to \nfile cloture on the bill itself if we get on it. I think we should try \nto finish the Defense bill.\n  As I have indicated, I went to Afghanistan. We have learned a lot, \nand we are implementing what we learned in Iraq. There are some things \nin Iraq that didn't do so well. We are trying to do better in \nAfghanistan. But it takes resources, and that is what this bill is \nabout. I hope we don't have to wait 30 hours. We don't have to do that.\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\n  We have a national election coming up. Speaking for the Republican \nleader, we don't want to be here until November 3, which is a Monday. \nWe need to allow people to get back and work--those who want to help \nMcCain and Obama, those who want to work on their own campaigns, and \nthose who want to help others who are campaigning.

At the risk of being redundant, I will consult with \nthe leadership of my conference and other members, and surely we will \nbe able to get on the bill, at the latest, sometime tomorrow and \nproceed with the amendment process.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3001, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3001, a bill to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the motion to \nproceed to the National Defense Authorization Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be given 20 minutes to do so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to set \naside bipartisan differences and vote in favor of the motion to proceed \nto the National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is critically \nimportant to ensuring that our troops have the equipment and support \nthey need in order to fulfill their mission. Voting against the motion \nto proceed would have significant consequences for the men and women \nwho have made so many sacrifices for this Nation, as well as their \nfamilies. It would mean delays in pay increases, delays in benefits, \nand delays in authorities that are necessary to train and equip our \nsoldiers.\n  This bill authorizes the military construction projects that directly \naffect the quality of life of our armed services members by giving them \nnew, safer, more effective facilities in which to work.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Levin, the Armed Services Committee \nhas produced a carefully crafted bill that addresses the many complex \nissues facing today's military. This includes language in direct \nsupport of our armed services members and their families, such as a \n3.9-percent pay raise.\n  Over the last 6 years, continuous combat operations have put a severe \nstrain on our Nation's military capabilities. Consequently, one of the \nprimary goals of this year's bill was to focus on restoring the \nreadiness of our troops.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, I worked very closely \nwith Ranking Member Thune on the readiness acquisition policy and \nmilitary construction portions of this bill that are under the \njurisdiction of my subcommittee. I would like to take this opportunity \nto thank Senator Thune for his hard work and cooperation during the \nmarkup of this bill. It was my privilege to work with him to advance \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  I also thank our personal staff members and the professional staff of \nthe committees for their efforts, in particular Peter Levine, Mike \nMcCord, Bill Sutey, Lucian Niemeyer, Greg Kiley, and Chris Paul.\n  The Readiness Subcommittee has a broad mandate of policy oversight as \nwell as jurisdiction over a substantial part of the DOD budget. In \naddition, it is responsible for the readiness and operation and \nmaintenance provisions that support the essential requirements of the \nmilitary services for the next fiscal year for the cost of normal \noperations. However, our goal remains simple: to maintain and, wherever \npossible, improve the readiness of our military.\n  Altogether, this bill contains $162 billion for the programs within \nthe jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee, which represents over \n30 percent of the DOD budget. That amount is within one-quarter of 1 \npercent of the amount requested.\n  I believe all of us are concerned that our military forces have what \nthey need to be trained and ready, but we are particularly concerned \nabout the readiness of our ground forces. This bill fully funds the \nArmy and Marine Corps readiness accounts, including the training and \nequipment maintenance request.\n  With respect to revitalizing our defense facilities, this bill \ninvests an additional $413 million above the budget request in our \ninfrastructure to repair or replace our aging defense facilities and \nimprove the quality of life and the productivity of our military.\n  These military construction projects require both an authorization \nand an appropriation. I urge the Senate to pass both these important \npieces of legislation--this authorization bill and the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill--as soon as \npossible.\n  This year's Defense authorization bill also addresses the need for \nincreased oversight of the acquisition programs and activities of the \nDepartment of Defense to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are well spent \nand not wasted. For example, this bill requires DOD to establish ethics \nstandards to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor \nemployees who perform acquisition functions on behalf of DOD.\n  This bill ensures that private security contractors do not perform \ninherently governmental functions in an area of combat operations. It \ncodifies existing DOD standards under which security operations are \ninherently governmental if they will be performed in highly hazardous \npublic areas where the risks are uncertain.\n  This bill prohibits contractor employees from conducting \ninterrogations of detainees during or in the aftermath of hostilities. \nThe provision has an effective date 1 year after the date of enactment \nto give DOD time to comply.\n  This bill requires the military departments to ensure that urgent \nrequirements documents developed by operational field commanders are \npresented to senior officials for review within 60 days of the time \nthey are submitted. This is a response to reports that Marine Corps \nleadership failed to respond to requests for Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected vehicles, known as MRAPs, and other critical requirements for \nseveral years.\n  This bill codifies the requirement for boards to review and approve--\nor disapprove--any new requirements that could add to the costs of a \nmajor weapon system.\n  This bill requires DOD to ensure that a contractor does not receive a \ncompetitive advantage by using foreign subsidiaries to avoid the \npayment of U.S. payroll taxes for its workers.\n  This bill requires DOD to establish a database of information \nregarding the integrity and contract performance of contractors, to \nensure that this information is available to acquisition officials \nmaking key contracting decisions.\n  This bill requires DOD to take steps to ensure that contractor \nemployees who are the victims of sexual assault and other crimes in \nIraq and Afghanistan receive the help they need and the investigative \nassistance they deserve.\n  This bill requires the military departments to establish business \ntransformation offices to serve as a central focus for the reform of \ntheir business and financial systems and processes.\n  This bill ensures that the chief lawyer for the DOD inspector \ngeneral, or IG, serves at the discretion of the IG and reports only to \nthe IG.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will strongly support these provisions.\n  In addition to working to improve the readiness of our troops as \nchairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I was pleased in my role as \nchairman of the\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\nVeterans' Affairs Committee to work to include language in this bill \nthat will improve care for this Nation's wounded warriors. One such \nprovision responds to the need for comprehensive care for wounded \nwarriors and their families by requiring the Secretary of Defense to \nprovide referrals for legal assistance when appropriate in order to \nhelp with legal issues related to long-term care needs.\n  The necessity to encourage and promote the treatment of service-\nrelated injuries was also addressed in this bill through the \nauthorization of a pilot program to assess treatment approaches for all \nforms of traumatic brain injury and the establishment of a center of \nexcellence for the treatment and rehabilitation of traumatic extremity \ninjuries and amputations.\n  In order to ensure that the Department of Defense and Department of \nVeterans Affairs continue to carefully coordinate these efforts to \nimprove the process for the care, management, and transition of wounded \nand ill servicemembers, this year's bill also provides for a 3-year \nextension of the Senior Oversight Committee.\n  Let me end by restating how vitally important it is for us to move \nforward with the debate of this bill. A little over 3 weeks ago, I \nattended the deployment ceremony for the members of the Hawaii Army \nNational Guard's 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team who are headed to \nKuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for their second \ndeployment. It was my great honor and privilege to say goodbye to these \nsoldiers who are leaving their homes, their jobs, and their families in \norder to fulfill a commitment to defend and protect our Nation. I \nremind my friends and colleagues that we have also made a commitment to \nwork together to pass a bill that provides our troops with everything \nthey need to come home safely. The first step in this process is to \nadopt this motion to proceed so that we can begin debate on this very \nimportant bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided between the two parties.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, last week we heard chants, \nslogans--as if those slogans were going to solve the energy crisis--of \ndrill, baby, drill. I think it is more appropriate to use the words of \nTom Friedman: Innovate, baby, innovate. If we are going to solve this \nenergy crisis, we have to have a comprehensive solution, and we need to \nunleash what America can do best, which is our intellectual capacity, \nour creativeness, our ingenuity. We need to unleash that capacity of \nAmerica to get out and whip the energy crisis where we are addicted to \noil. In fact, in this Senator's judgment, the single greatest threat to \nour security may well be our dependence on oil, not foreign oil but \noil.\n  We all have been hearing from our constituents about what is the \npossible path for us to break this addiction, and we need to break the \naddiction and become energy independent in 10 years.\n  I caution against misguided rhetoric and hollow chants, as we have \nheard--of drill, baby, drill--as a seemingly swift and simple solution \nto high gas prices. It doesn't have any basis in reality. Remember the \nwords of President Kennedy:\n\n       Real solutions are not easily or cheaply obtained, nor are \n     they quickly and simply explained.\n\n  So as we approach it in a comprehensive way, it is not easily and \nsimply explained. Common sense ought to tell us, since the United \nStates has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, and yet uses 25 \npercent of the world's oil production, we can't drill our way out of \nthe problem. Indeed, there are 65 million acres leased by the oil \ncompanies from the Federal Government, not one of which has been \ndrilled. In the Gulf of Mexico itself--where the so-called gang of 10 \nthat is now called the gang of 16 seems to want to pick on my State of \nFlorida and wants to drill all the way up to within 50 miles of the \ncoast--there are 32 million acres under lease by the oil companies, and \nnot one of those acres has been drilled. Yet they are leased from the \nFederal Government. As a matter of fact, that includes 8.3 million \nacres on which this Senator worked a compromise to try to solve this \nproblem and got it into law 2 years ago, 8.3 million new acres kept \naway from the military mission line where we do our testing and \ntraining off of Florida, kept away from the shores of Florida. Not 1 \nacre of that 8.3 million has been drilled since it was offered for \nlease.\n  More leasing would not stabilize Iraq or guarantee Saudi Arabia's \nlong-term friendship, nor would it end the unregulated speculation that \ndrove oil prices to over $147 a barrel and pushed pump prices to more \nthan $4 a gallon. More leasing of Federal lands will only delay \nAmerica's freedom from oil. If we do drill, baby, drill, we will dirty \nand destroy Florida's economy. Even worse, if this so-called gang of 16 \nputs it all the way up to 50 miles off of Florida, it will cut the \nheart and lungs out of the last area of unfettered military training \nfor the U.S. military, the largest testing and training for the U.S. \nmilitary in the world, which is the range in the Gulf of Mexico, all \noff of the coast of Florida.\n  No matter what anybody says, when the United States only has 3 \npercent of the world's oil reserves but uses one-fourth of the world's \noil supply, drill, baby, drill is not going to work.\n  Now, that is what this Senator has been saying for years. By the way, \nnow even a Texas oilman is saying the same thing. T. Boone Pickens has \nall of these commercial ads on TV, and he says we cannot drill our way \nout of this problem.\n  As a matter of fact, the White House report from 5 months ago that I \nhave shared with the Senate several times says the same thing: That \ndrilling in the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States will not \nchange the price of gasoline one whit until the year 2030.\n  So what do we do? Well, for the short term, we need to keep bringing \ngas prices down by not wasting so much oil and by banning the greedy \nspeculation on the part of the oil traders and the profiteers. We have \na Senate investigation that has reported that there is lax Federal \noversight of these traders, and that is as a result of a loophole that \nwas slipped in in the dead of night in December just before Christmas \nin the year 2000 at the behest of the infamous Enron Corporation. BP, \nAmoco, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley also were instrumental in \ngetting this so-called Enron loophole through Congress. Afterward, the \nprice of both oil and natural gas skyrocketed, despite reports that oil \nsupplies were mostly adequate.\n  Links between soaring oil prices and vast sums of money flowing into \nthese unregulated commodities have been uncovered by the Senate \nCommerce Committee and the Homeland Security Committee. As a matter of \nfact, just last week, a report by the Washington Post pointed out, \nunbelievably, that of all the futures contracts for the oil \ncommodities, 81 percent of all that trading was done by people who do \nnot intend to use that oil. If true, done by the speculators: 81 \npercent.\n  We have had testimony in Congress by an ExxonMobil executive. We have \nhad testimony from a Shell Oil Company executive who said that under \nnormal supply and demand oil ought to be at $55 a barrel.\n  But by any measure, this Enron loophole, which exempts the traders of \nenergy contracts from Federal oversight, was an ill-conceived public \npolicy. That is why a number of us have filed legislation to fully \nclose that loophole and to stop the unchecked runups in\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nspeculation of crude oil and gasoline prices.\n  Now, what do I mean by ``unregulated futures commodities markets''? I \nmean that a governmental entity, if it were regulated, would require \nthem to put a substantial downpayment on the contract for future oil--\nto put their money where their mouth is--or a regulated market would be \nthat they would require the bidder for that future oil contract to be \nsomebody who was going to use the oil instead of just speculating on \nthe price and running up the price. So if we do not do something about \nspeculation, they can drive that up again, and we have to fully close \nthat loophole.\n  About 50 percent of the oil we use goes into our cars and trucks. So \nit should not take a rocket scientist to realize this ought to be where \nwe ought to focus. It took us in the Congress more than 30 years to \nraise mileage standards to a paltry 35 miles per gallon, to be phased \nin over the next 15 years--35 miles a gallon. It was 25 miles a gallon \nback in the 1980s. But, oh, by the way, that exempted light trucks and \nSUVs. It is interesting that American car manufacturers sell cars in \nEurope and the cars over there already get 43 miles a gallon. Japan is \napproaching 50 miles per gallon. In other words, we are wasting \nbillions of gallons of oil here at home. To stop it, we must enact \nserious conservation measures, such as 40 miles per gallon for our \nvehicles. We must provide bigger tax incentives for people to buy \nhybrid cars and plug-in hybrids.\n  Now, what I have shared with you are not simple chants, simple \nslogans. They are real solutions for the short term. But for the long \nterm, we need to unleash that American ingenuity and to rapidly build \ncars that run on batteries or hydrogen, not petroleum. We need to \ndevelop alternative fuels such as ethanol from things we do not eat.\n  Our Government, led by the next President, must enact a national \nenergy program to transition us from petroleum to alternative and \nsynthetic fuels. It needs to be leadership by the next President in the \nmemory of President Kennedy, when we had only flown Alan Shepard in \nsuborbit, and President Kennedy had the vision and said: This Nation is \ngoing to go to the Moon and back in 9 years. That is the kind of \nleadership we need, and we now have to act with the same urgency.\n  So we are going to have to pay attention to how we power our homes \nand industry. We are going to need to develop solar, wind, and thermal \nenergy and safer nuclear power. We have a lot of innovative work.\n  I see some colleagues are in the Chamber who wish to speak, and I \nwill conclude.\n  Let me say that I want everybody to know, including the Senator who \nis just walking onto the floor, this Senator is not going to allow \nFlorida to be a sacrificial lamb for whatever is struck as an energy \ncompromise, nor is this Senator, who has been protecting the interests \nof the U.S. Department of Defense for 25 years, ever since I was a \nyoung Congressman representing the east coast of Florida, going to \nallow drilling to cut the heart and the lungs out of the military \nmission area, which is our largest testing and training area, nor to \nthreaten the interests of the State of Florida, by people succumbing to \nthe simple slogan of ``drill, baby, drill'' when it ought to be \n``innovate, baby, innovate.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n      International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to recognize \ntomorrow, Tuesday, September 9, as International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Awareness Day. This is a day to bring a voice to the numerous \nchildren--many children--born with a continuum of serious, lifelong \ndisorders caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol, which includes fetal \nalcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, and \nalcohol-related birth defects. The lifetime health costs for people \nafflicted with fetal alcohol syndrome is at least $2 million, and the \noverall cost of fetal alcohol syndrome in the United States is \nestimated to be at least $6 billion. That was back in 2007. There is a \ngreat need for research, surveillance, prevention, treatment, and \nsupport services for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \nand for their families.\n  It is for these reasons I rise today to dedicate September 9 as \nInternational Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day and \nencourage all my fellow Americans to promote awareness of the effects \nof prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals \naffected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects \nof prenatal exposure to alcohol; and, most importantly, to bring \ngreater awareness to a disease that is absolutely 100 percent \npreventable.\n  Communities around the world will observe a moment of silence at 9 \nminutes after 9 tomorrow, on September 9, to remind women that no \nalcohol during pregnancy is safe. For the past 6 years, the Senate has \npassed a resolution highlighting and bringing awareness to this issue. \nIt is my understanding that all resolutions are currently being \nblocked, so we may not have one this year. But today, on behalf of the \nmillions of individuals suffering from the lasting and detrimental \neffects of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, I encourage all Americans \nto observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of the ninth day of \nthe ninth month to remind them that no amount of alcohol--none at all--\nis safe during the 9 months of pregnancy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share a thought about the vote \nwe will undertake. I know some of us were taking to calling the \nspeculation bill our Democratic leader offered the ``no energy bill'' \nbecause it had nothing in it to produce any more energy for America--\nAmerican energy, which I think is a critical component of any \nsuccessful policy to make us more energy independent, which, indeed, \ncan make us energy independent if we do the right things as far as \nforeign oil and energy.\n  I would say to my colleagues, some of whom are part of the so-called \nGang of 10, who are trying to work out a compromise they think might \nproduce some more energy for America that might change a few policies \nthat would make us more energy independent and help our economy, which \nby any calculation is being pulled down by the increasing price of \nenergy, the Cato Institute says electricity bills have doubled since \n2001. Electricity has already doubled.\n  Before we get into some of the more extreme proposals for the \nregulation of utilities and requirements on utilities, I would say that \ngasoline prices have surged. The world price of oil hit 140-some-odd \ndollars per barrel. It has dropped some, to maybe the $107, $110 range \nper barrel, which is better, but it is still far above the $30 a barrel \nit was just a few years ago.\n  So this is adversely impacting American families. We calculate it \ncosts $57 more a month for a two-car family for gasoline each month \nthan it did this time last year. It is also impacting adversely the \nAmerican economy. I believe it is an absolute fact that this surge in \nenergy prices is causing the economic slowdown we are facing today, and \nwe have to do something about it.\n  There are things we can do. So I want to say to my colleagues who are \ntrying to work on something, I am for you. I want you to go ahead. I \nwant you to push forward. I want to put some things in there that will \nwork. That is my policy. I will support anything--efficiencies, \nconservation, innovation, creativity. It must include more production \nof American energy, of course. Anything else would be mindless. People \ndo not seem to worry that we pay $130 a barrel for imported oil, but \nthey want to constrict our ability to produce oil and gas here at home. \nSo I just want to say that.\n  I urge my colleagues who are discussing this issue to produce some \nthings that will work, and you will have a willing supporter in this \nSenator. I am willing to do some things that may be even dubious if we \ncan get some things that are good. For example, I understand they are \ntalking about more offshore production. I think that is absolutely \nnecessary. We need to have nuclear recycling. I am hopeful that will be \npart of any compromise package.\n  I offered with Senator Domenici earlier this year, just a few months \nago,\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nthe SMART Act, which would favor the nuclear recycling of waste, which \nwould reduce its toxicity dramatically and reduce the amount that would \nbe needed and produce more uranium capable of creating electricity. It \nwould increase, I understand, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's staff \nso we do not have unnecessary delays in approving new powerplants. We \nhave not built one in 30 years, but France is building them. The Brits \njust announced plans to build five more. We need to get in that game. \nWe have not done so in 30 years.\n  I would note, however, there is nothing in this legislation that I \ncan see that I am hearing about that would create energy from shale oil \nin the West. There has been no production from that 2,000 acres in ANWR \nthat is part--that will be producing oil and gas out of an 18-acre \nregion the size of the State of South Carolina. So those are things I \nhope we can have, before I yield the floor, in a compromise package and \nthat would actually produce more energy for us.\n\n  I would note I am honored to serve on the Armed Services Committee \nwith Senator Levin and Senator Warner, our senior member. I see them \nboth here to kick off this debate. It is a very good committee. It is a \ncommittee I have learned a great deal from serving on, and I think it \nis important that we be able to move forward with the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, under the existing unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from Virginia is going to proceed for 15 \nminutes, I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first wish to congratulate my colleague \nof some 30 years that we have worked together on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Under his leadership this year, we passed the 2008 \nbill unanimously by the committee in April. Here we are in September, \nand we are finally getting to the opportunity presented to our \ncolleagues and, hopefully, this week we will act on this bill.\n  Earlier this afternoon, the distinguished majority leader and the \nminority leader addressed the Senate on their express hope that this \nbill will be acted on expeditiously and done so within this week. That \nwill require, however, in my judgment--and I speak only for myself--a \nunanimous consent request relating to the amendment process. We are \nanxious to receive amendments from our colleagues, but unless we \nmaintain some order in terms of relevant amendments, I am fearful we \nwill not be able to expeditiously handle this bill. That is a matter \nthat is now being quite fairly and forthrightly worked upon by the \nrespective majority and minority leaders, and certainly my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Levin, and I have discussed this \ntogether and have a joint recommendation for our leadership.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to our professional staff, \nboth majority and minority, who have worked on this bill throughout the \nsummer. Such that on the assumption that we can pass it and then get to \na conference we will have beforehand reconciled some of the differences \nbetween--that is on an informal basis, but on a formal basis, we will \nbe able to reconcile in a conference this bill and then bring it back \nin the form of a conference report.\n  This will be the forty-third--bill No. 43--consecutive authorization \nbill adopted by the Senate. I am hopeful the unbroken record of 42 \nconsecutive times will now be the 43rd, and that puts the Senate \nclearly on record as supporting the men and women of the Armed Forces \nof the United States who most justly deserve all the support we can \ngive them. I point out that we have a specific constitutional \nresponsibility toward the men and women of the Armed Forces. It is this \nbill, coupled with such appropriations as may be acted upon by other \ncommittees--this is the discharge of our constitutional responsibility.\n  We are at a very dangerous crossroads in the history of the world. \nOur forces today are fighting in two theaters--Iraq and Afghanistan--\nand are standing watch on many other theaters and outposts across the \nworld. They are facing the threats of militant extremists at home, \nworldwide, abroad, in all corners of the globe. We are also astounded \nby the performance of what heretofore we thought was a supporting \npartner in world affairs--Russia--by virtue of their aggressions in \nGeorgia, and the instability in Pakistan, a major non-NATO ally but \nnevertheless a major ally. Hopefully, with the election of a new \nPresident, that country can begin to govern itself strongly because it \nis very important, with our forces on the border of Pakistan and our \noperations against the insurgents and the Taliban in Afghanistan, it is \nessential we have the strongest of working relationships with Pakistan. \nThen we have, unfortunately, the nuclear ambitions and the hostile \nbehavior of Iran. All of those propose a profound and wide-ranging \nchallenge for U.S. interests and our friends and our allies in the \ninternational community as a whole.\n  We are fortunate today that the people in the United States of \nAmerica are so supportive of our Armed Forces. I have had the privilege \nto observe this Nation in previous conflicts beginning in World War II. \nIn World War II 16 million men and women of the Armed Forces were \ngreeted when they returned home from a solid victory against the axis \npowers, as well as those of the Pacific. Then, following the Korean \nconflict, again I had the opportunity to observe firsthand the \ndeterioration of the support in the many respects it was given to the \nArmed Forces who fought so bravely in that conflict. I pause to think \nthat we have celebrated the 55th anniversary of that conflict. Over \n30,000 Americans--Americans in uniform--lost their lives in that \nconflict. Another 90,000 were wounded. Today, currently, 8,000 are \nstill unaccounted for.\n  So we have a different attitude today. In Vietnam, we likewise \nexperienced a lot of antagonism against the men and women of the Armed \nForces. Today, this country is united behind those men and women and \ngiving support to their brave families.\n  We have also had the good fortune for 35 years to have an All-\nVolunteer Force. This bill is constructed to continue that support of \nthe All-Volunteer Force. I can recall, in the Vietnam period, I was \nprivileged to be Secretary of the Navy--Under Secretary for some 5 \nyears--that the constricted force experienced a lot of problems. It was \nduring that period in 1973, I remember vividly that the then-Secretary \nof Defense, Melvin Laird, had the vision to have the All-Volunteer \nForce. It eventually came into law with the support of the Congress. It \nwas a major gamble, I say to my colleagues--a major gamble. It was the \nfirst significant large military power in the world--the United States \nof America--to try and have this national security policy, this \nnational security defended by all volunteers, but it has worked and \nworked well beyond the early concepts we had in mind. It has been a \nsuperb military force that has preserved America's freedom.\n  We also have in this bill a reflection on the future needs of our \nArmed Forces. This bill will provide better compensation and first-rate \nhealth care to improve the quality of life of the men and women on \nActive Duty and in the National Guard and Reserve and their families. I \nwill enumerate a number of provisions in this bill that address those \nissues.\n  We also authorize Active Duty end strengths, increases for the Army \nto go to 532,000-plus and for the Marine Corps, 194,000-plus, \nrespectively. We authorize an increase of 3,371 full-time personnel for \nthe Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. We authorize the costs of \nspecial pay and allowances, death benefits, and permanent change of \nstation moves. It authorizes $26 billion for the Defense Health \nProgram. It requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a \ncomprehensive policy to prevent, regrettably, the increasing rate of \nsuicides.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this bill is absolutely essential--\nabsolutely essential--and it provides the statutory authorities that \nour men and women of the Armed Forces need to succeed in combat and \nstability operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We will authorize those funds necessary to seek to reduce our \nNation's strategic risks by taking action to restore, as soon as \npossible, the readiness\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nof the military services to conduct the full range of their assigned \nmissions. I wish to correct that by saying by taking the action aimed \nat fully restoring, since much of our military is in a state of high \nreadiness today.\n  This bill will improve the efficiency of Defense Department programs \nand activities, promote the transformation of the Armed Forces to deal \nwith the threats of the 21st century, and improve the ability of the \nArmed Forces to counter nontraditional threats, including terrorism and \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2009 includes authorization of $24.8 billion in Division B for military \nconstruction, BRAC, and family housing programs. Because MILCON \nprojects require a line item authorization by law, and considered new-\nstarts, DOD will not be able to carry out any new project in fiscal \nyear 2009 if this bill is not enacted.\n  Of the 24.8 billion, $11.7 billion is for military construction, $3.2 \nbillion for the construction and operation of family housing, and $9.1 \nbillion to implement the results of the 2005 BRAC.\n  Within the BRAC account, 282 projects are at risk across the country, \nincluding critical construction to establish new hospitals at the Naval \nMedical Center, Bethesda, MD; Fort Belvior, VA; and Fort Sam Houston, \nTX, to facilitate the closure of inadequate facilities at the Walter \nReed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC. Other critical BRAC \nconstruction at Fort Bliss, TX, and Fort Benning, GA, is required to \nfacilitate the return of U.S. forces from overseas locations and the \nestablishment of new modular units. Also BRAC construction at Eglin Air \nForce Base, FL, is required to support the joint Air Force and Navy \ntraining.\n  In closing, this is an important bill that takes care of our troops \nand their families. It sustains a national treasure, the All Volunteer \nForce, and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and the \nnational security programs of the Department of Energy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to proceed to the \nDefense authorization bill for the sake of the men and women in uniform \nand in spirit of Article I, section 8 of the Constitution that assigns \nto Congress the powers ``to raise and support Armies'' and ``to provide \nand maintain a Navy.''\n  Mr. President, I defer to our distinguished Chairman. Again, I \ncongratulate the chairman on bringing this bill to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Very briefly, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my good friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner. As he pointed out, he and I have been \ntogether in the Senate now almost 30 years. Hopefully, we could get \nthis bill to the floor the way he and I and other chairmen before us \nhave been able to get a Defense authorization bill to the floor and \npassed for, I believe, close to 50 years; somewhere in the mid 40s now \nwe have had a Defense authorization bill. We have to have it under the \nlaw. There is mandatory spending in here. There are pay increases in \nhere. There are benefit provisions in here. This is a must-do bill.\n  Senator Warner, in his great leadership over the years, has made it \npossible for many of these bills to get to the floor. I look forward to \nall our efforts to get this bill done in the very few weeks we have \nremaining. If we do get it done--and I am optimistic--it will be \nbecause Senator Warner, as always, brings his managerial skills and his \ngood nature and his other skills to the fore. I look forward to trying \nto get this bill done the way we have been able to do it for all these \nyears.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \nkind remarks. I should also wish to join him in thanking the members of \nour committee. We have had an excellent committee, and we have a very \nbipartisan, professional staff. I am sure we can do the job. I will \npoint out one additional feature--military construction. I daresay that \nalmost every Member of this body has a provision somewhere in this bill \nrelating to military construction. Without passage of the bill, that \nsimply will not take place.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. I want to make another point. In the \nweeks we have remaining, we not only have to get this bill passed, but \nwe have to get it to conference and back in probably a record period of \ntime. It is going to take all of the cooperation of the Members of the \nSenate. We are going to succeed. There are 100 reasons to do it, and \nall of them boil down to the men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies and the security of this country. The incentive should be \nthere for us to do it. Because of the long delay, we have to do it in \nrecord time. We have had wonderful cooperation from members of the \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis. We have tremendous staff members who \nhave worked over the recess to get the work done so we can get this \nbill passed in a very short period of time and so that we would have a \nreasonable chance of getting this bill done in the number of weeks we \nhave left.\n  The committee approved this bill unanimously. More than 4 months ago \nnow, on April 30, we tried to bring the bill to the Senate floor. At \nthe end of July, we were unable to do so because we could not obtain \ncloture on the motion to proceed. There are many important nondefense \nlegislative proposals that Members would like to bring before the \nSenate to get adopted. I am one of those Members. There are a number of \nthings I would love to bring before the Senate and get adopted. But we \ncannot take out our frustration on our troops. I am prepared to give up \na whole bunch of nondefense amendments that I hoped to be able to bring \nto the Senate's attention. I am willing to give them up. I hope other \nMembers who feel the same way will ensure that we have a Defense bill \nthis year.\n  This bill is simply too important and the time available to us is too \nlimited to be sidetracked by unrelated amendments, as important as they \nmay be. As my dear friend from Virginia said, we have enacted a defense \nauthorization act every year now for 4\\1/2\\ decades. During that time, \nthere have been years when we had to invoke cloture to get final \npassage, years when we have had to enter unanimous consent agreements \nto expedite consideration of the bill, years in which the bill was \nvetoed and we had to start over again. There have been years in which \nwe have spent weeks debating the bill on the Senate floor and months in \nconference with the House. We have had to address serious disagreements \nover issues such as base closures and missile defense. But we have \nalways had a bill because Members have always understood that we have \nto do what it takes to do the right thing for our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and their families.\n  These authorization bills, which come annually, contain provisions \nthat improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and \ngive them the tools they need to defend our Nation and provide critical \nreforms to improve the operations of the Pentagon. That is the case \nwith this bill. The bill reported by the Armed Services Committee 3 \nmonths ago obtains many provisions of critical importance to our \ntroops.\n  First and foremost, the bill would increase military pay by 3.9 \npercent, a half percent more than the President requested. It provides \ncontinued authority for the payment of enlistment and reenlistment \nbonuses, ascension and retention bonuses for servicemembers with \ncritical skills who are assigned to high-priority units, and bonuses \nand incentives to reward our troops to make sure we can retain our \npeople. It provides new incentives to military psychologists and the \nnursing students to address the ongoing shortages we have in these \ncritical specialty areas.\n  At a time when thousands of our troops are deployed around the world \nand our voluntary military is strained to meet the requirements of \nongoing conflicts, while remaining prepared for other contingencies \nthese are steps that we simply must take.\n  When our men and women in uniform are in harm's way, there is nothing\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nmore important for us to do. The bill would increase the end strength \nof the Army, Marine Corps, Air National Guard, and Army Reserve to \nreduce the incredible stress on our troops. It would establish and \nextend critical authorities needed by the DOD for current operations. \nFor instance, it would provide the Department of Defense the \nauthorization to use funds for quick turnaround construction projects \nneeded to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will extend \nthe DOD's authority to provide training and funds and stabilization in \nsecurity assistance, which are so essential to the well-being of our \ntroops.\n  The bill includes numerous other measures to improve the quality of \nlife for our service men and women, retirees, and their families. For \ninstance, the bill ensures that wounded and injured servicemembers will \nnot be charged for meals received at military treatment facilities. It \nis so unbelievable that some of those facilities make these current \ncharges, so I should repeat it. This bill will ensure that wounded and \ninjured servicemembers will not be charged for meals received in \nmilitary treatment facilities. It will provide supplemental impact aid \nfor schools with large populations and military children. It authorizes \nfunds for military construction projects, military family housing, and \nBRAC-related construction to ensure that our troops have the housing \nthey deserve and our military has the facilities it needs for the \nnational defense.\n  The bill will build on last year's National Guard Empowerment Act by \nrequiring the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to \ndevelop a strategic plan to enhance the rule of the National Guard and \nReserves, taking into account the recent report of the Commission on \nNational Guard and Reserves.\n  The bill will provide funding for critical initiatives, including $3 \nbillion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. \nThat is the ongoing effort of that organization to defeat the threat of \nthese explosive devices. There are over $100 million in investments in \nadvanced energy and power technology to support defense missions, such \nas hybrid engines, military fuels research, and battery technology, and \nmore than $120 million to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and improve our ability to reduce and respond to threats of \nweapons of mass destruction, both at home and abroad.\n  Another thing this bill does is something I think every American who \nhas heard about the fact that we are spending taxpayer dollars for the \nreconstruction of Iraq, while the Iraqis have about $80 billion in \nsurplus funds in banks, including ours, drawing interest from the \nAmerican taxpayers, to go to the Iraqi Government to build \ninfrastructure in Iraq while they are charging us $120 a barrel and we \nare paying $4 a gallon for gasoline. When the American public focused \non that a few weeks ago, the reaction was what we would expect. They \nwere astounded that 5\\1/2\\ years later, $11 billion a month is going \nout of our taxpayers' pockets, while the Iraqis have a huge oil surplus \nbased on the revenues they get from $120- or $130-a-barrel oil, and \nwith all that money in the bank, we are still paying significant moneys \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. It is unconscionable.\n  We have a provision in this bill that will require the Iraqis to use \ntheir own oil revenues rather than U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay for the \nlarge infrastructure projects and also for the training and equipping \nof their own military. We all remember Deputy Defense Secretary \nWolfowitz, at the beginning of the war, who said Iraq would be able to \n``finance its own reconstruction through oil revenue.'' But that has \nnot proven to be the fact. U.S. taxpayers, so far, have paid $48 \nbillion for stabilization and reconstruction activities in Iraq.\n  Again, the Iraqi Government has generated more than $100 billion in \noil revenue since the war began and spent only a fraction of that \namount on its own reconstruction. Under these circumstances, it is \ninexcusable and unconscionable for U.S. taxpayers to have to foot the \nbill for projects that the Iraqis are fully capable of funding \nthemselves. The bill addresses that problem. We should not have to have \nlegislation on that. The President ought to call the Prime Minister of \nIraq and say: Folks, you have $80 billion. Reimburse us for the \nreconstruction. Surely, the ongoing construction should be paid for by \nIraq's surplus. But, apparently, that is not going to happen. So this \nlegislation is needed.\n\n  The bill also includes a number of measures to ensure the proper \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars. These include provisions that would \ninstitute improved cost control for the acquisition of major weapons \nsystems, require program managers to incorporate energy efficiency \nrequirements and performance parameters for such systems, and ensure \nthat private security contractors don't engage in combat and combat-\nrelated activities on the battlefield. This is a reform that has been \nneeded for a long time. We have these contractors that are hired to \nperform Government functions, with combat-related duties. We simply \nhave to make sure these private security contractors don't engage in \ncombat-related activities in these battle zones. We have to increase \noversight and accountability for housing privatization initiatives, and \nthe bill does all that. Our acquisition system is in deep trouble. This \nbill addresses that issue.\n  Since the beginning of 2006, nearly half of the 95 largest \nacquisition programs of the Department of Defense have exceeded the so-\ncalled Nunn-McCurdy cost growth standards that were established by \nCongress to identify seriously troubled programs.\n  I wonder if I might inquire of the Chair about the time remaining \nthat I control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will yield back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield my time to my colleague. I think I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. I am happy to share that with him. I am \nappreciative.\n  As I was saying, almost half of our largest acquisition programs have \nexceeded the Nunn-McCurdy standard to identify seriously troubled \nprograms. These major defense acquisition programs are known as MRAPs. \nThey have exceeded their R development by an average of 40 percent, \nand we have seen their acquisition costs grow by an average of 26 \npercent and experience an average delay of almost 2 years. The GAO \ntells us the cost overruns on these major defense acquisition \nprograms--just on these programs--now total almost $300 billion over \nand above the original program estimates. This isn't the cost of these \nprograms. This is the cost of the programs above what they were \nsupposed to cost--$295 billion. That is true even though we have cut \nquantities in those programs and reduced performance expectations on \nmany programs in an effort to hold costs down.\n  I want to put into context what the $295 billion cost overrun could \nbuy for us. This is what we could buy at current prices: two new \naircraft carriers at $10 billion each, eight Virginia class submarines \nat $2.5 billion each, 500 V-22 Ospreys, 500 Joint Strike Fighters, and \n10,000 MRAPs--all of that, not either/or but all of it--and we could \nstill pay for the total cost of our future combat system program, which \nis $130 billion.\n  That is just the overruns in those programs which have exceeded their \ncost estimates. These overruns happen because of fundamental flaws that \nare built into our acquisition system.\n  I will conclude because it is now time for us to vote. I am very \nhopeful that every Member of this Senate will vote to proceed to this \nbill. We cannot justify again delaying consideration of this Defense \nauthorization bill. The men and women in uniform deserve for us to act. \nThere is no way that we can look their parents, their families, their \nloved ones in the eyes and justify a failure to adopt this bill this \nmonth.\n  Again, I thank all the members of the committee and my good friend, \nSenator Warner, for everything he has done to make it possible for us \nto at least have a good chance to pass this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is at the hour of 5:30 \np.m. the vote will commence.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, \nthe Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n     Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close \n     debate on the motion to proceed to S. 3001, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.\n         Carl Levin, Christopher J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3001, an original bill to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.

We hope that is not the case. The \ntwo managers of the bill are ready to start legislating whenever they \ncan.\n  We have worked all afternoon trying to figure out a way to move \nforward on this bill, and I hope we can do that very quickly. This is \nan extremely important piece of legislation. This is the way we take \ncare of our troops. There is a 3.9-percent pay increase in this bill, \nand there are a lot of other good efforts to help the Nation's \nmilitary, so I hope we can move as quickly as possible. But we will \nwait for the Republicans to tell us if they are going to require the \nuse of the 30 hours postcloture.\n  There will be no more votes today, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8110-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8110-S8113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 6532\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today I came to the floor and \nindicated I had received calls from the administration--specifically, \none call from the Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters, who pleaded \nwith me to do everything I could to replenish the money from the \nhighway trust fund. The House has passed legislation that that will \ntake place on or about October 1 of this year. What we want to do, at \nthe request of the administration, is move that forward and do that \nnow. The money is gone. The Secretary has informed me and everyone else \nthat she is going to start doling the money out, first 80 percent and \nthen, as I understand what she said to me, it will be 50 percent, and \npretty soon nothing. We have major projects around the country that \nwill go unfunded and will have to cease construction.\n  It is extremely important we do this. We have asked, on many \noccasions prior to today, that this take place. We knew the trust fund \nwas down. But we have asked this be done before, and we received word \nfrom the White House that this was something they did not want to do. \nNow it appears the White House wants to have it done--as they should \nhave wanted it done a long time ago.\n  Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from H.R. 6532 and the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration; that the amendment at the desk be considered and agreed \nto, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table and any statements relating to this \nmatter be printed at its appropriate place in the Record with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  That is the consent. I add that what this would do is replenish--take \nfrom the general fund money in the sum of $8 billion and put it in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, if the majority leader will \nallow me to take a minute or so to explain the theory behind the \nobjection, it is this. Essentially, the highway fund was set up with \nthe highway trust fund and road construction to be paid for with \nrevenues from gas receipts. This will be one of the first occasions \nwhen the highways' construction will be paid for by taking the money \nout of the general fund. The only problem is we don't have any money in \nthe general fund. This money will have to be borrowed from our \nchildren.\n  It makes no sense from our fiscal responsibility to set this \nprecedent. There are many other ways this can be paid for in a \nresponsible way. Therefore, I do not believe we should start a \nprecedent of borrowing from the general fund in order to pay for \nhighway construction, which historically has been paid out of the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Therefore, on behalf of myself and Senator DeMint, I will be \nobjecting. But I would like to say this. I believe that with a \nreasonable number of amendments, probably no more than three, and a \nvery tight timeframe, we can address the issues about which I am \nconcerned and about which Senator DeMint is concerned. They would be \nrelevant issues, I would hope. We would run them by the majority leader \nso he could be reasonably comfortable with their relevance. Mine \nobviously would be related to paying for it in a more responsible way \nthan borrowing it from our children.\n  At this time, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. As I said a number of times, I so appreciate the ability \nthat I have--and I hope he, the distinguished senior Senator from New \nHampshire,\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nhas with me--to talk with each other, even though we disagree on \nmatters. He is always very upfront. He told me what amendments he \nthinks should be offered and I appreciate that very much. But at this \nstage we cannot do that. It would take days to get to this matter and \nthen, of course, amendments would take time.\n  I would also add this. This is not the first time the highway trust \nfund has been used in some manner. In 1998 we took approximately $8 \nbillion from the highway trust fund and put it in the general fund. So \nnow this is an opportunity to pay that back. We should have done it \nsome time ago. We didn't do that.\n  I appreciate the concern of the Senator from New Hampshire, but I \nhope, during the night, people will think about this. I hope the \nSecretary of Transportation will let the Republicans know how desperate \nthe country is for this money. We will renew this request tomorrow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield please for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I stand here as the chair of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We write the highway bill, and Senator Murray is \ninvolved in the funding of it. Both of us are involved in both. I ask \nthe majority leader's opinion on this.\n  We found out days ago that 82,000 jobs were lost in the month of \nAugust.\n  Mr. REID. It was 84,000.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you for the correction--84,000 jobs were lost in \nthe month of August and our unemployment rate is the highest in 5 \nyears. It is over 6 percent. I think it is extraordinary. I understand \nthe respect we all have for Senator Gregg. He is upfront about how he \nfeels. But the bottom line is, when people don't get a paycheck and \nthey lose their job, I want them to know what is going on here. You \nhave the Secretary of Transportation calling all of us saying: Please \nmove now. As my friend pointed out, we have, in fact, used the highway \ntrust fund in the past to fund the general fund. So this is not some \nextraordinary moment in history.\n  My question to my friend is--I want to ask you this, Mr. Leader: \nCould you please state again the urgency of this matter so my Governor, \nwho is dealing with a horrific budget crisis--he doesn't need this. \nNeither does my State legislature. I have a Republican Governor and \nDemocratic State legislature struggling to get a budget passed. I won't \ngo into the details. You need two-thirds to pass it. Now we get this \ncircumstance and job layoffs start to go out and the funding goes \ndown--would my friend, the leader, please explain again in clear \nlanguage why this is so urgent.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the chair of the committee of \njurisdiction, the highway trust fund is broke. As a result of that, \nthere are roads being built and bridges being built and that is simply \ngoing to stop. The people there, going to work, in the near future are \nnot going to be able to go to work anymore because there is no money to \npay them.\n  I would also say this. One of the things that so concerns me about \nthe Bush-Cheney-McCain operation is no one seems to care about all the \nred ink we have spent over the last 8 years. In Iraq alone we are \nspending $5,000 a second. During the time we have been here since this \nvote started, 40 minutes--I don't know how much money that is. I tried \nto figure out what it would be, 40 times 60 times 240. It is lots of \nmoney. Everything we have done this last 8 years has been basically \ndone on borrowed money.\n  Here is a situation where the administration is asking us to take \nmoney from the general fund. They will borrow that money as they have \ndone with everything here. That is why we have a $11 or $12 trillion \ndebt. I cannot imagine that self-righteous people are all of a sudden \nwanting things paid for.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could ask one more question. The Senator has hit the \nnail on the head. We do not hear any complaints from Senators DeMint or \nGregg or any of them over there on that side, or Senator McConnell, \nwhen we send all this money abroad. As a matter of fact, the \nadministration announced $1 billion to Georgia--not Atlanta, GA, the \ncountry of Georgia.\n  Regardless of how we feel, we all want to help them----\n  Mr. REID. That is borrowed money.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Borrowed money. The war costs $1 billion to the country \nof Georgia. Why are we paying $1 billion? It seems to me Europe has \nsome interest in this. But oh, no, now we hear objection from our \nRepublican friends when it comes to investing in America.\n  I tell my friend, the American people need to know more about this. \nThat is why I prolonged this discussion. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Senator from California \nfor her position. I don't think it accurately reflects my position. \nWhen you are voting for war costs, you are voting for supporting \nsoldiers in the field. Basically, there is a big difference between the \nobligation of a Federal government to defend the Nation and support \nsoldiers in the field and the obligation of the Federal Government to \nborrow from our children in order to do construction which should be \npaid for from taxes which go into the highway trust fund. That is a \nfairly significant difference. In fact, the two, as a matter of public \npolicy, have basically no touch point.\n  The issue is, the highway trust fund does not have enough money in it \nright now to pay for the costs which have been obligated as a result of \nconstruction commitments.\n  We knew 3 or 4 years ago, when we passed the highway bill, that as a \nvery practical matter we were setting up this scenario because we put \nin place thousands--actually, tens of thousands--of projects in that \nbill which we knew could not be paid for under the projected cash flows \ninto the highway trust fund. We knew this point was going to occur when \nwe passed that bill. So now we are here, and suddenly we hear these \nstatements: Well, I am sorry, we are out of money. So we have to go \ninto the general fund--which doesn't have any money, by the way--and \ntake money out of the general fund and put it in the highway trust fund \nin order to pay for these costs. Well, who pays for that? That is \nborrowed debt. That is debt on debt. Our children pay for that.\n  The purpose of the highway trust fund was to build roads and to do it \nin a fiscally responsible way. If the highway trust fund does not have \nenough money to build the roads that are proposed, then you either, A, \nget more money into the highway trust fund; B, take the money from \nsomeplace else that is part of the trust fund, such as the mass-transit \nfund, which was the proposal of the administration initially and which \nmakes probably the most sense here; or, C, you raise more money for the \nhighway trust fund, something I do not happen to support, but that is \nthe responsible way to approach this. You do not go into the general \nfund and set a precedent of borrowing from the general fund for the \npurposes of funding the highway trust fund because all that means is \nour children will get the bill and you will set up a scenario where the \nnext time we get the highway bill, there will be even more projects in \nit because people will know the relevance of the highway trust fund, \nand the revenues coming into it, has no relationship to the number of \nprojects you put in the bill because they will know that the precedent \nhas been set that you can raid the general fund for the purposes of the \nhighway trust fund. This is not good policy. It is not good fiscal \npolicy.\n  It has nothing to do, by the way, with funding troops in the field. \nNow, the Senator from California alleges that I am supporting funding \nIraq. By the way, I am not. Iraq reconstruction--I actually put the \nlanguage in the appropriations bill which stopped money from going for \nIraq reconstruction. So don't accuse me of something I didn't do. I \nhave supported funding the troops, but I do not happen to believe we \nshould be sending any more money to the Iraq Government. I think they \nshould be sending us more money, if we get down to the basics here, for \nall the money we have spent on reconstruction, especially the money \nthat has been stolen.\n  But, in any event, that is a red herring. The issue here is whether \nwe are going to set the terrible precedent of using general fund money \nto fund the highway trust fund because, believe me, once you open that \nfloodgate, there is no end to it--no end to it--and\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nthe next time we get a highway bill around here, there will be no end \nto the amount of spending that is involved.\n  Now, I understand the construction industry is not really too \nconcerned about that. I mean, they want those dollars and they want \nthem now. If they get access to the general fund, they are probably \npretty excited about that. But it is terrible policy. Remember, these \nprojects will not be terminated. The spend-out will continue. It will \ncontinue at a slower rate. As money comes into the general fund, it \ngets spent out of the general fund. That is called--wow, a surprise--\npay as you go.\n  Now, I hear a lot from the other side of the aisle about pay as you \ngo. Well, this is the ultimate test of pay as you go. We should be \npaying for highway construction as we go or, alternatively, if you \nreally want to start raiding different funds, you should raid within \nthe highway trust fund. There are significant dollars in the mass-\ntransit fund. You could take that money and put it in the highway trust \nfund if you really wanted to be consistent about funding the \ntransportation needs of this country or, as I said earlier, you could \nraise the taxes, which I do not happen to support, to go into either \none of those funds in order to make this a more responsible fiscal \naction. But what we are setting here is a precedent that makes no sense \nat all from a standpoint of fiscal policy.\n  The majority leader is absolutely right. We have been spending money \naround here in a very profligate way, and regretably it has not been a \npartisan event, it has been bipartisan. There has been a lot of money \nspent here that should not have been spent. But that doesn't justify \ncreating a new precedent which will create significant debt for our \nchildren, on top of debt which already exists, when we know that is not \nthe policy that was set up under the highway trust fund.\n  Now, if the theory of the chairman of this committee is that the \nhighway trust fund is essentially a nonexistent event, that it is \nbasically something that is there, it is a political statement--you \nknow, the gas taxes should come in and be spent, but if we run out of \ngas taxes, we go into the general fund--if that is the position of the \nmajority, the chairman of the committee, which appears to be the \nposition, well, then let's abolish the highway trust fund. Let's \nabolish it. Let's put the gas tax into the general revenue base, and \nthen you can argue, effectively, that it should come from general funds \nfor construction--not necessarily a good policy. In fact, it moves away \nfrom good policy. If we wanted a good policy, we would actually have a \nmuch more structured capital budget around here, and we would fund it \nfrom independent sources such as gas taxes.\n  So we have a difference of opinion. It is a difference of opinion, \nhowever, that is pretty significant because it goes to the question of, \nHow does a government spend money when it runs out of money? Does it \nborrow the money? Does it raise taxes or does it slow its spending to \nmeet its income? And I would suggest that the best way to approach this \nis to slow spending to meet incomes.\n  The second way to address this is to keep the integrity of the \nhighway trust fund by moving funding around within the highway trust \nfund. The third way to address this is to raise taxes, which I do not \nsupport. But absolutely the worst way to address this is to essentially \nmake the highway trust fund a nonevent, neutralize it, neuter it, and \nessentially merge it with the general fund, which is what is going to \nhappen as a practical matter if this bill goes forward in this form.\n  Now, I suggest to the majority leader, since I do not have the votes \nto sustain my position--I recognize that--the influence of the various \nforces that want to get this money is pretty significant, as always \nhappens around here anyway, but in this case it is even more \nsignificant since the White House has changed its position just this \nweek.\n  But I have suggested that we take up this bill, we spend a couple of \nhours on it, allow myself and Senator DeMint--I think Senator DeMint \ntold me he wanted two amendments--I cannot speak for him, but I believe \nthat is what he said--and that they would be relevant to earmarks, and \nmy amendment would be relative to a better way to pay for this, which \nwould be to pay for this by the transit fund or, alternatively, set up \nsome sort of structure where the general fund gets paid back. But in \nany event, we could set aside a couple of hours here sometime this week \nand do it. I mean, we can do that on unanimous consent. I think it is a \nreasonable way to approach it, and as a very practical matter, it would \ngive those of us who think a fiscally responsible approach at least \nrequires a vote on it the chance to vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not dream up the idea that projects \nwere going to be terminated. That is what the Secretary of \nTransportation told me. Now, maybe I misunderstood her. Maybe she was \nexaggerating. But that is what I took away from my conversation with \nher.\n  It is difficult for me to argue with the Senator from New Hampshire \nbecause I think it is fair to say that he has been trying to raise a \nred flag for a number of years about the wild spending of this \nadministration. Even though he is a stalwart Republican and close to \nthe administration, he has not been quiet about this.\n  Now, this is an issue I brought up today because I was asked to do so \nby the White House. Let the record be clear: Democrats have been very \nsupportive of funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We want to \nsupport the troops. And we can go into another discussion--and none of \nus want to get into that tonight--about what is going on in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  But the highway trust fund, part of it--and I believe, if we ever get \nto a point where we are debating amendments on taking money out of mass \ntransit--maybe 20, 25 years ago, when Nevada didn't have these \ntremendously difficult problems we have with traffic, with roads, and \nwe were not concerned about mass transit, maybe we would have joined \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire. But we in Nevada, as with many \nmetropolitan areas around the country, are desperately in need of more \ntransit money, not less--more transit money rather than less. So it \nwould exacerbate a tremendously difficult problem if the idea of the \nSenator from New Hampshire bore fruit; that is, we take the money out \nof mass transit and put it in for highways. That would be the wrong \nthing to do.\n  You can no longer say that the highway trust fund is just for \nhighways because for decades now, we have used part of this money--\nrightfully so--because of actions of the Congress, along with the \nadministrations, taking this money and doing very important mass-\ntransit projects.\n  So here is where we are. If we were able to have a vote on this piece \nof legislation tonight or tomorrow, it would pass overwhelmingly. But, \nas with the Senate, we cannot move to things just because we want to. \nWe have a lot ahead of this. We have the Defense authorization bill, we \nhave an energy issue we have to take up. That is next week. Every day \nthat goes by, according to the Secretary of Transportation, is a bad \nday for the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  It is my understanding that the Bush administration's Secretary of \nTransportation has asked us to move this bill, to put billions of \ndollars into the highway trust fund, so that it will not go broke so \nthat we can continue building those projects across America to reduce \nhighway congestion. And we have an objection on the floor of the Senate \nfrom a member of the Republican party to move to this bill to put the \nmoney in the highway trust fund; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is right. I see on the floor a poster child for \nthe necessity to do this, and that is the junior Senator from \nMinnesota. We had a bridge collapse from lack of money, and we, on an \nemergency basis, came to this floor, recognizing what a catastrophe \nthat was for Minnesota and our country. That bridge is now being built \nwith borrowed money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the leader in closing, to make the record clear \nfor those following the debate, our attempt to pass a bipartisan \nmeasure to help the administration, to make certain there is money in \nthe highway trust fund is being stopped by the Republican side of the \naisle; is that correct?\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely true.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the majority leader yield for a question? I would \nsay to the majority leader, since I am chairman of transportation \nappropriations, I have been warning of this to come for some time. It \nis my understanding that the amendment you are asking unanimous consent \nfor takes $8 billion out of the general fund and puts it back in the \ntrust fund, which is exactly what happened back in 1998, in reverse.\n  Taxpayers pay their gas tax into the trust fund, expect it to go for \ntransportation projects. In 1998, we took $8 billion of that money that \nthey expected to go into transportation funding and put it in the \ngeneral fund.\n  What you are asking to do tonight is simply to take that $8 billion \nback and put it exactly where taxpayers expected it to go originally, \nwhich was to transportation funds; is that not correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington is exactly correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I did not talk to the Secretary of Transportation. I did \nsee their press release that they now want this money to come out. It \nis my understanding that if we do not take this action, as the House \nhas done, that beginning this Thursday, and shortly thereafter, States \nwill not get their transportation dollars and will therefore have to \nbegin to lay off workers at construction projects and essentially halt \nmany of the construction projects in the country, correct?\n  Mr. REID. When I talked to her, I believe last Friday, she indicated \nto me that she was going to have to make those difficult decisions. \nThen I also read her press release later, after she had been able, I \nguess, to put more numbers in the paper, and that is what I read, which \nis an elaboration of what she told me.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I share the concern of the majority \nleader.\n  I am deeply concerned that several members of the Republican Party \nhave said no to this. At a time when our economy is in real trouble, \nwhen construction projects are not only providing critical dollars but \ncompleting important transportation work across the country, that we \nwould allow those projects to be halted and workers to be laid off, \nadding to the economic woes of the country at this time, is simply not \na smart move. I hope we see that decision reconsidered on the other \nside in the next 24 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership. I am not surprised that the Transportation Secretary for \nthe Bush administration would call the majority leader and ask this be \ndone. She came to us today. She stood over that bridge the day after it \nhappened. When I was listening to my friend from New Hampshire talk \nabout the fact that we need to continue funding our soldiers, of \ncourse, we need to do that. But for me, this is an issue of priorities. \nWhy this administration would decide to spend $10 billion a month in \nIraq month after month after month, so that this war has gone on longer \nthan World War II, while we have bridges collapsing, while we have \nlevees falling apart, defies reality.\n  When I heard the Senator from New Hampshire talk about soldiers on \nthe frontline, which this Congress has been more supportive of than any \nother Congress for continuing that funding, for those people on the \nbridge that day in Minnesota, they were on the frontline. Those people \nwho plummeted into that cold water that day were on the frontline. \nPeople died at that bridge. The NTSB has not concluded its \ninvestigation of the cause for the bridge collapse, but what we do know \nis, if it had been fixed earlier, if there had been appropriate funds \nall over this country for bridge and levee repairs, we may not have \nexperienced some of the disasters we have seen. I view this not only as \nfixing a bridge that, by the way, is six blocks from my house--I drive \nover it every day with my daughter in the back seat, an eight-lane \nbridge that fell into the Mississippi River--it is also about going \ninto the next century's transportation system.\n  If we are going to move to the next century in this economy, if we \nare going to start talking about transportation and wind and solar and \ndoing things with biofuels and building our own energy future, we \ncannot be stuck in the last century's transportation system. As we face \ndifficult economic times and look at the number in terms of what we can \ngenerate in jobs with transportation funding, it is a winner. I want to \nhave an infrastructure plan and a stimulus package that lasts long \nafter the rebate checks are cashed, that is looking to the future with \ninfrastructure funding.\n  When Dwight D. Eisenhower created the interstate highway system, when \nPresident Roosevelt did the rural electrification system, they saw it \nas not only moving the economy forward, they saw it as a way to \ngenerate jobs. That is what this is about.\n  It is shortsighted, indeed, and shows a lack of understanding of the \ncountry's priorities to say that we should let transportation funding \ngo down the pot while we are constructing bridges in Iraq and as \nbridges in Minnesota are falling apart.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8113-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the musical group \nLos Tigres del Norte for its contribution to the greater Las Vegas \ncommunity and especially for its commitment to the Silver State's \nvibrant Hispanic community. As we commemorate the importance of the \nHispanic community in Nevada and around the country during Hispanic \nHeritage month, I find it fitting to recognize the members of Los \nTigres del Norte for their talent and dedication.\n  Just last year, this premier musical group was chosen by a committee \ncomprising Las Vegas community and business leaders to join individuals \nsuch as my good friend, Wayne Newton, Vicente Fernandez, and other \nnotable celebrities who have made a positive impact on Clark County. \nLike the Walk of Stars honorees before them, Los Tigres del Norte have \nadded to the worldwide prominence of Las Vegas. These talented artists \nhave also been an encouraging and supportive voice for the Silver \nState's hardworking Hispanic community.\n  Their Grammy and Latin Grammy winning music not only entertains, but \nit sends a clear message that we all have a commitment to making a \nlasting impact on our community, regardless of the color of our skin or \nour country of origin. It also tells stories of those individuals who \noften are not able to share their concerns and challenges. Los Tigres \ndel Norte truly are a voice of the unheard. They confront the issues of \nour day and use their music as a medium to provide inspiration and \nhope.\n  Today I join my colleagues in the Silver State in recognizing Los \nTigres del Norte for all they have brought to Nevada and their \ndedication to serving as a positive voice for our vibrant Hispanic \ncommunity. Their addition to the Las Vegas Walk of Stars was a much \ndeserved recognition of their almost 40-year-long musical career and \ntheir success in bringing to light the challenges facing America's \nHispanic communities. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I offer \nmy congratulations to Los Tigres del Norte--an accomplished group of \nmusicians of whom all Nevadans can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8113-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8113-S8114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO TRILBY WHOBREY BALL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a dear friend \nof mine who has left behind her beloved\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\nCommonwealth stronger than when she found it. Mrs. Trilby Whobrey Ball \nwas 80 years old when she passed away in her Owensboro, KY, home this \nAugust 26.\n  Born in the Kentucky town of Semiway, in McLean County, Trilby--or \nTrib, to her friends--graduated from Calhoun High School in 1946. She \nmarried her husband, Dr. Coy ``Eddie'' Ball, in 1947 when they both \nwere attending Western Kentucky University. The Balls moved to \nOwensboro in 1964, where they would stay until this day.\n  Trib became well known to her neighbors and friends as she became \nactive in her community. She was a member of the Daviess County Medical \nAuxiliary/Alliance since 1964 and served on the boards of several \nimportant charitable causes, including the Ellis Park Foundation, the \nAlma Randolph Foundation and the H.L. Neblett Center.\n  In fact, I first became aware of the H.L. Neblett Center through \nTrib. The old building she showed me wasn't good enough, and I was able \nto appropriate funds to construct a new H.L. Neblett Center for the \ncommunity to focus on mentoring children and their families. That is \ndirectly due to Trib, and a room in the new building is appropriately \nnamed after her.\n  Since 2005, she was a member of the Kentucky State Legislative Ethics \nCommission. She joined Owensboro's First Baptist Church and became an \nintegral member of the New Ladies Sunday school class, a group of fast \nfriends who were very supportive of the Ball family during Trib's final \nyears.\n  Trib also became involved in local politics and devoted a lot of time \nto serving her community and her country that way. Back in the days \nwhen Kentucky was very much dominated by one political party, she stood \nup for a competitive two-party system. She became active in the \nRepublican Party of Daviess County and of Kentucky, and was chairperson \nof the 21-county Second District from 1968 to 1972. She cochaired the \nDaviess County gubernatorial campaign for Kentucky Governor Louie B. \nNunn.\n  Trib served on the party's State Central Committee for more than 20 \nyears, and represented Kentucky as either a delegate or a guest at the \nRepublican National Convention three times. In fact, in my role as its \ntemporary chairman, I selected her to be my honorary escort for the \n2008 Republican Convention, just held last week. Sadly, she left us \nbefore that date, but I decided to let her appointment stand as I know \nTrib would have loved to be with us in St. Paul, MN.\n  May I add, that Trib was also a longtime, steadfast supporter of my \nown campaigns, and I remember her eagerness to help and to volunteer \nvery well. Trib was very helpful to me back when no one knew who I was \nor if I could win a statewide election. I'm gratified that 24 years \nafter the fact, she told a reporter at a Lincoln Day luncheon this year \nthat my first Senate race in 1984 was one of the sweetest campaigns she \never worked on. It was made all the sweeter by her presence.\n  Friends and family members will remember Trib's love of boating, \nbasketball and bluegrass music when they think of her long, well-lived \nlife. She leaves behind her husband of nearly 61 years, Eddie; their \ntwo children, Bonnie Harris and her husband Jay as well as David Ball \nand his wife Christy; her grandchildren, Jack, Cal and Keeley Harris; \nher sister, Sylvia Gross; several nieces and nephews; and many other \nbeloved family members.\n  Mrs. Trilby Whobrey Ball was a very special woman and one of \nKentucky's finest citizens. I extend my deepest sympathies to her \nfamily. She will be greatly missed by all who loved her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8114-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8114-S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Brian K. Miller\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SGT Brian K. Miller from Pendleton, IN. Brian was 37 years old \nwhen he lost his life on August 2, 2008, in Abd Allah, Iraq, from \ninjuries sustained when his vehicle overturned. He was a member of D \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 293rd Infantry Division, 76th Infantry Brigade, \nArmy National Guard of Huntington, IN.\n  Today, I join Brian's family and friends in mourning his death. Brian \nwill forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, son, brother, \nfriend, and soldier. He is survived by his wife, Becky Miller; his \nchildren, Nikki and Austin Miller; his mother, Donna Cook; his sister, \nTammy Osalear; and his brother, Kevin Miller. Brian was preceded in \ndeath by his father, Glen Miller; and his brother, Kenny Miller.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, Brian was born in Indianapolis, IN, and graduated \nfrom Pendleton Heights High School in 1990. Driven to public service, \nhe joined the Indiana Army National Guard as a metal worker in 1989, \nwhile still in high school. Brian was assigned to Company D (HM), 738th \nMaintenance Battalion in Indianapolis and later moved to 1413th \nEngineer Detachment in Edinburgh, Indiana, where he was a vehicle \nmechanic and a welder. He later served time with Company C (HM), 38th \nMain Support Battalion as a welder and vehicle mechanic.\n  For 19 years, Brian devoted himself to national service through the \nIndiana National Guard. He assisted in Hurricane Katrina recovery \nefforts in the Mississippi Valley and in security for the 1996 Olympics \nin Atlanta. In March, Brian was deployed to Iraq, serving as a truck \ncommander for more than 20 combat logistics patrols and working full-\ntime as a technician with the Indiana Army National Guard. His comrades \nremember Brian as a respected leader who brought both professionalism \nand humor to his service, and as a man who loved his family. For his \nexceptional service and sacrifice, Brian was awarded the Army \nAchievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian Service \nMedal, Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal with 5 Oak Leaf \nclusters, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Joint \nMeritorious Unit Award.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Brian set. Today and always, Brian will be \nremembered by family, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American \nhero, and we cherish the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his \ncountry.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas we can take some measure of solace in knowing that Brian's heroism \nand memory will outlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian K. Miller in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \nstruggle in which we are engaged, and the immeasurable pain that comes \nwith so great a loss, I pray that Brian's family can find comfort in \nthe words of the prophet Isaiah who said:\n\n       He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \n     wipe away tears from off all faces.\n\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Brian.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Gary M. Henry\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life \nof SGT Gary M. Henry from Indianapolis, IN. Gary was 34 years old when \nhe lost his life on August 4, 2008, in Baghdad, Iraq, from injuries \nsustained from a roadside bomb that hit his vehicle. He was a member of \nthe 38th Military Police Company, 38th Infantry Division, Army National \nGuard in Danville, IN.\n  Today, I join Gary's family and friends in mourning his death. Gary \nwill forever be remembered as a loving husband, devoted father, son, \nbrother, friend, and soldier. He is survived by his wife, Regina Lynn; \nhis children, Shelby Brooke, Gavin Michael, and Ashtyn Taylor; his \nfather, Gary Henry; his mother and step-father, Marajo and Rick Castor; \nhis sister, Jennifer Clark; his step-sister, Stevie Ewing; his step-\nbrother, Jon Castor; and his grandparents, Margaret Hawkins, Orville \nHenry, and Pat Henry.\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n  Gary Henry was one of Indianapolis' great public servants, and his \npassion was visible in every aspect of his life. He joined the Indiana \nNational Guard in 1991 while he was a student at Whiteland High School. \nGary retired from the Guard 12 years ago, but rejoined in 2007, hearing \nonce again the call to national service. A 12-year veteran of the \nIndianapolis Fire Department, Gary was known to his peers as a team \nplayer, a dependable and upstanding leader who could be counted on \nduring hard times. He served as a captain and coordinator of special \noperations, head of the crisis response team, a paramedic, and a Marion \nCounty Deputy.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the extraordinary example Gary set.

Menke\n\n  Further, Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SPC Jonathan D. Menke from Madison, IN. Jon was 22 years old \nwhen he lost his life on August 4, 2008, in Baghdad, Iraq, from \ninjuries sustained from a roadside bomb that detonated near his \nvehicle. He was a member of the 38th Military Police Company, 38th \nInfantry Division, Army National Guard in Danville, IN.\n  Today, I join Jonathan's family and friends in mourning his death. \nJonathan will forever be remembered as a loving son, brother, friend \nand soldier. He is survived by his mother, Debbie Kay Estes Sizemore; \nhis father and stepmother, Daniel and Paula Menke; his sisters, Kristen \nPearson and Nichole Menke; and his brother, Matthew Eversole. Jon was \npreceded in death by his brother, Shane Pearson.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, Jon was born in Columbus, IN, and raised in \nMadison. A 2005 graduate of Madison Consolidated High School, Jon was a \nsuccessful student with many talents. He was a member of the football \nand track teams, qualifying for a regional meet as a member of the 400-\nmeter relay team. He was on the honor roll, was awarded for his art \nskills in sculpture, and had leading roles in school plays. A natural \nartist, Jon also played guitar and banjo.\n  In March of 2004, Jon answered the call to serve his country and \njoined the Indiana National Guard. He graduated from basic training at \nFort Leonard Wood in 2005. Returning to his education, Jon attended \nIndiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and Ivy Tech in \nIndianapolis. In February of 2008, Jon was called to active duty and \ndeployed to Kuwait and later to East Baghdad, his last assignment. Jon \nwas an exemplary soldier. For his outstanding service and sacrifice, \nJon was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, Army Good \nConduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal with \nBronze Service Star, Global War On Terrorism Service Medal, Army \nService Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon and the Combat Action Badge.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Jon set.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 6432, a bill \nthat reauthorizes the Animal Drug User Fee Act, or ADUFA, and create a \nnew user fee for the approval of generic animal drugs. This bill also \naddresses the use of antibiotics in animals, and technical corrections \nto last year's Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act.\n  Like human drugs, animal drugs must be shown to be safe and effective \nbefore they can be marketed. An animal drug can take 7 to 10 years to \ndevelop, at a cost of $100 million or more. ADUFA supports the review \nof animal drugs by authorizing FDA to collect fees for animal drug \napplications, and for the establishments, products, and sponsors \nassociated with these products.\n  This program is similar to the user fee programs for human drugs and \nmedical devices which we renewed last year. Like those programs, ADUFA \nexpires October 1. If we do not act on this bill, 60 valuable FDA \nemployees could be laid off. Even if we simply delay renewal of this \nprogram, those employees will receive a ``reduction in force,'' or RIF \nnotice, indicating they might be let go. Many will make that \npossibility a reality, and leave the agency, taking their talent with \nthem.\n  ADUFA has been a success. The program has eliminated the review \nbacklog for new animal drugs, improved the timeliness and \npredictability of reviews, and improved communication between companies \nand the FDA throughout the process. The renewal of this program will \ncontinue to enhance FDA review capacity, including more support for \nincreasingly complex reviews. Also, there is a growing backlog of \npremarket inspections of foreign animal drug producing facilities, \nwhich is a very timely issue. The renewal of ADUFA would better \nprioritize those inspections, and eliminate the backlog, helping to \nkeep our animal drug supply safe.\n  The renewal of this important animal health program would nearly \ndouble funding levels to $98 million over 5 years. I want to be clear \nthat the renewal of this program does not speed up the review of new \nanimal drugs. It holds FDA to the same performance goals for review \ntimes--it just keeps review times from getting slower.\n  The bill we are considering today contains another important advance \nfor animal drugs. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FDA is \nrequired to review and act on generic animal drug applications within \n180 days. Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2007, the average review time \nfor generic animal drug applications was 570 days, and there was a \nbacklog of 446 of these submissions. Without Congressional action,\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nthe proposed target for action in fiscal year 2009 is 700 days--nearly \n2 years. This is an untenable position.\n  We all know that FDA is seriously underfunded. Like many of you, I \nwould prefer that appropriations be used to fund the agency's \nactivities. But that is simply not in the offing. An appropriated \ndollar is better than a user fee dollar, but a user fee dollar is \nbetter than no dollar at all. The Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act \nunder consideration today would create a new program to fund the \nreviews of animal generic drugs. This program will lead to progressive \nimprovements in performance, with the time for review and action on \nsubmissions decreasing each year.\n  If we do not proceed with this initiative, our farmers, ranchers, \nveterinarians and pet owners like you and me will not be able to \ncapture the savings that result from generic animal drug use. I want to \npoint out that even with the creation of this new user fee, the \nperformance goals do not return animal generic drug review times to the \nstatutory requirement of 180 days. By fiscal year 2013, the fifth year \nof the program, the proposed review target is 270 days. Once again, the \nbest we can do is to keep things from getting much worse as quickly.\n  The bill before us today also includes a section expanding and \nstreamlining the reporting of the amount of antibiotics that are used \nto treat animals that are sold annually and the label information about \nthose antibiotics. This reporting language is a carefully crafted \ncompromise between the farmer, rancher and veterinarian communities on \none side and those who think the FDA has inadequate information to \nassess the potential public health impact of antibiotic use on the \nother. I appreciate the House Members and staff and outside groups who \nworked together to achieve this agreement.\n  Finally, this bill contains just two of several changes necessary to \nproperly implement the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of \n2007. As with any large piece of legislation, there are some technical \ncorrections necessary to fix inadvertent errors in the law.\n  These technical corrections are critical to ensuring that key drug \nsafety and transparency provisions in the bill work as intended. I am \ndisappointed that we could not complete agreement on a package in time \nto attach the package to ADUFA. I am even more discouraged that the \nHouse chose to cherry-pick just the technical corrections they wanted \nand attach those instead.\n  But given the approaching deadline for renewing ADUFA, we cannot \nafford to hold this important program hostage to unrelated provisions. \nI intend to continue pressing for passage of a full package of \ntechnical corrections. I appreciate Chairman Dingell's commitment to \ncontinuing to meet and work on this, and I look forward to preparing a \nfull package of technical corrections that can be accepted by both \nHouses and go into effect.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work on these proposals. We have \nsome work still ahead of us, but the bill before us today contains much \nthat is good. I strongly urge my colleagues to support final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NAMING OF U.S. COURTHOUSE IN RICHMOND, VA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 2403, a bill \nto name the new United States courthouse in Richmond, VA, for two \ndistinguished jurists and sons of VA.\n  Senator Webb and I introduced this bill together last year, and the \nbill passed the Senate on June 24, 2008. The House of Representatives \nis expected to pass this bill tonight, with a minor technical change. \nIt is my hope that the Senate will accept this minor modification and \npass this bill when the legislation returns to the Senate tonight or \nearly tomorrow.\n  Our bill will recognize two of Virginia's outstanding jurists: \nSpotswood Robinson III and Robert Mehrige, Jr. They were lawyers who \nthroughout their careers adhered to the principle of ``equal justice \nunder law.''\n  The first, Spottswood William Robinson, III, was born in Richmond, \nVA, on July 26, 1916. He attended Virginia Union University and then \nthe Howard University School of Law, graduating first in his class in \n1939 and serving as a member of the faculty until 1947.\n  Judge Robinson was one of the core attorneys of the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national \nprominence in the legal community with his representation of the \nVirginia plaintiffs in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board \nof Education. Brown outlawed public school segregation declaring \n``separate but equal'' schools unconstitutional.\n  In 1964, Judge Robinson became the first African American to be \nappointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and, \nin 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first African \nAmerican to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. Finally, on May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the \nfirst African American to serve as chief judge of the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Our second jurist, Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., was born in 1919 and \nlater attended High Point College in North Carolina. He subsequently \nearned his law degree from the T.C. Williams School of Law at the \nUniversity of Richmond, from which he graduated at the top of his class \nin 1942.\n  From 1942 to 1945, Judge Merhige served in the U.S. Air Force, he \npracticed law in Richmond from 1945 to 1967, establishing himself as a \nformidable trial lawyer representing criminal defendants as well as \ndozens of insurance companies.\n  On August 30,1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division by \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, serving as a Federal judge until 1998. In \n1972, Judge Merhige ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia \nschool districts. He considered himself to be a ``strict \nconstructionist'' who went by the law as spelled out in precedents by \nthe higher courts. In 1970, he ordered the University of Virginia to \nadmit women. As evidence of Judge Merhige's groundbreaking decisions, \nhe was given 24-hour protection by Federal marshals due to repeated \nthreats of violence against him and his family. His courage in the face \nof significant opposition of the times is a testimony to his dedication \nto the rule of law.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, I have worked to name the new \ncourthouse in Richmond for these two men for several years. I am proud \nthat the Virginia Congressional delegation, the Virginia Bar \nAssociation, the mayor of Richmond, and many others decided that the \nbest way to honor both men was to have them equally share the honor of \nhaving the courthouse so named.\n  With the ribbon cutting for this grand facility tentatively set for \nOctober 17 of this year, I can think of no better time than now to move \nthis legislation in honor of Spottswood Robinson and Robert Merhige. I \nthank the committee for the consideration of this bill and look forward \nto working with my colleagues in seeking its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8116-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8116-S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING OLYMPIAN SHAWN MACHEL JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I honor an Iowan who has shown \ntremendous strength of spirit, as well as a fierce determination and \nworld-class talent. Olympic gymnast Shawn Machel Johnson has been and \ncontinues to be a model of character and fitness, as well as a source \nof inspiration for all Americans.\n  Shawn recently returned from Beijing, where she made us all very \nproud, competing in the 2008 Olympics and winning one gold and three \nsilver medals. The gold medal was for her performance in the balance \nbeam finals, while the silver medals were for the team competition, the \nwomen's all-around, and the floor individual finals.\n  Since Johnson was 3 years old, she has exhibited a love for \ngymnastics, and received constant support and encouragement from her \nparents Teri and Doug Johnson, and coaches Liang Qiao and Liwen Zhuang. \nShe is greatly admired and respected by her fellow gymnasts at Chow's \nGymnastics and Dance in West Des Moines, where she has been training \nsince she joined the facility at age 6. Her training and her strong \ncommitment to the sport have propelled her to success in the series of \ncompetitions that led her to the Beijing Summer Olympics.\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n  In addition to her rigorous training of up to 25 hours per week, she \nhas also excelled academically. She is now in her junior year at Valley \nHigh School in West Des Moines, and has been on the ``A'' Honor Roll. I \nbelieve very strongly that promoting fitness and providing quality \neducation are both key factors in ensuring that children have a bright \nand successful future. Shawn Johnson is an inspiration to Iowa's young \npeople to stay active, be studious, do what they love, and follow their \ndreams.\n  I would like to congratulate Johnson for bringing home four Olympic \nmedals and commend her for her outstanding commitment to the sport of \ngymnastics. I hope that she continues to pursue her passion and that we \nwill see her endearing smile and more of her amazing performances in \nLondon in 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8117-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING OLYMPIAN LOLO JONES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I honor an Iowan who has \ncourageously pursued her dreams through great adversity and who has \ndisplayed outstanding character and grace throughout her life. Lori \n``Lolo'' Jones recently returned from Beijing, where she competed as a \nhurdler in the 2008 Olympic Games. Lolo made us all very proud as she \nrepresented the United States in Beijing. Although she did not come \naway from Beijing with a medal, she realized her dream of competing in \nthe Olympics and was a model of athleticism, sportsmanship, and \ndetermination.\n  Lolo has had seemingly limitless energy, a positive attitude and an \nintense focus on running since she was a child. It is these \ncharacteristics that have allowed her to overcome what many would \nconsider to be challenging circumstances, including the fact that her \nfamily relocated frequently throughout her childhood.\n  As a student at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, she excelled at \nrunning as well as academics. After graduating from Roosevelt, Lolo \nbecame the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at \nLouisiana State University, where she excelled on the LSU track team. \nShe graduated with an economics degree and a minor in Spanish, yet \ndeferred seeking a career in her field of study, determined to pursue \nher running career instead. She worked part-time jobs to support \nherself and to have free time to travel for competitions. After missing \nan opportunity to compete in Athens in 2004, her former LSU coach \npersuaded sponsors to recognize Lolo's great potential, allowing her to \ndevote herself to becoming a world-class professional athlete.\n  Competing in and winning many races around the world in the years \nleading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Lolo became a highly respected \nathlete, not only for her performances, but for her exemplary \nsportsmanship and generosity.\n  And, through it all, Lolo never forgot where she began her journey. \nShe returned to Roosevelt High School earlier this year to make a \ndonation for improvements to the track, and also for new shoes and \nequipment for the track team. She also donated winnings from a recent \nrace to a victim of the flooding that ravaged Iowa this spring.\n  I salute Lolo Jones for her extraordinary discipline and hard work, \nfor her determination to improve and excel as an athlete, and also for \nher grace, generosity, and strength of character. She has been, and \nwill continue to be, a wonderful role model for all athletes and for \nall young people seeking to excel in their field. I congratulate her on \nall of her achievements and on realizing her dream of competing in the \nOlympics. I hope and expect that we will see Lolo again in London in \n2012, this time hurdling her way toward Olympic gold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8117-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING BABE RUTH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and career of \nBabe Ruth, one of America's greatest baseball players. The man we know \nas Babe Ruth, was born on February 6, 1895, as George Herman Ruth, Jr. \nand passed away 60 years ago on August 16, 1948. In his obituary, the \nNew York Times called him ``a figure unprecedented in American life. A \nborn showman off the field and a marvelous performer on it, he had an \namazing flair for doing the spectacular at the most dramatic moment.'' \nAlthough he played his last season in 1935, Ruth still holds the \nrecords for all-time highest slugging percentage. Ruth's 714 career \nhomers and his consistent dominance in the batter's box rightly earned \nhim the nickname, ``The Sultan of Swat.''\n  However, Babe Ruth was more than a superior ballplayer. Although his \ndramatically big swing earned him a place in the record books, Mr. Ruth \nwas a figure of legendary proportions who permanently changed the game \nof baseball and made it a fixture in American life. His famous \n``called'' shot in the 1932 World Series is so ingrained in our \nnational memory and baseball lore that even our youngest children \nplaying tee-ball in backyards across the country seek to emulate this \niconic moment.\n  Mr. Ruth was also famous for his generosity, working for the Red \nCross during World War II, organizing charity golf tournaments with \nlongtime adversary Ty Cobb, appearing at benefits, and buying more than \n$100,000 in war bonds. A year before his death, he established the Babe \nRuth Foundation, which provided assistance to disadvantaged children. \nLinda Ruth Tosetti, Mr. Ruth's granddaughter, is a resident of \nConnecticut, and today I would like to remember her grandfather, one of \nthe greatest sports legends in our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8117-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE LA SALLE ACADEMY PLAYERS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize the achievement of the La \nSalle Academy Players, the theater troupe from my high school alma \nmater, which recently gave four performances of ``The Scottish Play: \nMacbeth'' at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This prestigious event, the \nworld's largest arts festival, is held annually in Scotland.\n  The La Salle Players were one of only 43 high school troupes chosen \nto perform from among hundreds of high school drama programs by the \nAmerican High School Theatre Festival.

Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I, along with my \nMichigan colleague, Senator Stabenow, congratulate WUOM-FM on 60 years \nof successful broadcasting. Over the past six decades, WUOM-FM, the \nUniversity of Michigan's flagship public radio station, has become a \nfixture in public broadcasting, distinguishing itself through the \nbreath and depth of its programming and through its unwavering \ndedication and service to its many listeners throughout southeastern \nMichigan.\n  Since its inception as a small radio station broadcasting in the Ann \nArbor area, WUOM-FM has been a consistent and important voice in public \nradio in Michigan. In 1950, WUOM broadcasted its first Michigan \nFootball game, a tradition it would enjoy for the next 50 years, and in \n1958, it broadcasted its\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\nfirst Detroit Symphony Orchestra performance from the Ford Auditorium. \nTwo years later, Michigan Radio broadcasted Senator John F. Kennedy's \nfamous campaign speech at the University of Michigan, where he spoke \nabout public service as a responsibility of freedom, a speech that \nhelped to bring about the creation of the Peace Corps. In 1971, WUOM \njoined National Public Radio and became one of the first radio stations \nto air ``All Things Considered''.\n  WUOM has grown and evolved since its first public broadcast on July \n5, 1948. Today, Michigan Radio, which includes WUOM, WVGR and WFUM, \nbroadcasts from Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, and Flint, respectively, and \nenjoys the largest listening audience of any public radio station in \nthe State and is among the leaders nationally. Michigan Radio's \nprogramming format changed from classical music to a news and \ninformation format in 1996. With this change one thing has remained the \nsame: the superb quality of each and every broadcast segment. With more \nthan 400,000 listeners tuning in each week, Michigan Radio has become \nan important source of news and information about local, state, \nnational and world affairs for the listening public.\n  As technology has evolved, so has Michigan Radio. Today, it is \nbroadcasted in high definition and is accessible from mobile devices \nacross Michigan. Listeners can tune in to programming from National \nPublic Radio, Public Radio International, and the BBC, as well as local \nprograms, such as the Environment Report and Jack Lessenberry's Essays \nand Interviews.\n  WUOM has been the recipient of many awards throughout its history. In \nthe past year alone, Michigan Radio has earned more than 30 awards. The \nmost notable was the 2008 National Edward R. Murrow Award for Best News \nDocumentary, which was awarded for ``Ashes to Hope: Overcoming the \nDetroit Riots.''\n  Michigan Radio has forged an impressive reputation for quality \nprogramming, public service, and integrity. It is in this spirit that \nwe know our Senate colleagues join us in congratulating each individual \nwho has contributed to the success of WUOM-FM over the past 60 years, \ndedicating endless hours, energy, and hard work in pursuit of \nexcellence in public broadcasting. I wish them another 60 years of \noutstanding achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8118-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8118-S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through an email address set up for these stories to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Priority: Explore in this country for oil\n       How do high fuel prices affect me and my family? We do not \n     travel nearly as much as before. I am telecommuting one day a \n     week. We have cut out all spending except the bare \n     essentials. We are worried about losing jobs as the economy \n     continues to collapse.\n       I have no doubt that the fuel prices will continue to \n     increase as the extremists in this country continue to \n     sabotage efforts to tap local fuel sources. They are diligent \n     in their efforts to slowly undermine and destroy this \n     country. Unfortunately, there is no hope that they will be \n     stopped. I am doing what I can to not spend as much on fuel, \n     such as using a wood stove for heat in the winter. Of course, \n     the natural gas-fired furnaces are cleaner-burning, but the \n     extremists do not consider that when they ban mining for gas \n     and oil and, in a roundabout way, drive up the price of \n     everything. Wood for the stove is very cheap or free.\n       I would use fossil-fuel-free transportation more than I \n     already do if the roadways were safer for that. I could use \n     my horses to get around, but the city codes and the highways \n     are not set up for that. Other people are trying to use \n     bikes. I saw a smashed bike in front of a large vehicle in \n     the middle of a busy road today. The ambulance was just \n     getting to the scene. Not too safe to use bikes.\n       If nothing effective can be done to bring down fuel prices, \n     then the roadways need to be set up for using horses and \n     carts and bicycles and foot traffic. City codes need to be \n     changed to allow the use of horses and other draft animals. \n     That was the most effective method of transportation before \n     the invention of cars, and draft animals are used in other \n     countries that do not have fossil-fuel-fired vehicles. It is \n     extreme, but all I see are fuel prices going up so fast that \n     quickly most people will not be able to get around. Bicycles \n     are limited as to how much stuff you can haul. So draft \n     animals are the only way.\n       With the short-sighted ban on horse slaughter, there are \n     now way too many horses around being abandoned and given \n     away. It is the perfect solution: A lot of these unwanted \n     horses can be used for transportation as soon as city codes \n     and CC's are changed to allow people to keep horses on \n     small land parcels. I have a few acres and pasture for my \n     horses, but a lot of people do not have that. I cannot use my \n     horses to go to the big towns because the roads are suited \n     for high-speed cars, not for horses. My horses and I would \n     end up like that bike I saw today, twisted and crumpled in \n     the road in front of some large car.\n     Carole, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to state briefly how higher \n     energy processes are impacting my own life. I like to think \n     of myself as well-educated, environmentally responsible, and \n     having control of my life and my family finances. We are \n     fiscally responsible. We try to live to an established \n     budget. We pay our bills on time, and we set aside money for \n     a rainy day. However, with today's skyrocketing gas prices \n     and energy costs, I do not think we are going to be able to \n     sustain our current lifestyle any longer. We have made cuts \n     where we can. We have tried to reduce the number of trips we \n     need to take in our vehicles, but just doing that is not \n     nearly enough. We have had to cut out some of our luxuries \n     such as cable television. Given what is presented on \n     television these days, that was not too much of a sacrifice, \n     either. Now we are starting to wonder if we will be able to \n     get enough food on the table, or keep our kids in the clothes \n     that they need. We have 3 growing children, and it seems \n     their clothes only fit for a few weeks. Now we are \n     considering reducing the amounts we contribute to our 401K \n     investment plan, cutting out family vacations, and working \n     more hours.\n       It is funny how the things that are most important in life \n     such as spending time with your children are the things that \n     must suffer because of the condition of the economy. It is \n     frustrating that we are having to cut the investments we are \n     trying to make in our future just to make ends meet today. \n     Further, every bill seems to be going up, and my salary is \n     not increasing at all. We feel lucky to have a job at all as \n     there have been many who have been laid off where I work. We \n     might be considered upper middle class, but I wonder how much \n     longer this will last as the economy and government policies \n     are slowly driving all of us into poverty.\n       There are a lot of things in the world to worry about. For \n     the sake of my children, I hate to see this direction we are \n     heading in. Also, I am disappointed at how [some of] our \n     lawmakers in Washington, D.C., wish to play politics, but do \n     not seem to have any intentions on fixing the problems. All \n     we see right now [is partisian] posturing just to win votes, \n     economy be damned. They like to tell themselves that they \n     have our best interests in mind, but given the lack of \n     action, I am starting to wonder what good it is to have a \n     government at all. How bad are things going to get before \n     someone starts doing something about it?\n       What can be done about it? I think we need to step it up on \n     several fronts. We need more gas and oil production here at \n     home. We need to encourage more conservation. We need to \n     demand car companies increase their mpg. We need to actively \n     encourage nuclear power production and stop listening to all \n     the crazy special interest groups that are out there. We need \n     to stop worrying about an international war that is literally \n     draining all of our resources. We have got to stop worrying \n     about universal healthcare and everything else that will not \n     succeed if we do not have a sound economy. Let us get focused \n     and do it now. If we do not, it will be too little, too late.\n       Thanks for taking a minute to listen to my story. I was \n     starting to wonder if any of our politicians knew we were out \n     here.\n     Jeff, Iona.\n                                  ____\n\n       It goes something like this. I am on Social Security \n     Disability, and my mother and stepfather, aunts, and uncles \n     are on Social Security. In the last ten years, the increase \n     in benefits has been around 2.5% each year. Rent has \n     increased 35%; gas, 50%+; natural gas, 30%; electricity, 35%; \n     food, 30%; and basic water fees were $18 in 1999, and now are \n     over $40.\n       An economist said that the economy raising 3% per year is a \n     good thing, did not say the price of goods/services going up \n     was a good thing. He meant that those working getting a 3% \n     increase in funds to spend was a good thing.\n       Thinking that I live on $750 per month, and bills are $350-\n     400 per month, then trying to\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\n     have insurance to drive a car, I was suspended because I had \n     none. And I thought I would save money by not driving. It \n     does not work that way, as food prices have risen over one-\n     third, which makes getting insurance or paying my fines not \n     on the top of my list. [I may need to rely on friends to \n     drive me to Twin Falls to purchase groceries.]\n       I understand that things are changing, but I need to ask: \n     how much profit is enough? I also think we should go back to \n     the stipend system for elected officials. Those that lead \n     this government should not be doing it for the money; it \n     should be for the honor of the position.\n       I would also think that the government running its own \n     business in competition to show a profit for tax relief would \n     be a great way to show corps that it can be done, and it \n     would force the lowering of prices. I think it would be cool \n     to run a state-funded cellphone system, in areas not \n     accessible to cell. The fees could be used for taxes, as well \n     selling the towers for profit to the cellphone corps. Force \n     the suppliers to compete.\n     Ed.\n                                  ____\n\n       While no one wants to pay more for anything, and most \n     people are glad to have things for cheap or free, there comes \n     a time to pay what the true value of energy is. Americans \n     have been pretty lucky to pay low energy costs for as long as \n     we have and we have become convinced that cheap energy is our \n     God-given right.\n       Unfortunately, cheap energy comes at a cost, and future \n     generations have been subsidizing our cheap energy. It is sad \n     that we have been willing to pass the bill on to them in \n     terms of pollution and the national debt. Since our military \n     is in essence used to secure oil, that is another hidden \n     costs that most people do not realize that someone will have \n     to pay.\n       I do not think paying more for fuel is such a bad thing \n     because I think most people overuse fuel. People need to be \n     more considerate in fuel use, and if higher prices will \n     reduce fuel use, then so be it.\n       As a farmer who grows food for my local community, higher \n     fuel price actually means I can charge more for the food I \n     grow since food prices are increasing everywhere. I have low \n     transportation costs, so I will actually make more money as a \n     result. I cannot complain about that.\n       If you sincerely want to do something about energy prices, \n     Senator Crapo, then I suggest you promote the development of \n     local economies, There is no need to ship and truck things \n     from halfway around the world when, in reality, we can be \n     producing what we need locally. That will reduce fuel use, \n     which will lower demand, which will lower prices. We will \n     also be reducing pollution and become more economically self-\n     sufficient.\n       Our current system is completely unsustainable, and to \n     complain about high fuel prices misses the point. I would \n     much rather have you fighting for sound economic and \n     environmental policies rather than continue to promote a \n     system will at some point will collapse, anyway. As a leader, \n     it is your job to make tough decisions, not pander to what \n     seems to be selfish energy use.\n           Sincerely,\n     Garrett, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the effects \n     that high gasoline prices are having on our family's budget. \n     To begin with, we are a family of six: My wife Nancy and I \n     have four children, ages 23, 21, 18, and 16. We live in \n     Boise, and both Nancy and I commute to work on bicycles. I \n     work for the State of Idaho, and my wife is a first grade \n     teacher. We enjoy the jobs we have been blessed with in \n     Boise.\n       Although we have received consistent salary increases, the \n     percentages of these increases are certainly not keeping up \n     to the increases in a lot of goods and services, and most \n     notably, in gasoline costs.\n       Commuting on bicycles has saved us money and kept us in \n     good shape, but it does have its risks! Our four children \n     bicycle to work, college and high school. We have one main \n     family car, and two of our children have cars. However, one \n     of the cars is currently ``off the road'' and parked in our \n     driveway. And the other one is destined for that, too. We \n     still use the family car for a number of local trips, but we \n     try to avoid or combine them when possible.\n       We are planning to take a trip to California in less than \n     two weeks. Each year we take a group of people to help at a \n     place called Gleanings for the Hungry, which is a Christian \n     volunteer organization that processes food and ships it to \n     hungry people all over the world.\n       We considered taking two vehicles for the seven people who \n     are in our part of the team, but instead we may all crowd \n     into our minivan in order to save gas money and wear and tear \n     on the other car.\n       So, Senator, these are the ways that the high gas prices \n     have affected us. I do not think that we will see lower gas \n     prices again, so it is time for all of us to use our ``Yankee \n     Ingenuity'' and make the best of this situation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ken.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am not surprised in the least that the situation is what \n     it is. Actually, I am a little surprised that energy costs \n     are not much higher at this time. I have been in contact with \n     my Federal Representative, the Honorable Mike Simpson, \n     regarding your update letter, namely, the high cost of \n     gasoline, and energy in general. I sent him a link to a \n     speech given in 2006, by a man that was present, for three \n     years, on the building of the Alaska pipeline. His words \n     were, ``. . . I am considering your suggestion to accelerate \n     completion of the Alaskan pipeline with great interest.'' \n     What say you, Senator?\n       The oil reserves that we hold are more than sufficient, to \n     not only bring our pump prices down, but also allow us to pay \n     off our outrageous, $9.3 Trillion national debt, in the space \n     of five years, and allow us to consume oil for the next 200 \n     years or so (at least!). Perhaps you, Senator Crapo, would be \n     willing to watch this video. You, too, will be enlightened, \n     as I have been by this knowledge, and perhaps will be \n     persuaded to come to the aid of your country, in our darkest \n     hour. This is a link to the video--http://wideeyecinema.com/\n?p=203.\n     Curt, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Being a sort of forward-looking individual, in 2005 we \n     purchased a Volkswagen Jetta with a diesel engine. It is a \n     wonderful little car, but the unique thing about it is that \n     it gets fifty as in 50 miles per gallon. Now I have watched \n     as our illustrious leadership have mollycoddled the \n     automobile makers here in the U.S. and even actually required \n     the raising of the automobile mileage here in this country to \n     a measly 35 miles per gallon average for vehicles. This when \n     vehicles running on diesel already get way more than that! \n     Now we do not drive that much because of gas and diesel \n     prices, but since I can drive nearly 700 miles on a 14-gallon \n     tank of gas, how often do you think we fill up? Admittedly, \n     the prices of a tank of gas amaze us each time we do fill up, \n     but still, we can, and often do, go a month without buying \n     diesel. Even if I were to drive to ``town'' every day, I \n     could drive almost half a month without filling up!\n       While such action by our leadership I guess is to be \n     expected, I would like to know when [Congress] will ever get \n     enough gumption to provide leadership for this nation? As a \n     sort of forward-looking individual, I guess it would be fair \n     to say that waiting for anyone living and working within the \n     Beltway to provide any kind of leadership on energy is \n     probably a moot point. While [partisan battles cloud \n     everything,] the world forges ahead, trying hard to ignore \n     the lack of ability to get anything done.\n       We hire you (elect you) to provide leadership, guide the \n     country in and out of crises but, to be quite frank, [I am \n     extremely disappointed in the partisanship that seems to \n     permeate everything that happens in Congress]. The \n     congressional confidence level is, as you know, at the lowest \n     level ever. Somebody has to do something--even if it is \n     wrong!\n       Since I do not work in your environment, I do not have a \n     remedy for the environment of ``do nothing'' that seems \n     pervasive in the Beltway. I do believe, however, that all \n     influence from well-paid lobbyists and those with more money \n     that they know what to do with should be put in some kind of \n     less effective position relative to policy influence. While I \n     understand that people need to be able to contact the people \n     representing them, they should be limited to doing so only by \n     the same means as the rest of us who do not and cannot have \n     someone following legislators around influencing them at \n     every turn.\n       Sorry, Senator, to rant about this on your forum for high \n     energy prices. But I do not think [the current leadership] \n     has or is providing any leadership in this or a variety of \n     other areas. It seems as if we, the public, have to solve our \n     own problems while Congress muddles around [in partisan \n     bickering.] I have a car that gets 50 miles per gallon of \n     fuel--what does your car get? What do your staff cars get? \n     How many of you use any of the many kinds of ``commuter'' \n     transportation available within the beltway?\n       Have a good day--please try and help us working on the \n     energy problem solve it!\n     Raymond and Sherry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Today I filled \\3/4\\ of my car's gas tank. It cost $80 \n     plus. Need I say more?\n     Grant, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for expressing an interest in the situation of \n     one family here in Lewiston. Any time we plan to drive \n     somewhere, we give more thought to the need for the trip and \n     whether it can be postponed or eliminated. In deciding \n     whether to travel, the miles to be driven and our estimated \n     fuel consumption (cost) are discussed. My wife works at LCSC \n     (Lewis Clark State College). Instead of my driving her to her \n     office, I now walk with her to work. The walk saves fuel and \n     gives us time together. Now that the summer air conditioning \n     season is here, we are keeping the thermostat at about 75 \n     deg. If the electric bill is much higher we will raise the \n     thermostat again. With the increased cost of groceries, we \n     are starting to shop in Clarkston, WA; i.e. no state sales \n     tax. Instead of eating out several times a week, we may only \n     go out once now. When getting gasoline, I limit my purchase \n     to about $20, or, about 5 gallons.\n       We spend a lot of time trying to figure out why in a \n     country with so many natural resources and safe nuclear power \n     we are not developing addition resources for the benefit of \n     the population.

Over the course of the last decade, based on his skills as \nan interviewer and his keen insight, Nnamdi has grown into a national \ntreasure and one of the most respected broadcasters in the National \nCapital Region. ``The Kojo Nnamdi Show'' features 2 hours of news, \npolitical issues, and social trends of the day in a magazine program \nformat.\n  It is hard to remember a time before Kojo Nnamdi was part of the WAMU \n88.5 broadcasting family, but it was just 10 years ago, in 1998, when \nNnamdi left his host position at WHUT-TV's public affairs show \n``Evening Exchange'' to become the host of WAMU's radio program \n``Public Interest.'' He replaced former host Derek McGinty, filling a \nvibrant radio talk show slot that can be traced back to 1977 with Fred \nFiske. The program officially was renamed ``The Kojo Nnamdi Show'' in \nSeptember 2002.\n  Nnamdi was born Rex Paul in Guyana. He came to this country in 1967 \nto attend college. He began broadcasting in 1973 at WHUR-FM and chose \nhis radio persona based on the Akan word for Monday--Kojo--and Nnamdi \nAzikiwe, a fellow journalist and the founder of modern Nigerian \nnationalism who was the first President of Nigeria.\n  Nnamdi's global perspective and inviting demeanor have made his radio \nprogram a must-do for both regional and national leaders. Each weekday, \nhe challenges his guests and call-in audience alike to explore a \nvariety of current and emerging topics relevant to our daily lives. As \ngood a listener as he is an interviewer, Nnamdi opens our consciousness \nto new ideas. He is so highly skilled that the Washington Post has \ncalled him, ``maybe the best interviewer in town.''\n  Locally, Nnamdi has become one of the foremost experts on the \npolitical and social scenes of Annapolis, Richmond, and Washington, DC. \nOn Fridays, 1 hour of his show is renamed ``The Politics Hour'' while \nhe opens his airwaves to the region's elected officials, community \nactivists and local leaders. I personally have looked forward to \njoining Nnamdi for his show time and again.\n  As Kojo Nnamdi enters his second decade broadcasting at WAMU 88.5, I \ntake great pride in joining with countless others in our community and \nacross the Nation in congratulating him on this milestone. I listen \nwith anticipation for his next topic and his next guest who will help \nopen our minds and further our dialog.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8120-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARTIN GUITAR FACTORY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr President, today I congratulate the Martin \nGuitar Factory, in Nazareth, PA, on celebrating 175 years of successful \nguitar making. C.F. Martin & Co. has continually produced the highest \nlevel of craftsmanship, design, quality, and tone for the acoustic \nguitar for over a century and a half.\n  Established in 1833, the Martin Guitar Factory has been at the \nleading edge of guitar manufacturing for six generations. The founder \nof Martin Guitar, Christian Frederick Martin, Sr., was born in 1796 in \nGermany and began the craft at the young age of 15. Since the guild \nsystem in Germany limited the opportunities for guitar production, C.F. \nMartin, Sr., decided to emigrate to the United States in the 1830s. \nMartin Guitar set up shop in New York City for 6 years before finally \nsettling in the Lehigh Valley in 1839. After a century and a half of \nsuccess in guitar manufacturing, C.F. Martin & Co. continues to produce \nthe finest quality American acoustic guitars today. Each year, Martin \nGuitar manufactures and ships approximately 170,000 guitars all over \nthe world and welcomes over 21,000 visitors to its factory in Nazareth, \nNorthampton County. Martin Guitars have been played by some of our \nNation's greats, such as Elvis and Johnny Cash, and are still being \nplayed today by Eric Clapton, Beck, Willie Nelson, and John Mayer, to \nname just a few.\n  In addition to Martin Guitar's accomplishments and I believe this is \nkey, the company has demonstrated incredible staying power through six \ngenerations. C.F. Martin & Co. is the oldest surviving manufacturer of \nguitars in the world and is thus an extraordinary model to other \nbusinesses. I am proud to say that C.F. Martin & Co. has long been and \nwill remain a vital staple of the Lehigh Valley.\n  Special recognition for this anniversary belongs to the sixth \ngeneration chairman and CEO Mr. Christian F. Martin IV, and the hard-\nworking staff of Martin Guitar, for continuing the long standing \ntradition of crafting America's finest acoustic guitars. It is with \ngreat pride that I congratulate the Martin Guitar Factory on 175 \noutstanding years of achievement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8120-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT FULWIDER\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I congratulate Mr. Bob \nFulwider as he nears the end of his term as the 103rd chairman of the \nNation's largest insurance association, the Independent Insurance \nAgents & Brokers of America, IIABA. Mr. Fulwider was elected to the \nIIABA's executive committee in 2002, and was installed as the \nassociation's chairman last September.\n  Founded in 1896, IIABA, or the Big ``I'' as it is better known, is \nthe Nation's oldest and largest association of independent insurance \nagents and brokers, representing a network of more than 300,000 agents, \nbrokers, and their employees. During his term as chairman of the Big \n``I'', Bob Fulwider has been a leader on a number of issues for the \nassociation including regulatory reform and natural disaster insurance. \nPerhaps most importantly, during this year's consideration of the farm \nbill and specifically its impact on crop insurance, Mr. Fulwider was a \nforceful advocate for his association who led with professionalism and \ndetermination.\n  Mr. Fulwider has over his lifetime built two financial and insurance \nplanning service businesses throughout eastern Iowa including West \nLiberty and West Branch, IA. Mr. Fulwider is also a former national \nboard director and a past president of the Independent Insurance Agents \nof Iowa, IIAI.\n  Mr. Fulwider has been honored with several national and state awards. \nHe has been honored with two IIABA Presidential Citations--in 1987 and \n1994. He was named IIAI Agent of the Year in 1993 and received the \nassociation's ``Mr. Chairman'' Award in the same year. He also received \nthe Agent of the Year Award in 1990. He is the first honoree in the \nIowa association's history to receive the award twice. In 2002, Mr. \nFulwider was honored with the Sydney O. Smith Award, IIABA's highest \nindividual government affairs honor. In 2003 he was named to the Iowa \nInsurance Hall of Fame.\n  In addition, Mr. Fulwider is extremely active in his community. After \ngraduating from Iowa State University, he taught in Iowa public high \nschools and served on the Iowa State University faculty prior to \nentering the insurance business. Mr. Fulwider is past president of the \nMuscatine County Economic Development Council and training director and \nboard member of the Iowa Council--Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Fulwider \nhas served as Scoutmaster of his local troop for 25 years and has \nreceived numerous Scouting awards including the Silver Beaver. \nAdditionally, he is active in his church and Masonic Lodge.\n  I want to thank Bob Fulwider for his work with the IIABA over the \nyears and for his commitment to his profession, his community, and our \nstate of Iowa. His efforts are greatly appreciated. I am proud to count \nBob as both a constituent and a friend. I wish him, his wife Jan, and \ntheir family all the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8120-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8120-S8121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate the American Society of Hematology, which is observing its \n50th anniversary this year, and to salute the advances hematologists \nhave been able to make\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nin biomedical research, largely as a result of the funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health that many of us in the Senate fight for \neach year.\n  The American Society of Hematologists--ASH--represents more than \n15,000 clinicians and scientists committed to the study and treatment \nof blood and blood-related diseases, including blood cancers, bleeding \nand clotting diseases, and hereditary disorders. Hematologists have \nmade remarkable contributions to the advancement of biomedical research \nand are active participants in NIH biomedical research programs, \nrecipients of NIH grants, and contributors to NIH's biomedical research \naccomplishments. I am pleased to note that some of this groundbreaking \nresearch is being conducted in Iowa by ASH member Dr. George Weiner and \nhis team at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of \nIowa.\n  Hematologists have been at the forefront of some of the most \nremarkable advancements in medicine over the past half century. ASH \nmembers have turned Federal research dollars into effective treatments \nfor diseases that were once disabling or a death sentence, and have \nbeen pioneers in the fields of bone marrow transplantation and gene \ntherapy.\n  By the NIH's own estimates, the overall 5-year survival rate for \nchildhood cancers rose to nearly 80 percent during the 1990s from under \n60 percent in the 1970s. A diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia \nwas fatal for every child who developed it in the 1960s, but today, \nafter new combinations of drugs were developed by hematology \nresearchers, and aggressive treatment of the brain and spinal fluid \nwere incorporated, approximately 80 percent of children with the \ndisease are cured.\n  NIH also notes that the emergence of new, more precise ways to treat \ncancer, such as drugs that target abnormal proteins in cancer cells, \nhave contributed to a dramatic increase in the average life expectancy \nfor Americans. Again, hematologists have been at the forefront of these \ndiscoveries.\n  Acute promyelocytic leukemia--APL--was once described as the most \nmalignant form of acute leukemia. Today, the treatment of APL has \nbecome a model for treating cancer with targeted therapy. In \ncombination with chemotherapy, targeted treatment has significantly \nimproved survival in patients with APL and raised remission rates to \nabout 85 percent.\n  In the 1950s the only treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia--\nCML--was radiation of the spleen, granting patients about 30 months of \nsurvival. Analysis of the CML-specific chromosomal translocation \nallowed the development of imatinib, a gene-targeting drug that is the \nparadigm for a new generation of ``smart'' drugs that allow disease-\nspecific therapy. Using this non toxic oral drug, more than 75 percent \nof patients diagnosed with CML achieve a durable, complete cytogenetic \nremission.\n  I have consistently fought for increases to NIH annual budget, and \nwill continue to due so to ensure that hematologists and researchers \naround the Nation continue to have the resources necessary to lead in \nnew fields of biomedical investigation and translate new scientific \ndiscoveries into improved diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive \nstrategies.\n  Again, I salute the American Society of Hematology for a magnificent \nfirst 50 years. With continued NIH funding, I am confident that \nhematologists will have even greater successes in treating and \neliminating blood diseases over the next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8121-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8121-S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING ALLAMAKEE COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun.

That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin Grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Allamakee Community School District received a 2004 Harkin Grant \ntotaling $394,382 for a collaborative project addressing a myriad of \nneeds throughout the community. After eight failed efforts to pass a \nreferendum to make improvements to the high school, it was time to \nthink outside the box.\n  Community leaders established the PRIDE committee to undertake a \ncomprehensive planning process that looked at the needs of the school \ndistrict as well as those of the community. The result was a proposal \nto renovate the high school and build an addition to the existing \nbuilding. The committee also recommended building a new facility across \nthe street from the high school to house a satellite center for \nNortheast Iowa Community College, a community wellness center, a senior \ncenter, and a youth center. This project was a unique partnership \nbetween the school district, city, county and community college. And \ntheir hard work paid off with the passage of a $10 million bond issue \napproved by 78 percent of the voters.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the patrons, staff, administration, and governance \nin the Allamakee Community School District.\n  I would like to recognize a number of individuals for their \noutstanding leadership on the project, in particular, members of the \nAllamakee PRIDE Committee--Michael Meyers from Veterans Memorial \nHospital, Dave Martin from Martin Funeral Home, Dennis Lyons from \nFarmers and Merchant's Bank, Joe Cunningham from the Waukon City \nCouncil, Patty Fosaaen from the Allamakee Board of Education, \nsuperintendent of schools David Herold and former superintendent of \nschools John Speer.

Finally, I would recognize some of the personnel \nresponsible for grant writing and for the bond referendum--Safe \nSchools/Healthy Students project director Barb Winters, elementary \nprincipal Ann Hart, Gail Prestemon from Waukon State Bank, Mary Jo \nMeyer from Farm Bureau Financial Services and Allamakee Community \nSchool District librarian Linda Groe.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin School Grant Program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities.

We have to do better.\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Allamakee Community School District.

That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Independence Community School District received two Harkin grants \ntotaling $450,000. A 1999 fire safety grant for $100,000 was used to \ninstall smoke detectors and replace doors at the high school. A 2005 \ngrant totaling $350,000 was used to help build the Early Childhood \nCenter to provide five classrooms for prekindergarten programs. This \nschool is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nit is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Independence Community School District. In particular, I would like \nto recognize the leadership of the board of education, President Dawnye \nSturtz, Vice President K.C.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nhonor today the memory of Walter C. ``Bud'' O'Meara, a teacher, coach, \nand good friend who passed away on August 3, 2008. I am deeply saddened \nby Walter's death and will keep his friends and family in my thoughts \nduring this difficult time.\n  Growing up in my hometown of Stamford, CT, Walter spent most of his \nfree time at the local YMCA, where he developed a passion for sports. \nWhile attending Stamford High School--SHA--in the 1930s, Walter was \ncaptain of the basketball team and an all state quarterback. His \nabilities on the football field earned him a scholarship to Notre Dame, \nthe most storied program in the history of college football, where he \nplayed under Coach Elmer Layden, one of the Four Horsemen.\n  After graduating from Notre Dame, Walter joined the U.S. Navy, where \nhe would become a lieutenant in the Naval Air Corps. While in the Navy, \nWalter married his wife, Grace, whom he had met on a blind date. They \nwould remain married until Grace's death in 2005. As a member of Air \nGroup 19, Walter flew bombers in the Pacific Combat Zone during the \nSecond World War and was awarded the Air Medal for his service. Walter \nwould keep in touch with his friends from Air Group 19 throughout his \nlife.\n  After the war, Walter returned to SHS as a teacher and coach. In \n1958, he was named head football coach, and proceeded to lead Stamford \nHigh to back-to-back State championships in 1958 and 1959. In addition \nto his duties as football coach, Walter also coached American Legion \nBaseball for 9 years. Again, Walter proved adept at getting the most \nout of his athletes, producing five State championship teams, and two \nregional champions.\n  While his teams' accomplishments on the field are certainly \nimpressive, Coach O'Meara's greatest contribution to Stamford High was \nthe constant source of friendship and support he provided his students. \nYears later, his players still fondly recall the influence he had on \nthem not just on the playing field but in life as well. When I attended \nSHS, all students, whether athletes or not, knew that Coach O'Meara was \nsomeone they could approach whenever they needed assistance.\n  When he retired from coaching, Walter continued to serve as an \nadministrator at SHS and managed the Roxbury Swimming and Tennis Club \nfor over 25 years. He also worked as a professional football scout for \n9 years.\n  However busy Walter was, he always made time for his family and \nfriends. Those who knew him best said that no matter his professional \nsuccess, his greatest pride was reserved for his 6 daughters, 11 \ngrandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.\n  While I will miss my good friend Walter O'Meara, I take solace that \nhis example will live on in all of us who were lucky to have known \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8124-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNUAL DICK LUGAR FITNESS FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to share my \ngratitude for the remarkable work of the students and staff at \nIndianapolis's Butler University over our 30-year partnership in \nencouraging fitness and health awareness in central Indiana.\n  This Saturday, September 13, 2008, I will have the privilege of \njoining my friends and fellow Hoosiers at the 30th Annual Dick Lugar \nCommunity Walk, Run and Health Fair, held on the attractive grounds of \nButler University. This festival was inaugurated in May of 1979 in \norder to highlight the positive benefits of fitness and nutrition to \nmembers of the local community. From the very beginning, this \ninitiative was designed to appeal to a wide spectrum of people. Youth \nand families were encouraged to participate in an effort to reach out \nbeyond the normal universe of running enthusiasts and to capitalize on \nthose who could serve as a model for young people. With the inclusion \nof the health fair our partnership strove to engage older adults as \nwell. And in 1983, the festivities began to include a Health and \nFitness Award, given in recognition of individuals and organizations \nthat have made exemplary contributions to the community in these \nimportant areas.\n  The Fitness Festival remains an event I look forward to with \nexcitement each year. The running and race-walk competitions, the \nhealth fair with local experts and organizations in attendance, and the \ngeneral fellowship all promise to be especially memorable in this \nsignal year. Accordingly, I would like to take special care in \nhighlighting those most responsible for the festival's perennial \nsuccess.\n  Butler University and its dedicated president, Dr. Bobby Fong, \ndeserve considerable praise. The university's eagerness to not only \nhost, but embrace this opportunity to promote the benefits of a fit and \nhealthy lifestyle reminds me of why Hoosiers are so proud of our \ncolleges and universities' roles in improving the quality of life for \nindividuals throughout Indiana. Thanks must also be given to the Butler \nstudents and faculty, and the community members who volunteer as \norganizers and race workers; the individuals who devote their \nexperience and expertise at the health fair booths; the city of \nIndianapolis and Marion County for logistical support; other supporting \norganizations, whose generosity and commitment to health awareness in \nthe Indianapolis community is highly commendable; and the thousands of \nindividuals who have participated in the Fitness Festival over the \ncourse of its life.\n  It is important that as citizens we do what we can at the Federal, \nState, and community levels to promote the benefits of leading healthy \nlifestyles. This auspicious occasion provides a wonderful opportunity \nto commend Butler University for its efforts in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8124-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8124-S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MISSOURI SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.

The University Missourian published \nits first issue that day, exemplifying the school's ``Missouri Method'' \nof hands-on training at multiple professional media outlets affiliated \nwith the school. In fact, the school still operates the only network-\naffiliated television newsroom in the country designed as a teaching \nfacility.\n  The school's pioneering endeavors continued in 1921 and 1934 with the \nawarding of the first master's and doctoral degrees in journalism. And \nnow more than 20,000 alumni from all over the world have become leaders \nin journalism, mass communication, and academe.\n  The free press plays an integral role in our society, as a champion \nof freedom and watchdog of liberty. The achievements of this school are \na mark of pride for its students and faculty, for Missouri, and the \nNation. I congratulate the school on the celebration of its 100th \nanniversary and look forward to future groundbreaking endeavors from \nthe school's leadership, faculty, alumni, and students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8125-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE MALCOLM GROW MEDICAL CENTER\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the great \nservices that the Malcolm Grow Medical Center has done for this \ncountry. Malcolm Grow celebrated its 50th anniversary on July 31, 2008, \nand in those 50 years, it has provided medical care for those serving \nin the U.S. Air Force as well as their families. They follow in the \nproud tradition of medicine which their namesake developed.\n  MG Malcolm C. Grow was the first surgeon general of the U.S. Air \nForce, serving from July 1 to November 30, 1949. In 1943, General Grow \nreceived the Legion of Merit for developing body armor to protect \ncombat crews. His research led the way in developing a light body armor \nand steel helmet that saved many lives and improved our fighters' \nmorale.\n  Today there are 372,200 eligible beneficiaries within 40 miles of the \nMalcolm Grow Medical Center. On a typical day, Malcolm Grow providers \nsee 930 outpatients, 90 dental patients, 72 emergency room patients and \nhas 5 inpatients. Staff complete seven surgical procedures and perform \ntwo deliveries. The Aeromedical Staging Flight takes care of 30 \npatients transitioning through the National Capital Region and carries \nout 1,963 pharmacy procedures. In 2007, Malcolm Grown oversaw over \n10,400 patient and attendant movements alone.\n  General Grow's innovative spirit has lived on at the Malcolm Grow \nMedical Center as it celebrates its 50th birthday. They are the East \nCoast hub for aeromedical evacuation and provide health care services \nto our Nation's top leaders. I am proud to honor the great contribution \nwhich this facility has made to our service members, our Armed Forces, \nand our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8125-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8125-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8125-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMESSAGE STATING THAT THE STATUTORY PREREQUISITE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IS \nNO LONGER SATISFIED, AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 123 B.

A bill to provide for the rescission of funds made available \nfor fiscal year 2009 for Iraq reconstruction; to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, legislation I am introducing today will \nrescind $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2009 funding for Iraq's \nreconstruction.\n  As you know, on the first of this month, U.S. forces handed security \ncontrol of the Anbar province to the Iraqi government. This was an area \nthat was considered all but lost to al-Qaida just 2 years ago, but as a \nresult of the surge and related policies, today the Iraqis are able to \ntake over the lead role for security in the province. This not only is \na shining example of the success of the surge, but also shows the great \nimprovements that the Iraqi government has made since the country's \nhistoric elections in 2005.\n  In fact, I believe these gains are so significant that it's time for \nthe Iraqis to foot the bill for their reconstruction.\n  From 2005 to 2007, the Iraqi government brought in an estimated $96 \nbillion--94 percent of that coming from oil revenues--and a cumulative \nbudget surplus of $29 billion. An August 5, 2008, report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office estimated that in 2008 the Iraqis will \ngenerate up to $86 billion, with a surplus of up to $50 billion. This \nmeans that, by the end of this year, the Iraqis will have realized a \nbudget surplus of up to $79 billion.\n  I have long been calling for the Iraqi government to assume more \nresponsibility for its own reconstruction costs. Just as they continue \nto take the lead in securing their country as the situation on the \nground improves, I once again call on the Iraqis to take more \nresponsibility for their country's reconstruction. The Iraqis have made \ngreat progress in developing their oil infrastructure, and they are now \nin a position to assume greater financial responsibility of their \neconomic future.\n  There is no reason that we can't begin to return American tax dollars \nto the U.S. Treasury. That is why today I am introducing legislation \nthat would rescind more than $1 billion in funding that has been \nappropriated for future Iraqi reconstruction.\n  My legislation will rescind approximately $1.1 billion in Iraqi \nreconstruction funding appropriated by Congress for fiscal year 2009. \nIt is important to note that this legislation will not affect any of \nthe funding for our soldiers who are putting themselves in harm's way \nevery day. Nor will it affect on-going projects, nor any money that has \nalready been obligated.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Iraqis in the \nimprovements they have made by allowing them to take control of their \nown reconstruction. For the people of Iraq, this is a matter of self-\ndetermination and self-reliance. For American taxpayers, it's a matter \nof fairness.\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to extend the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer \nprograms, to increase the allocation of Federal agency grants for those \nprograms, to add water, energy, transportation, and domestic security \nrelated research to the list of topics deserving special consideration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we need to take strong steps to promote \njob creation, innovation and sustainable long term economic development \nand there is no better way to do this than by stimulating and \nsupporting small business innovation, especially in areas of national \npriority. As part of this effort, today I am introducing the \nStrengthening Our Economy Through Small Business Innovation Act of \n2008.\n  Job growth, innovation and economic development are driven by our \nsmall businesses. Small businesses also tend to be based in our cities \nand communities and so they are major contributors to our local \neconomies. Half of our county's payroll jobs and most of our new job \nopportunities are provided by small businesses. Small businesses are \nproven innovators and drive commercialization of cutting edge \ntechnologies. They also are effective partners with universities to \nenhance product creation, develop university income and attract \nuniversity graduates and faculty through increased innovative job \nopportunities.\n  Over the last 25 years, through the Small Business Innovation and \nResearch program, SBIR, and, more recently, Small Business Technology \nTransfer program, STTR, up to 2.5 percent and 0.3 percent, \nrespectively, of Federal R funds from 11 Federal agencies have been \nspecifically allocated to our Nation's small businesses to fund \ninnovation.\n  My bill does three things. First, it extends the SBIR and STTR \nprograms for a further 14 years so that small businesses, as well as \nuniversities and non-profit research organizations that collaborate \nwith small businesses, can continue to leverage Federal research and \ndevelopment funding.\n  Second, it significantly increases the allocation of funds and the \nawards from large Federal research and development budgets to small \nbusinesses through the SBIR and STTR programs. It would increase the \nSBIR allocation from its current 2.5 percent to 10 percent and the STTR \nallocation from 0.3 percent to 1.0 percent over a 3 year period. It \nwould increase SBIR phase I awards from $100,000 to $300,000 and phase \nII awards from $750,000 to $2.2 million. Third, it identifies specific \nfunding priorities for energy innovation; safe and secure water; \ndomestic security; and transportation.\n  Not only are small businesses our major source of employment, they \nemploy about one third of our country's scientists and engineers and \ngenerate more patents on a per capita basis than large businesses and \nuniversities. This is simply a good investment in sustained job \ncreation and innovation.\n  Studies by both the independent Government Accountability Office and \nThe National Research Council have established that these programs are \nvery effective in addressing their stated purposes. The NRC's \ncomprehensive study, which was completed last year, found that the SBIR \nprogram ``is sound in concept and effective in practice.'' It also \nfound that the program was ``stimulating technological innovation''; \n``linking universities to the public and private markets''; \n``increasing private sector commercialization of innovations'' at an \n``impressive'' rate; and ``providing widely distributed support for \ninnovation activity.'' The study concluded that:\n\n       [T]he program is proving effective in meeting Congressional \n     objectives. It is increasing innovation, encouraging \n     participation by small companies in R, providing support \n     for small firms owned by minorities and women, and resolving \n     research questions for mission agencies in a cost effective \n     manner. Should the Congress wish to provide additional funds \n     for the program in support of these objectives, those funds \n     could be employed effectively by the nation's SBIR.\n\n  The NRC's study found that universities and other non-profit research \ninstitutions will benefit significantly from the increase in both the \nSBIR and the STTR programs. The STTR allocation increase will directly \nbenefit universities and efforts to bring university-based research \ninto the commercial marketplace, as a partnership with a non-profit \nresearch institution, such as a university, is a requirement of all \nSTTR award recipients.\n  The NRC study also found that many of the small businesses that \nreceive SBIR funding are rooted in the university infrastructure so \nthere will be synergies as investigators and graduates from \nuniversities, will have opportunities to be part of commercial \ndevelopments. More than \\2/3\\ of SBIR companies report that at least \none founder was previously an academic. About one-third of SBIR company \nfounders were most recently employed as academics before founding the \ncompany. Over a third of SBIR projects cite direct university \ninvolvement with: 27 percent of projects having university faculty as \ncontractors on the project; 17 percent using universities themselves as \nsubcontractors; and 15 percent employing graduate students.\n  In its report accompanying reauthorization legislation, the Senate \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee recently concluded that:\n\n       increases in the SBIR allocation will invest money in \n     research, contracting, internships, and other collaborative \n     activities done with universities, with the contracting and \n     patenting activities with SBIR companies being a sizable \n     source of revenue for universities as well. The university-\n     industry partnerships that SBIR creates are crucial in that \n     they provide an applied research and commercialization focus \n     that otherwise likely would not be present in university \n     research. More specifically, the partnerships are important \n     in exposing faculty and the next generation of scientists and \n     engineers to commercial research and development. SBIR \n     businesses provide graduate and undergraduate students with \n     hands-on experience and job opportunities that universities \n     would be unable to provide alone.\n\n  Our country faces some major challenges in which targeted research \nand development will be critical. Congress, with non-partisan expert \nguidance, has a role to play in guiding our national research and \ndevelopment priorities and, in this case, stimulating small business \ninnovation in specific areas of critical national need. The National \nAcademies of Science and other independent government research \norganizations provide us with carefully researched and considered \nrecommendations on how we can address these priorities, so my bill \ndraws on their recommendations to develop innovative energy \ntechnologies; enhance water quality and security; strengthen domestic \nsecurity; and address transportation priorities. I urge my colleagues \nto support my legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8134-S8135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Res. 647\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in his or \n     her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2008, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2008, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8141-5", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8141-S8142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 649\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally-appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with ADHD have a first-degree relative \n     with past or present ADHD, and that approximately \\1/2\\ of \n     parents who had ADHD have a child with the disorder, \n     suggesting that ADHD runs in families and inheritance is an \n     important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than \\1/2\\ of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 18, 2008, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8142-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 620) designating the week of September 14-20, \n2008, as National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week, to raise \npublic awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney disease, and to \nfoster understanding of the impact polycystic kidney disease has on \npatients and future generations of their families, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 620\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PICD''), one \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the United States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease \n     that has a devastating impact, in both human and economic \n     terms, on people of all ages, and affects equally people of \n     all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and \n     income levels;\n       Whereas this devastating disease comes in 2 hereditary \n     forms, with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease \n     (ADPKD) affecting 1 in 500 worldwide, including 600,000 PKD \n     patients in the United States, according to prevalence \n     estimates in the National Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas families in which 1 or both parents have ADPKD have \n     a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to each of \n     their children;\n       Whereas autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease \n     (ARPKD), a rarer form of PKD, affects 1 in 20,000 live births \n     and too often leads to death early in life;\n       Whereas parents who carry the gene for ARPKD pass on the \n     disease to 25 percent of the children the parents conceive;\n       Whereas, in addition to patients directly affected by PKD, \n     countless friends, loved ones, family members, colleagues, \n     and caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     treatment or cure, is the leading genetic cause of kidney \n     failure in the United States and the fourth leading cause \n     overall;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or to avoid following good health management \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and the resulting consequences of depression due \n     to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and. cures for disease and would \n     like to see results from investments in research conducted by \n     the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from such \n     initiatives as the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the third week of September, and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 14-20, 2008, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities, to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease, and to foster understanding of the impact of the \n     disease on patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url":

Res. 622\n\n       Designating the week beginning September 7, 2008, as \n     ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     Week''.\n       Whereas there are 103 historically Black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities \n     provide the quality education essential to full participation \n     in a complex, highly technological society;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities have a \n     rich heritage and have played a prominent role in the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities have \n     allowed many underprivileged students to attain their full \n     potential through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically Black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 7, 2008, as \n     ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     Week''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs to demonstrate support for \n     historically Black colleges and universities in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8142-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8142-S8143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 110-21\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on September 8, 2008, by the President \nof the United States: Hague Convention on International Recovery of \nChild Support and Family Maintenance, Treaty Document No. 110-21. I \nfurther ask consent that the treaty be considered as having been read \nthe first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Hague Convention on the International \nRecovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance, \nadopted at The Hague on November 23, 2007, and signed by the United \nStates on that same date, with a view to receiving the advice and \nconsent of the Senate to ratification, subject to the reservations\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\nand declaration set forth in the report of the Secretary of State. The \nreport of the Secretary of State, which includes an overview of the \nConvention, is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The United States supported the development of the Convention as a \nmeans of promoting the establishment and enforcement of child support \nobligations in cases where the custodial parent and child are in one \ncountry and the non-custodial parent is in another. The Convention \nprovides for a comprehensive system of cooperation between the child \nsupport authorities of contracting states, establishes procedures for \nthe recognition and enforcement of foreign child support decisions, and \nrequires effective measures for the enforcement of maintenance \ndecisions. It is estimated that there are over 15 million child support \ncases in the United States and that an increasing number of these cases \nwill involve parties who live in different nations. United States \ncourts already enforce foreign child support orders, while many \ncountries do not do so in the absence of a treaty obligation. \nRatification of the Convention will thus mean that more U.S. children \nwill receive the financial support they need from both their parents.\n  The Department of State and the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which leads the Federal child support program, support the \nearly ratification of this Convention. The American Bar Association and \nthe National Child Support Enforcement Association have also expressed \nsupport for the Convention. Although some new implementing legislation \nwill be required, the proposed Convention is largely consistent with \ncurrent U.S. Federal and State law. Cases under the Convention will be \nhandled through our existing comprehensive child support system, which \ninvolves both Federal and State law. The Departments of State and \nHealth and Human Services have been working on preparation of the \nnecessary amendments to Federal law to ensure compliance with the \nConvention, and that legislation will soon be ready for submission to \nthe Congress for its consideration. The National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws has worked closely with the \nDepartments of State and Health and Human Services to develop the \nnecessary amendments to uniform State child support legislation.\n  The Convention requires only two contracting states for entry into \nforce. No state has yet ratified the Convention. Early U.S. \nratification would therefore likely hasten the Convention's entry into \nforce. This would be in the interests of U.S. families, as it would \nenable them to receive child support owed by debtors abroad more \nquickly and reliably. I therefore recommend that the Senate give prompt \nand favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification, subject to the reservations and declaration \ndescribed in the accompanying report of the Secretary of State, at the \nearliest possible date.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, September 8, 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/08/senate-section/article/S8143-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2008\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.
