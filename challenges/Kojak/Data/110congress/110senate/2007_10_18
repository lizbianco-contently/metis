Mr. President, today, I rise to welcome Rev.

He has served his parish for the last 31 years. Early on, \nhis church had just a few hundred members. He has seen kids in his \nparish grow up to have kids of their own. Now his congregation is well \nover 2,600 strong.\n  As many in Appleton will tell you, Reverend Ellisen's ministry has \ntouched so many families beyond his church's walls. He has been a \ntireless advocate for cancer research, treatment, and education. His \nwork as an ambassador and fundraiser for the American Cancer Society \nhas taken him to every corner of our State and every corridor of \nCongress. His message is unwavering: If we work together, we can beat \nthis terrible disease.\n  Yet he may be best known in the community for helping comfort the \nterminally ill. Through his work with the Visiting Nurse Association, \nhe started the first hospice program in Appleton many years ago.\n  I had the privilege of introducing Reverend Ellisen on the Senate \nfloor in 1997. Much has changed in the world, but he has remained the \nhumble, compassionate person I met a decade ago. And, thankfully, his \nimportant work endures.\n  We need to hear his hopeful invocation today. I thank Reverend \nEllisen and his family for joining us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13030-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk this morning on the much-\ntalked-about subject of SCHIP. In this Chamber over the last several \ndays--and I would say all over the Nation--there has been a lot of \nconversation about the future of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and whether this side will budge or that side will nudge the \nother one or who will blink first.\n  Clearly, we are at an impasse. Today, the President's veto of this \nbill--which will enlarge Government by $35 billion--will be sustained \nin the House, I believe. Then we will find ourselves at a place where \nwe have to regroup and decide how to proceed in reauthorizing this very \nimportant program. It is an important program, and a program so many of \nAmerica's children have benefited from, and one for which I believe we \nneed to find a way to move forward.\n  I want to add my voice to those who have called for the program's \nreauthorization. This is a program that is working. It works in the \nState of Florida. It is a program that helps children. I know a lot of \nFlorida children have been helped by it. So we have to find a way we \ncan come together in the spirit of the program so every child who needs \nhealth care has the needed access to health care.\n  We should take great care, however, to avoid switching SCHIP from \nbeing a program aimed at helping poor children to a program that moves \nus toward a Government-sponsored, Government-run health care system. \nThat would not serve the people in the program, and it would not serve \nthe greater cause of reforming the bigger problem we have, and which we \nalso have to address, which is our entire health care system.\n  The bill the President vetoed would have allowed coverage to the \npoint where we would have essentially encouraged families who are today \nreceiving coverage through private insurance to drop that insurance in \nfavor of Government-sponsored health care coverage. I do not think that \nis the way to move forward with health care reform. I do not think that \npolicy would lower health care costs or increase the access to quality \nhealth care. Both are important goals.\n  In talking with people in my State of Florida, they want to see SCHIP \nreauthorized. They want to help poor children who need health care. \nThey understand the debate we are having, and they want a better \nalternative than anything that is on the table right now. So we are at \nan impasse. But I think we can find common ground. A real compromise \nneeds to be reached, one that keeps the spirit of SCHIP, one that adds \nprovisions to help find children currently eligible for assistance and \nsigns them up for insurance.\n  We need a compromise that does not simply broaden the program's \neligibility so people in private health insurance are forced to move to \nGovernment-sponsored health insurance because an employer sees an \nopportunity to save money. That is why later today I will introduce an \nalternative SCHIP reauthorization program composed of three elements--a \nfull reauthorization of SCHIP, a child health care tax credit, and an \naggressive outreach program to ensure all children eligible for the \nprogram have the opportunity to sign up for the insurance.\n  The first element enacts a full reauthorization of SCHIP, where we \ncontinue to cover children in families with incomes at or below 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  The second element of my proposal advances tax credits to families \nwith incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the poverty level. If a \nfamily does not have insurance, a credit provides the resources \nnecessary to go out and purchase health insurance. Families would have \nthe ability to purchase health insurance, health care coverage tailored \nto their children's unique needs.\n  The third element would enhance outreach for children who are \ncurrently eligible for SCHIP coverage but who are not currently \nenrolled.\n  It is estimated between 500,000 and 1.5 million children who are \ntoday eligible for SCHIP are not enrolled simply because families do \nnot know the program is available to them.\n  Make no mistake: The underlying debate is not whether we are going to \nprovide health insurance for our Nation's children. We all agree that \nour society can ill afford to not take care of children in need. The \ndispute is how are we best to achieve that goal.\n\n  One of the major differences between the vetoed SCHIP program and my \nalternative is that the vetoed bill created a newly eligible population \nand moved them into a system of Government health insurance. My \nproposal is patient focused. It retains for families the choice of \nproviders and practitioners and gives parents the resources necessary \nto add their children to their existing health care plan.\n  Where our proposals are similar is in the number of children we \ninsure. Under my proposal, 10 million children would have access to \nhealth insurance. That is the same number who would have been covered \nby the vetoed bill.\n  It is essential we come together as Republicans and Democrats to talk \nabout a viable alternative, about how we can get this done, about \nsomething that would ensure the reauthorization of SCHIP and that \nexpands rather than diminishes private health care coverage for \nchildren.\n  I would be willing to continue to discuss this issue in a way that \nallows us to debate whether in the reauthorization part of this bill--\nthe $5 billion probably is not enough to cover all of the children who \nneed to be insured under this program. I think a larger number than \nthat $5 billion is necessary, probably closer to $10 billion.\n  But once we did that, then how do we go about covering that 200 \npercent to 300 percent of poverty--those working families who still \ncannot find a way to insure their children without Government \nassistance? We would do that through a tax credit. That tax credit \nwould also be beneficial. It would be a way of allowing them to \ncontinue to have a private health care option, which I think is always \npreferable.\n  The insurance marketplace would adjust and continue to innovate in a \nway that I think would give us a much stronger, much better health care \nsystem for the children of America who so much need insurance for \nthemselves and for us to be sure we have a healthy future for them.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the coming \ndays\n\n[[Page S13031]]\n\nto strike a middle ground, to strike a compromise on SCHIP, to be sure \nwe come together to let the people of America know this Congress, \nRepublicans and Democrats, can come together to work together on \nsomething as important as the health of our children. I look forward to \nthe days ahead, as we continue to discuss this important topic, and I \nlook forward to having others join this effort.\n  I am very gratified that quite a number of the Members of the House \nhave adopted this as their idea and are going forward with this as a \nplan that may have viability, may be the answer. I hope an increasing \nnumber of Senators who are now not only looking at it but also finding \nfavor with it will create the kind of middle way that will allow us to \ncome together to find a solution and put this important issue back \nwhere it belongs: moving forward and taking care of the children of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida and many of my other colleagues in urging the sort of \nconsensus building, practical problem solving Senator Martinez is \ntalking about.\n  It is clear we are at a current impasse on the SCHIP debate. The \nversion that passed the Senate and passed the Congress has been vetoed \nby the President. It will be made even more clear in the next day or so \nthat veto will not be overridden.\n  I think what the American people want us to do is not talk endlessly, \ndebate endlessly, and simply try to score political points, but to come \ntogether around a practical compromise, a practical resolution that \nadvances health care, particularly for poor children.\n  So I join my colleague from Florida in urging us to do that. My ideas \nabout what that reasonable, practical compromise would be are very much \nlike his. I applaud Senator Martinez in terms of the ideas he has put \nforward to resolve this SCHIP debate.\n  I could not support the Senate Finance Committee version of the SCHIP \nbill. I could not support it for a very simple reason: I am all for the \nSCHIP program. I am all for covering poor children. I am not for \nexpanding that program well beyond the boundaries of poor kids so that \nit is a precursor, quite frankly, to government-run, government-\ndominated health care. I think that is a mistake. I think expanding a \nprogram such as this and actively pushing people off private insurance, \nwhich the Finance Committee version would do, is a big mistake and \nmoves us in the opposite direction of where we should be moving with \nregard to health care reform in this country.\n\n  Why do I say that about the Finance Committee bill? Well, for a \nsimple reason: It goes well beyond the original intent of SCHIP, which \nis to cover poor kids. It goes beyond that in several ways. First of \nall, it raises the general limit of eligibility from 200 percent of \npoverty to 300 percent of poverty. In the United States today, 300 \npercent of poverty is $62,000, a family income of $62,000. But, in \nfact, that limit is well above that in most cases. Why? Because under \nthe Finance Committee bill, States can define family income in \ninnovative ways. They can take out large expenditures such as tuition \nfrom family income, so we are not talking about gross family income of \n$62,000. Once you take out those major components, those major sources \nof spending of a family, you could easily be talking about a family \nincome of $80,000.\n  In addition to that, under the bill the administration--any \nadministration--would be urged, if not mandated, to grant waivers to \nStates in many cases to go well above even that 300-percent-plus line. \nSo clearly, you would dramatically expand the children and the families \ncovered under the program, and you would go well beyond what any \nreasonable person would define as the truly poor.\n  Now, why is this bad? Well, for one thing, you are crowding out \nfolks--pushing folks off--of private insurance. There have been several \nanalyses done of the Finance Committee bill which passed the Congress \nand which the President vetoed. Under those analyses of new enrollees, \nit is estimated that between 45 and 51 percent would be dropping \nprivate insurance to enroll in SCHIP. Now, is that the direction we \nwant to move in, encouraging folks who have private insurance to drop \nit, to flee private insurance to come under the care of the Government? \nI think that is the wrong direction to move in.\n  Beyond that, if you look at new eligibility groups--in other words, \nnot all new enrollees, but the new groups of people who would become \neligible under the bill--there is a 100-percent crowd-out effect. \nEverybody in those new groups would be dropping private insurance to \nenroll in SCHIP. Is that the direction we want to move in? I think not. \nWe talk about the problem of the uninsured in this country. Why do we \nwant to grow that problem versus solve it by encouraging people and \nhelping people keep their private insurance or get onto private \ncoverage? That is not the direction we want to move in.\n  I believe the direction we want to move in is to encourage coverage, \nto make it more available, to make it more affordable. That is the sort \nof solution that Senator Martinez and myself and others have been \ntalking about. That is why I support the McConnell-Lott SCHIP bill and \nsupport furthering the goal of health care for all American families \nwith tax credits that can make private coverage available and \naffordable.\n  Step 1: A real SCHIP reauthorization focused on poor kids. That is \nwhat the legislation I support does. That bill costs $8 billion in new \ncosts over 5 years, but those new costs are fully offset. That bill \nwould keep eligibility at 200 percent of the poverty line, but it would \nenroll many more new kids: 1.3 million by 2012 and 1.5 million new kids \nby 2017. It would also extend coverage to pregnant women and their \nchildren in the womb. That is important as well. That is a real \nreauthorization of the SCHIP program as it was originally designed and \nintended.\n  Now, is that good enough with regard to children's health care needs \nand families' health care needs? Absolutely not. There are other needs \nout there which we must address. Health care insurance isn't available, \nisn't affordable to enough folks. But rather than encouraging them to \nget on a government program and in half the cases actively pushing them \noff private insurance, why don't we help them stay on private insurance \nor obtain private insurance? That is the additional step we need to \ntake through tax credit or other legislation.\n  So again, I urge us to do what the American people want, which is not \nto simply argue, talk, debate, and try to score political points \nendlessly, but to come together around a real and valid and commonsense \ncompromise. That is what the American people want, so let's do it. That \ncompromise is clearly within striking distance if we have the political \nwill to come together around those ideas. Again, I believe the \nprinciple we should look at is a real reauthorization of SCHIP for poor \nchildren, supplemented with some additional help for those families \nthat need the help to stay on or to get on private insurance. I don't \nbelieve the path of the current SCHIP bill, which actively pushes \nfamilies off private insurance in so many cases, is the way to do it.\n  The proponents of that bill laud it because it would sign up 4.4 \nmillion new enrollees. Well, guess what: 4.4 million of that 2.4 \nmillion currently could have private insurance. Is that progress? Is \nthat a great accomplishment, to push off of private insurance 2.4 \nmillion and get them on a government program at the expense of the \ntaxpayer, when there is a better, cheaper alternative to help them stay \non private insurance, to help them have more choice and control and \nautonomy of their health care future? That is what the American people \nwant: More control, more choice, more autonomy, making good health \ninsurance available and affordable. Let's reauthorize SCHIP for the \ntruly poor and let's give them ways to make health care insurance \navailable and affordable through instruments such as tax credits.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I am greatly concerned. I had breakfast \nearly this morning, together with the Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of our committee, and two House senior Members of the Armed \nServices Committee--our annual meeting to work toward conference of the \nauthorization bill--Secretary Gates and the new Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, the Admiral. We addressed this issue of the Armenian resolution \nin the House. I do not in any way imply that the House has moved \nforward on that in an improper way. I don't want to get into the \npolitics. I simply say I perceive that this is changing, a changing \nissue in the House. It may well not be brought up. But the Secretary of \nDefense again, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, reiterated the \npossible impact of such a resolution, were it to be passed, upon our \noperating forces, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13032-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. President, it is my intent to oppose the non-binding resolution, \npassed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, that states that the \ndeportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire \nbetween 1915 and 1923, resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million of them, \namounted to genocide. While I deplore the killings of Armenians 92 \nyears ago by the Ottoman Empire, I urge my colleagues to consider the \ngrave consequences this may have on United States-Turkish relations and \non interests of the United States in Europe and the Middle East. Turkey \nhas been a steadfast ally and an indispensable friend in a critical \nregion of the world. If Turkey decides to respond negatively to our \npassage of this resolution, their decision could have lasting \nrepercussions for U.S. foreign policy interests in the region and \ncompromise our conduct of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The House resolution on the Armenian genocide appears at a \nparticularly sensitive point in United States-Turkish relations. The \npossibility of a Turkish incursion into northern Iraq must be an \nimmediate concern. There is no doubt that tensions are mounting along \nthe Iraqi-Turkish border. The United States has urged Turkey not to \nsend troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish \nseparatist rebels, who launched cross-border attacks against Turkish \ntargets. We must all urge Turkey and Iraq to seek a diplomatic solution \nto this crisis and the House resolution could undermine our diplomatic \nleverage.\n  Last week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that relations with \nTurkey are vital because 70 percent of the air cargo sent to U.S. \nforces in Iraq and 30 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. forces in \nIraq are flown through Turkey. Secretary Gates said that U.S. \ncommanders ``believe clearly that access to airfields and roads and so \non, in Turkey, would very much be put at risk if this resolution passes \nand the Turks react as strongly as we believe they will.''\n  I would like to share some important facts with my colleagues about \nhow Turkey is enabling our forces to achieve the mission we have given \nthem. Turkey has provided over 20,000 overflight clearances to U.S. \nmilitary and contracted aircraft since 2002. These flights carry \ncritical supplies and equipment to our forces in the field, currently \nincluding 95 percent of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, \nvehicles. These flights also include our medical evacuations from Iraq \nto Landstuhl, Germany. KC-135 tankers operating out of Incirlik, \nTurkey, have flown over 3,400 sorties and delivered 35 million gallons \nof fuel to U.S. fighter and transport aircraft on missions in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Finally, approximately 30 percent of the fuel and \n17 percent of the food used by U.S. and coalition forces enter Iraq \nfrom Turkey via the Habur Gate border crossing.\n  I would like to expand on these military concerns. The loss of access \nto critical air and ground lines of communication through Turkey to \nIraq and Afghanistan may result in: (1) temporary interruptions to the \nflow of cargo; (2) increased aircraft requirements; (3) increased \ncosts; and (4) longer transit times.\n  If these supplies need to be rerouted by ground through Kuwait, or \nJordan, we must be concerned about additional force protection issues. \nI am very troubled about our ground convoys that already move from \nKuwait to Iraq. They are high-value targets to insurgent groups. I \nvisited with a number of the convoy drivers on my last visit to Kuwait. \nWe have brave and experienced drivers leading these dangerous convoys, \nbut I am concerned about the heightened risks associated with an \nincrease in number of convoys or employing less experienced drivers on \nthe road to meet the new mission caused by the loss of access to lines \nof communications through Turkey.\n  There is one additional point I would like to make about the impact \non our operations in Iraq. I believe we should all be concerned about \nthe potential negative impact this resolution could have on the \neventual redeployment or withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. If Turkey \ndecides to cut off our lines of communications through their country \nthat redeployment or withdrawal would be more difficult.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues that there are over 1000 \nTurkish soldiers in Afghanistan. Turkey remains the only Muslim country \nin the International Security Assistance Forces, ISAF, in Afghanistan. \nTheir troops have significant responsibilities in ISAF which include \nproviding security in Kabul.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the consequences which may result \nfrom passing the House legislation on Armenian genocide and encourage \nthem to reject the measure. The passage of this measure would do great \nharm to our relations with a key ally in NATO, our interests in the \nregion, and our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  It is the House of Representatives' business. But I do believe here \nin the Senate we have to address that issue.\n  I do not in any way disparage or denigrate the seriousness of what \nhappened 92 years ago, at another time in history. But right now we \nhave young men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, and \nour coalition partners, risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe passage of this could have implications on nations in that region \nwhich I think could be detrimental and could put at risk the lives of \nour service persons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13032-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now back on the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and related agencies appropriations bill.\n  I thought I might recap for Senators where we are. We started \nyesterday. I thought we had a fairly productive afternoon. We, right \nnow, have five pending amendments that we are working on in terms of \noffsets. We have the Vitter amendment on drug reimportation. That \nlanguage we are just working on. There is no offset needed.\n  We have the amendment by Senator Dorgan on heart disease. We are \nagain looking at an offset there. We are working on that.\n  We have an amendment by Senator Thune on telehealth. Again, we are \nworking on trying to find the proper offsets.\n  We have another amendment by Senator Dorgan on a NAFTA study. That \nhas not been totally agreed to yet on the other side of the aisle.\n  We have an amendment by Senator Menendez on patient navigators. \nAgain, I think it is broadly supported. But, again, we are working on \ntrying to find an offset.\n  We adopted three amendments yesterday: the amendment by Senator \nFeinstein which was to set up a child abuse registry; the second \namendment was by Senator Smith which was a technical fix to the Garrett \nLee Smith suicide prevention bill; and then yesterday we accepted an \namendment by Senator McCaskill which provides for a link on the Web \nsites of all of the departments under our jurisdiction to the IG.\n  I am told we have about 30 amendments filed. We have 10 that we now \nhave worked on, so we are down to about 20 amendments. I hope we can \nagain move rapidly today and have people come over. I see people are \nhere waiting to offer amendments. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these three Members be \nrecognized to call up amendments and that the pending amendments all be \nset aside for this purpose. In this order it would be: Senator DeMint, \nSenator Dole, and Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3338 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3338.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3338 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Rangel Center for Public Service, \n     City College of New York, NY.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I actually wanted to bring up another \namendment to speak on briefly. If there is no objection, I would like \nto call up amendment No. 3340 at the same time. I will speak to both of \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3340\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, amendment No. 3340 is one we have already \nseen. It is a simple amendment that we all agree on. Both sides \naccepted it unanimously last week on the last appropriations bill that \nwe considered.\n  This is an amendment that prohibits Members of Congress from \npressuring Federal agencies to designate funds, what we call ``phone \nmarks'' to special projects back home.\n  All of us have worked real hard to create more transparency and \ndisclosure of earmarks. Last week we added to the last appropriations \nbill this amendment that would prohibit Members of Congress from going \naround the earmark disclosure process and pressuring Federal agencies \nto designate funds.\n  This is an amendment that I also want to add to this appropriations \nbill. I understand both sides will be willing to accept this again.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n  I would like to address my second amendment at this point as well. \nThis is a very difficult amendment to talk about because when we start \ntalking about earmarks in the House or the Senate, all of those \nearmarks are something that have been designated by individual Members \nof Congress. So it is often taken quite personally when we challenge \nthese amendments and make it public, particularly amendments that do \nnot sound good to taxpaying Americans.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that my point is not to focus on \nMembers of Congress but to focus on wrong ideas; in fact, wrong ideas \nabout earmarking and spending taxpayer dollars that have discredited \nthis body with the American people.\n  We know only 11 percent of the American people have any kind of \nfavorable perspective of Congress at this point. A lot of it is because \nof the publicity of how we spend their money.\n  I was made aware by ``CBS News'' of a particular earmark that the \nHouse has put in their version of the Labor-HHS bill. CBS is not known \nfor being supportive of conservative causes. They were pointing out a \nparticular attachment to the House appropriations bill, which will be \nin the final bill if we do not disallow it in the Senate.\n  It is an earmark for $2 million that was put in this bill by \nCongressman Rangel, chairman of Ways and Means. This $2 million earmark \ngoes to a new Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City \nCollege of New York. This center does not yet exist. It is one that \nmoney is being raised for at this time.\n  Frankly, the college does not need this duplication of an educational \nservice which already exists on the campus, but the description of this \nbuilding includes not only an educational program--that is, a \nduplication of the Colin Powell Center which is already there--but it \nalso creates a library for the personal archives of Congressman Rangel \nand a well-furnished office for his personal use.\n  CBS made the point, and they actually called this ``Monument to Me.'' \nAnd not just about Congressman Rangel but about all of us who, through \nthe earmarking process each year, are given a personal slush fund to \nsend taxpayer dollars to our favorite causes back in our home States \nand districts.\n  Increasingly, Members of Congress are doing things such as giving \nmoney to colleges and other organizations that are naming buildings and \nprograms after us so that it will attract more earmarks. It has become \na vicious circle that Americans are on to.\n  CBS made the point of this waste of money. To me, it, frankly, looks \nvery bad. It reflects poorly on all of us, and it discredits a lot of \nthe good things we do. Again, my point is not to identify a particular \nMember of Congress to embarrass them but, hopefully, to embarrass us \nall; that we are all involved with a very bad approach to spending \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  The idea of each Member of Congress--we all have papers, we all give \nthem to colleges. Does this mean we will all get taxpayer money to send \nto these colleges to build some type of Presidential-like library to \narchive our papers and give us personal offices? I assume it is \npermanent.\n  The hard-working people in South Carolina who are paying taxes should \nnot be building a center for Congressman Rangel in New York. If we had \nplenty of extra money, maybe we could talk about it. But the fact is, \nwe are borrowing this money from future generations to build monuments \nto ourselves all around the country.\n  My amendment would disallow the use of funds in this bill for this \nparticular project, hopefully making a point to all of us that this is \nnot what\n\n[[Page S13034]]\n\nAmerica expects when they send us to Congress. Our job is to do what is \nbest for this country in our future, not to create slush funds for \nourselves so we can win popularity back home by taking money back home, \nparticularly when we get involved with this back and forth of, they \nnamed something after us, so we give money to them. It does not look \ngood, it does not sound good, and it is not good. It is not good for \nour country and our future.\n  I encourage every Member of this Senate to vote for this amendment \nthat would disallow funds for this project and hopefully send a message \nhere and all around America that we are going to reform ourselves, and \nwe are no longer going to be embarrassed by CBS and other media. Every \ntime they point out what we are doing, we cannot hide from the fact \nthat it is shameful. I do not want my tax dollars spent this way. I \nknow the people in South Carolina do not. I bet if we had a chance to \nask every American, not one would say this is how they expect their tax \ndollars to be spent.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3340 be \npending at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3340 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds made available under the \n Act may be used to circumvent any statutory or administrative formula-\n driven or competitive awarding process to award funds to a project in \n    response to a request from a Member of Congress, and for other \n                               puropses)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used to circumvent any statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive awarding process to award funds \n     to a project in response to a request from a Member of \n     Congress (or any employee of a Member or committee of \n     Congress), unless the specific project has been disclosed in \n     accordance with the rules of the Senate or House of \n     Representatives, as applicable.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 3338.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we do have two amendments I have offered. \nMy understanding was that there would be a voice vote on 3340, and I \nhave asked for the yeas and nays on 3338, if I may correct my request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Would the Chair state the question \nbefore the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has asked for \nthe yeas and nays on amendment No. 3338.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Will the Senator from South Carolina repeat his request?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 3338.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have not disposed of amendment No. \n3340, if I am correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have looked at 3340. I don't know that it needs an up-\nor-down vote. We can accept it. I understand Senator Specter will \naccept it, also, so it is accepted on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3340.\n  The amendment (No. 3340) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will probably have more to say about \nthis later, but on the amendment the Senator offered regarding the \nRangel Center, I object to this amendment. It is an attack on an \ninstitution that is not in the Senate amendment before us. It is a \nHouse provision that provides funding for a center at the City College \nof New York. As I understand it, the center was set up basically to \noffer interdisciplinary programs for bachelor's degrees, master's \ndegrees, midcareer programs, to get more minority population into \nmanagement positions. Right now, non-Whites make up nearly 30 percent \nof our population, yet only 13.8 percent of the men and women who \noccupy top management and policy positions in the Federal Government \nare members of minority groups. We need to do more to bring minority \nAmericans into public service. A center for public service at the City \nCollege of New York was set up to do this. It was the City College of \nNew York that decided the name of it. As far as I know, we didn't \ndecide that. We didn't do anything to decide the name of it. In this \nbill, we have funds for the Howard Baker Center in Tennessee. We have \nfunds for a Robert Dole Center. These are centers set up at \nuniversities, and they name them. We do not. They decide to put a name \non it.\n  I believe we ought to be in the position of saying, yes, there is a \nneed for course work to help minorities get into midmanagement and \nsenior positions in the Federal Government. That is laudable. But what \nthe university names it ought to be up to the university. It is not up \nto us.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Surely.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the concerns. Again, it is difficult when \nnames of Members of Congress are involved. The college already has an \neducation center specifically for the purpose listed for the Charles \nRangel Center. It is called the Colin Powell Center. They perhaps added \nsome bells and whistles, archived the papers as well as the personal \noffice we talked about.\n  To the chairman's objection about this not being in our bill, in this \nbody we regularly disallow funds for various agencies that are not \nlisted in our bill but that as a body we decide it is not the \nappropriate way for money to be spent.\n  We should honor Congressman Rangel and others who have served with \ndistinction as he has. CBS brought out that the college had not made \nthe decision or at least would not make the decision as to how to name \nthe center. So there were a lot of questionable things that came up in \nthis report, questions enough that CBS decided to make it news.\n  My point is, if we get into the practice as Members of Congress while \nwe are still serving of responding to centers being named after us by \ngetting taxpayer dollars back to them and getting personal offices in \nbuildings around the country, this is clearly not our purpose, and it \nis not one that will be respected by the American people.\n  I look forward to further debate. I appreciate all the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have in our bill a provision for a \nHoward Baker Center at the University of Tennessee. I haven't heard the \nSenator from South Carolina want to go strike the Howard Baker Center. \nThat is in this bill. A couple years ago, we had the provision for the \nDole Center at the University of Kansas. I don't remember the Senator \nobjecting to that. This is nothing unusual. This happens all the time. \nIt is up to the university to decide whether they want to name them; it \nis not up to us.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if the Senator will continue to yield, I \nappreciate the give-and-take. We have made the point many times. We did \nit with judges. We created a law that would not allow us to name \ncourthouses after active judges, but once they retire, we look at it \ndifferently. The same is true for Members. Senator Baker and Senator \nDole are not in positions now to direct money to different places \nbecause they are named after them, but we are. There is a serious \nquestion here, and we should make a distinction between what we do \nwhile we are serving and what we do after we have retired.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe we are ready for the Dole \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S13035]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3341 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I call up No. 3341 pending at the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3341.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funding for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell \n                                Program)\n\n       On page 37, line 2, insert ``Provided further, That of the \n     funds available under this heading, $12,000,000 shall be \n     provided for the National Cord Blood Inventory pursuant to \n     the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-129):'' after ``programs:''.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, on December 20, 2005, the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act was signed by the President and became \nlaw. This legislation established, through the Health Resources and \nServices Administration, HRSA, the C.W. ``Bill'' Young Cell \nTransplantation Program. This program, a successor to the National Bone \nMarrow Donor Registry, takes what used to be considered medical waste, \ndeposits of umbilical cord blood, and banks it for future transplant \nrecipients. Cord blood is the only known substitute for bone marrow.\n  The first cord blood transplant in the United States not involving a \nfamily member was performed at Duke University Medical Center in 1993. \nSince then, cord blood transplants have become increasingly common. \nNationwide, more than 500 cord blood transplants are performed each \nyear.\n  Today, cord blood transplantation is one of the most hopeful and \nexciting areas in the field of medicine. Together, adult stem cells and \ncord blood units have been used to treat over 70 blood cancers and \ngenetic diseases.\n  Let me tell you about a young girl named Sangeetha. She received a \ntransplant 10 years ago at my alma mater, Duke University, when she was \nbattling leukemia. Doctors struggled to find a bone marrow match for \nSangeetha, who is Indian. Fortunately, doctors found a compatible match \nfrom a baby girl born in New York, and Sangeetha was able to have cord \nblood stem cell transplantation. I am pleased to say she graduated from \nWestern Alamance High School last year and is now a freshman at East \nCarolina University.\n  My amendment ensures that the cord blood program is included in the \nactual Labor-HHS appropriations bill. In the past, the cord blood \nprogram has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress, and I ask \nthat the Senate again show its support of this program by accepting my \namendment. I also thank my colleagues, Senators Specter and Harkin, for \ntheir strong support of the cord blood program. Without their hard \nwork, this life-saving program would not have received the funding \nincrease that it did this year.\n  Patients across the Nation have benefited from these state-of-the-art \ncenters that are located in six States: North Carolina, New York, \nWashington, California, Colorado, and Texas. I know that in my home \nState of North Carolina, Duke University Medical Center has been \nworking tirelessly to serve patients who travel from all across the \ncountry to benefit from the latest advancements in medical research.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. It is \nimperative that these centers are adequately funded to ensure that the \nNational Cord Blood Centers can continue to expand and store more cord \nblood donations--which means matches for more patients in desperate \nneed of a transplant.\n  I ask for passage of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for her interest \nin and support of the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank. This is a \nprogram Senator Specter and I created in the 2004 bill when he was \nchairman. Our bill includes $12 million for this program, enough to \nsustain the banks that exist and start a new round of grants to startup \noperations. The Dole amendment codifies this $12 million for the cord \nblood stem cell banking program. I fully support it. I believe I can \nspeak for Senator Specter. On both sides, we are more than happy to \naccept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 3341.\n  The amendment (No. 3341) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3324\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose amendment No. 3324, the \nSessions amendment. As far as I know, there is no Member of this body \nwho opposes rigorous oversight of labor unions. Members of this body \nwho care about the well-being of American workers don't want them \nharmed, period. It doesn't matter if it is an employer or a union \nleader or the U.S. Trade Representative who is doing the harming.\n  Unions are already subject, as they should be, to stringent reporting \nrequirements, and unions overwhelmingly comply with whatever \nrequirements are mandated. In its budget justification, the Department \nof Labor stated that the acceptability rate for unions in meeting their \nfinancial requirements is 96 percent. There is not a serious problem. \nWe don't have a problem with monitoring unions. What we do have a \nproblem with is attacking workers, which is what this amendment will \ndo.\n  The offset of this amendment should offend any Member of this body \nwho respects the hard-fought progress our Nation has made in the \nworkplace, whether it is protecting the health and safety of workers or \npreventing the exploitation of children.\n  Look at what this amendment does. It increases funding 37 percent for \n``labor-management standards.'' It does nothing for wage and hour \nenforcement. The Presiding Officer from Iowa has fought so hard for \nmore wages to build the middle class.\n  Look what it does here--and one of the reasons we have had stagnant \nwages in this country--it cuts funding for occupational safety and \nhealth. We know what has happened with workers in the workplace. We \nhave seen an increase in incidents because of the Bush administration's \nlax enforcement of OSHA standards to begin with. Look what it does to \nthe International Labor Affairs Bureau.\n  This offset would undercut our investment in fighting the worst forms \nof child labor and human trafficking. It would undercut our ability to \nensure that labor laws in developing nations are being enforced. When \nthose laws are not enforced, not only are there gross human rights \nabuses, there are insurmountable obstacles to fair competition in the \nglobal trading arena.\n  In other words, when we do not enforce labor standards in the \ndeveloping world, it is only costing us jobs because they are \nundercutting our wages because they are violating labor law and they \nare basically not playing fair.\n  This administration now seeks more of the same, asking Congress to \napprove trade agreements with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. \nThis amendment is more of the same. The Sessions amendment cuts from \nthe small contribution--the small contribution--this Government makes \ntoward eliminating the worst forms of labor abuse.\n  Many countries still permit deplorable practices such as child labor \nand forced labor. The Sessions amendment cuts funding of the \nInternational Labor Affairs Bureau by $5 million. That undercuts its \ncore mission: investigating and combating these violations of human \ndignity.\n  Look at these children shown in this picture I have in the Chamber, \nand look at the work they are doing, hour\n\n[[Page S13036]]\n\nafter hour, day after day, in all too many places around the world. \nThis is economic globalization on the cheap, and our Nation cannot \nafford it.\n  Many in this Chamber may remember a report released last year by the \nNational Labor Committee which exposed disgraceful working conditions \nin Jordan--a country with which we have a free trade agreement. The \nreport documented workers who were trafficked--their passports \nconfiscated when they arrived in Jordan. They used materials made in \nChina to make finished projects eligible for duty-free entry into the \nUnited States, passing through Jordan. We see too many workers in \nplaces such as Jordan. And our administration, what does it do? It \nlooks the other way.\n  International Labor Affairs funding--the funding this amendment would \ncut--goes toward the implementation of ILO Convention 182 on the \nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. It has been ratified by \n165 nations. The funding provides foreign governments with technical \nassistance on meeting their responsibilities so this does not happen.\n  A more recent ILO report, ``The End of Child Labor: Within Reach,'' \nshowed that the number of children working around the world dropped 11 \npercent, from 246 million children--like these--in 2000, to 218 million \nin 2004. That is not good enough, but that is progress, and the \nSessions amendment would pull the rug out from under that progress.\n  Members of this body who vote ``yes'' on this Sessions amendment will \nbe simultaneously launching a gratuitous attack on labor unions in this \ncountry and abandoning workers, including these children, and others, \nwho are being abused and exploited. It is doubly wrong. Vote ``no.''\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3348 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and to call up amendment No. 3348 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 3348 to amendment \n     No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the Underground Railroad Educational \n                         and Cultural Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $2,000,000 shall be available for the Underground Railroad \n     Educational and Cultural Program. Amounts appropriated under \n     title III for administrative expenses shall be reduced on a \n     pro rata basis by $2,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment will be set aside.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3349 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3349, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Mr. Obama, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Collins, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 3349 \n     to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary of Education from using funds with \n      respect to an evaluation for the Upward Bound Program until \n congressional examination of the regulation providing for such review)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. __.  No funds appropriated under this Act may be used \n     by the Secretary of Education to promulgate, implement, or \n     enforce the evaluation for the Upward Bound Program as \n     announced in the Notice of Final Priority published at 71 \n     Fed. Reg. 55447-55450 (Sept. 22, 2006), until after the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House \n     of Representatives have thoroughly examined such regulation \n     in concert with the reauthorization of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment with \nSenators Lincoln, Obama, Feingold, Collins, Wyden, Menendez, and Kerry.\n  This amendment would halt the implementation of an invalid and \nunethical Department of Education evaluation of Upward Bound programs. \nAcross the country, Upward Bound serves low-income, first-generation \nstudents who are at risk of not completing high school or pursuing \nhigher education. The evaluation requires that Upward Bound programs \naggressively recruit twice as many students as they can serve simply to \nprovide enough students for a control group that will never actually \nreceive Upward Bound services. It forces program directors to engage in \na sort of bait and switch that contradicts their mission as educators. \nIt places in danger longstanding trust relationships between Upward \nBound directors and school administrators, between students and their \nfamilies, and, most critically, it dashes the hopes of vulnerable teens \nwho lack the academic or the financial or the emotional support \nnecessary to successfully pursue higher education.\n  Not only will students be given false hope under this evaluation and \nthis process, but there remain serious questions about the adequacy of \nresearch designs based on randomly assigned control groups in \neducational research. These concerns are based on the difficulty--\nperhaps even the impossibility--of imposing laboratory conditions in \nnonlaboratory environments.\n  Unless we take action, the evaluations will proceed on about 100 \ncampuses across the country, 10 percent of those--10 of those--in my \nState of Ohio.\n  Upward Bound programs are critically important. We know how effective \nthey are to our Nation's youth, and we should evaluate their \neffectiveness. But we should do it the right way, in a fair, ethical, \nand valid way.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues, including the Presiding \nOfficer, on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and in \nthe Senate to develop an evaluation methodology that will truly let us \nknow how our Upward Bound programs are performing.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be laid aside for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3321 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3321, which I believe \nis at the desk and was filed by Senator Coburn. He and I are \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for Mr. Coburn, for \n     himself and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 3321 to \n     amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional care for pregnant women, mothers, and \n infants by eliminating a $1,000,000 earmark for a museum dedicated to \n                               Woodstock)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds made available under the heading \n     ``office of museum and library services: grants and \n     administration'' under the heading ``Institute of Museum and \n     Library Services'' in title IV may be used for for the Bethel \n     Performing Arts Center.\n       (b) The amount made available under the heading ``office of \n     museum and library services: grants and administration'' \n     under the heading ``Institute of Museum and Library \n     Services'' in title IV is reduced by $1,000,000, and the \n     amount made available under the heading ``health resources \n     and services'' under the heading ``Health Resources and \n     Services Administration'' in title II is increased by \n     $336,500, which $336,500 shall be used to carry out title V \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), in order \n     to provide additional funding for the maternal and child \n     health services program carried out under that title.\n\n[[Page S13037]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I can describe the amendment very briefly. \nHere is the context in which Senator Coburn and I offer this amendment.\n  This Labor-HHS appropriations bill provides just under $150 billion \nin total discretionary spending. I believe it is $149.2 billion. This \nis about $8.95 billion over the President's recommendation. That is \nwell over 6 percent in excess of what the President recommended.\n  With this kind of excessive spending in the bill, it is important for \nCongress to address the use of taxpayer dollars within this bill to \nensure that anything that is not a critical governmental function is \nprioritized, and for those things that are not critical, that we not \nspend money on them.\n  Now, this bill contains a $1 million earmark for a museum located at \nthe Bethel Performing Arts Center in Bethel, NY--the site of the \noriginal 1969 Woodstock Festival. The museum, which is scheduled to \nopen in 2008, apparently will house exhibits on the Woodstock Festival \nand the 1960s in which it occurred. According to the museum's Web \nsite--I am quoting now--\n\n       Through dramatic imagery, audio-visual technology and \n     immersive interactives, this exhibition tells the story of \n     the 1969 [Woodstock] festival and its significance in a time \n     of unrest and change, concluding with the myth, reality, and \n     impact of the Woodstock Festival today.\n\n  Our amendment is very simple. We simply strike that $1 million \nearmark.\n  For those who thought the Woodstock Festival was a neat thing and \nsomething that needs to be commemorated in American history, it is \nhappening. It does not need the Federal Government, the taxpayers in my \nState and others, to subsidize that museum.\n  The Gerry Foundation, which is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, \noversees the Bethel Center, and it reported an adjusted net income of \n$7.7 million, investment income of more than $24 million, and total net \nassets of over $150 million at the end of 2004, the last year for which \nstatistics are available. So why are we asking for $1 million to be \nearmarked out of this particular bill, the Labor-HHS bill, for the \nfunding of this particular museum? As I said, our amendment would \neliminate the earmark for this Woodstock museum, and it would transfer \nthe funding to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program--\nsomething that is relevant to the Labor-HHS bill.\n  The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program provides funding to \nStates to meet their most pressing maternal and child health needs, \nencouraging the development of community-based networks for both \nprivate and public health care services and programs designed to meet \nthe health needs of pregnant women, mothers, infants, children, and \nadolescents. This is what this bill is supposed to be about.\n  We have had a lot of debate recently about protecting children's \nhealth. It seems to me if that is something we are concerned about, we \ncould use this $1 million for children's health rather than helping to \npay the expenses of an already very well-funded museum to celebrate the \nfestival at Woodstock.\n  The amendment basically asks some questions about our priorities as \nMembers of Congress, stewards of taxpayer dollars. Remember, the money \nhas not grown on trees. It has been collected from hard-working \nfamilies who expect us to put it to good use. They are frustrated about \nwasteful Washington spending. They criticize us every day for the \npriorities we set. It seems to me we do have to ask questions such as \nwhether it is the will of this body to fund an earmark for a museum \ncelebrating a weekend-long party that occurred 38 years ago or funding \nchild health.\n  The American people, as I said, are sick and tired of the kind of \nspending that this particular kind of earmark represents. They see us \nas a government that is not accountable to them, that is out of touch \nwith their needs and realities in trying to provide for their own \nfamilies, and they then send what the Government needs by way of taxes. \nThey are not against paying taxes, but they do not want us to waste \ntheir money.\n  It is beyond me how, with an entity as well funded as the Gerry \nFoundation, the Government would have to then take taxpayer money and \nfund this particular museum to the tune of $1 million. It is clearly \nnot a high priority. It is clearly not needed. It is not critical to \nour future. It may be a nice thing for some people to visit to relive \ntheir memories of the good old days, but, frankly, it is a handout from \ntaxpayers to a foundation that otherwise has plenty of money to \ncommemorate this particular event.\n  I close by noting that recently there was a festival at the Bethel \nsite, the site of Woodstock, on August 11 of this year. They hosted an \nevent called the ``HIPPIEFEST,'' with tickets priced up to $60 a \nperson. Here is how it was advertised:\n\n       Return to the flower-powered days of the 1960's with our \n     oh-so-hippie line-up of truly talented artists.\n\n  The center's advertisement for the concert further states:\n\n       [G]ather your groovy beads and we'll see you on the lawn \n     for a trip down memory lane.\n\n  Well, the trip down memory lane may be fine for folks. I suggest if \nthey want to participate in that, they can pay the admission price. If \na rich entrepreneur in New York wishes to fund the creation of this \nmuseum, as he has done, he obviously has plenty of money to do it, as I \nindicated. It is not something American taxpayers should pay for.\n  I will conclude by saying this: The reason why this Congress has a \nlower approval rating than the President of the United States--the \nlowest approval rating in its history, according to the public opinion \nsurveys--is because they do not trust us to do the right thing. They \nbelieve we are wasteful stewards of their money. We have to start \nsomewhere in convincing them that we are serious about the business \nthey want us to conduct, that we can set priorities, and that we are \nnot going to continue to waste their money.\n\n  How can we, with a straight face, argue to them that we are not \nwasting their hard-earned, taxpayer money when we take $1 million of it \nto spend on a memorial or a museum for a party, as I said, that \noccurred 38 years ago, and which is already plenty adequately funded? \nIt makes no sense at all.\n  I urge my colleagues, when this comes up for a vote, let's at least \ndemonstrate in a symbolic way, at a minimum, that we are serious about \nnot wasting their money. I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, does my colleague from Oklahoma intend to \nspeak on this amendment? Then I would like to speak after both my \ncolleagues have spoken and respond to what they have to say.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I intend to speak after Senator Schumer \nspeaks as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we heard Senator Kyl talk about the \nproblem. The Woodstock Museum is not the problem; it is a symbol of the \nproblem. Alan Gerry has done great things for the State of New York. He \nshould be praised for what he has done. This isn't an attack on him. \nThis is an attack on the process--the process where we inappropriately \nsend money back on the basis not of priority but on the basis of a low-\npriority need.\n  Now, there was a historian by the name of Alexander Tyler. These \nwords are attributed to him. Nobody can say for sure he is the author \nof them, but they bear a very important lesson for us. He wrote about \nthe Athenian Empire which had collapsed, and he was writing this about \nthe time that our Founders were writing our institutional documents. \nHere is what he said: All democracies eventually fail. They fail \nbecause people learn that they can vote themselves money from the \npublic Treasury. Consequently, they only vote for people in elected \noffice who will return them money from the public Treasury. \nConsequently, all democracies fail over a fiscal collapse.\n  Now, is that where we are headed? Have we walked into the trap of \nhistory which talks about how every other democracy in the world has, \nin fact, failed over fiscal issues? They haven't failed over the \nprinciples of their democracy. They haven't failed over their freedom. \nThey failed over the financial collapse of their system because the \npolitical class used public monies to pay off private citizens.\n\n[[Page S13038]]\n\n  This is a symbolic vote. It is not about going after Senator Schumer \nor Senator Clinton and this earmark. I have been going after Republican \nand Democratic earmarks for 2\\1/2\\ years. But this is a great example. \nI am part of the hippie generation. I was a junior in college when \nWoodstock occurred. It may be great for upstate New York to empower and \nhave this as an economic development tool. It is certainly a part of \nour history and ought to be remembered. There is no question about it. \nBut the question is, should this be a priority for this body over the \npriority of women and children, of maternal-child health, which isn't \nfunded adequately in this country? Should we fund $1 million to a \nworthwhile project but low priority? That is the question. It is not \nabout whether great things have been done in this area or whether great \nthings can continue to be done.\n  New York has a $1.6 billion surplus right now. If this is great, why \nshouldn't the State of New York fund it more, this $1 million? We have, \naccording to the latest estimate if you use Enron accounting, a $160 \nmillion deficit. If you use real accounting, it is going to be about a \n$300 billion deficit. So why should we put the credit card in and \ncharge another $1 million to our kids for something that is low \npriority? If we are going to charge another $1 million to our kids, why \ndon't we do it for the kids, for maternal and child health? We will \nearn the 11 percent if we reject this amendment.\n  The problem is, this is a good thing to do. Senators have a right to \ndo it. We know that. Even though, I disagree that, before we fix the \nmajor financial problems that face our country, we shouldn't be sending \nmoney home. I am in the minority on that issue. I understand that. You \nare not bad if you disagree with me. But according to the American \npublic, you don't agree with them either because 85 percent of the \nAmerican people in the latest poll think we ought to eliminate all \nearmarks until we get our house in order.\n  The question is, how will they ever trust us to fix Medicare or \nSocial Security if they can't trust us on these small things? And they \ncan't. We can't help ourselves. Surely, $1 million for a Woodstock \nmuseum and performance center is not a priority for this country at \nthis time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? \nI hate to interrupt the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think this has been cleared on the other \nside.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30 today, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. 3338, with no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote, and that there be 2 minutes \nof debate prior to the vote with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators DeMint and Schumer or their designees; that \nupon disposition of the DeMint amendment, Senator Byrd be recognized to \ncall up an amendment on the subject of mine safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would ask \nto modify that time on the provision that we be finished this debate. \nIn other words, that being the first order of business after we finish \nthis debate rather than setting a fixed time because I am not sure we \nwill be through at 12:30. If the Senator would care to modify, so that \nat 12:30, or the soonest thereafter we finish this debate, I would be \nmore than happy to agree.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, is there any chance that we \ncould finish the debate after the vote? We are trying to get the vote \nin prior to some noon things that are happening around here.\n  Mr. COBURN. I guess we can do that. I would do that if that is what \nyou want to do. I would love for us to finish this before the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I modify my unanimous consent request to \nsay that if the pending debate is not finished at 12:30, that after the \nvote on amendment No. 3338, we would return to the debate on the Coburn \namendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Is that OK with my colleague?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I only intend to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Then I think we should be finished. I have no objection \nto the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nHarkin request, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, so here we have a bill, the Labor-HHS \nbill, and it has over $400 million in earmarks--some good, some \npriority, some are high priority, probably should be there, but many \nare not high priority.\n  When are we going to do what the American family has to do every \nyear? What they have to do is say: Here is how much money we have \ncoming in. Here is what we have needs for, and here is what we have \navailable. What they do is make choices based on priorities. This \ndebate is about making choices. If we had different rules, this debate \nwould have been eliminating the earmark plainly, and several others. \nBut because of the Senate rules, the money is going to be spent, so we \nhave to figure out a higher priority place to spend it, and maternal \nand child health is certainly the place to do it.\n  The real question the American people are asking us, the 89 percent \nof the American people who don't have confidence in this institution \nare asking us is, when are we going to get it? When are we going to \nstart doing what they want us to do? When are we going to start playing \nfor them and their future, rather than playing for us and our future? \nThat is the real question.\n  There is no question that the desirability of what this earmark \nsupports is probably great. I don't have any problems with it. What I \nhave a problem with is that we have a $9 trillion debt.\n  This Senator has never voted to raise the debt limit. We just raised \nthe debt limit $850 billion, to almost $10 trillion, because we can't \ncontrol ourselves.\n  So the question before us isn't whether this is good or bad. The \nquestion is, when are we going to change our behavior? When are we \ngoing to start doing $1 million here and $1 million here, up to \n$398,584,000 worth of earmarks in a bill? That is the question. This \nisn't conservatives who are asking this question; it is liberal \nDemocrats; it is Independents; it is conservatives, because they know, \nin fact, this Government can run better, more efficiently, with less \nmoney than what we are doing now, if, in fact, we will stand up and do \nthe oversight work we ought to be doing. But we refuse to do that.\n  So the vote will come. We will have a vote. If we don't enhance this \namendment and pass it, we will go from 11 percent to 10.95 percent \nbecause, in fact, the American people will see, again, that we don't \nget it. We don't have to live by the rules they live by.\n  The tragedy is, in this bill, the Labor-HHS bill to help those most \ndependent in America, we are going to take money in the future from \nthose who we are saying we are giving to now, through a decreased \nstandard of living or an increased tax rate. If you don't believe that, \nread David Walker, the Comptroller General's report about what is \ngetting ready to happen to us as a nation in terms of our finances, or \nread Peter Peterson's book, ``Running On Empty,'' about what is going \nto happen to us. Why in the world is the Euro at $1.42 when it was 83 \ncents 3\\1/2\\ years ago? Why is that? Is there a beckoning call about \nour financial condition that the world financial markets recognize, and \nyet we refuse to pay attention to?\n  So I call on my colleagues. This isn't a partisan amendment. I have \ngone after just as many Republican amendments--as a matter of fact, one \nof the amendments I am going to be offering today goes after a \nRepublican amendment. I also plan on offering an amendment to get rid \nof all earmarks in this bill before we finish this bill. So we will get \nto see whether this body gets it, whether the 80 percent to 85 percent \nof Americans who want us to change our behavior have any influence on \nus whatsoever. Will we listen?\n  There is a rumble. I said this a year and a half ago. There is a \nrumble in America, and the rumble is this: We don't have confidence in \nour Government anymore. Where is the legitimacy of our Government when \nour own people don't have confidence in us? It is a great question to \nask about the\n\n[[Page S13039]]\n\ngreatest Republic that there ever was. It is a problem we need to be \nabout solving rather than ignoring.\n  With that, I yield for the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to make a few \ncomments. First, I would like to say this: I have tremendous respect \nfor my colleague, and I would say friend, from Oklahoma. I don't think \nhe does this out of any personal animus or even a direct, crass \npolitical advantage. I think he believes, and I respect that. So I \nwould like to say that at the outset, and I say the same for my friend \nfrom Arizona. They have both been consistent in this, and they don't \nput in--even though their States do get earmarks, even earmarks for \nmuseums, it is not the wish of the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator \nfrom Arizona to do that. That is point 1.\n  Point 2, generally, about fiscal responsibility, I would say both of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, like so many others, have \nvoted pretty strongly against spending programs. But they don't vote \nthe same way against tax cuts. They don't do pay-go on tax cuts. They \nvote to cut taxes much more than all of the earmarks in this entire \nbill, even though it makes the deficit worse, even though it is a fact \nthat our children will suffer because of the debt.\n  So there is no high moral ground here. There is a view as to how big \nGovernment ought to be, but the idea of keeping the budget balanced for \nour children and for our grandchildren, I daresay, this new Congress, \nunder Democratic leadership, is toeing the mark far more carefully than \nprevious Congresses did. We have instituted pay-go--pay-go for tax \ncuts, but pay-go for spending programs as well.\n  Any economist will tell you, if you have a large deficit, it doesn't \nmatter whether the deficit was caused by either reducing taxes or by \nraising spending. So, frankly, I think the arguments of my colleagues \nwould have a great deal more suasion in this body if they were to say \nthey will not vote for any tax cut that is not paid for either because \nwhat is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  If you wish to say I am for shrinking Government and I don't care \nwhat the deficit is, that is just fine. But if you are making the \nargument that we should not pass debt on to our children, debt from tax \ncuts and debt from spending programs is exactly the same debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Can the Senator recall a time that I voted for a tax cut?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't know offhand.\n  Mr. COBURN. As a matter of fact, my public statements are that there \nshould be no tax cuts unless you do spending cuts to pay for them.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I respect my colleague for that. But the Senator from \nArizona--I know of his record longer, and he does not have that record.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate that, and I look forward, when tax-cutting \namendments come to the floor, to working with my colleague to say they \nought to be paid for if we are going to do it, like we did, for \ninstance, in the recent SCHIP bill.\n  I will make a second general point, and I will get to the specifics \nof this program. There are many needs in this country, and this country \nhas always been one of federalism. Most of our time, effort, and energy \ngoes into broad programs that basically do the same thing in Oklahoma, \nArizona, and New York--whether it is helping pregnant women, whether it \nis education, or whether it is road building. Those are large national \nneeds that this body has determined are real. But we have always had a \nview that States and localities are important.\n  Frankly, since the 1930s, there has been a view that the Federal \nGovernment has every right or reason to help those States and \nlocalities specifically, and that is what good earmarks are. Earmarks \nare not all good. Spending programs are not all good. Tax cuts are not \nall good. Each of them can be aimed at a specific place. Each of them \ncan be aimed for the wrong reason. But I am proud of the earmarks I \nhave put in the bills that we have had this year and in previous years. \nI am proud to defend them and I am glad we are having this debate. I do \nbelieve there is a balance, and I don't believe saying every program \nthe Federal Government does ought to be just aimed across the country \nbecause Sullivan County in upstate New York, in the Catskill Mountains, \nis quite different from the county that surrounds Tulsa, OK, or the \nGrand Canyon in northwestern Arizona.\n  Yes, there should be a balance. To me, the balance in this bill--and \nthe overwhelming majority are for broad Federal programs, but a certain \namount are designated for earmarks--makes sense. Now, obviously, if you \nare putting an earmark in for something out of your State, or for the \nwrong reason, that is wrong. But let me tell you, if you go to Sullivan \nCounty, NY--and I appreciate that my colleague from Oklahoma has \nconceded this is a good program; he just doesn't think the Federal \nGovernment ought to spend for it. But I appreciate that because if you \ngo to Sullivan County, NY, it is the place where the Catskills are. \nUntil about 1950, the area boomed. Then the airplane boom hit and all \nthe people from New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston who vacationed \nthere started getting on airplanes and going to Florida, the Bahamas, \nCalifornia, and now Arizona to vacation. So Sullivan County became one \nof the poorest areas in our State. You drive up there, and you will \nsee, from the Old Glory days, the great hotels that are boarded up. You \nwill see the little bungalow colonies that people used to go to, which \nare now decrepid. I have been there many a time. I was there as a kid. \nI went to summer camp in the Catskills across the river in \nPennsylvania. I would go there, of course, as a Senator frequently. It \nis an area that needs help.\n\n  When you ask the people what is the No. 1 thing they need, it is \njobs. In this bill, we talk about jobs, no question. But I daresay the \npeople of Sullivan County--the economic development experts, the town \nand local officials--have a better idea of what would create jobs in \nSullivan County than the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from \nArizona and, quite frankly, the Senator from New York. They are there, \nthey know it. They live on the ground. They are the ones who see their \nchildren unable to get work. They are the ones who have seen and \nremember the older once great days, and now the decline, and they are \ndesperate to try to restore some of the jobs so their children won't \nhave to go away.\n  This Bethel Center for the Performing Arts was one of the two \neconomic development projects that Sullivan County put at the top of \nits list, the other one being a racetrack, remaking the old Monticello \nRaceway to help with gambling, which is still pending in the Department \nof the Interior, where the Secretary, from Idaho, who doesn't seem to \nhave a real understanding of the need, says it is an out-of-State tribe \nand we don't want to do it.\n  A job training program will be very nice, but it would not help \nSullivan County to a large extent. All of the other large Federal \nprograms we fund in this bill will not help Sullivan County. The people \nof Sullivan County, as well as the people in the rest of New York, who \nelected myself and Senator Clinton to try to help them with their \nspecific needs, as well as make the country a better place--we don't \ntell them what is good for them. We make sure the money will be spent \nwhere it is supposed to be spent. But we defer to their decision. This \nwas their decision. A lot of other things in Sullivan County might have \nneeded specific help, but this was their decision. It is a good \ndecision.\n  I believe--and this is where, I suppose, my colleague and I have a \ndifference--that the Federal Government should play a role. Being a \nU.S. Senator means making the big, broad national policies for this \ncountry, and it means helping the Sullivan Counties of each of our \nStates. I argue that a Senator who doesn't do that is derelict in his \nor her responsibilities to their State. So I am proud of this earmark. \nIt is the right type of earmark.\n  My colleague mentioned the State government and why doesn't the State \ndo it. The State has put $15 million into this. The local county \nofficials have clamored for this for years. There was a previous \nearmark put in by Congressman Hinchey in the House of Representatives \nto help build a road. It is\n\n[[Page S13040]]\n\na whole performing arts center at Bethel, not just a museum, but it is \nabout $100 million. We hear about State and private partnerships, and \nthis is one of them. The locality and the State are putting far more \nmoney into it than Washington. So both the State and the county and the \ntown of Bethel have stepped up to the plate. They are not just asking \nthe Federal Government for something they would not spend money for.\n  Every one of our counties has a need like this. If we are going to \nlet a broad-brushed argument that there should be no earmarks stand--\nnone--we are not going to be able to help these specific needs. I am \nproud to do it. I spend some time doing it, and I am going to continue \nto do it. I think it is part of my job. I think the people of Sullivan \nCounty and the people of New York State and the people of the United \nStates would agree with that when told the facts of this particular \nsituation and a little history of Sullivan County, which I have just \noutlined.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote against this amendment because this \nis, as my colleague from Oklahoma says, a worthy project, and most of \nthem are--not all. I have great respect for my two colleagues on the \nSenate floor. I don't think they are motivated by anything other than \nthe best of intentions. Most of my colleagues believe they want to help \nout the Sullivan Counties, and we should be getting at the deficit. But \nthe right way to do it is to put in pay-go across the board, not tie \nour hands and eliminate one specific type of program.\n  I want to review a little about the Bethel Museum in Sullivan County. \nIt is a museum that not just covers Woodstock in the late 1960s, but it \ncovers a whole post-World War II period, focusing on the sixties. It \nwas a tumultuous decade, and it is a good idea to study it. Museums and \nlibraries are a very important part of our history and education, as \nwell as a job magnet. I don't think there is a debate that they are \nimportant. They have broad-brushed Federal programs that help libraries \nand museums. So that is not the argument.\n  Most important, it is an economic engine, as important as an economic \nengine might be in southeast Oklahoma, in the Indian country of \nArizona, or the mountains of Montana, and it is what the two Senators--\nSenator Clinton and I--in listening to the needs of Sullivan County and \nthe people of Sullivan County, the elected officials there and the \nChamber of Commerce have said they need most of all.\n  I hope my colleagues will support us and vote down this amendment \nbecause when they vote down this amendment, they are standing up for \nthe other role we have in the Senate: to help our communities in the \nway they believe is best, not the way Washington dictates is best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me return the compliment to our colleague \nfrom New York. Nobody is questioning anybody's beliefs. He certainly \nmade that point, and we make the same point. In Senator Schumer, the \ncitizens of New York have a very worthy and persuasive advocate. I say \nthis with no disrespect. He could literally make the sow's ear into a \nsilk purse, which I think is what is being done with respect to this \nparticular program. He fights for his constituents' interests and \nbeliefs. But I say thank you.\n  If this is a jobs program, and that is the justification for it, I \nthink we need to take a look at this again. I am informed that the \nunemployment rate in Sullivan County is 4.1 percent, contrasted with \n4.6 percent nationwide.\n  Our colleague talked about the counties in northwest Arizona. He \nmentioned the Grand Canyon. One of the counties next to the Grand \nCanyon incorporates the Navajo Indian Reservation.\n  I think about Tuba City. The unemployment rate on the Navajo Indian \nReservation is about 40 percent as opposed to a little over 4 percent \nin Sullivan County, NY. We could use a lot of jobs programs. We can use \nother programs more than that. I cannot get money for a roof on the \nTuba City jail which leaks. There are parts of Arizona where it \nactually rains, and on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Tuba City, AZ, \nit rains.\n  I went up there on a Saturday night about 6 months ago. Hope \nMacDonald said: You need to come up, we have to get a new jail; this \nthing is falling apart. I walked in and, yes, it is falling apart. It \nhappened to be raining and, yes, the roof leaks.\n  There are huge needs on these Indian reservations in poor counties of \nArizona. There are a lot of events we can commemorate on the Navajo \nReservation in terms of a museum that would be worthwhile for everybody \nin this country to visit. There is a rich, long, wonderful history \nthere. But I don't think we should have an earmark in the Health and \nHuman Services bill to create a museum as a jobs program. If we want to \ndo that, let's focus on the real need.\n  I don't know how many jobs this would create or what the cost-benefit \nratio of the expenditure of this money is for job creation, but there \nsurely has to be a better way to do it than creating a museum. If we \nare prioritizing, I can tell you areas in Arizona that are far greater \nin terms of unemployment and could use the money in much more direct \nways to benefit the citizens of the State.\n  The second point that our colleague from New York made--I will stand \nguilty with respect to Senator Schumer's charge, which is that I don't \nbelieve we should always raise taxes when we cut taxes. That is what \nthis so-called pay-go rule is all about. It is supposed to work this \nway. You either cut spending or you raise taxes.\n  We had a Finance Committee meeting, I believe it was yesterday, an \ninformal meeting. I asked my colleagues, because it was all about \nraising taxes: Does anybody here have an idea about how we could cut \nspending in order to pay for this? Dead silence. Not a one. I know my \ncolleague from Oklahoma has lots of good ideas about how to cut \nspending, but nobody in the Finance Committee was willing to put forth \nan idea of cutting spending. No, it had to be to raise taxes.\n  What I am curious about is whoever decided that the amount of revenue \nthe Federal Government collects today is exactly the amount of revenue \nit has to collect from now into the future so that if we are ever going \nto reduce taxes on hard-working Americans, we have to raise their taxes \nin some other area so the Government can still collect the same amount \nof money?\n  It is interesting, we collect about 18.4 percent of the gross \ndomestic product in taxes today. We could prevent any of the existing \ntax rates from increasing--take the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--and \neliminate AMT, the alternative minimum tax, and we would still be \ncollecting 18 percent of our gross domestic product in taxes. Isn't \nthat enough?\n  If we don't do these things, we will be over 20 percent. The historic \n40-year average is 18.2 percent. Clearly, we don't have to keep raising \ntaxes on Americans. That is why some of us believe, when we try to help \npeople by cutting taxes, we ought to leave well enough alone and not \nraise taxes somewhere else so we can keep the Government whole. The \nobject is not to make sure the Government always has the same amount of \nmoney. It is to try to help the people who pay the taxes. They are the \nones who generate the jobs.\n  If we are talking about unemployment, let's talk about who creates \nthe jobs. It is mostly small businesses. So if we help small businesses \nby not raising their taxes, they can create the jobs and that creates \nwealth and, by the way, it produces more income tax revenue to the \nFederal Government.\n  I conclude by saying I plead guilty to not wanting to raise taxes \nevery time I am in favor of cutting taxes, but that debate is \nirrelevant to the question before us today, which is simply, as a \nsymbolic measure, can we at least find $1 million in this multibillion-\ndollar bill that we can all agree could better be spent on something \nelse? Can we set some priorities once and for all?\n  This Woodstock museum, maybe it is a good idea--I am not so sold on \nit--but if it is a great job creator, and it is pretty clear the people \nin New York have concluded that, they have the money to fund a museum. \nThey do not have to rely on the taxpayers in my State or other States \nto fund a museum.\n  I hope my colleagues agree that in setting priorities, we can strike \nthis one earmark from this bill.\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a couple points as to Senator \nSchumer's statement. First, with an unemployment rate six-tenths \npercent lower than the national average and lower than New York's \naverage, by the way--lower than New York's average--it is hardly in the \ndire consequences of what we see around the rest of the country.\n  The second point is, we have 60-some million dollars out there for \ncompetitive grant competition on museums for which the museum \nadministration does a great job. In other words, everybody in the \ncountry who wants to have a museum has to compete against everybody \nelse, and the ones who are most meritorious--by the way, they are also \naudited to see that the money is actually spent in a proper way; this \nwill never be audited--they have to compete.\n  The major problem with Senator Schumer's argument is that Sullivan \nCounty can never be healthy if the country as a whole is not healthy. \nThat is the problem with the argument. We can say we want to make XYZ \nhealthy. It is akin to saying your finger is healthy when you are \nhaving a heart attack.\n  The fact is, the country as a whole is at the precipice--D day comes \nJanuary 1, 2008. That is the demographic day on which all the baby \nboomers, the ``Woodstockers'' start taking Social Security, and 3 years \nlater they start taking Medicare, $79 trillion worth of unfunded \nliabilities. How in the world can the American people ever trust us to \nfix those big problems if we don't even get it on the small problems?\n  If this is a great idea, put it into the competition on competitive \ngrants for museums. To say they are in hardship with an unemployment \nrate of 4.1 percent compared to the rest of New York and the rest of \nthe country, that is hard to believe.\n\n  Again, we have to start listening to the rumble in America that says \nstart being good stewards with our money, quit doing things that help \nyou as politicians that hurt us as a country.\n  The fact is, although this may be very worthy, why shouldn't it have \nto compete against everybody else in the country who wants a museum? \nWhy shouldn't it have to compete? Why is it that I can pick out and \nplace--and I guess I am one of the derelict Senators because I don't \nbelieve Oklahoma can be healthy if our country isn't healthy. I believe \nOklahoma will ultimately fail if our country fails. I believe that \nfuture generations will live a less standard of living with less \nopportunity and ultimately less freedom if we don't solve the financial \nproblems in front of us as a nation.\n  This is a symptom of our sickness, and until we reject and get rid of \nthis disease of parochialism and start fulfilling our oath--do you \nrealize the oath we take when we come to the Senate never mentions our \nState? It says you will uphold the Constitution of these United \nStates--these United States, all of us. So the will and the best well-\nbeing of all of us as a country has to be our most important goal.\n  Alexander Tyler will be right about us if we don't wake up and change \nwhat we are doing. We will collapse under our own fiscal insanity if we \ncontinue to do these things.\n  Senator Schumer is a great Senator for the State of New York, there \nis no question about it. He is going to fight and defend this old way \nof parochialism. He is going to fight and defend it until we as a \ncountry collapse. That is why we have an 11-percent confidence rating. \nWe are collapsing already in terms of our real duty to build \nconfidence, that we are looking out for the country as a whole, not for \nour own political careers or not for local parochial interests. That is \nwhy the Senate was created. It wasn't for parochial interests. If you \nread the Founders' writings, they never thought about the Senate being \nconsidered anything other than a body that looked at the long term, \nensure the future, create opportunities, and protect the liberty, and \nwe fall away from that as we go through this process.\n  Mr. President, I know we have a unanimous consent agreement. I ask \nthat all the Members of this body read Comptroller General David \nWalker's report about what is getting ready to happen to us and read \nformer Secretary Peter Peterson's book ``Running on Empty'' and what \nthey will see is not a pretty picture.\n  The time to diagnose the disease is now, not when we are in ICU and \nwe could have prevented it.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for their debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, moments ago I heard my colleague from \nArizona, who is a member of the Finance Committee, as am I, talking \nabout eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Most of us in this \nChamber know we have a problem with the alternative minimum tax that is \ngoing to affect 23 million Americans, up from nearly 4 million last \nyear, if we fail to act. But the notion that we eliminate the \nalternative minimum tax and not pay for it I find breathtaking. Why? \nBecause unless we replace that revenue, we will have to go out and \nborrow another $870 billion over the next 10 years. In fact, some of my \ncolleagues in a meeting yesterday of the Finance Committee said let's \nnot only eliminate the alternative minimum tax and not pay for it, \nlet's eliminate or extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and not pay for \nthat either, not reduce spending or replace it with other revenue.\n  The effect of those proposals would be $4 trillion of additional debt \nafter they have already run up the debt of the country by $3 trillion \nin the last 6 years alone, a 50-percent increase in the debt. I find \nthat not just irresponsible, I find it wildly irresponsible.\n  From where is this money going to come? It would be borrowed. From \nwhom would we borrow it? Right now, over half the money we are \nborrowing to float this Federal Government we are borrowing from abroad \nand primarily the Japanese and the Chinese.\n  So when my colleagues come out and say let's have a bunch more tax \ncuts and not pay for them, by either reducing spending or replacing it \nwith other revenue, understand what they are saying. What they are \nsaying is let's go borrow a bunch more money from China and Japan.\n  Some people say it is a sign of strength that they will loan us this \nmoney. That is an interesting idea of strength. I had a man in my \noffice the other day, one of the wealthiest men in America. He said to \nme: I believe America is in danger of following the path of Great \nBritain, a great empire in decline, because we are not responsible \nabout our financial commitments and we get into this idea of spending \nmoney we don't have and borrowing it primarily from abroad.\n  It leaves me cold to hear some of my colleagues talk about supporting \nevery tax cut, supporting every spending initiative, wanting another \n$200 billion for the war in Iraq and not willing to pay for any of it. \nThat is what will bring America down. That is what will weaken this \ncountry. That is what will leave us deep in debt and a debt that we \nwill owe all around the world.\n  We are increasingly dependent on the kindness of strangers. At some \npoint, we have to get serious around here and become responsible. Those \nwho embrace every spending initiative of every tax cut and then call \nthemselves fiscally responsible have gone beyond the pale.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. DeMint, and the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, or \ntheir designees, prior to a vote on amendment No. 3338, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate about 3 years, \nand I have become increasingly concerned that many of my colleagues and \ngood friends, whom I deeply respect, now believe it is our purpose here \nin the Senate to take tax dollars from the American people and then \ngive them to our favorite causes back in our States. There are many \nwonderful causes back in South Carolina. I could spend a whole national \ntreasury on them if I could get my hands on it, but that is not what I \nam here for. Americans expect us to work for the good of the country, \nof everyone and our future as a whole, not to create slush funds for \nourselves and give them to our favorite causes back home.\n  My amendment addresses a particular cause, and my purpose is not to\n\n[[Page S13042]]\n\nembarrass a Member of Congress but to point out that it is particularly \negregious if we, as Members of Congress, take taxpayer money and give \nit to some project that has been named after us, and in this case Mr. \nRangel has gotten $1 million or $2 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 30 \nseconds since no one else is speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. My amendment strips this out. Some have said it is not in \nthe Senate bill, so we don't need to do it. We do that all the time; we \ndisallow the use of funds for particular reasons because that is not \nwhat a bill is intended for.\n  Some have said we name things after Senators all the time. But it has \nonly been after they have retired that we have done that. We do it for \njudges after they retire.\n  We have to stop this insidious problem of becoming a favor factory \nwhere we are giving away taxpayer money for things we are not supposed \nto do, despite how worthy they might be. Please support my amendment to \nstrike this egregious provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the only fault I find with the amendment \nof the Senator from South Carolina is that this provision is not in the \nbill before us. It is not in this bill. The thing he finds \nobjectionable is in the House bill; it is not in this bill.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think all time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We have done this before. We did it with spinach a while \nback. It is not unusual for us to disallow the use of funds for things \nnot in our bill. It is important we do it as a Senate; otherwise, it \nwill end up in the final bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would just say again that I find it \nunusual that we are passing amendments on provisions that aren't even \nin the bill before us. It is in the House bill. Now, maybe the Senator \nfrom South Carolina wants to send a signal, and I certainly respect \nthat, but the fact is the provision he objects to is not in the \nlegislation before us. It is over in the House bill. Ultimately, this \nwill have to be worked out between the House and the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3338. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are making progress on this legislation. \nThe two managers are working very hard to consider all the amendments \nthat people have suggested to them.\n  We have just spoken to the distinguished Republican leader, and we \nbelieve this bill can be finished--it is 1 o'clock Thursday afternoon, \nand I hope we will not have to work into the evening tomorrow. We \nreally need to finish this bill and have some cooperation from Senators \nas to how it can be finished with a time certain. So I tell the two \nmanagers, this is a bill we need to do.\n  As I said before, there are a couple of reasons we need to do it. No. \n1 is we need to get this bill completed so we can get something to the \nPresident, and this would be a bill to do that. If the President is \ngoing to veto legislation, which he said he is going to do, this would \nbe a good one to send to him because what the President is complaining \nabout, in actual dollars, is in this bill.\n  Second, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is the manager of \nthis bill. We have to get him the ability next week to start and finish \nmarking up the farm bill. We have to do the farm bill every 5 years. We \nare now past the time when we should have already completed that.\n  So there are a number of very important reasons we have to push \nforward this week to finish what we are working on today. I hope \neveryone understands that. I said before, I am so happy last week we \nwere able to find a way of finishing the Mikulski-Shelby appropriations \nbill. We were able to do that. It took the cooperation of both sides, \nbut we wound up with a good product.\n  I hope we do not have to work late tomorrow. I hope we can figure out \na way to do this. When Senator McConnell was speaking earlier today, a \nfew minutes ago, we had both our floor staffs with us, and they are \ngoing to help work through this. If people have amendments they want \nvotes on, let's set them up today or tonight. It should be, and could \nbe, an important day to complete this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to the majority leader, we \nare anxious to move this bill to completion as well. We understand the \ndesire of the manager of the bill to turn his attention to the farm \nbill, which has not yet been marked up. I am on that committee, and I \nunderstand his interest in being able to do that.\n  Let me just reiterate, there is going to be plenty of cooperation on \nthis side of the aisle to complete the Labor-HHS bill at the earliest \npossible time. I encourage our Members who have been offering \namendments and are going to be offering some more to come down and \nlet's do it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to move this along, I ask unanimous \nconsent to call up en bloc amendments numbered 3242, 3352----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is to be recognized.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator wish to make a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield, if I could call up this \namendment and speak for 2 minutes and then yield the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. How long does the Senator wish?\n\n[[Page S13043]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor for 2 minutes.\n\n\n      Amendments Nos. 3342 and 3352 En Bloc, to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up, en bloc, amendments Nos. 3342 \nand 3352.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes, en bloc, \n     amendments numbered 3342 and 3352 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3342\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to administer Social Security \n      benefit payments under a totalization agreement with Mexico)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     used by the Commissioner of Social Security or the Social \n     Security Administration to pay the compensation of employees \n     of the Social Security Administration to administer Social \n     Security benefit payments, under any agreement between the \n     United States and Mexico establishing totalization \n     arrangements between the social security system established \n     by title II of the Social Security Act and the social \n     security system of Mexico, which would not otherwise be \n     payable but for such agreement.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3352\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to process claims based on \n    illegal work for purposes of receiving Social Security benefits)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated in this Act shall \n     be expended or obligated by the Commissioner of Social \n     Security, for purposes of administering Social Security \n     benefit payments under title II of the Social Security Act, \n     to process claims for credit for quarters of coverage based \n     on work performed under a social security account number that \n     was not the claimant's number which is an offense prohibited \n     under section 208 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 408).\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, these----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to recall the floor \nbut yielded 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will sit down because I know I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very briefly, I will keep this very short. \nThe first amendment deals with the totalization agreement the United \nStates and Mexico have been working on together. I think there is a \nsevere problem with a totalization agreement between our two countries; \nnot because of our country but because of the recordkeeping and the \nproblems associated with Mexico.\n  What the first amendment would do, very simply, it would not allow \nthe administration to use funds to implement a totalization agreement \nwith Mexico. Our Social Security trust fund is already in trouble. We \nall know that.\n  This totalization agreement with Mexico would put our Social Security \ntrust fund into trouble. That is why I think this is an important \namendment that we debate, we talk about, and hopefully we will support.\n  The second amendment I have, I believe, reflects American values. We \nhear about identity fraud all the time. My amendment says the Social \nSecurity Administration could not pay Social Security benefits to \nanybody who has used a Social Security number fraudulently. That \nhappens today. They use it fraudulently. They come back and they claim \nthe benefits while they were using someone else's Social Security \nnumber.\n  This amendment would stop that practice. It would say Social Security \ncannot use any funds in this bill to give Social Security benefits to \nsomebody who used an illegal Social Security number.\n  So briefly, those are my two amendments. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom West Virginia yielding me 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, is the Senate operating under a time \nagreement at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement on the Senator's \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Am I recognized at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3362 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n     (Purpose: To increase funding for the Mine Safety and Health \n                            Administration.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, last year the coal mining industry \nrecorded the highest fatality rate in 10 years: 47 coal miners \nperished. Perished. They died. Many of these coal miners perished in \nthe terrible tragedies at the Sago, Alma, and Darby Mines in West \nVirginia and Kentucky.\n  In response, the Congress passed the MINER Act to help ensure better \nemergency preparedness in the coalfields, such as the underground \ninstallation of wireless communications and additional emergency \nbreathing devices.\n  In order to fund these new mandates, and in order to ensure continued \ncompliance with already existing health and safety standards, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee recommended $13 million above the \nPresident's budget request for the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration in the fiscal year 2008 budget.\n\n  I also note that because the President's budget failed to do so in \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007, the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee \nsecured funding, at my request, to hire additional mine safety \ninspectors and to bolster safety enforcement at MSHA.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter for their support \nand their stalwart advocacy of these requests. They are true champions \nof the coal miners.\n  Since the Appropriations Committee reported this bill in June, \nanother tragedy occurred in Utah where six miners were trapped at the \nCrandall Canyon Mine. During the rescue operation, three miners lost \ntheir lives, one of them a Federal mine inspector. The original six \nminers who had been trapped were never found. They remain entombed to \nthis very minute, this very hour, this very day. They remain entombed \nin Crandall Canyon.\n  When the Congress returned from its August recess, the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Senate Labor HHS Subcommittee conducted a \nhearing to examine MSHA's actions at Crandall Canyon.\n  In response to several questions I asked based on articles in West \nVirginia's Charleston Gazette, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for \nMine Safety and Health informed me that MSHA had not been performing \nthe full quarterly inspections required by the Mine Act. I learned that \nMSHA has fallen dangerously, shockingly behind on its mine inspections \nacross the Nation.\n  In southern West Virginia, the inspection rate had been allowed to \ndecline from 89 percent in 2006 to 63 percent in 2007. MSHA needs the \npersonnel, MSHA needs the budget to perform its primary and most basic \nfunctions; MSHA needs support staff to properly assess penalties; MSHA \nneeds resources to review and certify safety equipment; MSHA needs the \ncapacity and the personnel to train more inspectors.\n  Years of attrition and budget cuts by the Bush administration--let me \nsay that again--years of attrition and budget cuts by the Bush \nadministration have left critical positions unfilled at MSHA, \nincapacitating the Agency in many respects.\n  During a recent meeting in my office, the Assistant Secretary for \nMSHA, in response to my request, described a plan for MSHA to achieve \n100 percent of the inspections required by the Mine Act. The plan would \nrequire many tens of thousands of overtime hours and the transfer of \ninspectors from districts across the country.\n  I have been told that these additional measures would be sufficient \nto fill the current gaps in the inspection schedules, at least until \nnew inspectors can be trained and are able to assume their full \nresponsibilities.\n  Now the problem falls to the Congress. That is here. The problem \nfalls to the Congress to figure how to pay for this interim plan and \nhow to fix these very serious budget deficiencies at MSHA.\n\n[[Page S13044]]\n\n  Even after the most horrific year of mine fatalities in a decade, the \nPresident's budget request still does not include adequate funds to \nenable MSHA to conduct, in full, the most basic safety inspection.\n  The President's budget request--let me say that again. Our \nPresident's budget request--let me say that again--our President's \nbudget request does not even include the necessary funds to help MSHA \ncomply with the mandates of the new MINER Act which the President \nsigned into law.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment that would add $10 million. Did you \nhear that? It would add $10 million to MSHA's budget. These funds are \nnecessary to enable MSHA both to complete the safety inspections \nrequired by the law and also to implement the mandates required by the \nMINER Act.\n  The amendment would be fully offset by a reduction in travel \nexpenditures for the departments and the agencies funded in the \nunderlying bill. It would save lives. The funds enable MSHA to support \nadditional hours of overtime for mine inspectors and specialists and to \npay for travel for inspectors temporarily reassigned.\n  In addition, this amendment enables MSHA to hire additional support \nand administrative staff and to designate education specialists to \nbetter train new mine inspectors. The amendment would allow MSHA to \nbegin to reduce its backlog of applications for certification and \napproval of new safety technologies. The amendment would spur \nexpeditious approval of a truly wireless communications and tracking \nsystem that can meet the requirements of the MINER ACT.\n  As SAGO--SAGO, a terrible word because of that terrible tragedy--\nCrandall Canyon, and too many other recent mine disasters have made \ndeadly clear, mine safety must not be funded on the cheap. The Congress \nmust fund MSHA's true budgetary needs, and it must have the candid \nappraisal of the Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration. Tell it to us straight. I say to them, tell it to us \nstraight. Anything less is a threat to the health and safety of our \nminers.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Specter, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3362:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a)  In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $10,000,000 for necessary expenses for salaries and expenses \n     of the Mine Safety and Health Administration.\n        (b) Amounts made available under this Act for travel \n     expenses for the Department of Labor, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education \n     shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by the percentage \n     necessary to decrease the overall amount of such spending by \n     $10,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it is my understanding that someone is \nneeded on the other side of the aisle. I can certainly appreciate that. \nI want to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  I am advised by the able staff on the other side that Senator Specter \nwould agree to having the yeas and nays. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey and Mr. Sanders pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2191 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, we have a saying in some parts of \nMissouri, and I think it is a common saying in some rural parts of \nAmerica: That dog won't hunt. I rise today to speak a few minutes about \nthe Presidential veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Mr. President, that dog won't hunt. All America has to do is look at \nthe rationale for the veto and look at the tale of two programs--and \nthat would be T-A-L-E.\n  The President says he is vetoing children's health care because it is \ntoo expensive. It is a $35 billion expansion over 5 years--an average \nof $7 billion a year. The President says he is vetoing the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program because it is providing health insurance for \nwealthy families or families who can afford health insurance on their \nown.\n  This is a President who is out of touch. When a family of four making \naround $50,000 is facing over $1,200 a month in health insurance costs, \nthat is a crisis in our country, and one that the majority in Congress \nhas recognized. That is why we have prioritized the children. This is a \nprogram for low-income children, for modest-income children, and it is \nimportant we give them this health insurance. The President says it is \ntoo expensive. We pay for it. It is a novel concept around here that we \nare paying for it.\n  Now, let's dial back the calendar a few years and look at Medicare \nPart D. Was it expensive? Yee howdy, was it expensive. Try $710 billion \nover 10 years--an average of $70 billion a year. Was there a way to pay \nfor it? Absolutely not. No way to pay for it. We just wrote a bad check \nfor it. We had no way of paying for it. Was it for modest-income \nAmericans or low-income Americans? Oh, no. Oh, no. It was for anybody \nin America. You could be a billionaire and participate in Medicare Part \nD.\n  So let me see if I get this straight. We have one program that is not \npaid for that is 10 times more expensive than the Children's Health \nInsurance Program that is for wealthy people in America--and it is OK \nthe year before the President stood for reelection, it is OK with my \nRepublican colleagues who voted against the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, it is OK with some of my colleagues from Missouri in Congress \non the other side of this building who are voting to uphold the \nPresident's veto today. They voted for Medicare Part D.\n  So what is the difference? Why is one program not fiscally \nirresponsible and inappropriate? But the program for low-income \nchildren, why is it so bad? Well, the devil is in the details. And the \ndetails in this instance are that the people who wanted Medicare Part D \nwere the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies. It is \nestimated they are going to make close to $150 billion off Medicare \nPart D. That is why this dog won't hunt. Because what this is about is \nthe private insurance companies and private drug companies making \nmoney. Then it is OK to give the benefit to wealthy people and to not \nhave a way to pay for it. But if it is going to the children and nobody \nis going to make any money off of it, then all of a sudden it is evil.\n\n  No wonder the people of America are outraged. No wonder our phones \nare ringing off the hook. No wonder the Members of Congress who are \nwilling to uphold this veto are feeling the heat. They ought to feel \nthe heat. This is the right thing to do. We should be taking care of \nthese children. It is the least we can do as Americans to face the \nhealth care crisis that we face right now.\n  So I urge my colleagues from Missouri--especially those who are \nvoting to sustain the President's veto--to reconsider because if you \nvoted for Medicare D and you are saying this is a problem, you know \nwhat: America will figure that out.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my colleague \nfrom Missouri for her wonderful comments as it relates to health care. \nAlso, as to the bill in front of us, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa for his passionate commitment to the right things as it \nrelates to the values and priorities for our families: health care, \neducation, and focusing on things that really matter to families every \nday.\n  I specifically come to the floor, though, because we just saw a vote \nin the House of Representatives that was just completed regarding the \nchildren's\n\n[[Page S13045]]\n\nhealth care legislation. Unfortunately, it fell short of the override \nwe need to have happen in order to be able to provide health insurance \nfor 10 million children in America--10 million children of working \nfamilies who are working very hard. They don't want to be on public \nassistance and Medicaid so that their children can get coverage; they \nwant to work. They are working, but they are not in a position to be \nable to afford private health care coverage and they don't have it at \nwork. So we are, through the children's health care program, rewarding \nwork and rewarding the families of America who want to make sure their \nchildren have health insurance.\n  It is my understanding that there was just a vote that fell short. \nThere were 273 colleagues in the House of Representatives--and I \ncommend every one of them.\n  All of those who have worked so hard on both sides of the aisle in \nthe House and the Senate should be commended again. Certainly, our \nleader, Senator Reid, the Speaker, Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Hatch--all of our bipartisan colleagues \nshould be thanked for their efforts one more time.\n  I come to the floor to say that we are not done. We are not done. The \npeople of this country are appalled at the lack of understanding of \nwhat average families are going through today. This President will be \nshortly asking us to approve another $200 billion for the war in Iraq--\nthat will be paid for by our children, by the way, because it is not \npaid for; it goes on the national deficit, so our children and \ngrandchildren will be paying for it--but says no to a program that is \nfully paid for, that invests $7 billion a year in making sure the \nchildren of America have health insurance. Seven billion dollars versus \n$200 billion, on top of another half a trillion dollars that has \nalready been spent, on a war the American people want to stop as it is \ncurrently constituted. They want to change that mission and focus on \nthings that will certainly keep us safer.\n  So I come to the floor to, first of all, commend everyone who has \nbeen involved to this point. I am very proud to be a member of the \nFinance Committee, where we worked very hard to put together a \nbipartisan agreement. But we are not done. This is a mainstream program \nsupported by the broadest possible coalition you could have, from the \nbusiness community and the large pharmaceutical companies to Families \nUSA and to organized labor and child advocates and health care \norganizations. This is mainstream. This is the broadest possible \ncoalition. Unfortunately, I regret to say it has been defeated by \nmisinformation presented by folks who think that if they repeat long \nenough that somehow this covers people making $83,000 a year or repeat \nlong enough that illegal immigrants are covered, that it somehow makes \nit true. Now, as the distinguished Chair knows, even in looking at the \nissue of documented or undocumented immigrants, even those who are here \nlegally were asked to--were basically put in a position not to be able \nto receive children's health care help.\n  So to be able to address all of this misinformation that is out \nthere, there is a real issue about that which needs to be fixed. So we \nhave seen lack of information, misinformation, and more that has gone \non with this proposal. In the short term, it seems to have worked, but \nit will not work in the long run because the reality is this is the \nright thing to do. It was passed 10 years ago by a Democratic President \nand a Republican Congress. I remember that debate. I was in the House \nof Representatives at the time in 1997. This was a positive step \nforward to support families working hard every day, trying to make sure \nthey can put food on the table, pay the mortgage, buy the school \nclothes, and then have children's health care, have health care for \ntheir children, maybe be able to take them to the dentist so they don't \nend up with an abscessed tooth and the outrageous situation that \nhappened with a child who died whom we all read about in the paper.\n  This is about moral values, priorities. When this President now comes \nto us asking for another $200 billion for a war that is not paid for, \nthat is putting brave American men and women in the middle of a civil \nwar in Iraq every day, I want to have him answer the question: Why?\n  Why, Mr. President, is it all right to add $200 billion more to the \ndebt and ask our children and grandchildren to pay for it, yet you are \nnot willing to stand with the children of America, 10 million children \nin America who are counting on us to be able to make sure they can get \nbasic health care? There is something fundamentally wrong with this.\n  I urge colleagues to join with us. We are not going to stop until \nthis is addressed because it is the right thing to do from a moral \nstandpoint, and from a fiscal standpoint it is the right thing to do.\n  When children can't go to the doctor, their family can only use the \nemergency room or the child gets sicker than they otherwise would \nbecause they only have the emergency room to go to. They can't go to a \ndoctor. The hospital pays, and then who picks up the tab? Every \nbusiness that has health insurance. So from a practical economic \nstandpoint, it makes sense. Certainly from a moral standpoint, it makes \nsense.\n\n  I think this is one of the proudest moments we have had in the \nSenate, of people of diverse backgrounds and philosophies coming \ntogether, putting the ideology at the door, and saying: You know what, \nthis is about children. I don't know how many times I heard the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, the distinguished chairman, say: \nThis is about the kids. Just keep focused on the kids. And because we \ndid that in this Chamber, we came up with something we can all be very \nproud of.\n  The American people want to know that we reward work in this country \nand that we understand that families who are desperately concerned \nabout health care for their children ought to be able to have a right \nto be able to purchase an affordable policy that will allow them to \nhave their children get the health care they need.\n  So I appreciate our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee allowing me to speak. I am deeply disappointed, along with \npeople all across America, at the vote that just happened. But we are \nnot done. Ten million children and their families are counting on us, \nand we are not going to stop until they have the health care they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor her very eloquent and very timely statement on what just happened \nin the House. I guess it just transpired a little while ago. I think \nprobably all of us were hoping that somehow the Members of the other \nbody would come to realize this had broad support across the country--\nthe SCHIP bill--and the fact that the $35 billion we had in there over \n5 years was something that is sorely needed. I think we were all hoping \nthis would pass. So when I just heard the Senator from Michigan say it \nfailed by only getting 273 votes--we need 290 in the House to override \na veto--that is a shame because it is obvious that we here in the \nSenate have the votes to override a veto.\n  So what can I say? Seventeen people prevented this from becoming law \nand from providing the health care our children need in this country--\nchildren of working parents. Mostly these are people who are a working \nparent or parents, they are contributing to society, they are taxpaying \nindividuals, but they simply don't have enough money to buy the kind of \nhealth insurance they need to cover their kids. So this really is a \nslap in the face to the middle class in America, the middle-class \npeople who are struggling to make ends meet and trying to provide a \ngood education for their kids, maybe trying to put something away for a \nrainy day or for retirement, and they just don't have the money for \nhealth insurance. The Senator from Michigan is so right.\n  I don't mind if the President is opposed to this, but I think he has \nan obligation to speak truthfully to the American people. When he came \nout yesterday--I think it was just yesterday I heard this--he said: \nWell, it would cover kids with families earning up to $83,000 a year. \nWell, that is just simply not factually true. It would be if he signed \nit--I mean, it is up to the\n\n[[Page S13046]]\n\nPresident to approve or not approve those. So is he saying that if the \nbill went through, he would approve it? That doesn't make sense. So \nthat was disingenuous on his part. Also, as the Senator from Michigan \npointed out, that somehow this would cover immigrant children, that is \nabsolutely forbidden in the bill.\n  So I thank the Senator from Michigan for her long efforts in this \nregard as a member of the Finance Committee, as well as the occupant of \nthe chair, who I know is a member of the Finance Committee and who also \nhas worked very hard to reach a compromise, a bipartisan agreement on \nthis bill to send it to the President. All I can say is, when people \nask me now what are we going to do, well, what we are going to do is we \nare going to try to do something to move this forward. We can't just \nsit back and say that because of 17 people we can't move ahead.\n  So I think most of us who feel very strongly about the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program are going to do everything we can between now \nand the time we adjourn to get this back up and try to get it to the \nPresident, and hopefully by then there will be enough momentum behind \nit that he will sign it. But I don't think we should just sit back and \nlet it linger.\n  So I thank the Senator from Michigan for all of her strong support \nfor the SCHIP bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3362\n\n  Mr. President, turning back now to this bill in front of us, the \nchairman of the full Appropriations Committee, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, Senator Byrd, had offered an amendment on MSHA, \nthe Mine Safety Health Administration, to provide an additional $10 \nmillion for that. It was fully offset by a reduction of $10 million in \ntravel expenses for the Department of Labor, the Department of Health \nand Human Services, and the Department of Education. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  Our subcommittee held two hearings on MSHA this year. What we learned \nis they still don't have two-way communication and tracking technology \nthat would operate after an accident in an underground coal mine. Other \ncountries seem to do quite well in that--Poland, Australia--other \ncountries seem to be able to do that, but we can't. MSHA has been \ndragging its feet on this for a long time.\n  Our inspector force has been growing over the last couple of years, \nagain thanks to Senator Byrd, who in the 2006 supplemental put in $25 \nmillion to train and to equip the inspectors. But even with that, MSHA \nstill is not capable of conducting 100 percent of the inspections in \nour Nation's coal mines. That 100 percent is required. That is a \nrequirement. Yet they still can't do it.\n  This is something I think is sorely needed. I support it, and I hope \nthe Senate will adopt the Byrd amendment to the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3368.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for activities to reduce infections from \n    methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and related \n                              infections)\n\n       On page 50, line 5, insert before the period the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That $5,000,000 shall be for activities \n     to reduce infections from methicillin-resistant \n     staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and related infections''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Specter, and Senator Kennedy. We have seen, in the last \n24 hours or so, horrific stories come out about this new bacteria that \nis invulnerable to our first line of antibiotics. It is a dangerous \ngerm and it is spreading all over the country.\n  There was a story in the paper this morning about cases nearby here. \nA teenager died recently in Bedford County, VA, because of methicillin-\nresistant staphylococcus, or MRSA. As of yesterday, Montgomery County \nschools had 14 cases, Anne Arundel County had 1 reported MRSA \ninfection. They have received 57 reports from parents about other \npossible cases. Two cases have been confirmed at Wild Lake High School \nin Howard County. So something is going on.\n  Some of these schools are trying to clean up. We have one here, where \nthe Rappahannock County School System finished a comprehensive cleaning \nof its two campuses, and the cost was more than $10,000. That is one \ncost. The cost in human life and suffering is growing.\n  We all are very concerned--and rightfully so--about the number of \npeople losing their lives to the AIDS virus every year. But the fact is \nmore people are dying because of this staphylococcus than they are of \nAIDS. MRSA was calculated with striking 31.8 out of 100,000 Americans, \nwhich translates into 94,360 cases and 18,650 deaths nationwide a year. \nIn comparison, complications from the AIDS virus killed about 12,500 \nAmericans last year.\n  So what is happening is that this microbe is spreading. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention have calculated about 19,000 deaths \na year. So, again, it seems to me we need to pay some attention to this \nand we need to respond to it as rapidly as possible.\n  This amendment basically says they shall spend a minimum of $5 \nmillion--take $5 million out now to focus on identifying and containing \nand trying to hold down the spread of this terrible bacteria. It is not \na virus, it is a bacteria. So, again, Senator Specter, Kennedy, and I \nwanted to introduce this to let the public know we are trying to get on \ntop of it. Hopefully, we will have hearings with the CDC soon to find \nout what they are doing.\n  This amendment would increase activities in hospitals and other \nhealth care settings, aimed at preventing the spread of this deadly \nbacteria. So I will leave it there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point an article that appeared today on Washingtonpost.com \nregarding this MRSA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post Oct. 17, 2007.]\n\n        Drug-Resistant Staph Germ's Toll Is Higher Than Thought\n\n                             (By Rob Stein)\n\n       A dangerous germ that has been spreading around the country \n     causes more life-threatening infections than public health \n     authorities had thought and is killing more people in the \n     United States each year than the AIDS virus, federal health \n     officials reported yesterday.\n       The microbe, a strain of a once innocuous staph bacterium \n     that has become invulnerable to first-line antibiotics, is \n     responsible for more than 94,000 serious infections and \n     nearly 19,000 deaths each year, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention calculated.\n       Although mounting evidence shows that the infection is \n     becoming more common, the estimate published today in the \n     Journal of the American Medical Association is the first \n     national assessment of the toll from the insidious pathogen, \n     officials said.\n       ``This is a significant public health problem. We should be \n     very worried,'' said Scott K. Fridkin, a medical \n     epidemiologist at the CDC.\n       Other researchers noted that the estimate includes only the \n     most serious infections caused by the germ, known as \n     methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n       ``It's really just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Elizabeth \n     A. Bancroft, a medical epidemiologist at the Los Angeles \n     County Department of Public Health who wrote an editorial in \n     JAMA accompanying the new studies. ``It is astounding.''\n       MRSA is a strain of the ubiquitous bacterium that usually \n     causes staph infections that are easily treated with common, \n     or first-line, antibiotics in the penicillin family, such as \n     methicillin and amoxicillin. Resistant strains of the \n     organism, however, have been increasingly turning up in \n     hospitals and in small outbreaks outside of heath-care \n     settings, such as among athletes, prison inmates and \n     children.\n       On Monday, Ashton Bonds, 17, of Lynch Station, Va., \n     succumbed to MRSA, prompting officials to shut down 21 \n     Bedford County schools today for cleaning to prevent further \n     infections. The infection had spread to Bonds's kidneys, \n     liver, lungs and the muscle around his heart.\n       The MRSA estimate is being published with a report that a \n     strain of another bacterium, which causes ear infections in \n     children, has become impervious to every approved antibiotic \n     for youngsters.\n       ``Taken together, what these two papers show is that we're \n     increasingly facing antibiotic-resistant forms of these very \n     common organisms,'' Bancroft said.\n       The reports underscore the need to develop new antibiotics \n     and curb the unnecessary use\n\n[[Page S13047]]\n\n     of those already available, experts said. They should also \n     alert doctors to be on the lookout for antibiotic-resistant \n     infections so patients can be treated with the few remaining \n     effective drugs before they develop serious complications, \n     experts said.\n       MRSA, which is spread by casual contact, rapidly turns \n     minor abscesses and other skin infections into serious health \n     problems, including painful, disfiguring ``necrotizing'' \n     abscesses that eat away tissue. The infections can often \n     still be treated by lancing and draining sores and quickly \n     administering other antibiotics, such as bactrim. But in some \n     cases the microbe gets into the lungs, causing unusually \n     serious pneumonia, or spreads into bone, vital organs and the \n     bloodstream, triggering life-threatening complications. Those \n     patients must be hospitalized and given intensive care, \n     including intravenous antibiotics such as vancomycin.\n       In the new study, Fridkin and his colleagues analyzed data \n     collected in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, \n     Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Tennessee, \n     identifying 5,287 cases of invasive MRSA infection and 988 \n     deaths in 2005. The researchers calculated that MRSA was \n     striking 31.8 out of every 100,000 Americans, which \n     translates to 94,360 cases and 18,650 deaths nationwide. In \n     comparison, compliions from the AIDS virus killed about \n     12,500 Americans in 2005. ``This indicates these life-\n     threatening MRSA infections are much more common than we had \n     thought,'' Fridkin said.\n       In fact, the estimate makes MRSA much more common than \n     flesh-eating strep infections, bacterial pneumonia and \n     meningitis combined, Bancroft noted.\n       ``These are some of the most dreaded invasive bacterial \n     diseases out there,'' she said. ``This is clearly a very big \n     deal.''\n       The infection is most common among African Americans and \n     the elderly, but also commonly strikes very young children.\n       ``We see these cases all the time,'' said Robert S. Daum, a \n     pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the University of \n     Chicago. ``In the last five weeks, I've taken care of five \n     children who were sick enough to be hospitalized and require \n     intensive care.''\n       Studies have shown that hospitals could do more to improve \n     standard hygiene to reduce the spread of the infection. \n     Individuals can reduce their risk through common-sense \n     measures, such as frequent handwashing.\n       In the second paper, Michael E. Pichichero and Janet R. \n     Casey of the University of Rochester in New York documented \n     the emergence of an antibiotic-resistant strain of another \n     bacterium known as Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes \n     common ear infections. Although 11 children identified in the \n     Rochester area with the microbe so far were successfully \n     treated, five required an antibiotic approved only for \n     adults, and one child was left with permanent hearing loss.\n       The researchers attributed the emergence of the strain to a \n     combination of the overuse of antibiotics and the \n     introduction of a vaccine that protects against the \n     infection.\n       ``The use of the vaccine created an ecological vacuum, and \n     that combined with excessive use of antibiotics to create \n     this new superbug,'' Pichichero said.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the knowledge of other Senators, we \nare trying to reach an agreement to get to a series of votes. We don't \nquite have it yet, but hopefully in the next few minutes we will agree \nto have a series of votes starting fairly soon.\n  With that, I see my friend, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \non the floor.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside so I might call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3350\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I call up amendment No. 3350, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 3350.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to provide abstinence education \n        that includes information that is medically inaccurate)\n\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n         Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be used to provide abstinence education that includes \n     information that is medically inaccurate. For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``medically inaccurate'' means \n     information that is unsupported or contradicted by peer-\n     reviewed research by leading medical, psychological, \n     psychiatric, and public health publications, organizations \n     and agencies.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before I speak on my amendment, I \noffer my personal thanks to Senators Harkin and Specter for their hard \nwork in putting together an excellent bill. It puts more resources, in \nparticular, into the well-being of our most precious asset: our \nchildren.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Harkin and Senator Specter as a member \nof the subcommittee in providing more of the resources needed for \nhealth and education programs that have been shortchanged by this \nadministration over the last several years.\n  The best part of this bill is that we have a chance to help children \nlive longer, healthier, and more productive lives. The worst part of it \nis that, despite all of its benefits, the President said he intends to \nveto the bill.\n  This bill increases Head Start funding by $200 million. Today in New \nJersey, more than 14,000 children depend on Head Start for their early \neducation. This bill also recognizes growing concerns about the \nterrible conditions of autism. It is a growing problem. Studies have \nshown that 1 in 94 children in New Jersey will be born with or carry \nautism in their lives. From 1991 to 2005, the number of cases diagnosed \nas autistic went from 234 in 1991 to 7,400 cases in 2005, a mere 15 \nyears. To see an increase such as this must be paid attention to. These \nnumbers are alarming.\n  I congratulate our committee for this welcome addition for funding \nautism detection. Families across America are ever more anxious about \nthis health threat. Also alarming are the statistics on another health \nproblem in our country. We have the highest rate of teen pregnancy in \nthe industrialized world. America sees 19 million cases of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, and almost half of them strike young people. That \nis why Senator Snowe from Maine and I are offering an amendment to make \nsure our young people get the truth about their health, so they don't \nbecome one of these statistics. America's young people should expect \nthe truth from their doctor, they should expect it from their parents, \nand they certainly should expect it from a government-funded program. \nWe cannot expect young people to make life-changing decisions if they \nget the wrong information from the Government. We have a responsibility \nto give them the most accurate information available when communicating \nwith them.\n  Right now, the Federal Government is falling down on the job. We have \ngiven out hundreds of millions of dollars for abstinence-only \neducation. The fact of the matter is these programs are not successful. \nIf we are going to spend as much as a dime on them, we must be good \nstewards of the people's tax dollars and make sure the information \nbeing given out is complete and truthful. Yet we have found case after \ncase of incorrect and potentially harmful information being taught in \nthese programs.\n  In 2004, a report found that of the 13 most common federally funded \nabstinence programs, 11 have unproven claims and basic scientific \nerrors. In fact, the office in the Department of Health and Human \nServices in charge of these programs doesn't even bother to check \nwhether they are providing accurate medical or scientific information. \nIt is time to change this policy. Young people have a right to complete \nand accurate information that protects their health and may save their \nlives.\n  The amendment Senator Snowe and I are offering would make sure they \nget it right. Our amendment says Federal money is not to be spent on \ninaccurate and deceptive information. Millions of children in New \nJersey and across this country deserve no less.\n  We have seen misstatements made about the failures of contraception. \nWhat does that mean? It means diseases are more likely to be \ntransmitted. It also means the number of teen pregnancies could \nincrease based on misinformation.\n  The Senate had approved this amendment in the 2006 appropriations \nbill. I hope and urge that we pass it again this year. What is more, I \ncommend the leadership of this committee, Senators Harkin and Specter, \nfor constructing a bill that is going to help our young children better \noff in their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S13048]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey for his amendment. Senator Specter and I had put into the bill a \nprohibition on abstinence-only programs providing information that is \nmedically inaccurate. Again, this is the beauty of having issues such \nas this come to the floor. Senator Lautenberg and Senator Snowe have \noffered a suggestion to tighten down on that provision and actually \nmake it more meaningful.\n  This is what the amendment says:\n\n       For purposes of this section, the term ``medically \n     inaccurate'' means information that is unsupported or \n     contradicted by peer-reviewed research by leading medical, \n     psychological, psychiatric, and public health publications, \n     organizations and agencies.\n\n  That clarifies the intent of the amendment. I thank Senator \nLautenberg for the amendment, and I intend to support it.\n  Hopefully, we are going to have clearance soon to begin a series of \nvotes. We do not have that agreement yet, but we hope in the next 15 \nminutes we will begin a series of four votes. We don't have that \nagreement yet. Hopefully, we will have that cleared pretty soon. In the \nmeantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3365 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I call up the Roberts amendment No. 3365.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will \nreport the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3365 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To fund the small business child care grant program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SMALL BUSINESS CHILD CARE GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       For carrying out the small business child care grant \n     program under section 8303 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, \n     Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability \n     Appropriations Act, 2007 (42 U.S.C. 9858 note) $5,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended. Each amount otherwise \n     appropriated in this Act for administrative expenses for the \n     Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, \n     and Department of Education shall be reduced on a pro rata \n     basis by the amount necessary to provide the amount referred \n     to in the preceding sentence.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer and the expert staff we \nhave working for us.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that I truly believe will have a \npositive effect on the quality of life for many hard-working American \nfamilies. Access to childcare is essential to the quality of life of \nfamilies trying to balance both work and family.\n  Earlier this year, S. 228, my small business childcare grant program, \nwas incorporated into and passed as part of the supplemental spending \nbill. I thank Senators Kennedy and Dodd for working with me to secure \nthis authorization. This truly was a bipartisan effort.\n  My amendment today provides the funding for this program so that we \ncan make a difference for American families.\n  Unfortunately, our small businesses generally do not have the \nresources required to start up and support a childcare center. The \nsmall business childcare grant program provides flexible short-term \nfunding to encourage small businesses to work together or with other \nlocal organizations to provide childcare services for their employees.\n  Small businesses will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 for \nstartup costs and for training, for scholarships, and other related \nactivities. Grants will be given to States on a competitive basis with \nthe grant amount to be determined by the population of the State. \nPriority will be given to grantees who work with other small \nbusinesses, large businesses, nonprofit agencies, local governments, or \nother appropriate entities to provide childcare in an underserved \ngeographical area of the State.\n  The grantees will be required to match Federal funds to encourage \nself-sustaining facilities well into the future--50 percent for the \nfirst year, 67 percent for the second year, 75 percent for the third \nyear. The Secretary is required to report to Congress in 2-year and 4-\nyear intervals on the effectiveness of the program, and the program \nwill sunset in 2012.\n  It seems to me this is a fiscally responsible approach to increasing \naccess to childcare. The matching requirement, paired with the program \nand the sunset, will ensure that Federal funds are used in an efficient \nand targeted manner.\n  This program has been authorized at $50 million over 5 years. My \namendment appropriates only $5 million for fiscal year 2008.\n  I urge support for this amendment to help ease the burden on working \nfamilies by encouraging the development of small business childcare \nprograms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President we now have clearance for a series of \nvotes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote in relation to Senator \nByrd's amendment No. 3362 at 2:30 p.m.; that upon disposition of that \namendment, the Senate vote in relation to Senator Harkin's amendment \nNo. 3368; that upon the disposition of that amendment, the Senate vote \nin relation to the Brown amendment No. 3348; that upon the disposition \nof that amendment, the Senate vote in relation to the Kyl amendment No. \n3321; that there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual \nform prior to each vote and that no other amendments be in order prior \nto these votes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have no objection to the Senator's \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senators should be alerted that beginning \nat 2:30 p.m., there will be a series of four votes. I do not ask for \nconsent now, but I will after the first vote, that the other three \nvotes be 10-minute votes. So there will be four votes starting at 2:30 \np.m.\n  Mr. President, I have a slight change in that unanimous consent \nagreement. It has been cleared. That the first vote at 2:30 p.m. will \nbe my amendment No. 3368; that following that amendment, it will be \nSenator Byrd's amendment No. 3362, and the rest as stated earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Snowe and Senator \nRockefeller be added as cosponsors of the amendment I offered on MRSA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the first amendment will be my amendment, \nand I have not asked for the yeas and nays as yet, so I now ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back, and the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3368. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There are 2 minutes \nequally divided before the vote, and at this time the yeas and nays \nhave not been ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this amendment strikes an earmark of $1 \nmillion in the bill, an earmark that would create a Woodstock museum \ncelebrating the Woodstock Festival in northern New York 38 years ago.\n  Now, some of you may believe it would be neat to celebrate Woodstock \nagain and to do so with a museum. To the extent you believe that, there \nis a private foundation as well as money available from the State of \nNew York that provides the funding.\n  To the extent one would argue it is only $1 million, and therefore \nsymbolic, the answer to that is, yes, it is, but I think the American \npeople want us to begin to make some votes that demonstrate we care \nabout setting priorities. Funding a Woodstock museum in New York is not \na priority above the funds that would help the children and the \npregnant women to whom this $1 million would otherwise go.\n  As to jobs, every one of us could spend $1 million in our States to \nhelp create jobs. But to justify this on the basis of it being a job-\ncreation program goes too far. The unemployment rate in this county, I \nam told, is less than the average nationwide.\n  So let's strike a blow for priorities. Let the American taxpayer know \nwe are willing to at least start somewhere to save their money and not \nwaste it on the Woodstock museum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this is the largest economic \ndevelopment program in one of our poorest counties. It is the Bethel \nPerforming Arts Center. It is a large complex. It is a $100 million \nprogram. Madam President, $85 million has been donated by a major \nphilanthropist. The State has put in close to $14 million. This is our \n$1 million.\n  Every one of you has a poor county. They have gotten together, and \nthis is their economic development project. It is not just a museum; it \nis a whole complex devoted to history in America from 1945 through to \nthe present.\n  If you believe in helping counties, if you believe every one of us \nwants the Federal Government not to just pass broad-brushed programs \nbut to help individual needs in our States--this one coming from the \nleaders who have spent years and years in the Catskills to try to bring \nthat area back--this is the project.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Madam President, I move to table amendment No. 3321 and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think everyone is aware that the House \ntoday failed to override the President's veto on SCHIP. I think \neverybody is aware that 18 Republicans joined with Democrats to pass \nthis bill in the Senate. This is a bill to support health insurance for \nlow-income children. It is something I think all of us want to make \nsure continues to go forward.\n  I haven't had the opportunity since I have been here to vote for a \nperfect bill. I doubt I will be able to do that during the course of \nthe time I am here in the Senate. I think everybody knows the \nPresident's budget, the budget's $5 billion is not enough to cover the \nprogram, even going forward as it is. I think everyone would agree we \ncan always trim a little bit out of any bill we put forth.\n  I have a letter here signed by 18 Republicans, the 18 Republicans who\n\n[[Page S13051]]\n\njoined with Democrats to make sure this bill was able to pass and \nhopefully to be able to fund insurance for low-income children. What \nthis letter does is asks the leadership of the House and the leadership \nof the Senate not to simply send back the bill that has already been \nvoted on, but to ask them to sit down with the President and let's \nnegotiate a bill that can cause this program to go forward as we all \nwant it to and discontinue all of the political rhetoric that is \ncentered around this issue.\n  I want to make sure children in America, like everyone else, have the \nopportunity, as low-income children, to be insured. I encourage the \nleadership of the House and Senate to sit down with the President and \nlet's come up with a bill that allows this very good program to go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I may call up an amendment which I will then later \nwithdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3356 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3356.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3356 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify provisions relating to the Low Income Home Energy \n                          Assistance Program)\n\n       On page 55, strike lines 19 through 23 and insert the \n     following: ``U.S.C. 8623(a)-(d)), $2,161,170,000.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, was designed to provide funds to low-income \nindividuals who cannot cover rising home energy prices. The program \ndoes not discriminate between cold and hot weather States. However, \nupon implementation, cold weather States have unfairly received the \nmajority of the LIHEAP funds.\n  My amendment eliminates the discretionary nature in which the funds \nare disbursed and frees up money and allocates it on a nondiscretionary \nbasis.\n  Before I go into specifics of my amendment, I would first like to \ndiscuss how Arizona is affected by LIHEAP funds. This summer, record \nlevel temperatures have devastated the State. Phoenix set a record with \n32 days of temperatures exceeding 110 degrees. In August alone, Phoenix \nexperienced 9 days of temperatures of 110 degrees or above. The State \nof Arizona's average temperature for August 2007 was 105.8 degrees. It \nwas the second hottest summer on record in Arizona and the Salt River \nProject and Arizona Public Service reached peak demand for energy \nservice. Just imagine the cost to the people of Arizona to cool their \nhomes during such extreme heat. Therefore, LIHEAP funds are crucial to \nmany Arizonans who cannot meet their energy costs alone.\n  Let me now turn to the way in which LIHEAP funds are distributed. \nCurrently, LIHEAP funding is divided between two pots of money. The \nfirst pot is distributed based on a tiered funding formula, while the \nsecond pot of money is deemed a contingency fund distributed based on \n``emergencies.'' Historically, the contingency fund is overwhelmingly \ndistributed to cold weather States. My amendment would eliminate the \nbias inherent in the contingency fund distribution and allocate all \nLIHEAP money to the funding formula account that is more equitably \ndistributed to all 50 States. I would implore my colleagues to think of \nall Americans when considering my amendment, and vote to provide a more \nequitable distribution of LIHEAP funds.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3356 withdrawn\n\n  Madam President, having spoken to the manager of the bill, and \nappreciating the fact that the amendment was offered too late in the \nprocess, probably, to receive the consideration it deserves, we will \nwork on this at a later date. I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3373\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I believe, in accordance with our \nunderstanding on both sides, it would be appropriate for me to call up \namendment No. 3373, and I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \npending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Vitter, Mrs. \n     Dole, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Enzi, and \n     Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 3373.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount of funds available for the Office of \n                      Labor Management Standards)\n\n       On page 14, line 24, strike ``$436,397,000'' and insert \n     ``$441,397,000, of which $50,737,000 is for the Office of \n     Labor Management Standards (notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act for the administrative and related \n     expenses for departmental management for the Department of \n     Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \n     Department of Education shall be reduced on a pro rata basis \n     by $5,000,000),''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this amendment is similar to the one I \nintroduced yesterday, except it provides a different offset to pay for \nthe needed additional funds for the Office of Labor-Management \nStandards in the 2008 Labor-HHS budget.\n  This is a program that I believe is critically important. It is a \nprogram that has been very successful. It has resulted in over 700 \nprosecutions in the last several years and restitution to union members \nand union locals in the amount of about $101 million.\n  This is an important program. It is a working program. It represents \nthe only required audits, the only required reporting and disclosure \nfor unions in the country. The Securities and Exchange Commission does \nthat for corporations and other institutions that are required to be \naudited. Other than this program, there is no real integrity to protect \nunion members from fraud and corruption and theft. I will mention in a \nmoment some extraordinary thefts that have occurred from union members, \nwhy this is important, and I will express my personal and deep belief \nthat one reason we have as much broad corruption in unions is because \nwe are not auditing them. We are not doing it. Even with the current \nlevel of funding, we are way behind and it would take, at this rate, 33 \nyears to do a basic audit of all the unions around the country. That is \nnot acceptable.\n  People are not being watched. They feel like they are free and \ntemptation and money is coming before them. Obviously, people are \nsuccumbing to that temptation. More rigorous enforcement and audits are \nneeded. The Office of Labor-Management Standards is a group that is \nrequired to enforce the statutory provision that mandates that unions \nprovide, each year, public disclosure of how they spend their money. It \nwas a bill offered and passed in 1959 by former Senator and former \nPresident, John F. Kennedy. It was an important reform.\n  During the Clinton years, sadly, this reporting requirement was \nalmost totally abandoned and, under Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, in \nrecent years she has worked hard and those reporting numbers are up. \nBut 36 percent still don't report. There is not even a way, with our \nstaffing level, that she can insist on that. So 36 percent are not \nreporting properly. The members don't know where their money is being \nused. That is the fundamental question.\n  The committee mark doesn't even flat fund the Department; it cuts its \nfunding by $2 million. Every other enforcement agency is given an \nincrease, but this one is cut. I think our members ought to ask \nthemselves, do we need to be listening to certain union leaders who \ndon't want disclosure, or do we need to be listening to union members \nwhose funds and dues are being misappropriated? If we do regular \naudits, they will be more effective, and\n\n[[Page S13052]]\n\nI am convinced we will see a dropoff in this kind of problem. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  My proposal is to add $5 million, $2 million of which would get us \nback to last year's budget only, and a $3 million cost of living on top \nof that, so they can continue an aggressive effort to ensure integrity.\n  I have Senator Enzi with me, the ranking member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Senator Alexander, who are \nboth interested in speaking on this. I will yield to Senator Enzi at \nthis time. I believe I have 30 minutes; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Senator Sessions has offered a very important amendment, \nand I am pleased to be a cosponsor. The amendment restores critical \nfunding to the Department of Labor's Office of Labor-Management \nStandards. It is referred to as OLMS.\n  Funding for the Office of Labor-Management Standards in the current \nSenate bill is 20 percent below the requested amount, essentially \nscaled back from the 2006 level. Senator Sessions' amendment restores \nfunding to current fiscal year 2007 levels and adds an additional $3 \nmillion to continue audit and enforcement efforts.\n  What is the Office of Labor-Management Standards and why is it so \nimportant? The fact is the Office of Labor-Management Standards is the \nonly agency in the Federal Government that is devoted to protecting the \ninterests of American workers that pay union dues. It requires \nfinancial reporting and transparency by labor unions about how they use \ntheir members' money, and it investigates and prosecutes union \nofficials who are guilty of fraud or abuse of their members' financial \ninterests.\n  There should not be any reasonable debate about the importance of \nfinancial transparency for any entity, including labor unions. We \ndemand, as we should, corporate transparency in order to protect \nstockholders. Those who pay union dues are no less entitled to the \nbenefits of financial transparency and fraud protection than those who \npurchase stock. Indeed, purchasing stock is a voluntary activity, while \nin many instances the payment of union dues is not voluntary. \nProtecting the financial interests of working men and women, giving \nthem access to how their money is being used and providing remedies for \nthose instances where the money is misused ought to be a priority, not \nan afterthought.\n  It is the height of hypocrisy to talk about protecting the rights of \nworking men and women, or aiding the so-called middle class, while \nsimultaneously slashing the budgets of one of the Federal agencies that \nprotects the financial interests of those who pay union dues.\n  The Sessions amendment puts a question directly before the Senate. \nWill we vote down his amendment and allow the Office of Labor-\nManagement Standards funding to be rolled back and go out of our way to \nsend a message to the working men and women who pay union dues that \nprotecting their rights is unimportant? That is the question we are \nbeing asked.\n  I hope we will not tell them that protecting their rights is \nunimportant. This amendment gives the Senate a chance to go on record \nabout the importance of integrity in leadership elections, finances, \nand respect for the rights of individuals. We know every dollar in most \nof our paychecks matters. When we are compelled to give a portion of \nour paycheck away, either through taxes or union dues, it is an affront \nfor that money to be used to inflate someone else's lifestyle, or to be \nmisused in any other way. That is exactly what the Office of Labor-\nManagement Standards guards against.\n  OLMS enforces the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, a \nlaw enacted with bipartisan support, including that of then-Senator \nJack Kennedy.\n  In this administration alone, OLMS has returned nearly $102 million \nto union members who were robbed. There were only 8.7 million private \nsector employees represented by unions in 2006. I will restate that \nnumber. OLMS has returned $102 million to union members who were \nrobbed. OLMS has indicted 827 individuals and gotten convictions on 790 \nof them. That is a pretty good record. Again, they have indicted 827, \nand they have obtained convictions on 790. That is a very impressive \nconviction rate by any standard.\n  I have a State-by-State breakdown of those statistics, which I will \nenter into the Record. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            OLMS STATE

This is so my colleagues can see how many union-represented \nemployees have been protected in their States. These numbers indicate \nthat union corruption is not an issue to which we can turn a blind eye. \nIt may not be seen as politically correct by some in this body to fund \nan office that audits and investigates unions. But the truth is that \nhaving a strong Office of Labor Management Standards is the best thing \nwe can do to help the labor movement. Sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant. When rank-and-file employees feel everything is in the \nopen and they can trust union leaders, they are probably more likely to \njoin one.\n  It was the outcry of rank-and-file union members themselves that \nactually created the Office of Labor Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act. That act was born in the wake of egregious cases of \nfraudulent elections, embezzlement, and strong-arm tactics by a number \nof unions. The law also works to prevent backroom dealings between \nemployers and union leaders that disadvantage the employees. The first \nsection of the law, the Union Members Bill of Rights, was added by \nthen-Senator and later President John F. Kennedy.\n  I certainly understand that not every department can receive an \nincrease in every budget year. But what this bill does is quite \nremarkable. It singles out this one office, the Office of Labor-\nManagement Standards, as the only enforcement agency in the whole bill \nto have its funding decreased.\n  Senator Sessions and I are asking today that we simply keep the \nOffice of Labor-Management Standards at essentially the same funding \nlevel it received last year. The President requested an increase \nbecause OLMS has been taking on a number of projects, such as \ncompliance assistance for unions, which would especially be helpful in \nlight of their recent revised disclosure forms.\n  The funding called for in this amendment will be offset by a modest \nacross-the-board cut in general administrative expenses of the \ndepartments funded under this bill. This reduction in administrative \nexpenses is a very small price to pay in order to protect the rights of \nworking men and women. These workers deserve to know how their hard-\nearned money is being used and deserve to be protected from those who \nmisuse it.\n  I hope a majority of our colleagues will agree and vote in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Alabama \nyielding. I am due in the Judiciary Committee, where I am ranking, and \nwe are proceeding with the confirmation as to Judge Mukasey. I wish to \nspeak briefly in opposition to the amendment.\n  The figures which have been provided to me show that there has been \nan increase in the funding for the Office of Labor Management Standards \nup to $47,753,000--it does show a slight decrease on this year. But \noverall, since fiscal year 2001, the figure has risen from $30,492,000 \nto a figure of $47,753,000 for last year. This year it is, both the \nSenate and House figures, $45,737,000.\n  There has been a very substantial increase in the number of workers, \nand there is a concern about the complexity of the new form LM-2 which \nruns to more than 100 pages. The Department of Labor has issued some 88 \nanswers to frequently asked questions to try to address this new rule. \nHaving taken a look at it, it is not in line with the policy to try to \nreduce regulatory burdens because this new form is extremely \nburdensome.\n  The principal argument is going to be made by Senator Harkin. I have \nasked him to take the lead, to go ahead because I am due at a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on Judge Mukasey for Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the question before the Senate is \nwhether we think the union members of the United States are first-class \ncitizens or second-class citizens. The Sessions amendment says we \nrecognize union members as first-class citizens by increasing the \namount of money available to the Office of Labor-Management Standards, \nwhich collects the information to give them a chance to know what is \ngoing on within their union.\n  We treat stockholders as first-class citizens. We passed the \nSarbanes-Oxley law with a number of disclosure requirements for \nbusinesses. Some of the requirements may be burdensome, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, but we thought it \nwas important for the stockholders of this country to know what their \npublic corporations were doing.\n  We have disclosure requirements which we in the Senate are required \nto give every year. They are fairly burdensome, but we do that because \nthe voters need to know what our incomes are, what our assets are. They \nknow quite a bit about us because we are required to file these \nreports, and these reports are investigated by various officials and \nethics committees.\n  There are a number of people running for President of the United \nStates today, including a number in this body. They have to spend a lot \nof time filing information about where they get their contributions, \nbecause this is an era of instant information and almost universal \naccess to information and transparency. We hear that all the time. So, \nwe want the voters to know where the candidates for President are \ngetting their money to see whether that influences what they do.\n  In this age of transparency and universal access to information, we \ntreat stockholders as first-class citizens, we treat voters as first-\nclass citizens, we treat taxpayers as first-class citizens, but we will \nbe treating union members as second-class citizens if we are going to \ncut the funds the Department of Labor needs to provide union members \nwith information they deserve.\n  For example, this year the Senate, I am told, provides a $12.8 \nmillion increase in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe oversight agency for publicly-traded companies. So we are \nrecognizing the importance of treating stockholders as first-class \ncitizens, but at the same time we are cutting the funding for the \nOffice of Labor Management Standards, which means we are treating union \nmembers as second-class citizens.\n  That is the issue. A vote for the Sessions amendment says we believe \nunion members are as important as stockholders, are as important as \nvoters, are as important as taxpayers, and that they are all entitled \nto be treated as first-class citizens.\n  This is not, as has already been mentioned, a Republican cause, I \nwould hope. I have been around long enough to remember the Kefauver \ncommittee,\n\n[[Page S13054]]\n\nthe McClellan committee, Senator John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy in \nthe 1950s. It was the early days of television, and people who wanted \nto know about the Senate watched those Senators--one of whom later \nbecame President, one of whom later became Attorney General--as they \nferreted out corruption and organized crime in various parts of \nAmerican society, including unions.\n  This Federal statute we are talking about was championed by Senator \nJohn F. Kennedy. It was enacted as an outcome of the McClellan \ncommittee hearing. Senator Kennedy knew then, as we know today, that \nrank-and-file union members deserve the right to know how their unions \nare spending their money, how they are investing their members' money, \nthat their union books are clean, and that elections for union officers \nare fair and free of intimidation or scandal. They have a right to know \nthat information.\n  The question is, Do unions still need a Federal watchdog? Apparently \nso. The Secretary of Labor thinks so. She has said so. She has plenty \nto do over there. She could do more. She could use the money, according \nto her testimony.\n  Over the last 7 years, the Office of Labor Management Standards has \nperformed more than 3,000 audits, resulting in 827 indictments and 790 \nconvictions. There apparently is a lot to do in this area. What is our \nresponse? Let's cut the funding so we cannot have the investigations, \nso we cannot have the audits, so we cannot have the indictments, so we \ncannot give these union members the rights that Senator Kennedy--later, \nPresident Kennedy--thought they ought to have.\n  I hope we can correct what I hope is an oversight in the development \nof this big, complex piece of legislation. Senator Sessions' amendment \nwould treat union members as first-class citizens, just as we do \nstockholders, just as we do taxpayers, just as we do voters. We live in \nan era of instant information, universal access to information, and \nunion members, just as stockholders, voters, and taxpayers, have a \nright to know what is going on in their union.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Alexander for his \ncomments. Indeed, what we are talking about is funds contributed by \nunion members to further union causes, not to line the pockets of \npersons who embezzle, steal, or otherwise cheat and use the money. That \nis an important issue we need to keep in mind. It is troubling to me \nthat we have opposition to keeping this program on track.\n  I have offered this amendment, as I indicated earlier, a new \namendment that has a different offset. I know there was concern over \nthe international union funds that go to the U.N.-affiliated agency. \nThere is a big increase in that program, a $10 million increase. I am \ntroubled by that increase, frankly, because last year Secretary Chao \nmet with the people who were receiving this money, and they gave very \ninadequate explanations of where the money went. In fact, they couldn't \nexplain where it went. I don't know whether it is being well spent.\n  At any rate, the most important thing for us to do is focus on making \nsure we are protecting the contributions of union members and that \ntheir funds are being protected. That is why I altered the offset to \none that takes this $5 million from the administrative, management and \nrelated expenses of the Department of Labor, the Department of Health \nand Human Services, and the Department of Education. That is where the \nfunds would come from. I believe that would not be a heavy burden on \nthose agencies. In fact, they can absorb it readily, and this is \nclearly, as a question of priorities, more important to make sure we \nare not cutting back on this budget.\n  Senator Specter talked about the status of the budget. I repeat, I \nthink he understood it and explained it eventually correctly that the \ncommittee mark cuts the budget $2 million below last year's funding \nlevel. Because of inflation and cost increases, that is a most \nsignificant $2 million cut.\n  What we are proposing is that there be a $3 million increase in the \noverall budget, a total of $5 million--$2 million to get up to last \nyear's funding and an additional $3 million to increase the funding. I \nthink this is valid. I think it is justified. It is something we really \nshould do. If we don't do it, we are going to have a severe, adverse \nimpact on the ability of OLMS to fulfill their statutory requirement of \nauditing unions and requiring unions to publicly file their financial \ndisclosures.\n  Some say this is a burdensome regulation, but in today's day and age, \nbeing able to maintain records of where you spend your money is not too \nmuch to ask. Most of these records are done by computers now. People \nhave bookkeepers, and if they don't, they are taking serious risks. So \nto be able to report this information is not too much to ask. It is \nvery valuable to their members. Union members should have the same \nprotection, as Senator Alexander said, as corporate stockholders. This \nOLMS legislation is to union transparency what the Securities and \nExchange Commission is to corporate transparency.\n  This chart shows the mission of OLMS. The mission of OLMS is a good \nmission. It is not to harm anybody. It is to assist in the integrity of \nthis system--No. 1, to provide union financial transparency. That is \nwhy the bill was passed in 1959, so that union members can know where \ntheir money is being spent. That is the report which is required. Then \nto protect union financial integrity--that is part of the audit \nfunction of the OLMS. They are required to audit the union activities, \nand they do so, but, as I noted, even at this current level of funding, \nthey only get around to doing every union in the country once every 33 \nyears. Until we had some increases in this budget, it was once every \n133 years. It is a small agency, $47 million in last year's budget, but \nit has shown big results.\n  OLMS does not tell unions how to spend their money; it simply \nrequires them to file accurate and timely reports, which allows union \nmembers to determine for themselves whether the expenditures that are \nbeing made are appropriate. If they don't know what is happening, they \ncannot express their opinions in leadership meetings.\n  That there is a high level of demand from union members for this kind \nof information is very evident. This is a remarkable number. Between \nMay of 2006 and May of 2007, on the Web site of OLMS where these \nreports are posted so members can access them--so they don't have to go \ndown and ask the officer or the boss at the local union to ``give me \nyour records,'' they can just access them on the computer--767,980 hits \nwere identified on last year's Web site. People are looking to see \nwhere their elected union officers are spending their money. Why \nshouldn't they? That is an average of 64,000 a month and over 2,100 a \nday. If union members don't care about how their hard-earned dollars \nare being spent, I ask, why do they take time to access this Web site? \nOf course they want to know, they have a right to know, and the only \nway they are able to get this information in a readily available form \nis through this reporting requirement.\n  Unfortunately, the reports are not being submitted, and because of \nshortage of personnel and a certain lack of legal enforcement ability, \nonly 36 percent of unions are not filing the appropriate forms. The \ndelinquency rate is 36 percent. That is not good for union members.\n\n  Now, Secretary Chao has met with union leaders. But let me tell you \nwhat happened. Under the Clinton years, this was not being enforced. \nThat is just it. You want to know the truth? It was not being enforced. \nAnd the number of personnel went from 427, in about 1990, down to 260. \nThey just weren't enforcing this 1959 mandate. When Secretary Chao \nrealized it was her responsibility to make sure union members could see \nfinancial disclosure forms, and she asked that it be done, a lot of \ngrumbling occurred. They said, oh, it was burdensome; oh, there were \nproblems. So she met with them and met with them and they altered plans \nand they figured out ways to do it that were cheaper and better and \nless burdensome, but she required them to comply with the law that \nrequires this disclosure.\n  Now, after our colleagues have gained ascendancy in the Senate, lo \nand behold we come in and whack their budget. Now, who is being \nlistened to, politically powerful bosses or is it the interest of union \nmembers? Embezzlement is not something we ought to\n\n[[Page S13055]]\n\nsupport and put up with. We in Congress are focusing on transparency \nright here. We talk about it a lot. It is embarrassing to me that our \ncolleagues have seen this budget be reduced.\n  This chart gives a clear indication of just how significant overall \nthe problem is we are dealing with. From 2001 to 2007, 796 people were \nconvicted. Most of them pled guilty, and court-ordered restitutions \ntotaled $101 million. But I indicated to you that less than 5 percent \nof the unions per year are being audited, and it appears that for every \nfour of the audits that are conducted, about one person is convicted of \nsomething, on average. So we have a problem, we really do. And I submit \nit is not because people are necessarily bad people. Some of them may \nbe, but a lot of it is because there is no real oversight and \naccountability, and temptation is too great.\n  I have been a prosecutor for 15 years. I will tell you, you give \npeople lots and lots of money, it goes through their hands and nobody \nis watching it. Temptation takes over, and you will rightly expect \nproblems to occur if you don't have tight fiscal controls. We don't \nhave it. I think we need to have a lot more emphasis in this area than \nwe do, other than just a $3 million increase in this department. It is \nobvious.\n  We hear a lot of talk about integrity in here about our financial \ndisclosures and other things. Well, if we don't do our duty, people \nwill complain. If businesses don't file their reports, they will \ncomplain. And we need to make sure unions do the same, not to beat up \non unions but to help unions have integrity.\n  Now, not to be monotonous--and I find this remarkable--but some may \nsay, well, they are abusing unions and picking on people. But the \nconviction rate is 95 percent--95 percent of all indictments have \nresulted in convictions. They do not always get big sentences. I \nthought some I have seen were pretty light. But the point is, if you \nare convicted of these kinds of offenses, you lose your leadership \nposition in a union, and that is important. So if you are stealing from \na union, you ought not stay in as an officer.\n  So I would just suggest that from my review of the cases, people are \nnot being abused. They are being fairly treated. Overwhelmingly, the \ndefendants are pleading guilty, and restitution is being made. People \nwho are corrupt are not being able to remain in office to keep their \nhands in the till where the money is.\n  The legislation that requires this is not new. This law has been on \nthe books for some time. I will admit that we been very lax, and it was \nnot being enforced, but the conviction rate, the amount of restitution, \nthe number of fraud cases per audit indicates that was not a good \ndecision. And if the audit rates had been maintained, I submit we would \nhave had a lot less crime and fraud and loss of union members' money. \nThis occurred in 1959. One of the leaders of it was our own Senator \nRobert Byrd. He spoke earlier today. He has been here a long time. He \nwas here in 1959 when this bill passed. And as a Senator from West \nVirginia, a State with a strong union heritage, a proud union heritage, \nhe decided to vote for this bill.\n  The bill was actually introduced and led by Senator John F. Kennedy. \nThis is what Senator Kennedy said at the time.\n\n       The racketeers will not like it, the antilabor extremists \n     around the country will not like it, but I am confident that \n     the American people, and the overwhelmingly honest rank and \n     file union members, will benefit from this measure for many \n     years to come.\n\n  And until we stopped enforcing it a few years ago, or got lax, it has \nbeen beneficial. I think the work that is being done now, the $101 \nmillion in restitution, indicates that progress has been occurring that \nhas benefitted union members.\n  Now, Senator Byrd wrote a letter that was included in the \nCongressional Record in response to certain criticisms he received from \na district president of a union in West Virginia. They sent a letter of \ncondemnation, and Senator Byrd was direct about it. He responded:\n\n       The bill which passed the Congress will not hurt honest \n     unions, and it will give added protection to the rank and \n     file members in the unions. Honest union leaders have nothing \n     to fear from this legislation. The corruption and \n     racketeering that have been revealed in the fields of both \n     labor and management made it imperative that some kind of \n     legislation be enacted.\n\n  And I think that remains as true today as it was when he made those \ncomments in 1959.\n  Madam President, since 2001, OLMS has only had the resources to audit \n3,275 of the 26,000 unions on record. That means in the past 7 years \ncombined, only 12.5 percent of the unions have been audited. It is able \nto audit only about 2 to 4 percent of the unions each year. It is \nimportant to note that unlike corporations, unions are not required by \nlaw to have outside auditors. Most corporations have to have outside \nauditors. So in many cases, this audit is the only outside audit a \nunion will have.\n  In 2000, OLMS only did 204 audits out of well over 20,000 unions. \nThat is the equivalent of a union being audited once every 133 years. \nLast year, they did 736 audits, a better number, but that still \ntranslates into an audit only once every 33 years at that rate. It is \nbetter, but I think we need to do a lot more.\n  With the $2 million reduction in funding which is currently in the \nbill, it is estimated there will be approximately 350 fewer audits each \nyear, and that is almost cutting the number in half. So we should be \nseeking more, really, considering that from those 3,267 audits that \nwere completed there came 827 indictments and 796 convictions. OLMS has \nbeen funded below the President's requested levels over the past \nseveral years. Yet if the proposed cuts in the bill are implemented \nfunding will drop from $47.7 million to $45.7 million. That is below \nlast year's budget. So I would just note again that we had 427 \nemployees in this department in 1990. It fell down to 260, it has been \ninched up to 331, and if this bill passes in this form, cutting the \nbudget, we are going to see a loss of personnel instead of an increase \nin personnel. We ought to be closer to the 400, it seems to me. OLMS \nwas the only enforcement agency in the Labor Department that received a \nbudget cut during the congressional markup.\n  Let me mention this story of the United Transportation Union. We have \na picture I think is sad. It is a picture from an undercover operation. \nThe person who is handing off this money that is on this picture is a \nUTU-designated legal counsel by the name of Victor Bieganowski. The \nperson receiving the money is John Russell Rookard, 58, of Olalla, WA, \na top special assistant to Alfred Boyd, Jr., UTU president at the time \nthis bribe money was paid.\n  In 2004, Boyd, the international president of the Nation's largest \nrailroad operating union, pleaded guilty to participating in a bribery \nscheme involving Houston lawyers. Union officials extorted bribes from \nthe lawyers in exchange for access to injured union members.\n  A March 12, 2004, Houston Chronicle article explains that Byron \nAlfred Boyd, Jr., of Seattle, is the last of four officials of the UTU \nto plead guilty in a plan to extort bribes from lawyers in exchange for \naccess to these injured members.\n  Boyd admitted using the bribes he was paid--get this--to gain control \nof the union. He persuaded former union president Charles Leonard \nLittle of Leander, near Austin, to resign in exchange for $100,000 and \na new pickup. This would allow him, Boyd, to assume the presidency of \nthe union. Little resigned, but I guess he didn't get a promissory note \nor a mortgage because he was never paid his $100,000. Boyd not only \nstole from his union and breached the trust of his union members, he \ndidn't pay the man he promised to pay to give up his office. Little \npleaded guilty last year, as did former union insurance director Ralph \nJohn Dennis.\n  We have too many examples of this kind of disregard for the integrity \nof the funding of unions. People are being entrusted with this money, \nand it is not being managed well. And it is something that we need to \ndo more about, in my view.\n  Madam President, I would just share a few other examples which I \nthink are instructive of some of the problems that have occurred in \nrecent years.\n  In Pennsylvania, in June of 2007, in the eastern district of \nPennsylvania, Lawrence Marable and Deborah Powell, former president and \ntreasurer of AFGE Local 1793, representing employees at the VA Medical \nCenter, both\n\n[[Page S13056]]\n\npled guilty to conspiracy and theft of property in a special \nterritorial case. They conspired to convert dues checks and issued \nLocal 1793 checks for their personal use totaling $184,129. This was a \nvery serious matter, I suggest.\n\n  In May of this year, in Michigan, Alan Raines, former financial \nsecretary of Steelworkers Local 1358 was charged with embezzling union \nfunds in the amount of $274,262. That is not chicken feed. That is huge \nmoney. A lot of these unions do not have that many members, and the \ncost per member in one, I remember specifically, was about $1,000 per \nmember in the amount of loss that occurred.\n  Here, on April 2, 2007, in Puerto Rico, the president of the \nInternational Longshoremen's local was found guilty of 12 counts of \nembezzlement. He was charged among other counts with conspiracy to \nembezzle union funds in excess of $1,950,000. That is a breathtaking \namount. Both of those, in May and April of this year. In March of this \nyear, in New York, John Daley, former chief financial officer of the \nNew York State Nurses Association, was sentenced to time in prison \nafter pleading guilty to grand larceny for taking $1,193,000 in union \nfunds. These are public records. These are huge amounts of money.\n  In June of last year in Connecticut, a former financial secretary of \nLocal 745 of PACE was charged with taking $138,000, embezzling that \nmuch money.\n  In June of this year, in my hometown, sadly, the Southern District of \nAlabama, where I at one time was a Federal prosecutor myself in the \nUnited States District Court there, Kenneth Mays, the former treasurer \nof IBEW Local 1053, was sentenced after pleading guilty to embezzlement \nand ordered to pay $37,000 in restitution, reimbursement. This is right \nin my home state.\n  On July of last year, in Fulton County, GA, in the district court, a \nbookkeeper for IBEW Local 613 was indicted for taking $11,000.\n  In December of 2005, in the Northern District of Iowa, Debra Herrig \nwas sentenced and pled guilty to embezzling union funds and made \nrestitution in the amount of $13,000.\n  In December of 2004, in the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of Iowa, Rodney Fox was charged with embezzling \n$89,000 of union funds.\n  In May of 2005, in the Southern District of Iowa, Amanda Kemmer was \nsentenced to 24 months and ordered to pay $209,000 in full restitution \nfor embezzling union funds.\n  There are lots more I can indicate.\n  I will repeat. I don't believe there is any need for this kind of \ncriminal activity to go on. I believe a lot of it occurs because there \nis so little oversight. If we had a rigorous oversight and audit \nfunction by the Department of Labor, we would see a lot less of it. If \nthe unions were required to promptly and fully report the expenditures, \nunion members would be able to watch for problems and pick them up \nsooner and keep these kind of embezzlements from going to hundreds of \nthousands of dollars, even millions of dollars. That is why this \noffice, of all offices, should not be reduced.\n  I understand some people believe it is a burden, and for a good union \nthat never had any problems I guess filing it is a burden. It may not \nbe a necessary thing. But, really, probably it is because the union \nmembers get to see where their funds are being spent, honestly and \nfairly.\n  Most unions, of course, are honest and do a good job, and most union \nmembers are the salt of the Earth and couldn't be better people, and \nmost union leaders are honest and decent and work hard every day to \nprotect the interests of their own members. They try to make sure they \nget a fair deal in the workplace.\n  I am telling you we need to be attuned to that because wages are not \nwhat I think they ought to be for the average worker in America today. \nThere are a lot of reasons for that. I suggest one of them is this very \nlarge surge of low-wage labor that comes into our country illegally.\n  But, regardless, we want to help our union members receive the \nhighest possible wage and to be able to know that their leadership is \nhonest and trustworthy and doing the right thing. I believe we have to \nget this money back into this account. We need to be sure we have at \nleast a modest increase in spending to keep up with the inflation rate \nso we can continue at least this modest rate of enforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to not see this as an action that goes against \nunions but as an action that will strengthen unions, that will affirm \nthe importance of the union members' money that they contribute, and to \nmake sure it is spent wisely.\n  It is sad to say, sometimes you get a big restitution order of $1 \nmillion--I have been there and seen them, but it is like getting blood \nfrom a turnip. It will never come back. It is gone and the members have \nactually lost it and nobody can do anything about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to this amendment. \nI think it is reasonable and fair and the offset, let me repeat, does \nnot deal with the controversial ILO, International Labor Organization, \nthat does some good. It certainly has good objectives. How well they \nspend their money, I have my doubts, but it has good objectives. It is \nan offset against administrative expenses, and across the board it will \nbe a small impact on the administrative budgets of these agencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the \npoints made by the Senator from Alabama. First of all, I want to make \nit clear that I do not know of any Senator on either side of the aisle \nwho is not in favor of going after either fraud, waste and abuse, or \nany kind of criminal activities--whether it is done in the business \ncommunity, by corporations, or whether it is done in labor unions. \nReally, the question is, how do you do it? What is the best way of \ndoing it? Are we getting a good return on the dollar, so to speak, for \nwhat we are investing in?\n  I thought we might take a look and see what has been happening in \nthis whole area in the Department of Labor over the past few years, \nwhere their focus has been and where it has not been, and what the \npriorities are. You can tell a lot about someone's priorities by how \nthey spend their money. The bill before us provides some modest \nincrease in work protections agencies--OSHA, MSHA, Wage and Hour \nDivision. We also provide for the OLMS--that is the office the Senator \nfrom Alabama has been talking about, Office of Labor Management \nStandards--$45.7 million. That is not chicken feed. I will talk more \nabout that in a bit.\n  But I want to point to some charts to show where we are, to put it in \nbetter perspective. Right now at the Department of Labor, for OSHA--\nthat is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These are \nthe people who go out and make sure your workplaces are safe, that you \nare not exposed to toxic chemicals, things that cause cancer, or unsafe \nworkplaces where you wind up losing a limb, an arm, a hand, or where \nyou are exposed to different things that may injure your lungs, whether \nit is asbestos inhalation or any kind of toxic chemicals that may have \nlong-term profound effects. This is OSHA.\n  What does the administration spend on OSHA? They spend $26 per \nworkplace.\n  The Wage and Hour Division is the people who go out and make sure you \nare actually being paid what you say you should be paid, that you are \ngetting overtime pay, that the company is abiding by the wage and hour \nprovisions of the contract, for example, that the union may have \nsigned. So in Wage and Hour, they are spending $26 per workplace. Under \nOccupational Safety and Health, the Department of Labor is spending \nabout $26 per workplace--about the same.\n  What are they spending at the Office of Labor Management Standards? \nIt is $2,707 per union; $26 per workplace for OSHA, 100 times more for \nOLMS than they are spending on OSHA investigating where people get \ninjured, damaged, maimed for life due to unsafe working conditions.\n  There it is, 100 times more for OLMS. Yet they say it is not enough \nmoney. They need more. Let's see what that means. OLMS--more staff. \nMore staff and fewer results.\n  I was listening to the Senator from Alabama. It would be one thing \nif, over these years they were spending more money and hiring more \nstaff, they actually got more convictions and that\n\n[[Page S13057]]\n\nstuff. That is not so. In 2003, there were 297 people working for OLMS. \nIn 2006, that had increased to 384, almost a 40-percent increase, \nmaybe, or 50-percent increase? Anyway, almost 100 people more, 297 to \n384. What happened to the number of indictments? The number of \nindictments in 2003 was 132; the number in 2006 was 118. They have 100 \nmore people, but the number of indictments goes down.\n  Look at the convictions. We saw the chart. In 2003, we had 152 \nconvictions; in 2006, 129. So we have a lot more people working there. \nWe are spending more money on personnel, and we are getting fewer \nindictments and fewer convictions. The budget, at that same time, went \nfrom $34.3 million to $45.7 million, which is where we are. They put on \nmore people, but they got fewer indictments and fewer convictions.\n  Now with the Sessions amendment, they want to go to $50.7 million--I \nguess to hire more people so we can get fewer indictments and fewer \nconvictions.\n  This really tells the story. What is happening is, they are loading \nup OLMS with featherbedding. That is classic. They put more and more \npeople on, and they are doing less and less work. When I see a \ntrendline like that, I say: You don't chase bad money with good. We put \nall that money in there, and it looks as though what we are doing is \nhiring a bunch of people who are sitting around, not doing very much.\n  Let's look at labor staffing. I mentioned before--this is the same \nfigure you saw in the previous chart, OLMS went from 297 to 384, a 29-\npercent increase. How about OSHA? What happened to Occupational Safety \nand Health? It went from 1,683 down to 1,542. They got rid of people to \ndo inspections. And MSHA, coal mine safety, went down from 2,299 to \n2,136. So while OLMS went up, OSHA and MSHA, Mine Safety Health \nAdministration, actually cut personnel.\n  What does that mean? This next chart shows what it means. Unlike \nOLMS, where more staff means fewer results, the cutbacks of OSHA and \nMSHA means less work gets done. This chart demonstrates what has \nhappened over the last several years in President Bush's budget. OSHA \ninspections, right here, from 2003 to 2006, dropped from 39,884 to \n38,589, so we get fewer OSHA inspections and fewer workers are being \nprotected as a result.\n  Then, the number of employees benefiting from OSHA inspections fell \nfrom 1.6 million to 1.2 million. I don't have that number on this \nchart.\n  Look at mine safety. Right now, MSHA is unable to do all the \ninspections that they are required to do by law. What has happened \nhere? Under mine safety, the staff went from 2,299 to 2,136.\n  The number of inspections they were able to complete went from 98.8 \npercent to 95.1 percent, which is where we are today. They cannot even \ninspect all of the mines. Need I remind anyone here of the recent mine \ndisaster in Utah, the mine disasters in West Virginia and Virginia, \nPennsylvania.\n  Miners continue to lose their lives every year in coal mines and \nother mine disasters, and yet in MSHA, we do not even have enough \npeople there to do the inspections. I think these charts show you what \nis happening over there.\n  I think that $45.7 million is more than enough for them to do their \njob. There it is. It went from 297 to 384 people. Yet the number of \nindictments and convictions went down. The budget went from $34 to $45 \nmillion. Now they want to go to $50 million. Well, something is not \nright here. Something is not right. It sounds as if they are hiring \nmore and more people, but I do not know what they are doing.\n  There is one other thing I want to respond to that Senator Sessions \nbrought up. I think if I remember it right--I will have to check the \nRecord, but I thought he said something about 26 percent of the reports \nwere not standard, were not acceptable, did not meet standards of \nacceptability.\n  Well, you can go right to the White House, online, go to the Office \nof Labor Management Standards. It has got program performance measures. \nIt says here: Measure. Increasing union transparency. Increase the \npercentage of union reports meeting standards of acceptability for \npublic disclosure.\n  Here is what it says: Explanation. The principle objective of this \nperformance goal is to increase the percentage of union reports meeting \nstandards of acceptability for public disclosure.\n  Prior to implementation of electronic reporting formats, only 73 \npercent of union reports filed met standards of the acceptability. \nExpanded use of electronic report formats is significantly improving \nthe sufficiency of reports for public disclosure.\n  Here it is. In 2003, 73 percent, that is what I mentioned. I think \nthat is where Senator Sessions got the 26 percent that were not \nacceptable. Well, that was 2003. In 2004, it went to 94 percent. It is \nnow at 93 percent, 93, 94 percent. So there are only about 6 to 7 \npercent that are not meeting the standards; again, not 26 percent. It \nis more like about--well, it is either 6 or 7 percent right now. The \ngoal is 97 percent. Obviously they are getting there with this new \nelectronic reporting.\n  Now the other thing has to do with financial integrity. I talked \nabout fraud, and I saw the picture of somebody getting money and all of \nthat kind of stuff. Well, again, on the same Web site--you can look it \nup yourself--the measure: increasing union financial integrity. The \npercentage of unions with fraud will decrease. That is the outcome. \nRight here it says that: OLMS conducts audits to monitor compliance, \nuncover embezzlement, and other criminal and civil violations of the \nlaw, using streamlined investigative audit procedures.\n  In fiscal year 2004, OLMS conducted a union audit study that \nidentified fraud in 9 percent of the unions. That was in 2004. The last \nreporting period was 2006. It went down to 8 percent. What is the goal? \nSeven and one-half percent. So it is only half a percent of what the \ngoal is as stated by OLMS. Again, the indicators are there that the \nelectronic reporting and other things are having their effect. So you \nwonder, why do they need so many personnel if, in fact, they have gone \nto electronic reporting and they are getting better results and better \ntransparency from that? This sounds to me like a classic case of \nfeatherbedding, padding it with people and spending more money for not \ngetting much for results; in fact, getting less results than we have \ngotten in the past with less money.\n  Again, I think we have met our obligation with $45.7 million for \nOLMS. By the way, that should be more than enough for them to do their \naudits and to do their indictments and convictions. I think this shows \nthat more personnel and more money have not translated into more \nconvictions and more indictments.\n  There is a balance that has got to be held here. I think our \ncommittee did a good job of balancing OLMS, which has a job to do. They \nshould do it. They should investigate, they should audit, they should \nindict, and they should convict people who are absconding with union \nmoney. Absolutely. No one denies that. They should.\n  The question is, how do we balance that with making sure we have more \ninspections of workplace safety, or mine safety, the other things that \nthe Department of Labor is supposed to be doing to protect our workers? \nThat is the balance we have struck here in the bill. I think it is a \ngood balance, something that was worked out in a bipartisan fashion \nwith Senator Specter, myself, and other Republicans and Democrats on \nthe committee. As I pointed out, this passed the committee 26 to 3. \nThis was not even an issue. I think everyone figured there was a pretty \ngood balance for what we set up. I hope we can maintain that balance.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3349 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, among the amendments that are pending, \none is 3349. I ask unanimous consent to have it called up and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this was the amendment offered by \nSenator\n\n[[Page S13058]]\n\nBrown earlier. It had to do with Upward Bound evaluations. It was \ncleared on both sides of the aisle. We are ready to vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3349) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I say to Senators, we are working our \nway through the amendments. It is now 5:15. I know people do not want \nto work late tonight, but we are going to be in very late tonight \nunless Senators who have amendments pending come over and offer their \namendments.\n  As people can tell, there is nothing happening here right now. We \nhope to get a couple more votes here very shortly. Right now, there is \nnot an amendment pending for which we can have a vote except the \nSessions amendment. We had a pretty good debate on that yesterday and \njust now. I think pretty much all of the debate regarding the amendment \noffered by Senator Sessions is over. We are prepared to vote on that, \nbut we will hold off until we can get clearance on the other side to \nhave a vote.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share a few thoughts on some \nof the discussion we had earlier today. My colleagues shared some ideas \nabout whether we are funding OSHA sufficiently, that sort of thing. The \nspending per business from OSHA is different from spending per union. \nOSHA has many businesses they serve, and so they go out to each one and \nmake their visits and do their inspections and assess penalties. But \nunions serve many businesses, and one inspector would come there and \nspend some time and would cover their relationship with quite a number \nof businesses. All workplaces are not unionized so I don't think that \nwas a fair comparison.\n  Also, the Department of Labor just reported that the indictment and \nconviction numbers continue to go up. They now have 798 convictions and \n834 indictments. It seems every day they are out there making good \nprogress, where they have the capability to do so, against fraud and \ncorruption.\n  With regard to the full-time equivalent, the number of employees, in \nrecent years we have seen an increase in the number of employees--that \nis true--but the truth is those increases have been modest. For \nexample, in 1990, there were over 400 OLMS employees. Now that number \ndropped down below 300. Mostly during the period of the Clinton \nadministration there was a sharp dropoff. Now it is back up to 331, but \nthat is well below the amount it used to be.\n  I don't think there is anything that can be said except that \nSecretary Chao has begun to restore that office a bit, tried to get it \non a stronger basis, have it do a better job of enforcing the law. She \nneeds that. One can only interpret this budget cut--the only budget cut \nwithin this whole line item of appropriations to her enforcement \nagency, the agency that requires the unions to publish their \nexpenditures, the enforcement agency that actually does audits--as an \nindication of something rather serious, especially when the audits are \nuncovering extraordinary amounts of problems. That is what we have. We \nhave a situation in which we have had so little oversight that there is \nabuse of union members' money going on on a regular basis. That money \nis too often being abused. Not by everybody; overwhelmingly, the \naverage union leader is honest and decent. The locals are run by good \npeople elected by their members. But long-term tenures, lack of \ncontrols, no audits puts people in a position where their good \ndiscipline fails.\n  I have seen it in churches. People in church have access to large \namounts of money. Nobody is monitoring it, and they take it, sometimes \nlarge amounts. So we need to understand that oversight, auditing, and \nfinancial disclosure is not punishment. It is not demeaning. It is \nserving the rank-and-file union members. It is serving their interests \nso they can know their leadership is functioning honestly and with \nintegrity, and they can know what they are spending their money on. It \nmay be an honest expenditure, but a union member might look at it and \nsay: They paid too much for this copy machine because that is his \nbrother-in-law. They might want to complain about that. Isn't that the \nway we want it to happen? That is what the whole system is about.\n  It is disappointing to me to see that we have a cut in this agency, \nof all agencies. I am disappointed in that. I know Secretary Chao would \nbe concerned that people thought that somehow in doing these few \naudits--and we are so slow in what we are doing and doing so few it \nwould take 33 years to audit all existing unions. But to suggest they \nwere spending so much money on that, and they weren't protecting \nworkers. There is actually some good news there. For example, since \nfiscal year 2001, the fatality rate among Hispanic workers has fallen \nby over 18 percent. Since 2002, the injury and illness incident rate \nhas fallen from 5.3 per 100 workers to 4.6 per 100 workers, a drop of \nmore than 13 percent in the injury and illness incident rate, which is \na substantial improvement.\n  With regard to the number of resources, from 1992 to 2002, there were \nbudget cuts and the FTEs dropped 34 percent. That is the number of \nworkers during basically the period in which President Clinton was in \noffice. The audits of unions, the local unions dropped by two-thirds in \nthat decade. That is all we are saying. Secretary Chao has a statutory \nresponsibility to do audits, a statutory and compelling responsibility \nto insist on these reports being filed on time. They are required by a \nlaw that was passed in 1959. Thirty-six percent of the unions are not \nsubmitting those reports on time so their members cannot access where \ntheir money is going. We had almost a million people in the last year \naccess the Web site where these reports are required to be filed to see \nwhere the money is being spent. This is union members accessing these \nWeb sites so they can find out where the money they are contributing to \nthe local union is being spent. What is wrong with that? Why would we \nwant to cut this agency when we still are not where we need to be? We \nare auditing only a very small fraction of the unions, and a \nsubstantial number, over a third, are failing to report as required \nby law--not a law I am asking us to pass, not a law that is part of \nthis amendment--a law that was passed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy \nin 1959.\n\n  So I believe this is a good government issue. It is the right thing \nto do. It will not hurt unions. It will strengthen unions. It will make \npeople feel better about their membership. It may be some bosses do not \nwant to have to disclose where they spend their money, and they may be \ncontacting Senators and telling them: Don't give in. Fight. Don't let \nthem go back and make us do these audits. Don't do it. Cut their \nbudget. Stop Elaine Chao from doing what she is required by law to do. \nDon't give her the money.\n  Maybe that is what is happening. I do not know. I hope not. I think \nwe ought to keep this going. We ought to at least have this modest \nincrease which is a little more than the inflation rate--a net $3 \nmillion increase on a $47 million budget from last year. That modest \nincrease will allow her to keep the momentum, to keep these delinquency \nrates going down, moving in the right direction, with financial \ndisclosure, sunshine. That is going to help eliminate fraud in itself. \nThen she will be able to also do a certain number of other audits. \nMaybe we can see not an increase in convictions, but we might see a \ndecrease, if we know there is more accountability.\n\n[[Page S13059]]\n\n  Again, there were 796 criminal convictions over the last 6 years, \nwith court-ordered restitution of $101 million. Whose money is that? \nWhose money was being ordered to be paid back? It is union members' \nmoney--working Americans who have trusted their leaders. Maybe in the \nunion hall there are 10 officers and leaders and only one of them found \nthemselves in a position to steal. I am not saying we have this \nwholesale problem. What I am saying is there is a very real problem. \nThere is no doubt about it. We are finding far too many criminal cases \nfor each audit that is done.\n  As a result, it takes up time by the investigators. It takes up time \nby the auditors. It results oftentimes in a loss of money that no \nmatter what the judge orders to be restored--no matter how much \nrestitution they order--it may not actually ever be paid back if they \ndo not have it. That is a true fact.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Once again, some \nof you may be concerned that the offset was to take money from the ILO, \nI believe it is, the U.N.-affiliated international labor group that is \nsupposed to help labor conditions around the world. They certainly have \nhigh and good goals. I am not sure they have been very effective. But \nthis money for my amendment is not coming from there anymore. I know a \nlot of people want to see that budget increased.\n  So this offset will be an offset from administrative expenses of \nLabor and HHS and Education. It will be a small impact on their overall \nbudget.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have an amendment I offer on behalf of \nSenator Reid. I send it to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Reid, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3395 to amendment No. 3325:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Nothing in this Act shall be construed to effect \n     or otherwise modify provisions of current Federal law with \n     respect to the funding of abortion.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am going to propound a unanimous \nconsent request. I ask the Senator's attention to this request so we \nget it right.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set this pending \namendment aside, then to turn to an amendment to be offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana, at which time we will have a time agreement of \n10 minutes for Senator Vitter and 10 minutes for Senator Boxer on the \nVitter amendment, at the end of which time the Senate will proceed to a \nvote on or in relation to, first, the Reid amendment; upon disposal of \nthe Reid amendment, the Senate will then proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana; at the \nconclusion of that vote, that the Senate then proceed to a vote on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions; and that \nno other amendments or intervening matter occur prior to these votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. First of all, Madam President, I thank the chairman of \nthe subcommittee for all his courtesies.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3330 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Under that unanimous consent request which has been granted, I now \ncall up amendment No. 3330, the Vitter amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3330 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the provision of funds to grantees who perform \n                               abortions)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds appropriated in this title shall be \n     distributed to grantees who perform abortions or whose \n     subgrantees perform abortions, except where a woman suffers \n     from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical \n     illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the \n     woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, \n     including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or \n     arising from the pregnancy itself. The preceding sentence \n     shall not apply to a grantee or subgrantee that is a \n     hospital, so long as such hospital does not subgrant to a \n     non-hospital entity that performs abortions.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this is a very simple and \nstraightforward but, I believe, important amendment. It says in clear \nterms that none of the funds in this appropriations bill will go to \nentities that provide abortions.\n  I think that is the right policy we should set in this body because \nwhatever side of the abortion debate you are on, we can all agree on \none thing: Abortion is a very divisive topic. Abortion divides our \nNation--many folks would say down the middle--and it causes \nunderstandable passions and feelings on both sides. To a substantial \nnumber of Americans--myself included--but millions upon millions of \nAmericans, the procedure of abortion is deeply troubling and deeply \noffensive. In that context, I think it is the right policy and a very \nreasonable mainstream policy to say we are not going to send taxpayer \ndollars to support groups that perform abortions. It seems to me that \nis the right policy when you talk about taxpayer dollars.\n  Now, the other side will immediately jump up and say: Well, we have \ncurrent Federal law that says we are not going to use taxpayer dollars \nto fund abortions. But, quite frankly, that is not good enough in my \nmind and in the minds of millions upon millions of other abortion \nopponents.\n  Because the way it works now, we send Federal dollars to abortion \nproviders and money is fungible and it is a big shell game and it \nsupports their overhead and it supports their organizations and, in \nmany cases, that funding is a huge percentage of their overall revenue. \nSo it does, in a very significant, meaningful way, support abortions. \nThat is wrong in my mind.\n  Now, let me make clear what this amendment does and what it does not \ndo.\n  It says we are not going to send taxpayer dollars to abortion \nproviders under the title X program. The title X program is a family \nplanning program, and many of those entities which get millions of \ndollars from the Federal Government perform abortions. This amendment \nsays we are not going to send taxpayer dollars to those entities.\n  Now, what does the amendment not do? It does not affect hospitals. \nThere is specific language, a specific exemption for hospitals. So \nhospitals are another category. It does not cut one penny from family \nplanning. This amendment is not about family planning. It is clearly \nabout abortion. We do not cut one penny of family planning funding.\n  This amendment does not deny one family, one individual, family \nplanning services, because in every locality where a private abortion \nprovider is receiving title X funds, there are alternative sources for \nfamily planning services--in every area, in every locality. So we are \nnot taking family planning services away from any American, from any \nindividual in any part of the country.\n  Finally, this amendment does not affect free speech. The amendment \ncontains no language regarding counseling, advocacy, information or \nexpression. It simply says: Let's be fair. Abortion is a very divisive \ntopic. At least half the American people have deep concerns about it. \nIn that context, we should not be sending those folks' money to \nabortion providers to take care of their overhead, to allow them to use \nit as a shell game and, essentially, indirectly fund abortions and \nsupport abortion services.\n  Now, there are a lot of examples of these sorts of entities that we \ncould use. But, obviously, the biggest nationwide is Planned \nParenthood. Planned\n\n[[Page S13060]]\n\nParenthood performs and accounts for hundreds of thousands of abortions \nevery year. According to the last figures we could locate from 2005-\n2006, Planned Parenthood has about a $1 billion budget and source of \nrevenue. About a third of that--$305.3 million--comes from Government \nsubsidies of one sort or another. So $1 billion in revenue, and a third \nof that comes from the taxpayers--whether it is $120 million or more \nfrom the Federal Government kicking in directly and at least $59 \nmillion coming from this very title X program, which is the subject of \nmy amendment.\n  Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood, in the last year we could get figures \nfor, performed over 264,000 abortions. The best estimate for abortions \nnationwide in a year is 1.29 million. So Planned Parenthood alone \naccounts for over 20 percent of that.\n  You cannot tell me, given all those numbers, given 265,000 abortions \nperformed, that we are not sending Federal taxpayer dollars that is \nsupporting all of that activity, that is indirectly paying for those \nabortions--clearly, enormously important to keep Planned Parenthood \ngoing, to provide for its overhead--a third of all of its revenue.\n  Pure and simple, that is wrong when so many Americans find performing \nabortions so deeply troubling in a fundamental, gut, moral way. So this \nwould set the policy right and simply say, if you are a title X \nrecipient, if you are a recipient of those sorts of Federal dollars, \nyou need to decide. You cannot perform abortions if you want that \ntaxpayer support when half or more of U.S. taxpayers have fundamental, \nmoral reservations, and problems with the procedure.\n  This amendment is strongly supported by the Family Research Council, \nand they are going to score the amendment. In addition, it is strongly \nsupported by Concerned Women for America--they also will score the \namendment--and, finally, by National Right to Life, which will also \nscore the amendment.\n  I have letters from two of those three organizations. The third is on \nthe way. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of Family Research Council and the \n     families we represent, I want to urge you to vote for the \n     Amendment #3330 offered by Senator David Vitter (R-LA) to the \n     Substitute Amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 \n     (H.R. 3043) which would prevent Title X family planning funds \n     from supporting abortion providers. We strongly support this \n     amendment.\n       Title X family planning funds are distributed to \n     organizations that perform a broad array of family planning \n     services. Though Title X funds may not be used to perform \n     abortions, some Title X recipients co-locate their family \n     planning services with their abortion facilities. Indeed, \n     Planned Parenthood clinics receive Title X funding.\n       Title X family planning funding should not go to abortion \n     providers such as Planned Parenthood, which performed nearly \n     265,000 abortions in 2005. Recent reports indicate that \n     Planned Parenthood generated over $900 million in income in \n     fiscal year 2005-2006, of which over $300 million came from \n     government grants and contracts. In addition, it has recently \n     been reported that Planned Parenthood clinics that receive \n     Title X funding have not complied with state statutory rape \n     reporting laws. We should not be sending taxpayer money to an \n     organization such as Planned Parenthood that performs \n     abortions or violates state laws designed to protect young \n     women. The Vitter amendment would not alter the $300 million \n     contained in the LHHS bill for Title X family planning \n     services.\n       Your support for the Vitter amendment will uphold the \n     principle that the United States taxpayer should not have to \n     subsidize the abortion industry. FRC reserves the right to \n     score votes surrounding this amendment in our scorecard for \n     the First Session of the 110th Congress to be published this \n     fall.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  Thomas McClusky,\n     Vice President for Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 18, 2007.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, On behalf of the 500,000 members of \n     Concerned Women for America (CWA), I would like to thank you \n     for your continued commitment to support of the sanctity of \n     life. We appreciate your offering an amendment to prohibit \n     federal Title X funding from going to any group which \n     performs elective abortions or whose subgrantees perform \n     elective abortions.\n       CWA will score the vote on your pro-life amendment to the \n     Department of Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations \n     Bill (S. 1710).\n       Federal taxpayers must not be forced to pay for cruel and \n     immoral abortion procedures to which they rightly object. \n     There is no way around this fundamental principle of fairness \n     and common decency.\n       Senator, thank you again for your amendment and working to \n     promote life in the Senate. Our members appreciate your \n     strong stance and CWA lends its support to this pro-life \n     amendment. Our little ones cannot speak for themselves, so we \n     must speak for them and make a statement that our nation \n     should not subsidize this destruction of life.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Beverly LaHaye,\n\n                                             Founder and Chairman,\n                                      Concerned Women for America.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nLouisiana have left, Mr. Vitter, and how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes 46 \nseconds, and the Senator from California has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The Vitter amendment is ``big brother'' at its very worst. It tells \nnon-governmental entities how they should spend their own private \nfunds. I wonder what the Senator has in mind next? Is he going to tell \nAmerica's families what they can spend their private funds on? This is \na dangerous amendment which will lead to more abortions.\n  The Senator takes to the floor and he attacks an a private \norganization by name--an organization that over many years has had \nleading Republicans and Democrats on its board of directors. I think it \nis a very sad day when we have an amendment such as this. This \namendment punishes the very organizations that work hard every day \nusing their own funds to provide family planning services and \nreproductive health care, including legal abortion services.\n\n  If Senator Vitter wants to deny these funds, he should work to outlaw \nall abortion. He should work to make women criminals who have \nabortions--throw everyone in jail. If he wants to go that way, that is \nan honest way. But to stand up here and say that a private organization \nthat works so hard every day to give women the health care they need--\nto punish them because they use their own funds to provide a full array \nof reproductive health care is really, I think, a very sorry idea.\n  His amendment will do nothing to reduce abortions. It will make \ncontraceptives harder to get, and that will increase the number of \nunintended pregnancies. It will increase the number of abortions, just \nas we have shown the global gag rule does. Make no mistake, he may not \ncall it a gag rule, but in essence it is. When you tell a person or an \norganization how they can spend their own personal funds, that is \ninterfering with their rights.\n  What is going to happen? We are going to have less funding for breast \nand pelvic examinations, breast and cervical cancer screening, sexually \ntransmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS. We are going to see less \ncounseling, less testing, and less referrals.\n  This amendment is an attack on title X-supported health clinics. \nTitle X was enacted in 1970 with strong bipartisan support to provide \nhigh-quality, comprehensive, and low-cost family planning and \nreproductive health care services to those in need but who cannot \nafford such services. Let's be clear. No title X dollars may be used \nfor abortion care. We are going to have a vote that makes it very clear \nthat nothing in this bill allows Federal funds to be used for abortion. \nNo discretionary funding in this bill can ever pay for abortion. That \nhas been illegal for quite some time.\n  So again, the Vitter amendment punishes effective organizations that \nare working every day to provide a full range of legal, important \nhealth care to women. The consequence of passing this--which I don't \nthink we will because it is so radical--are that women would have less \naccess to reproductive health care. They would get sick. They would be \nsuffering, and they wouldn't\n\n[[Page S13061]]\n\nget access to contraception, which is so necessary.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to use 1\\1/2\\ minutes of my \nremaining time to simply respond to some of the statements.\n  A statement was made that this amendment cuts health care services, \nfamily planning services that are not abortion and makes them less \navailable. That is simply not true. This amendment doesn't cut a single \npenny of title X family planning money. That dollar amount is exactly \nthe same. This amendment doesn't make those services unavailable to a \nsingle American because we checked every metropolitan area, every \nlocality, and there are other opportunities--public, private, both--for \nAmericans in every locality for true family planning entities that \ndon't also perform abortions. So it is not true that we are lessening \nthat opportunity.\n  It is not about those true health or family planning services. It is \nabout abortion and whether the American taxpayer is going to be forced \nto indirectly subsidize abortion in this country as we do right now. \nWhen abortion is so divisive an issue, when it is so troubling and \nfundamentally offensive to so many millions of Americans--at least half \nthe country, in my guesstimate--I don't think it is right or fair to be \nspending taxpayer dollars. Who can deny that is effectively what we are \ndoing? Just look at the biggest example.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed a minute and a half.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will consume the remainder of my time.\n  I talk about Planned Parenthood simply because it is the biggest and \nmost obvious example of billions of dollars of revenue--fully a third \ncomes from Government. Meanwhile, they perform 265,000 abortions--20 \npercent of the entirety of abortions performed in the United States. \nThat is not right.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to point out that George Bush's \ngrandparents founded the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Connecticut. I \nwish to point out again that the issue of choice is only divisive when \nwe have amendments such as this one, even though we already know there \nisn't a penny of funding in this bill that can be used for abortion. \nSo, this is punishing the people who are living by the law, who are \nusing their own private funds, and who are using Federal funds for \ncontraceptive services, for health care services, and the rest.\n  This amendment shouldn't even be on this bill. The reason it is \ncontroversial is because Senator Vitter decided to bring up this very \ndivisive amendment, which I hope we will defeat.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let's be very clear. The amendment that \nhas been offered by Senator Vitter is an attack on the health and well-\nbeing of all Americans, purely and simply. When you look at the depth \nand breadth of this amendment which has been offered, it could withhold \ncritical Federal dollars from virtually any health care entity or \nprovider across the country that is in any way tied to abortion \nservices, directly or indirectly.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that in some of our rural communities, \nthere is only one health care provider. That clinic may provide flu \nshots for children, for the elderly, and it may also provide family \nplanning services. This amendment which has been offered would tie that \nclinic's hands and prevent it from receiving any Federal funds \nwhatsoever. That is just plain wrong.\n  Our Nation's core health care providers rely on millions of dollars \nfrom Medicaid, from family planning, from community health centers, \nchild health, and numerous programs which provide, as we all know, \nvital health care services to some of our Nation's most vulnerable \nwomen, men, and children. But because of the way this amendment is \nworded, it would put millions of men and women--primarily, of course, \nthose who are low income who can't advocate for themselves, who don't \nhave health insurance--at risk of losing access to family planning and \nother preventive health care services.\n  We have all said many times we all want to reduce the number of \nabortions. It is something on which we all agree. But this amendment, \nin fact, goes directly against that goal. This amendment is \ncounterintuitive. Eliminating a community's only source of birth \ncontrol will not reduce the number of abortions. Denying women access \nto their trusted doctors and nurses won't do it either.\n  Let's be clear. This amendment is not necessary to prevent family \nplanning funds provided through title X from paying for abortions. As \nthe Senator from California has said, Federal law prohibits that.\n  Over the past 7 years, we have seen this administration and \nconservatives in this Congress systematically work to erode \nreproductive freedoms for women, both in the United States and \noverseas. In fact, just this week we learned that the President's \nnominee for Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs has \nsupported dropping a requirement that Federal health insurance plans \ncover birth control.\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. She called Plan B--the medically safe birth control pill \nthat I and others worked to approve--a ``grave threat to women.''\n  We all want to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in this \ncountry, but limiting health care and education options will only \nproduce the opposite effect. We have to make sure women have access to \nsafe and affordable family planning alternatives. Cutting them off, as \nthis amendment would do, is the wrong way to go.\n  I stand with my colleague from California in saying that the Senate \nneeds to stand on record to protect women's rights in this country. \nThis is the time when we need to do it. We are not out here to provide \na divisive debate; we are out to defend the rights of women in this \ncountry, for which they have worked long and hard. Let's not affect and \nimpact hundreds and hundreds of men and women who are trying to get \nhealth care today by an amendment that is divisive and is not needed.\n  As the Senator from California said today, the funds in this bill \nthat are federally provided do not go for abortions today. We do not \nneed this amendment. We should not take this dangerous step that will \nimpact the lives and health of many women in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds remains.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me just say that Senator Murray said \nit all. This is an unnecessary amendment by Senator Vitter. I urge an \n``aye'' vote on the Reid amendment and a ``no'' vote on the Vitter \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3395\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had a long conversation with the \nRepublican leader to determine how we are going to get done what we \nhave to get done. I have discussed with the two managers the \nconversation the Republican leader and I had. The first thing we are \ngoing to do is get consent at the appropriate time, which will be in a \nfew minutes, that all first-degree amendments be filed tomorrow at 1 \np.m. I am not asking that consent now.\n  The managers should know, though, the amendments we will need to deal \nwith. We will have a finite list of amendments.\n  The commitment that the Republican leader, I think, is going to be \nwilling to make is that we finish this bill by the time of our caucus \nluncheons on Tuesday; that is, by noon on Tuesday, October 23. That \nbeing the case, we have a lot of work to do. Everyone should understand \nwe may have a number of votes Monday night. This is not going to be \ncome in Monday night and go out to some event you have. Everyone should \nhave Monday night free because we could have a lot of votes Monday \nnight. Everyone should understand that.\n  The following week we have a lot to do. I have made a commitment to \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee--that bill needs to be marked\n\n[[Page S13063]]\n\nup next week and he has scheduled that for next Wednesday. We have to \nfinish this matter next Tuesday. This avoids a lot of trouble.\n  I could file cloture on it, and the Republican leader knows this \nbetter than I, and we could have a vote on Saturday. We have people not \nhere today. To get everybody here on Saturday is no easy thing to do.\n  I think what I have suggested here would be very appropriate. As I \nsaid, I talked to the Republican leader about this. We would have votes \nMonday night. We are going to have whatever votes are necessary Tuesday \nmorning to complete this legislation and then go on about the week's \nbusiness that we would have, which should be a significant week. After \nnext week we only have 3 weeks left here until Thanksgiving. We have \nalready scheduled a break at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me confirm for our colleagues my concurrence with \nwhat the majority leader has indicated. We can finish the bill Tuesday \nbefore the policy luncheons. I have consulted with Members on my side \nand we are confident that is an ending that can be achieved, which \nwould free up our friend from Iowa and the members of the Agriculture \nCommittee for their markup.\n  I want to concur in what the majority leader has indicated. I think \nthat is a goal we can achieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, then, that all first-degree \namendments be filed on this bill by 1 o'clock tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, the managers have already acknowledged they \nare going to process more amendments tonight. There will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. They will process what amendments they can work \nout tomorrow also. So I think this is good.\n  It is no secret we are doing our very best to get this bill finished \nso we can get it to the President. There has been a lot of \npreconferencing. I talked to the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Iowa. They have done a lot of work.\n  The reason I want to try to get this bill to the President is the \nconcern the President has involves about $22 billion. More than half of \nthat is in this bill we have here, so that would be a good place to \nstart to see if we can work something out on this bill with the \nPresident. If we cannot, it certainly points to where we need to work \nsomething out to finish our work on the appropriations matters for the \nrest of the year.\n  There will be no votes tomorrow. The first vote will be Monday; 5:30, \nprobably.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there a pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside that \namendment and then call up an amendment that has already been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just briefly. The Senator has called up an amendment. I \nwish to get a consent for Senator Allard and for Senator Landrieu. How \nmuch time is the Senator intending to take?\n  Mr. REED. No more than 10 minutes, and I will try to be less than \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator from New Jersey also have an amendment?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I have been waiting on the floor to speak for about 10 \nminutes, so at some point I wish to be recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On the bill?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. In part on the bill, yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed \nbe recognized to offer his amendment, and then Senator Allard, and upon \nthe disposition of that amendment, that Senator Landrieu be recognized, \nin that sequence, and then after Senator Landrieu, Senator Menendez be \nrecognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are currently debating the Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. \nLet me commend Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter for their \ngreat work on this legislation.\n  As Chairman Harkin said, this bill truly defines America. It defines \nour Nation's commitment to our children's future through education, it \ndefines our Nation's compassion to seniors and working families, and it \ndefines our hopes in many different areas, particularly in the area of \nhelping to cure disease and improve the public health. This is an \nextraordinarily important piece of legislation. Both Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter have done a remarkable job bringing it to the floor.\n  Let me highlight a few of the important points that I believe should \nbe emphasized.\n  First of all, the bill increases Head Start funding, whereas the \nPresident's budget would decrease it. The legislation before us will \nprovide sufficient resources to continue Head Start, which is an \nimportant aspect of giving children a chance to succeed earlier in \ntheir lives. It also provides resources for higher education: Pell \ngrants, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program--LEAP \nProgram--TRIO, and GEAR UP. All of those are vital to ensuring that our \ncitizens can seize the opportunity of America, and the greatest \nopportunity is education.\n  This legislation also provides an important safety net for many of \nour low-income families and our seniors; that is, the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. We could see a very severe winter in the \nNortheast, in the Northwest, and in the Central Plains of America. We \nare also seeing incredibly expensive prices for oil. Without this \nLIHEAP money, we will not be able to deal with the issue, and countless \nfamilies will make difficult choices between literally eating or \nheating their homes. This legislation, in contradistinction to the \nWhite House's proposal, would maintain, not decrease, LIHEAP funding.\n  The legislation provides additional resources--about a billion \ndollars more--for the National Institutes of Health. This is vital to \nour ability to do research and to provide new diagnoses and new cures \nfor disease. But it is something else that is important: It provides \nthe infrastructure for research in this country. It gives those young \nPh.D.s and M.D.s who are doing research incentives to stay in the \nfield. Without it, we will not only miss out on the cures, but we will \nalso miss out on the physicians and researchers who can give us, over \nthe next 20, 30, 40 years, insight into the problems with disease in \nhuman beings.\n  We also are supporting in this bill the vaccination program. The 317 \nvaccination program, immunization program, has been essential to \nimproving the public health, particularly the public health of \nchildren. This bill supports those commitments.\n  It also provides for training and employment resources. In a world of \nglobalization, where jobs are going overseas, we just cannot tell \npeople: Tough luck. We have to give them an opportunity to change their \ntraining, change their workplace, to go ahead and seize new \nopportunities. The President's budget diminishes these programs; this \nlegislation increases the programs. I think that is the right \ndirection.\n  The Job Corps Program--very successful since the 1960s. We have in \nRhode Island what I think is the best Job Corps center in the country. \nI just had the director in a few days ago talking about how they are \nbeing evaluated higher and higher in each evaluation across the country \nin terms of other Job Corps centers, providing not only training but \njobs. All of their students are walking out into good jobs. These are \nyoung men and women who, frankly, we haven't been able to reach before \nthis stage. Either they have dropped out of high school or they have \nhad a long process to get their GED and to get into this program. Some \nare just getting their GEDs in this program. This program deserves our \nsupport.\n  But there is one area in which we have not committed resources; that \nis, the Trauma Care Systems Planning\n\n[[Page S13064]]\n\nand Development Act of 2007. Trauma--injuries, accidents, falls, \nautomobile wrecks, recreational mishaps--is actually the leading killer \nof young Americans up to the age of 44. It claims more than 140,000 \nlives and permanently disables about 80,000 each year. But only one in \nfour Americans lives in an area served by coordinated systems that will \ntransfer patients to designated trauma centers from less-equipped \nhospitals. This is particularly a problem in rural areas. It affects \nurban and rural communities but particularly the rural areas. At the \nhighest risk are those people in rural areas. Sixty percent of the \ntrauma deaths occur, even though there is only 20 percent of our \npopulation, in rural areas--60 percent of the trauma deaths, 20 percent \nof the population. This is a program which is desperately needed in \nrural parts of America.\n  The Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act is an important \nbuilding block to an improved national network of care across the \ncountry. This program would allow for planning, infrastructure \ndevelopment, and standards development to determine the procedures that \nare most appropriate to do this. It would also require coordination \nwith Federal agencies. It is a sensible investment in a systemic \napproach to trauma care. I believe it is very important.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3360 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  As a result, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3360.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3360 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the trauma and emergency medical \n    services programs administered through the Health Resources and \n                        Services Administration)\n\n       On page 59, line 22, insert before the colon the following: \n     ``, of which $6,000,000 shall be made available to the \n     Administrator of the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration to carry out trauma and emergency medical \n     services programs''.\n  Mr. REED. This amendment would provide $6 million for the program. It \nis fully offset. It is a small amount of funding to improve and expand \nthe availability of trauma care across the country, particularly in \nrural areas, to ensure all areas are equipped with appropriate \nemergency and medical services, thus improving the survival rate and \nrecovery rate for injured patients.\n  Trauma care is not only critical to providing timely access to \nlifesaving interventions, it is central to our national security and \ndisaster preparedness. It is an essential component of our overall \nhealth care system and something I believe we have to do.\n  I hope that at the appropriate time my colleagues will be able to \nsupport this very worthy measure. Let me thank Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter and particularly their staffs for a bill that I think \ndoes speak to the best of America, and does, in fact, define, in a very \npositive way, our most important priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3369 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendments and call up amendment No. 3369 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3369 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the total amount appropriated to any program that \nis rated ineffective by the Office of Management and Budget through the \n                 Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the total amount appropriated by this Act for any program for \n     which the most recent rating available on the date of \n     enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget \n     through the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) is \n     ``ineffective'' shall be reduced by 10 percent. Not later \n     than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, an \n     amount equal to the aggregate amount of any such reduction \n     shall be deposited in the account established under section \n     3113(d) of title 31, United States Code, to reduce the public \n     debt.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my amendment cuts 10 percent of the \nfunding under this bill for programs labeled ``ineffective'' under the \nOMB--the Office of Management and Budget--PART Program and transfers \nthe funding to an account previously established to pay down the \nnational debt.\n  Now, I do not believe I am being presumptuous when I say that most of \nus in this body would like to reduce spending. Where to cut is the \nquestion we fight over. So that is where the fight exists. Now, given \nballooning Federal spending and the Federal debt, this amendment lets \nus make an easy choice to cut spending. It has to start with programs \nthat cannot even justify their mission or success internally.\n  In case you are unfamiliar with the PART Program in general, let me \ngive you some background. When making funding decisions, Members of \nCongress should consider what they are buying for the taxpayer. Funded \nprograms should be effective and efficient. So the Program Assessment \nRating Tool--that is, PART--was put in place by the Congress more than \na decade ago. Agencies have had time to work with this program under \nthe Clinton administration as well as the Bush administration. The \nprogram directs the agencies to set up measurable goals and objectives, \nand then the Office of Management and Budget goes in later on and \nevaluates to see if the agency is actually meeting those goals and \nobjectives.\n  These detailed program assessments and the evidence on which they are \nbased are available to the public to view. All they have to do is go to \nwww.expectmore.gov. That is the Web page you would go to. It is a very \ngood reference for the public, for Members of Congress, or for any \nagency to know exactly where they stand as far as their performance \nstandards are concerned.\n  These assessments represent the combined wisdom of career officials. \nThis is not a political process. These are objective evaluations done \nby career officials at agencies and OMB, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and are based on evidence of that program's performance. \nPrograms assessed with the PART receive an overall rating. The best \nrating they can get is ``effective,'' then it goes to ``moderately \neffective,'' ``adequate,'' then it goes to ``results not \ndemonstrated,'' and finally to ``ineffective,'' the lowest rating. This \namendment tries to address the lowest rating, which is ``ineffective.''\n  While a program's overall rating should not be the sole determinant \nof funding, Congress should prioritize funding programs that perform \nwell. Ineffective programs in particular should be scrutinized to \ndetermine whether the resources they use could be better spent \nelsewhere and whether their goals could be achieved through other \nmeans.\n  When determining where to invest resources, Members of Congress can \nlook to the PART Program for important information:\n  No. 1, does the program address an existing problem, interest, or \nneed? Those that do not should not be funded.\n  The other question to be asked: Does the program have performance \ngoals that relate to the outcomes the American people want? Those that \ndo not may not be worthwhile investments of taxpayer dollars.\n  Do independent, rigorous evaluations demonstrate that the program is \neffective? If not, Congress may want to reconsider whether to fund the \nprogram. If evaluations have not been conducted, Congress may want to \nconsider investing some money in an evaluation to determine if the \nprogram is having its intended impact.\n  Is the program working to improve its performance is another question \nwe ask. A program that does not have an improvement plan in place or is \nnot working aggressively to improve may not be the best investment of \nresources.\n\n[[Page S13065]]\n\n  Another question: If an increase in funding is requested for a \nprogram, has the program explained how the additional funding will \naffect its performance? Programs that cannot articulate how they will \nuse their resources simply are not the best candidates for investment.\n  So that is what the PART Program is all about. It is a good program, \nand it is being implemented more and more throughout the agencies. Some \nof the PART findings are programs that have been ineffective. I would \nlike to look at a few of those.\n  Take the Health Professions Program, for example. One study found \nthat only 1.5 percent of the physicians trained by institutions \nreceiving the program's family medicine training grant provided health \ncare in areas with a physician shortage, compared to 1.1 percent of \nphysicians trained by other institutions. So there is only a four-\ntenths of a percent performance difference. So the question comes up: \nWhat is the program accomplishing?\n  PART found no evidence that the Radiation and Exposure Screening and \nEducation Program reaches the maximum number of beneficiaries or the \nbeneficiaries who are at the greatest risk. There is not even an \nestimate of the number of people potentially affected by uranium and \nnuclear testing activities and where they might live.\n  These are only a few of the programs that have been looked at by the \nPART Program. They provide the information Members of Congress need to \nevaluate whether programs are ineffective. Some of these are programs I \nhave supported. I am sure there are programs that are not doing well, \nand I think we need to take a close look at them. That is all we are \nasking with this amendment.\n  The amendment before us addresses a portion of discretionary \nspending. I ask Members to support this amendment as we deal with \ndiscretionary spending areas where the PART Program is being applied. \nThe overall purpose of the amendment is to pay down the Federal debt, \ncurrently over $9 trillion, and eliminate Government waste by reducing \nspending on programs rated ineffective by the Office of Management and \nBudget PART Program. This is through the career professionals in the \nagencies. This is not driven by any kind of political agenda.\n  That is what my amendment is all about, saving taxpayer dollars in a \nresponsible way. It is about forcing managers of these programs to put \nin effective goals and objectives so that they accomplish what the \nlegislation intended when the Congress passed it. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in trying to bring forward more accountability in the \nprograms we have passed. This is a wonderful tool we have for whatever \nadministration is in control. This is a direct message to the agencies \nto get their act in order because we are concerned about how taxpayer \ndollars are being spent.\n  It is not an onerous amendment. It is trying to bring accountability \nto Government programs we have passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend the \nprevious unanimous consent agreement so I may speak next and the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, will speak after me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, yesterday I began to speak about what \nthe failed war in Iraq is costing us at home to mark the fifth \nanniversary of Congress's capitulation to the war. As we debate the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, I can't think of a better moment to \nreturn to the cost of this war.\n  Let me begin by saying again we are aware of the human cost of the \nwar: 3,816 Americans are dead; more than 28,000 have come back home \nwounded. Iraqis have died in even greater numbers. Millions have fled \ntheir homes. The United States has been involved in the war for longer \nthan we fought World War II. We all know the Iraq war is a human \ncalamity of vast proportions. It can be harder to visualize the direct \ndamage that comes from the financial cost of the war. We are paying for \nthis war with borrowed money, burying ourselves in massive debt, \nseverely threatening the future of our country.\n  We know we have spent more than $450 billion on this war so far, and \nwe continue to spend about $10 billion every month. That doesn't add up \nto a stack of bills that could have been sitting in the Treasury. It is \nequipment at ports that scan nuclear weapons and other measures that \nactually make the homeland more secure. It is children healed with \nbetter health care. It is more teachers in school, better training for \njobs, energy that is clean and doesn't strengthen repressive regimes in \nthe Middle East, payments of our debts so future generations will \ninherit a country that is financially viable.\n  The Bush administration likes to parrot the line: We are fighting \nthem over there so we don't have to fight them here. But when we add it \nall up, the bottom line is clear: The administration's motto really is: \nWe are spending all our money over there so we don't spend it here.\n  Yesterday I spoke about how much we could accomplish to safeguard our \nhomeland against terrorists if we spent a fraction of the money we have \ndumped into the war that makes no sense. Today I would like to speak \nabout what the failed war in Iraq has cost us in terms of our health; \nspecifically, the health of our children. Today the House of \nRepresentatives considered whether to support a bill to provide health \ninsurance for children. Every time we go to the doctor or fill a \nprescription at the pharmacy, we remember how expensive health care can \nbe. There are families who work every day in some of the toughest jobs, \nbut their jobs don't offer health care, and their paychecks would not \nlet them afford private coverage. That is why the Federal Government \nand the States teamed up to start the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram or what is commonly referred to as SCHIP.\n  This year Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a bill that \nwould continue to provide health care to the 6 million children already \nenrolled and will expand the program to include a total of 10 million \nchildren across America. We knew we had to because the children who \nfall into the wide abyss between Medicaid and private coverage are \ndepending on us. But on October 3, millions of children got some \nterrible news. President Bush had vetoed the bill. He did it silently \nand secretly, with no cameras allowed to watch as he condemned millions \nof children to a lack of coverage with a single stroke of his pen.\n  Today families across America were waiting to see if Congress had the \nmoral resolve to override that veto. Some of our colleagues who cast \ndecisive votes against children's health raised the question of whether \nthe bill was financially reasonable, whether 10 million uninsured \nAmerican kids were worthy of funding. President Bush said they were \nnot. Many of my colleagues who voted against children's health have \nrepeatedly decided to vote for continuing the failed war in Iraq. Right \nnow I wish to speak directly to all of them. If we are talking about \nwhat is financially reasonable, let's take a very close look at the \nstark contrast in cost between children's health and the failed war in \nIraq.\n\n  The total cost of expanding children's health is $35 billion over 5 \nyears for 10 million children. How many dollars per child does this \ncost us every day? Depending upon which State you live in, the answer \nis as little as $3.50 a day, about the cost of a latte at Starbuck's. \nIraq costs us $10 billion per month. That means with 3\\1/2\\ months of \nIraq funding, the total expansion in this bill would have been paid \nfor. That is what the war costs--health care for 10 million children \nversus 3\\1/2\\ months of what we spend in Iraq.\n  The impact of this bill would have been enormous in many States, \nincluding my State of New Jersey, where families have to pay some of \nthe highest health care costs in the Nation. It would have helped \nsupport the State in keeping 124,000 New Jersey children insured. It \nwould have covered as many as 100,000 additional children in my State. \nIn the bill, New Jersey would have received about $350 million next \nyear alone to cover working families and children. This program has \ngiven New Jersey families that cannot afford private coverage the peace \nof mind to know that children have health care. President Bush has told \nthose children: No, you don't deserve the Federal Government's strong \nsupport, even though\n\n[[Page S13066]]\n\nthis country spends $330 million in Iraq every day. Again, every single \nday in Iraq, we spend roughly the amount of money it would take to get \ntens of thousands of New Jersey children coverage for a full year.\n  I wish he had to look every child in the eye to tell them that. But \nthat is what the war costs: Health insurance for New Jersey children \nversus one day in Iraq. In fact, for the amount Congress has spent on \nthe failed war in Iraq, we could provide 2 years of health coverage for \nall of the 47 million Americans who don't have health insurance, who \nplay Russian roulette every day with their lives and their wallets, and \nstill have $30 billion left over. We could have provided health care \ncoverage for all of the 47 million Americans who don't have health \ncoverage today. That is what the war costs: Health care coverage for \nevery single American family versus the failed war in Iraq.\n  Here is the question we have to ask ourselves as legislators, as \nAmericans, as human beings: Is a child to get more benefit from a \ndollar spent keeping our military in Iraq to referee a civil war or a \ndollar spent on their health insurance? Is she going to be better \nserved by oil injected in an Abrams tank or by a vaccine a nurse \ninjects in her arm to save her from measles? Is her life going to be \nimproved by missiles in the desert or antibiotics in her medicine \ncabinet; more troops on the streets of Baghdad or more doctors in the \nhospital down the block; multimillion dollar bombs that rain down on \nIraqi neighborhoods with surgical precision or orthopedic surgery for a \ndisease such as cerebral palsy that would mean the difference between a \ndebilitated life in a wheelchair and being able to walk and run and \nplay with other children at school?\n  How dare we take money from her family and borrow money from foreign \ncountries to spend it on a war that makes no sense, while leaving her \non her own to fight diseases and injuries that might very well claim \nher life.\n  It is hard to think of a more grievous act on the part of this \nGovernment than abandoning those children in order to prolong a war. \nThe vote to override President Bush's veto was not only about political \nresponsibility. It was not only about constitutional responsibility. It \nwas a question of right and wrong. Let's remember the administration \nmotto: Spend all our money over there so we don't have to spend it \nhere. In my mind, that is as wrong as it gets.\n  I will continue to speak out on what else this war is costing us here \nat home in terms of education and jobs and green energy, helping the \nmiddle class make ends meet and the financial stability of our Nation \nthat our children will inherit. America deserves to know what we could \nhave achieved had this horrible war never happened. The administration \nhas spent down our finances, mortgaged the future. Republicans in the \nHouse have voted down health care coverage for our children. But one \nthing they have not yet emptied out is our vast treasury of hope. It is \ntragic to think what might have been, but it is not too late to believe \nin what we can become.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3402 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in a few minutes I am going to offer an \namendment and ask for its consideration. It is an important amendment, \nalthough it is quite small and has virtually no impact on the \nunderlying cost of this bill, which is why I believe I can bring it \nwith good faith to the Members for their consideration. It does not add \na penny to the underlying bill, but it does send some directive \nlanguage to SAMHSA, which is the agency that funds mental health and \nsubstance abuse programs for our country. Because of the good work of \nSenator Harkin and Senator Specter, there is an increase in funding for \nthis important program. This money is given out in grants through \ncompetitive bids and has been ongoing for some time. I don't know \nexactly the year the program was authorized and commenced, but it has \nbeen a fairly longstanding program and usually gets good marks.\n  This particular amendment would direct the Agency to give \nconsideration to programs providing mental health services to children \nand families in the gulf coast area. It seems, for some reason, a very \neffective program that had received some funding in the past few \nyears--that is the only program operating in the gulf coast region that \nis giving support and counseling and clinical services to a population \nof children and adults, but this is for children literally traumatized \nby the catastrophic disaster, not only in my State but Mississippi, \nsomewhat in Texas, and Alabama--was not considered to be a priority.\n  So my amendment will basically direct the agency to consider programs \noperating in the gulf coast area that are serving children who have \nvery good records, to provide a priority for them.\n  If I could, I would like to send the amendment to the desk now. It \nsimply, as I said, establishes a priority for these programs, and it \nadds no money to the bottom line of this bill.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3402 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49; line 1: strike the colon and insert ``Provided \n     further, that, of the funds provided to the Child Trauma \n     Stress Network Initiative, priority shall be given to those \n     centers, that previously received grants, that provide mental \n     health services to children affected by Hurricane Katrina \n     and/or Rita.''\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand the managers have cleared \nit. I ask for it to be accepted now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on this \namendment?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2128\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in just 13 days the Internet tax \nmoratorium will expire. If Congress has not acted by then, State and \nlocal governments will be free to impose new taxes on Internet access--\nand trust me, they will.\n  We need to be straight with the American people about what is \nhappening. The majority wants to preserve at least the possibility of \ntaxing access to the Internet.\n  The Internet has literally transformed this country. It has cleared \nnew pathways to learning for rich and poor. It has brought a level of \nefficiency and innovation to the shop floor, the home, and the corner \noffice that were unimaginable just a decade ago. Just think of the \nmillions of middle-class Americans who have lifted their fortunes \nthrough online auction sites or made their first stock purchases over \nonline trading sites.\n  The Internet has been at the heart of America's economic growth over \nthe past decade--all because Government has not gotten in the way. But \nthose days are over if the people on the other side of the aisle in the \nSenate open the Internet to new taxes.\n  We cannot let that happen. For the sake of our economy, for the sake \nof our competitiveness, for the sake of consumers who don't want to see \nnew taxes on their bills, we need to ban taxes on Internet access \npermanently.\n  The House of Representatives has sent us a bill that would extend the \nmoratorium for 4 years. Frankly, I do not think that is nearly long \nenough. If we all agree that taxing Internet access hurts consumers, \nhurts innovation, hurts broadband development, why should we stop at 4 \nyears? Why not keep the Internet tax free forever?\n  So I say to my friends on the other side, the clock is ticking. If \nyou object to considering the Sununu bill to make the moratorium \npermanent, let's take up the House-passed bill with a couple of \nrelevant amendments in order. One would make the moratorium permanent \nand, failing that, one would extend it for substantially longer than a \nmere 4 years.\n  We can debate these amendments quickly and vote--to see where the\n\n[[Page S13067]]\n\nSenate stands on this very important question of keeping the Internet \nfree of onerous taxes.\n  We could do it this week or next week--but the Senate must act before \nthe moratorium expires in 13 days. And it is my intention to have a \nvote on the question of whether the moratorium should be extended \npermanently or merely for another 4 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 401, S. 2128, the permanent \nmoratorium on the Internet tax bill. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, Mr. President, there is objection. On behalf of \nSenator Carper, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3402\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Now, Mr. President, I understand the previous amendment \nhas been cleared. I ask for its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, \nwithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3402) was agreed to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3323, 3337, 3355, and 3375 to Amendment No. 3325, en \n                                  bloc\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have four amendments that have been \nagreed to on both sides, cleared. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nconsidered and agreed to en bloc. They are amendments Nos. 3323, 3337, \n3355, and 3375.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendments \nare considered en bloc and agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3323\n\n   (Purpose: To provide an annual report card for the Department of \n                               Education)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SCIENCE TEACHING AND \n                   ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that there is broad \n     agreement in the scientific community that learning science \n     requires direct involvement by students in scientific inquiry \n     and that such direct involvement must be included in every \n     science program for every science student in prekindergarten \n     through grade 16.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate Regarding the National Assessment \n     of Educational Progress 2009 Science Test.--It is the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) \n     2009 Science assessment should reflect the findings of the \n     Senate described in subsection (a) and those expressed in \n     section 7026(a) of the America Creating Opportunities to \n     Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and \n     Science Act; and\n       (2) the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) should \n     certify that the National Assessment of Education Progress \n     2009 Science framework, specification, and assessment include \n     extensive and explicit attention to inquiry.\n       (c) Report.--The National Assessment Governing Board shall \n     submit a report to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions of the Senate describing whether the \n     certification described in subsection (b)(2) has been made, \n     and if such certification has been made, include in the \n     report the following:\n       (1) A description of the analysis used to arrive at such \n     certification.\n       (2) A list of individuals with experience in inquiry \n     science education making the certification.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3355\n\n (Purpose: To allocate funds to the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model \n                        Systems of Care Program)\n\n       On page 88, line 16, strike the period and insert ``: \n     Provided further, That $8,400,000 shall be used to carry out \n     the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model Systems of Care \n     Program and to sustain at least 16 TBI Model Systems \n     Centers.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3375\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funds for partnership grants for teacher \n    preparation under title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We just disposed of four more amendments. Obviously, there will be no \nmore business tonight. The leader already said there would be no more \nvotes. Our staffs and I will continue to work through these amendments. \nBut we will be in tomorrow, and we will be disposing of amendments \ntomorrow. So if Senators have amendments to this bill, and they want \nthem offered, I suggest that tomorrow would be a good time to do it.\n  We will not be in Monday until about 5:30. And then we will have \nvotes on Monday night on pending amendments. So if amendments are \noffered tomorrow, and votes are needed, we can stack those votes for \nMonday night.\n  I will just say the door will start closing after tomorrow because \nMonday night we will be voting. We will be in Tuesday morning probably \nat the usual hour--that is up to the leadership to decide--but then the \nfinal passage of this bill will be at noon on Tuesday. So I say to \nSenators, if they have amendments they want to have considered, I would \nsay tomorrow would be an excellent time; otherwise, the door is going \nto close very rapidly, and they will not be able to offer those \namendments and to get any debate or a vote on them prior to noon on \nTuesday.\n  So with that, Mr. President, again, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           ADVANCED PLACEMENT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor putting together an excellent bill and bringing this critical \nlegislation to the floor. This bill is a major step forward in \nstrengthening education, health care, and job training in this country. \nAs the chairman knows, this Congress recently passed the America \nCompetes Act--comprehensive legislation designed to ensure the United \nStates remains competitive in the 21st century economy. I believe the \ncornerstone of this legislation is its effort to strengthen math and \nscience education in this country.\n\n[[Page S13068]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree. Strong math and science education is critical if \nwe, as a nation, are going to continue to have a skilled and educated \nworkforce that can compete in the global economy.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As the chairman knows, the National Academy of Sciences \nreported that students in the United States are simply not keeping up \nwith their international peers in the areas of math and science. The \nNational Academy recommended training an additional 150,000 advanced \nplacement, AP, and pre-AP instructors, and to quadruple the number of \nstudents who take AP math or science courses to 4.5 million by 2010. Is \nthe chairman aware that America Competes makes a downpayment on this \nrecommendation and authorizes a program to increase the number of \nstudents in high-need schools taking AP and international \nbaccalaureate, IB, classes in math, science, and critical foreign \nlanguages?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am aware of that provision, and point out that America \nCompetes also recognizes that other highly rigorous, evidence-based, \npostsecondary preparatory programs can also qualify for funding under \nthis authorization.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, and the chairman's support for this provision was \ncritical to its passage. I'd also like to thank the Chairman and \nRanking Member for increasing funding for Advanced Placement programs \nin this mark to $42 million. As the Chairman knows, the House FY 08 \nLabor HHS Education Appropriations bill increases funding for AP to $50 \nmillion. I ask the Chairman if he thinks it's a good idea to increase \nAP to at least $50 million in the final bill that emerges from \nConference, and use this additional increase to fund the provisions in \nAmerica Competes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think that is a good idea, and will work with the \nranking member and my colleagues in the House to try to achieve that \ngoal.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree and will work with the chairman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nsupport of this critical program.\n\n\n                        workforce investment act\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee. As this body debates this spending bill, I would like to \nstart by thanking Senator Harkin, Senator Specter and the other members \nof the Senate Committee on Appropriations for supporting the Workforce \nInvestment Act in this bill. The Workforce Investment Act is a critical \nprogram for workers across the country in need of training and \neducation benefits.\n  WIA brings essential resources to my home State of Michigan, where \nhundreds of workers are ready and willing to begin job-training \nprograms that make them more employable for high wage, quality jobs. \nThe House-passed Labor-HHS spending bill includes a $335 million \nrescission of WIA funds as proposed by the administration. This \npotential cut would devastate the various efforts in place to \nreinvigorate Michigan's economy and workforce right at the time when \nour Governor is making great strides towards the goal of doubling the \nnumber of workers trained for high-demand jobs in the State.\n  In Michigan, we are using WIA dollars to create scholarships for \nworkers who want to attend State colleges, we are counseling workers on \nskill development and the importance of furthering their education, and \nwe are performing skill assessments that help workers decide what level \nof training they should pursue. All of these services need to be \navailable to workers in my State.\n  Michigan workers have been hit hard by layoffs and I am proud that \nthe committee has decided to support workers in my State and in all \nStates with the resources and benefits that they need so that they can \ncontinue to support their families. I hope to see this body continue to \nwork towards full restitution of these funds in a final bill. It is the \nright thing to do for our Nation's workforce system.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for their leadership and cooperation in ensuring that \nthe Senate continues its commitment to training workers through the \nWorkforce Investment Act. I ask for their continued support on this \nimportant issue in conference. I, too, am pleased to see that my \ncolleagues have rejected efforts to pull these critical funds away from \nStates that are attempting to plan and use them for their own specific \nworkforce development needs.\n  The Workforce Investment Act provides many opportunities to workers \nin my home State of Michigan who have been laid off and are seeking a \nnew start. The cuts proposed by President Bush could have cost my State \nclose to $11 million; that is 7,500 workers who would not receive \ntraining and several local workforce agencies that could potentially \nclose their doors and no longer serve Michigan communities. This cut \nwould have cost workers in all of our States. The loss of benefits and \nservices during hardship is too great a burden for us to place on our \ncitizens' backs.\n  I want to thank the comittee for rejecting efforts to drain this \nprogram of needed dollars. The Governors will thank us, the State and \nlocal workforce agencies will thank us, and most importantly, the \nworker who is trying to better himself or herself and gain employment \nwill be able to do so because of our actions here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank both of my colleagues from Michigan for their \nconcern and support of WIA. I agree that the Workforce Investment Act \nshould be provided the adequate level of funding needed to ensure that \nworkers can get the training and services they need to compete for 21st \ncentury jobs.\n  The Workforce Investment Act statutorily provides States 3 years to \nspend the funds allocated to them. This flexibility allows States to \nassess their unique needs, the needs of their unemployed workers, and \nto adequately plan innovative initiatives, training programs, and \nservices for the workforce. I believe the rescission of funds proposed \nby the House of Representatives would be unfair to those programs that \nhave appropriately obligated funds at the State and local levels to \nserve workers in need.\n  The committee expects to provide sufficient funds for this program \nand will work towards securing the funding in the final bill. I thank \nthe distinguished Senators from Michigan, and I will be happy to work \nwith them in conference on this important matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with Senator Harkin. WIA was passed in 1998 to \nunify this country's fragmented employment and training system. Since \nthen it has impacted the lives of millions. Our subcommittee seeks to \ncontinue the Senate's commitment to our nation's workers; they are the \nheart and soul of our economy.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the subcommittee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senators as well.\n\n\n                Community Innovations for Aging in Place\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to first thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies for doing a \nwonderful job drafting a spending bill for fiscal year 2008 that makes \na true commitment to the priorities of so many Americans across the \ncountry, especially our older Americans. Close to 90 percent of all \nseniors in this country want to or, by necessity, will remain living in \ntheir homes, even as they grow frail. That is why I created a new, \ninnovative program in the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 called \nthe Community Innovations for Aging in Place. Are the chairman and \nranking member aware of this program?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I think this is a great program. Because the vast \nmajority of our seniors are aging in place, the Community Innovations \nfor Aging in Place program will help leverage new, human, financial, \nand neighborhood resources for the benefit of our seniors' health, \nindependence, and quality of life.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with the chairman and senator from Maryland. \nThis program is important because it promotes independence and healthy \naging by engaging seniors before a crisis and responding to their \nchanging needs over time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The chairman and ranking member are right. The \nCommunity Innovations for Aging in Place\n\n[[Page S13069]]\n\nprogram provides community-based services by supporting partnerships \nbetween government and health and human services providers in caring \nfor the nation's elderly. The federal government needs to be able to \nfund programs that work not only through government but through \nnonprofit organizations. That is why I would like to ask the chairman \nand ranking member if they support implementation of the Community \nInnovations for Aging in Place program?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do support implementation of this innovative program. I \nassure the senator from Maryland that I will do my best to find funding \nfor the Community Innovations for Aging in Place program during the \nconference process.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree and will support these efforts, as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I sincerely thank my colleagues from Iowa and \nPennsylvania for addressing this issue that touches so many older \nAmericans.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment which may \nprovide up to $2.5 million in additional funds for the Fire Fighter \nFatality Investigation and Prevention Program, contained within the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The account for \nthis funding is Other Occupational Safety and Health Research. The \nfunding, which can be used across the United States, will be used to \nallow the agency to more effectively and comprehensibly investigate \nfire fighter fatalities, so that the cause of fatalities may be \nidentified and future fatalities may be avoided. The inspector general \nfor the Department of Health and Human Services found that flat funding \nfor the program since 1998 has resulted in a reduced number of \ninvestigations over time. As a result, NIOSH has to prioritize certain \ntypes of investigations. The inspector general concludes that limited \nresources are a significant constraint which limits the program's \neffectiveness.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to respond to amendment No. \n3322 offered by my good friend the junior Senator from Oklahoma. As you \nknow, the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma would, among other \nthings, strike $150,000 in Federal funds that I helped provide for a \nworthy initiative in the Commonwealth of Virginia called the Virginia \nAquarium and Marine Science Center's Beyond the Aquarium Program.\n  The Beyond the Aquarium Program is a hands-on, educational outreach \nprogram that brings science directly into K-12 classrooms. As we know, \nschool field trips have declined and teachers are struggling to \nmotivate students to study the sciences. Our ability to remain ahead of \nthe curve in scientific advancements is a key component to ensuring \nAmerica's homeland security in the post-9/11 world of global terrorism. \nYet alarmingly, the bottom line is that America faces a huge shortage \nof homegrown, highly trained scientific minds. The Beyond the Aquarium \nProgram will inspire children to take an interest in science.\n  I applaud the Senator from Oklahoma in his efforts to obtain \nadditional funding for IDEA. There is no Senator who is more supportive \nof fully funding IDEA than myself. Over the years, I have worked with \nSenators Hagel, Dodd, Roberts, and Harkin to ensure that Congress \nprovide the highest possible funding for part B of IDEA. Unfortunately, \nCongress has never come close to meeting the 40-percent commitment to \nfund the cost associated with this legislation, although progress has \nbeen made the last several years. I encourage the good Senator from \nOklahoma to join me and others as a cosponsor of S. 1159, the IDEA Full \nFunding Act.\n  I am proud to stand up in support of this worthy project.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to address the pending \nlegislation, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Fiscal \nYear 2008 appropriations legislation. While this legislation is very \nwell intentioned, regretfully, I oppose the bill as it is currently \ndrafted.\n  The legislation we are currently debating totals approximately $149 \nbillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2008. This is roughly \n$9 billion above the level requested by President Bush. Mr. President, \n$149 billion sounds like a lot of money, but total spending in the \nlegislation is actually much higher--about $605 billion when the \nmandatory spending is accounted for.\n  This legislation funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, as well as a host of smaller agencies. I know that \nall of my colleagues want to ensure these agencies are properly funded \nand staffed, so that Federal programs have the resources they need to \nproperly function. But the level of spending in this legislation is \nexcessive, and will add to the huge financial burden we are leaving for \nour children and grandchildren. So while this legislation is well \nintentioned, I can not support it as it is currently drafted.\n  My understanding is that, for a variety of reasons, the President \nwill veto the legislation. The administration has been vocal about \ntheir concerns since the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution was \nconsidered earlier this year, so this veto threat should not come as a \nsurprise to my colleagues. The Senate has been on notice. We need to \nmove past the political theatrics associated with this bill and other \nappropriations legislation, and get to work on the real challenge of \nwriting a balanced proposal the President is willing to sign. As U.S. \nSenators, one of our primary duties is to fund the Government. Our \nFounding Fathers designed checks and balances for a purpose, one being \nto force compromise on key, and sometimes contentious, legislative \nproducts. We ought to be thinking about--and debating--the type of \nlegislation that will pass muster on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nWe owe that to our constituents and to the American people.\n  I would also like to address other concerns I have with the \nlegislation. The committee-reported bill contains stem cell language \nthat overturns Presidential order, making more embryonic stem cell \nlines available for Government research funding. Currently, only \nembryonic lines created before July 9, 2001, are eligible for \nFederal funding. This legislation would extend that date until June 15, \n2007. I do not support this provision as part of this vehicle. Earlier \nthis year, we had a larger debate on the stem cell issue. I believe \nthat we owe it to the American public to work on real solutions to this \nsituation and not just keep moving a potential date. For these reasons, \nI was pleased to hear yesterday that the bill manager decided to remove \nthis provision from the underlying committee-reported legislation.\n\n  The committee-reported bill also addresses funding for September 11 \nworkers. Specifically, this legislation provides an additional $55 \nmillion for treatment, screening and monitoring for 9/11 related health \nissues. This is in addition to the approximately $45 million that was \nincluded in the emergency war supplemental earlier this year. In \naddition, this legislation for the first time expands funding to cover \nall city residents. The HELP Committee has been looking into this issue \nfor well over a year. We should agree on the facts regarding worker \nhealth before we broadly expand current spending to cover residents. In \naddition, there are substantial unspent funds already available: out of \na total of $92 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and currently \nproposed under the President's 2008 budget, grantees have actually \ndrawn down just $2 million in payments on fiscal year 2006 funds.\n  This legislation also cuts funding for the Office of Labor and \nManagement Standards--known as OLMS--by $2 million, from $47.7 million \nto $45.7 million, while the President's request is $56.8 million. OLMS \nis responsible for overseeing union disclosure and corruption. This may \nseem like a small amount of money considering the scope of the overall \nlegislation, but cutting funds targeted for policing corruption as a \n``cost saving'' measure isn't a good way to build credibility with the \nAmerican people. We must do better. With Sarbanes-Oxley, we made big \nbusiness more transparent. We need to do the same thing with big \nunions. The Office of Labor and Management Standards can and must do \nexactly that. OLMS must be allowed and funded to do what we have told \nthem to do. The transparency and accountability is for the benefit of \nthe union members. Of course, this might be just like the card check \nbill where labor union management was trying to take away the right\n\n[[Page S13070]]\n\nfor potential members to have a secret ballot. Unions are for the \nmembers, not for the union bosses. Members have a right to know. That \nis what the law passed in 1959 was and is all about. Enforce the law. \nBe sure union members have a right to know.\n  I would also like to point out that the legislation does not contain \nfunding for the National All Schedules Prescription Reporting Act--\nNASPER. Known as NASPER, this law was designed to assist States in \nsetting up prescription drug monitoring programs--to make sure people \ncan't get multiple refills of their restricted prescriptions merely by \ncrossing State lines. Instead, this legislation funds an unauthorized \nsimilar program through the Justice Department. Congress should first \nfund the programs that are authorized by committees that have \njurisdiction over the measures. As the lead Republican on the HELP \nCommittee, I know the value of the authorization process--Federal \nprograms are reviewed by Senators and staff to ensure there is value \nfor program beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. Funding unauthorized \nprograms usurps the entire authorizing committee process.\n\n  All that being said, there are many provisions in this legislation \nthat are not objectionable, and some of which I support. Like previous \nyears, the bill contains language that prohibits the Labor Secretary \nfrom issuing regulations related to the Workforce Investment Act, known \nas WIA, until the Congress has reauthorized the program. Reauthorizing \nWIA is a bipartisan priority for the HELP Committee, and a top personal \ngoal of mine that I have been working toward for many years. Congress \nshould first act to reauthorize the law before the administration moves \nforward with regulations. This reauthorization is long overdue. \nModernizing job training programs will result in better, higher paying \njobs. Under my chairmanship, we passed this reauthorization--but it was \nheld by Democrats who would not allow the appointment of conferees \nbecause of concerns they would not be included in the process. That \nargument no longer holds true. They control a majority in each \nlegislative body, and a majority on conference committees. Congress \nneeds to pass this legislation to provide training for current and \nfuture jobs so Americans have the skills they need to get the best \njobs--instead of sending them overseas because we don't have trained \nworkers at home.\n  This legislation also restores the authority of the Railroad \nRetirement Board Office of the Inspector General to conduct Railroad \nMedicare audits and investigations. Similar language was included in \nprevious years, but was dropped in the conference with the House. My \nhope is that this year we will be successful in restoring that \nauthority. In September, Senator Kennedy and I, together with Senators \nBaucus and Grassley, weighed in on this issue with the Appropriations \nCommittee, thanking them for including this language in their bill, and \nurging them to fight for this provision in conference. Restoring the \nability to audit is fiscally responsible, and is the right thing to do.\n  In closing, while there are valuable provisions in the Labor-HHS \nspending bill that ought to be enacted, I will be voting against this \nlegislation because of the excessive total spending level, as well as \nsome objectionable policy language that I have discussed today.\n  I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues on a compromise \nproduct that can garner support from both the legislative as well as \nthe executive branch of our Government.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks, I have joined \nmany of my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle in speaking \nabout the recent events in Burma.\n  A few weeks ago, the world watched in admiration and support as \nthousands of Buddhist monks peacefully marched through Burma's largest \ncities calling for an end to that country's brutal military \ndictatorship. Amidst tens of thousands of clapping and cheering \nsupporters, the monks chanted ``democracy, democracy.''\n  All the while, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi remained locked under \nhouse arrest--an appalling situation that has continued for most of the \nlast 18 years of her life. Despite the shameful detention, the Burmese \npeople have not forgotten it was her political party that won a \nlandslide victory in the 1990 election.\n  During the recent protests, the monks reportedly reached Suu Kyi's \nheavily guarded home, where witnesses said she greeted them at her gate \nin tears.\n  This scene is moving in its dignity and simplicity--a population \npeacefully saying: Enough.\n  What happened next was tragic. The military in Burma used violence, \nmurder, and arbitrary detention to try to halt the calls for change. \nThe military did what all dictatorships do: it used fear to suppress \nits own people. Yet it is the military that is truly afraid--afraid of \nthe people of Burma, afraid of change, afraid of releasing Aung San Suu \nKyi.\n  This Reuters photograph is so graphic. It shows Burmese military \nviolently attacking peaceful protesters. It also shows a Japanese \nphotographer, Kenji Nagai, being shot at close range. You see his body \nlying on the street. Mr. Nagai died shortly after this photo was taken. \nThe military's mouthpiece newspaper brazenly said his death was his own \nfault as he was ``inviting danger'' by being among the protesters.\n  Sadly, reports from the past few days are even more tragic. Instead \nof reaching out to Aung San Suu Kyi and the international community to \nwork toward peace, the military has only furthered its brutal \ncrackdown, hunting down and detaining leaders of the peaceful movement.\n  Amnesty International has expressed concern that the arrested \ndissidents will be tortured--a real concern in a country with an \nabhorrent record of torturing political prisoners. For example, the \n2006 State Department Human Rights Report on Burma cites a recent study \nby the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners that meticulously \ndocuments the regular use of electric shocks, beating until \nunconscious, forced crawling on glass, and threats of rape. The \nGovernment is reportedly even hunting down simple participants and \nbystanders from the rallies, including groups of ``those who watched,'' \n``those who clapped,'' and ``those who joined in.''\n  Mr. President, this is madness. The United States and international \ncommunity must not allow this to continue. This is a government with a \nlong and well-documented history of brutality and indifference to its \npeople. For example, in eastern Burma, the military has destroyed 3,000 \nvillages over the past 10 years. It has widely used forced labor and \nhas recruited up to 70,000 child soldiers--70,000 child soldiers--far \nmore than any other country in the world. Today, Burma has an estimated \n1.5 million refugees.\n  Global condemnation of Burma's brutal actions has been loud and \nswift. European Union foreign ministers have just approved new \nsanctions against the military junta, including an embargo on the \nexport of wood, gems, and metals, and threatened further penalties. \nPresident Bush and First Lady Laura Bush have similarly called for\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\ngreater international pressure to make it clear to the generals that \nthey will be completely isolated by the international community if they \ncontinue.\n  The Association of Southeastern Asian Nations, ASEAN, expressed \nrevulsion at the killings and demanded fellow member Burma stop using \nviolence against demonstrators. Japan announced a cut in foreign \nassistance. And just the other day, the U.N. Security Council issued a \nstatement agreed to by all of its members saying that it ``deplores the \nuse of violence against peaceful demonstrations'' in Burma, called for \nthe release of ``all political prisoners and remaining detainees,'' and \nurged a ``genuine dialogue'' with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Recently, Senators Feinstein, Kerry, Lieberman, and I joined for a \ndiscussion with the Chinese Ambassador on the situation in Burma. We \ndiscussed the need for China, in particular, to play a more \nconstructive role in ending the violence and pushing for democratic \nchange. I am glad that China helped with U.N. Special Envoy Gambari's \ntimely trip to Burma and its support of the recent U.N. statement. But \nthe global community must do more. China must do more. And the United \nStates must do more. We must not let the brutal crackdown bring an end \nto the desperate need for change in Burma.\n  So once again, I speak to lend my support to these peaceful protests \nand to call on the Burmese military to immediately begin working with \nAung San Suu Kyi and the U.N. envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to bring about \npeaceful change and democracy in Burma. It should also unconditionally \nrelease all political prisoners, including four recently detained \ndissidents, Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, Min Ko Naing, and Ko Ko Gyi.\n  I call on the ASEAN nations and the Governments of China, Thailand, \nand India to use their special relationships with the Burmese \nGovernment to once and for all start democratic change. ASEAN should \nconsider suspending, even expelling, Burma under these circumstances, \nand Japan needs to apply even greater economic pressure.\n  I also call on the U.N. to tighten sanctions, including an arms \nembargo against the Burmese military. We in Congress should also do all \nwe can to tighten our existing sanctions against Burma.\n  My colleague Senator McCain has introduced important legislation to \ntake such steps. I am pleased to enthusiastically cosponsor Senator \nMcCain's bipartisan efforts.\n  The circumstances in Burma couldn't be more compelling: A Nobel Peace \nPrize winner is held under house arrest for 12 of the last 18 years, \nheld under house arrest even while her party wins a landslide election \nin the country; a brutal and corrupt military government pillages the \ncountry's economic wealth and its own children's future; and repeated \nattempts by the people through elections and peaceful demonstrations to \nbring about democratic change are extinguished.\n  No nation on Earth should support or protect this ghastly regime. No \nnation should trade one more item with these horrible leaders in the \njunta in Burma. And no nation should ever sell any arms to a regime \nwhich treats its people with such brutality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13071-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ALASKA DAY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, today our friends and colleagues Senators \nLieberman and Warner are introducing their bill to cap carbon \nemissions. I would like to outline some of the ways their approach will \nunfairly and unnecessarily hurt our most vulnerable families and \nworkers.\n  To begin with, capping carbon will make more expensive what we all \ndepend upon in our everyday lives. Our heating bills in the winter, air \nconditioning bills in the summer, every time we put gas in our cars; \nthey will all be much more expensive under their plan.\n  While the rich can afford higher power bills, millions of struggling \nfamilies cannot. Will we force them to\n\n[[Page S13072]]\n\nchoose between heating their homes or buying school clothes for their \nchildren?\n  I support higher Federal LIHEAP funding, but almost 30 million \nAmerican families still cannot afford to pay their heating bills. How \nmany millions more will suffer under this bill?\n  Millions of fixed-income seniors have no room in their budget for \nhigher power bills. Will we force them to choose between air \nconditioning in the summer or buying their prescription medicine?\n  Blue collar workers supporting middle class families will also suffer \nwhen their manufacturing jobs flee the U.S. for cheaper energy sources \nin other countries.\n  Are we telling millions of auto assembly, steel, aluminum, plastics, \nfertilizer, cement, and lime workers we do not care about them \nsupporting their modest families?\n  The Lieberman-Warner bill admits it hurts vulnerable families and \nworkers and tries to help them through rebates funded by carbon \nauctions. But vulnerable workers cannot afford to pay higher energy \nbills now and wait months later for a rebate check. Where do they get \nthe extra money to pay their higher energy bills now? What do they go \nwithout while they are waiting to get their rebate check later?\n  The whole carbon auction and rebate system is inherently unfair and \nunnecessary. Some push it so that companies will not see windfall \nprofits. I oppose windfall profits too, but they are only possible in \n14 States, mostly in the northeast and west coast where electricity \nmarkets are deregulated. In the other 36 states with regulated markets, \nutilities are prevented by law from reaping windfall profits.\n  That means a national carbon auction unfairly punishes 36 States in \nthe midwest, mountain, west and south where there would be no problem. \nMr. President, 36 States will pay higher energy bills then needed. \nFamilies and workers in 36 States will suffer unnecessarily. We must \nfind a better way.\n  Europe, in their system, made the mistake of passing out more carbon \nallowances then needed. We can easily avoid that mistake.\n  As long as the obligation we impose to submit carbon allowances for \ncarbon emissions is greater then the amount of allowances we pass out, \nthere will be no surplus profits in those 36 regulated States.\n  We must address the issue of preemption. We will create havoc with a \nnational carbon cap system on top of regional systems.\n  We also need to set up a liability system for sequestering carbon \nunderground. We do not want to set up an impossible situation where we \ncapture all this carbon and have nowhere to put it.\n  We need to guarantee that we will not harm low income families and \nvulnerable workers. Protections should kick in automatically at a set \nlevel, so that our struggling elements of society are not left to the \nwhims of a fickle and vague cost containment system.\n  We need to calibrate any cap plan to the ability of technology to \nmeet that plan'' The welfare of millions are too important to roll the \ndice that low carbon solutions are around the corner. We also cannot \ninflict too much pain on struggling families and workers in the interim \nwhile we wait for those clean energy solutions to come on line.\n  There are many things we can do now to reduce carbon emissions. We \nhave on the shelf or stuck in stalled legislative vehicles, measures to \npromote energy efficiency, promote low-carbon biofuels, cut vehicle \nemissions through aggressive but achievable stronger CAFE standards, \nrequire renewable and clean energy generation, increase renewable \nenergy transmission, green buildings, carbon storage research and \ndevelopment, and clean energy research, development and deployment.\n  That is 8 different ways I am prepared to reduce carbon emissions \ntoday. So before we go down the road of hurting the poor, hurting \nvulnerable workers, sending jobs overseas, let us take advantage of \nwhat we have now. Let us get serious about our energy future and fund a \nManhattan project for clean energy. Let us get to work where we can \njoin together and do so now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13072-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13072-S13073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SCHOOL SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 2 months ago, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee originated the School Safety and Law Enforcement \nImprovement Act of 2007, a legislative package that responds to the \ntragic deaths that occurred this past April, almost exactly 6 months \nago, on the campus of Virginia Tech and to the ongoing problem of \nviolence in our schools. We have attempted to show deference to \nGovernor Kaine and the task forces at work in Virginia and to \ncomplement their work and recommendations. Working with several \nSenators, including Senators Boxer, Reed, Specter, Feingold, Schumer, \nand Durbin, the committee originated this bill and reported it before \nthe start of the academic year in the hope that the full Senate could \npass these critical school safety improvements this fall.\n  Over the past few weeks, Senator Schumer and I have tried separately \nto pass the component of the bill designed to fix flaws in the Nation's \nbackground check system. Regrettably, our efforts were blocked by a \nsingle Senator.\n  I do not think the Senate should continue to stand by and wait for \nthe next horrific school tragedy to make the critical changes necessary \nto ensure safety in our schools and on our college campuses. Risks of \nschool violence will not go away just because Congress may shift its \nfocus. In just the last few weeks we have seen tragedy at Delaware \nState, University of Memphis, and SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, \nOhio, as well as incidents in California, New York, Pennsylvania, and \nOregon. I urge the Senate to move aggressively with the comprehensive \nschool safety legislation. It includes background check improvements, \ntogether with other sensible yet effective safety improvement measures \nsupported by law enforcement across the country. Accordingly, I urge \nthe Senate to take up and swiftly pass S. 2084. If we are prohibited by \nobjection from doing so by unanimous consent, then let us move to it \nand let those with objections seek to amend those provisions to which \nthey object.\n  There are too many incidents at too many colleges and schools \nnationwide. This terrorizes students and their parents. We should be \ndoing what we can to help. Just a few weeks ago, a troubled student \nwearing a Fred Flintstone mask and carrying a rifle through campus was \narrested at St. John's University in Queens, NY, prompting authorities \nto lock down the campus for 3 hours. The next day, an armed 17-year-old \non the other side of the country in Oroville, CA, held students hostage \nat Las Plumas High School, also resulting in a lock-down. The incidents \nhave continued this month, with the arrest last week of an armed \nstudent suspected of plotting a Columbine-style attack on fellow high \nschool students in Norristown, PA. Just today, in Happy Valley, OR, \npolice arrested a 10-year-old student who brought a semi-automatic \nweapon into his elementary school. The students in these situations \nwere lucky and escaped without injury.\n  University of Memphis student Taylor Bradford was not so lucky. He \nwas killed on campus on September 30 in what university officials \nbelieve was a targeted attack. He was 21 years old. Shalita Middleton \nand Nathaniel Pew were not so lucky. They were both wounded during an \nincident at Delaware State. They are each only 17 years old. High \nschool teachers Michael Grassie and David Kachadourian and students \nMichael Peek and Darnell Rodgers--all of whom were wounded by a \ntroubled student at SuccessTech Academy on October 10--were not so \nlucky.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act responds \ndirectly to incidents like these by squarely addressing the problem of \nviolence in our schools in several ways. The bill enlists the States as \npartners in the dissemination of critical information by making \nsignificant improvements to the National Instant Background Check \nSystem, known as the NICS system. The bill also authorizes federal \nassistance for programs to improve the safety and security of our \nschools and institutions of higher education, provides equitable \nbenefits to law enforcement serving those institutions, and funds pilot \nprograms to develop cutting-edge prevention and intervention programs \nfor our schools. The bill also clarifies and strengthens two existing \nstatutes--the Terrorist\n\n[[Page S13073]]\n\nHoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act--\nwhich are designed to improve public safety.\n  Specifically, title I would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level, and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced in April, and I want to thank \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this issue. The improvements include \nincreased funding for much-needed infrastructure changes to improve \nsecurity as well as the establishment of hotlines and tip-lines, which \nwill enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to \nschool administrators before they occur.\n  These improvements can save lives. After the four students and \nteachers were wounded last week at SuccessTech Academy, the press \nreported that parents had been petitioning to get a metal detector \ninstalled and additional security personnel added, and that the guard \nwho was previously assigned to the school had been removed 3 years ago. \nIn fact, the entire City of Cleveland has just 10 metal detectors that \nare rotated throughout the city's more than 100 schools. Title I of the \nbill would enhance the ability of a school district to apply for and \nreceive grant money to fund the installation of metal detectors and the \ntraining and hiring of security personnel to keep our kids safe. Over \nthe past 4 years, this administration has spent over $15 billion to \nequip, train, and build facilities for the Iraqi security forces. \nSurely, Congress can stand up for American kids who face unrelenting \nschool violence by supporting just a small fraction of this figure for \nmuch-needed school safety improvements.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of Virginia \nTech and more recent college incidents, title I also creates a matching \ngrant program for campus safety and security to be administered out of \nthe COPS Office of the Department of Justice. The grant program would \nallow institutions of higher education to apply, for the first time, \ndirectly for Federal funds to make school safety and security \nimprovements. The program is authorized to be appropriated at \n$50,000,000 for the next 2 fiscal years. While this amounts to just $3 \nper student each year, it will enable schools to more effectively \nrespond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  Title II of the bill seeks to improve the NICS system. The senseless \nloss of life at Virginia Tech revealed deep flaws in the transfer of \ninformation relevant to gun purchases between the States and the \nFederal Government. The defects in the current system permitted the \nperpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain a firearm even though a \njudge had declared him to be a danger to himself and thus ineligible \nunder Federal law. Seung-Hui Cho was not eligible to buy a weapon given \nhis mental health history, but he was still able to pass a background \ncheck because data was missing from the system. We are working to close \ngaps in the NICS system. Title II will correct these problems, and for \nthe first time will create a legal regime in which disqualifying mental \nhealth records, both at the State and Federal level, would regularly be \nreported into the NICS system.\n  Title III would make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits, and for funds administered under the \nByrne grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program. \nProviding this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. I \ncommend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area.\n  Title IV of the bill makes improvements to the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act of 2003. These amendments to existing law will \nstreamline the system by which qualified retired and active officers \ncan be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we permit qualified \nofficers, with a demonstrated commitment to law enforcement and no \nadverse employment history, to protect themselves and their families \nwherever they may be.\n  Title V incorporates the PRECAUTION Act, which Senators Feingold and \nSpecter asked to have included. This provision authorizes grants to \ndevelop prevention and intervention programs for our schools.\n  Finally, title VI incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of \n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  Let us go forward and act now on this important bill. The Virginia \nTech Review Panel--a body commissioned by Governor Tim Kaine to study \nthe Virginia Tech tragedy--recently issued its findings based on a 4-\nmonth long investigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill \nwould adopt a number of recommendations from the review panel aimed at \nimproving school safety planning and reporting information to NICS. We \nmust not miss this opportunity to implement these initiatives \nnationwide, and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety of our \nkids.\n  I recognize that there is no solution to fully end the sad phenomenon \nof school violence.

Mr. President, it is fitting that the Senate has passed S. \nRes. 350 which honors the scientific work and accomplishments of Mario \nR. Capecchi, who, along with Sir Martin J. Evans and Oliver Smithies, \nreceived the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their \ncontributions to the development of gene targeting technology.\n  What an honor to see these great men receive this distinguished \naward.\n  As with previous Nobel winners, one of this year's recipients has \nwaded through much difficulty in his life to go on and accomplish such \nan amazing feat--Dr. Mario Capecchi. I would like to take a moment to \nreview for my colleagues some of Dr. Capecchi's background and \nsuccesses.\n  Dr. Mario Capecchi, who has worked at the University of Utah School \nof Medicine for nearly 35 years, has, through both his life and work, \ndemonstrated that hard work and determination can and will lead to good \nresults, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.\n  Mario was born in Verona, Italy, in 1937. His father was an Italian \nsoldier who, soon after Dr. Capecchi's birth, was reported missing in \naction while manning an anti-aircraft gun in Libya. At the age of 3, \nhis American mother was sent to the Dachau concentration camp as \npunishment for her association with an anti-Fascist organization. Prior \nto her arrest, she sold all her belongings and gave the proceeds to a \npeasant family to provide housing for her son. However, 1 year later, \nthe funds were exhausted and, at the age of 4, Dr. Capecchi was left to \nfend for himself on the streets of northern Italy.\n  After 4 years of living in orphanages and moving from town to town \nwith different groups of homeless children, he was located by his \nmother who, upon her release from Dachau, had engaged in a year-long \nsearch to find her son. She found him in a hospital bed in the town of \nReggio Emilia, sick with a fever and suffering from malnutrition.\n  In 1946, his uncle, Edward Ramberg, a prominent American physicist, \narranged for Dr. Cappecchi and his mother to come to the United States. \nAt that time, he and his mother relocated from Italy to a Quaker \ncommune in Pennsylvania, where he would begin his education, graduating \nfrom a Quaker boarding school in 1956.\n  Dr. Capecchi received bachelor's degrees in both chemistry and \nphysics from Antioch College in Ohio in 1961. He then went on to earn \nhis Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard University in 1967. In 1969, he \nbecame an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the \nHarvard School of Medicine, and was promoted to associate professor in \n1971. Two years later, he joined the faculty at the University of Utah, \nwhere he began the work that would eventually earn him a Nobel Prize.\n\n[[Page S13074]]\n\n  Dr. Capecchi, along with Drs. Evans and Smithies, received the Nobel \nPrize for their discoveries of methods for introducing specific gene \nmodifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells. In the late \n1980s, after years of research and experimentation on mouse-derived \nstem cells, these doctors were able to develop the first knockout mice, \ngenetically engineered mice that have had one or more of their genes \nisolated and made inoperable. Knockout mice have allowed scientists to \nlearn more about genes that have been sequenced but have unknown \nfunctions. Through the techniques developed by these three doctors, \nresearchers are able to inactivate specific mouse genes and study the \nmice for any resulting differences. From this process, they are able to \ninfer the probable functions of the individual genes.\n  This gene targeting technology has led to a vast expansion of our \nunderstanding of genetics. Indeed, it has impacted virtually every area \nof biomedicine. The successful isolation of genes has allowed \nresearchers to determine their roles in embryonic development, adult \nphysiology, aging and disease. In addition, the use of knockout mice \nhas led to the production of more than 500 different mouse models of \nhuman disorders, including cardiovascular disease, neuron-degenerative \ndisorders, cancer and diabetes.\n  Drs. Capecchi, Evans, and Smithies have dedicated their lives and \nwork to bettering mankind. Dr. Capecchi has been a key advisor to me \nfor many years and has been a great help to me and this nation with his \nmedical and scientific work and knowledge. I have the highest praise, \nnot only for his work and intellect, but for his dedication and \nperseverance.\n  I am joined by Senators Bennett, Dole, and Burr in introducing S. \nRes. 350 recognizing the work and achievements of these new Nobel \nLaureates and congratulating them for the honor they have received and \nI want each of them to know how proud I am of them and their great \naccomplishments. I also want the entire country to know, that this is \njust the beginning. The work of Drs. Capecchi, Evans, and Smithies has \ncontinued to lay the groundwork and establish a strong foundation we \nwill need to continue developing stem cell research and someday, sooner \nrather than later, find therapies that will heal some of the greatest \nafflictions suffered by millions around the world. This is the great \npromise of the work of these great men and I am proud to honor them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13074-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise with pity and anger that this \nadministration can be so insulated from reality that millions of \nAmerican children will be denied health insurance because of the \nPresident of the United States and a small minority in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There was a critical vote in the House today: whether to override the \nPresident's veto of the children's health insurance bill.\n  Two hundred and eighty six votes were needed to override this veto, \nbut we fell 13 votes short: 273 to 156.\n  One hundred and fifty six Members of the House of Representatives \ncowered to the President and turned their back on our children.\n  They turned their back on almost 4 million kids nationwide who would \nhave gotten health care, including 100,000 in my home State of New \nJersey.\n  And they cast these harmful votes against the will of the American \npeople.\n  Eighty-one percent of the public supports this bill.\n  Yet the President's puppets in the House said no. They chose ideology \nover children.\n  They choose tax breaks for millionaires over a doctor's visit for a \nsick child.\n  They are more than willing to spend $12 billion a month on Iraq, but \nnot $7 billion a year for children's health.\n  You have to question the moral priorities of those who oppose funding \nchildren's health care in America.\n  Civilized societies take care of their children. I believe we are a \ncivilized society. I just think we have the wrong person in the White \nHouse.\n  It is time to put aside ideology and put the needs of American \nfamilies first.\n  The only good news today is that the bill on the floor of the Senate \nright now puts families first.\n  This Labor-HHS appropriations bill will help children live longer, \nhealthier, and more productive lives. It increases Head Start funding, \nmedical research gets a boost and we are doing more to support critical \neducation programs.\n  But despite all of these benefits, President Bush says he will veto \nthis bill too.\n  I say: ``shame.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13074-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13074-S13075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SHERIDAN CONSERVATION EASEMENT DEDICATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, recently I got to participate in the \ndedication of the first conservation easement in Sheridan County, WY. I \nattended grade school in Sheridan and graduated from high school there. \nI earned the Boy Scout merit badges I needed to become an Eagle Scout \nwhile I lived there. One of the badges was bicycling. It required \nseveral 25-mile rides. My first ride of that length went from Sheridan \nto Big Horn and beyond. That ride was on the highway. Today it would be \nmuch more dangerous as the area has developed and more people drive. So \nI am glad for this new conservation easement--what I hope will be the \nfirst of many conservation easements--that will make it possible to go \nfrom Sheridan to Big Horn on a scenic path by the river that will \nprovide safety and great views.\n  I want to congratulate the Volunteers of America for their great role \nin this achievement and ``first.'' I want to thank and congratulate the \nSheridan County Commission and the city of Sheridan, mayor and council \nfor their great cooperation. I especially want to thank the members of \nthe Sheridan Land Trust for their effort and vision. This is the kind \nof community, the kind of people, I remember growing up in Sheridan.\n  I was glad to play a small role in getting the 501c(3) certification \nfor nonprofit status pushed through the system. I also did some work \nfor conservation easements in, of all places, the pension bill last \nyear. I got to chair the conference committee for the pension bill last \nyear. At the end of the process, leadership from both sides of the \naisle brought me a small tax package to include. I mentioned that I had \na couple of small provisions I wanted included. One was a provision to \nget Wyoming abandoned mine land money released back to Wyoming. I found \nthe power of a chairmanship. The abandoned mine land money will amount \nto $1.6 billion for Wyoming. Another provision included was for \nconservation easements--conservation easements that would make it \npossible for the average person to participate as well as those with a \nlot of money. The bad news is that act is available only until Dec 31 \nof this year--unless it gets extended. The good news is this bicycle-\nhiking-running-nature path could be finished from Sheridan to Big Horn \nthis year with some tax incentives. I will be working to extend the \nincentive.\n  It is very important that I share with the Nation the words of Mayor \nKinsky at the dedication of this first conservation easement in \nSheridan County. It is the finest description of what we are trying to \ndo that I have heard. Here is what he said:\n\n       Look about you--the mountains, the creek, the wildlife. It \n     is as God made it. This is how it was before we came. Because \n     of what we do here today--preserving this place as it is, \n     unspoiled--it will be here for those who follow us.\n       There are those who say we inherited this place from our \n     grandparents. I believe we are borrowing it from our \n     grandchildren.\n       As such, we have a duty to preserve--for them--the beauty \n     that had drawn us here, and holds us here.\n       Fifty years from now, the town will have changed. Coffeen \n     Avenue will look different, our downtown will look different. \n     But this area will look as we see it today.\n       Future generations will not recall who we are, or what we \n     say. But they will recap the benefit of what we do here \n     today. We may hope that they will look out on what we have \n     left them and say, ``These were people of vision. These were \n     people who cared about the future.''\n       It is proper that this be done in a manner fitting of the \n     character of our people. This easement comes about not as a \n     mandate of government, but as a gift--given with love--to the \n     community and future.\n       The purpose of the Sheridan Community Land Trust is to hold \n     such gifts, preserving them for our heirs. It is our hope \n     that many more in the community may be moved to make similar \n     gifts to generations to come.\n\n[[Page S13075]]\n\n       With history the final judge or our deeds, we ask God's \n     blessing and help, but knowing here on earth God's work must \n     truly be our own.\n\n  Mayor Kinsky, thank you for those words. May they serve as a \nchallenge and example to everyone to do what you and the greater \nSheridan community have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13075-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today is the 35th anniversary of the \nClean Water Act, one of this Nation's landmark environmental laws.\n  Since 1972, the Clean Water Act has provided essential protection for \nour Nation's waters that enhance and contribute to human health and \nwell-being, the economy, and the environment. Yet as we celebrate the \n35-year anniversary of the enactment of the Clean Water Act, Federal \nprotections of surface waters that provide drinking water to an \nestimated 110 million Americans remain threatened until the U.S. \nCongress acts. Two recent U.S. Supreme Court cases have jeopardized the \nprotection of these and many other of our Nation's waters by calling \ninto question the Clean Water Act protections for entire categories of \nwaters.\n  In the 2006 consolidated cases of Rapanos v. United States and \nCarabell v. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court left more \nthan half of our Nation's waters without Federal protections. The \nimpact of that decision is compounded by the 2001 case Solid Waste \nAgency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps of Engineers, SWANCC, in \nwhich the U.S. Supreme Court limited the authority of Federal agencies \nto extend Clean Water Act protections to certain wetlands traditionally \nprotected based on their use by migratory birds.\n  The implications of the recent Supreme Court decisions are disturbing \nfor the safety of our drinking water, habitats for wildlife, and \nfragile ecosystems around the country. At the crux of the debate is the \nterm ``navigable waters,'' which the Supreme Court used to restrict the \nscope of the Clean Water Act in ways never intended by Congress. The \nfundamental purpose of the Clean Water Act of 1972 was to protect the \nNation's waters from pollution rather than just sustain the \nnavigability of waterways.\n  That is why Congress extended protections to ``waters of the United \nStates,'' and the Environmental Protection Agency's and Army Corps of \nEngineers' regulations have properly established the scope of waters--\nincluding all interstate and intrastate waters--needed to be protected \nin order to maintain the ``chemical, physical, and biological integrity \nof the Nation's waters,'' as called for in the act. This goal cannot be \nachieved if Congress does not restore protections that the Supreme \nCourt stripped from 53 to 59 percent of the total length of U.S. \nstreams, excluding Alaska, and at least 20 million acres of so-called \n``isolated'' wetlands in the lower 48 States, as estimated by the EPA.\n  It is important to understand that though the recent court cases \nfocused on dredge and fill permits under section 404, the definition of \n``waters of the United States'' is integral to the Federal Government's \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act as a whole. This definition is \nthe linchpin for State water quality standards under Section 302 and \nSection 303, national performance standards under Section 306, toxic \nand pretreatment standards under Section 307, oil and hazardous \nsubstance liability under Section 311, aquaculture standards under \nSection 318, State water quality certifications under Section 401, and \nnational pollution discharge permitting requirements under Section 402.\n  In light of these Supreme Court decisions, Congress must reaffirm the \noriginal intent of the Clean Water Act and our commitment to ensuring \nthat Americans have clean, safe water. The Clean Water Restoration Act, \nwhich I have introduced, will reestablish protection for all waters \nhistorically covered by the Clean Water Act. It will end the legal \nwrangling over the definition of waters protected by the original Clean \nWater Act by defining ``waters of the United States'' based on the \nlongstanding definitions in EPA and U.S. Army Corps regulations.\n  It is a straightforward, surgical fix. Unfortunately, special \ninterest and industry groups that opposed the Clean Water Act in 1972 \nare back at it again, trying to sabotage any legislation that restores \ncritical clean water protections. They are making claims that ``every \nwet area'' will be regulated, which could not be further from the \ntruth--from the downright silly accusation that swimming pools will be \nregulated to the flat-out incorrect accusation that ground water will \nbe regulated. My legislation does not broaden the scope of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Congress should not stand aside while the courts roll back more than \n30 years of Federal protections for our waters. On the 35th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Clean Water Act, we must step in to bring \nclarity to a law left murky by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13075-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout something very important--the Special Olympics World Winter \nGames.\n  It is a privilege for all of us in Idaho to be a part of these games \nas the host for the 2009 worldwide games. And it has been an honor for \nme personally to be involved with this wonderful organization. I know \nthe people of Idaho are looking forward to welcoming the world to our \ngreat State.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Harkin for his help. He has been a \ntremendous advocate for the Special Olympics. And from what I \nunderstand, he is a big fan of the games in his home state of Iowa, \nwhere they recently hosted the National Summer Games. Senator, thank \nyou.\n  I think we all know that the Special Olympics is a first-class \norganization. Its sole purpose is to enrich the lives of literally \nmillions of people across the world. Through training and competition, \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities have a chance to become \nphysically fit, productive and respected members of society.\n  However, Special Olympics is responsible for much more than games and \ncompetition . . . it is about quality of life. The Special Olympics \nHealthy Athletes Program, developed over a decade ago, focuses on \nhealth, fitness, and well-being of people with and without \ndisabilities. Last year this program made it possible to conduct more \nthan 135,000 health screenings. Just this month, at the World Summer \nGames in China, medical volunteers provided free dental, vision, and \nhearing exams. Clearly, the games are more than just a sporting event \nthey provide services to promote better fitness and health care.\n  So when the Special Olympics asked me to help with the Idaho Winter \nGames, it is easy to see why I considered it a great honor.\n  Now, hosting the largest multiday winter sports competition ever held \nin the United States isn't easy--and it isn't cheap. There is a \ntremendous amount of work going on behind the scenes. It requires a lot \nof manpower and resources to prepare the infrastructure and organize \nhousing, meals, and transportation for participants from all over the \nworld. As a world-class nonprofit organization, Special Olympics relies \nmostly on in-kind gifts and services. Raising enough money to pull off \nsuch a large event is a daunting task, to say the least.\n  This is why I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nprovided the Idaho Special Olympic Winter Games with some much-needed \nfunding. This critical financial assistance will make these games \npossible. It will make it possible for some truly remarkable athletes \nto compete.\n  Again I would like to thank both Senator Harkin and Senator Specter \nfor their devotion to the Special Olympics. Their work will make these \ngames a success. And while I am on the floor, I would like to invite my \ncolleagues to come to Idaho--to experience the magic of an Idaho winter \nand to experience the magic of the Special Olympics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13075-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13075-S13076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RECOGNIZING JOHN HALL\n\n Mr. KOHL.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to significant narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia is to continue in effect beyond \nOctober 21, 2007.\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, of \na national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of significant \nnarcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States and to cause unparalleled violence, \ncorruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For these \nreasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain economic \npressure on significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by \nblocking their property and interests in property that are in the \nUnited States or within the possession or control of United States \npersons and by depriving them of access to the U.S. market and \nfinancial system.\n                                                      George W.

The order \nsimilarly blocks all property and interests in property of foreign \npersons determined to materially assist in, or provide financial or \ntechnological support for or goods or services in support of, the \nnarcotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant \nto the order. In addition, the order blocks all property and interests \nin property of persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or to \nact for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to the \norder.\n  The order also prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States \npersons or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of the persons designated in or pursuant to the order.\n  Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in \nColombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, \nand economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of \nviolence, corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the \nnational emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures \nadopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in \neffect beyond October 21, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section \n202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am \ncontinuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for me, today is one of the most important \ndays in my career because, with the introduction of the Lieberman-\nWarner bill, today will be remembered, in my view, as the turning point \nin the fight against global warming. Let me explain why I make that \nvery sweeping statement.\n  First, this bill represents a bipartisan breakthrough on the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. When I took the gavel of the \ncommittee 9 months ago, I said that global warming was the challenge of \nour generation, a challenge that I believed our committee could meet \nwith knowledge, with bipartisanship, and in pursuit of that knowledge \nwe have held 18 global warming hearings and 2 scientific briefings this \nyear in the Environment Committee.\n  At our very first hearing in January, we invited all Senators to come \nto the committee and share their perspectives. More than one-third of \nthe Senate took part in that historic event. Since then, we have heard \nfrom more than 120 witnesses, ranging from utility executives, Silicon \nValley entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, religious leaders, and Nobel \nPrize winners. Indeed, yes, we had Al Gore, we had members of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and we also heard from \nbusiness community leaders who have formed the U.S. Climate Action \nPartnership. We heard from mayors, Governors, and leaders of both \nparties, from many different States, cities, and counties across \nAmerica.\n  Then a wonderful thing happened: Senator John Warner, who is the \nranking member on Senator Lieberman's Global Warming Subcommittee, \ndecided it was time that he play a lead role in crafting a landmark \nenvironmental law which will take its place beside the Clean Air Act, \nthe Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other great \nbipartisan environmental legislation.\n  Senator Warner, this decision of yours is giving heart and hope to \nliterally not only the people of the United States of America but all \nthe people who share our planet. I know in your beautiful State of \nVirginia how proud they are. We had a hearing with you and with \nSenators Mikulski and Cardin, and we heard about the impact of global \nwarming already taking place on the Chesapeake. Your Governor was also \nthere. So this is a great moment.\n  I cannot tell you how touched and moved I am that Senator Warner has \njoined Senator Lieberman. It is a wonderful moment in history. This, I \nbelieve.\n  We would never leave a child alone in a hot, locked car, and I \nbelieve the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will not \nleave this issue of global warming burning for another generation to \naddress. It is our responsibility, and we must act.\n  Today, with the introduction of this bill, we are taking the first \nimmensely important legislative step to meet the challenge of global \nwarming with hope and not with fear and with approaches that are \ncarefully thought out and some already successfully tried out, like a \ncap-and-trade system that has been so successful in addressing acid \nrain. Also in this bill, which I am very proud of, is a section on \nenergy efficiency, which has been so effective in lowering per capita \nenergy use, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions in my own home State of \nCalifornia.\n  For the past 50 years, the United States of America has been the \nworld leader in environmental protection. Laws such as the Clean Water \nAct, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Endangered Species Act, \nand the Superfund Act have achieved so much for our Nation and so much \nfor our people. They have cleaned up our rivers and lakes, improved the \nquality of our air, and protected our drinking water supplies. Each of \nthose laws--if you go back and study them--became a reality because \nCongress started on the path that, over time, would lead to enactment \nof strong legislation. The same is true for what we face today in \nglobal warming. We must start on the path to pass strong legislation.\n  I have been working very closely with Senators Warner and Lieberman \nas they have assembled their bill, as have many other colleagues. I \npraise my friends for including so many people, including the occupant \nof the chair, Senator Casey, who was quite involved in crafting the \ngreen jobs portion of the bill. I have been so impressed with the \neffort they have invested, seeking out the views not only of other \nSenators but outside groups and business leaders, environmentalists, \neverybody, pro and con, with whom they have met. They have put great \nwork into this effort. I am proud of that.\n  In my own conversations with them, I have laid out some important \nprinciples that I believe must be reflected in legislation to address \nthis challenge.\n  First, the most important thing is that any bill has to include real, \nmandatory cuts in global warming pollution. Any bill we pass must set \nthe Nation on the path to achieving the emissions reductions that will \navoid dangerous climate change. Under the Lieberman-Warner bill, we \nanticipate reaching 1990 emissions levels by 2020. This will send a \nstrong early signal to the marketplace, which is a very important part \nof getting where we need to go.\n  The second necessary element is the flexibility to respond to new \ninformation because all of us know that daily we face new reports, new \nscientists telling us new things we didn't know before. So I ask my \ncolleagues if they would include what I call a look-back provision in \nthe bill. The bill must include provisions for continuing to review the \nscience. We want to have our work based on science, and it has to \nhappen at regular intervals. We have to know whether we are doing \nenough, too much, or if we have to do even more.\n  Third, we must establish a cap-and-trade program for global warming \npollution like the one that worked so well\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\nin curbing acid rain. A cap-and-trade system will put a market price on \ncarbon, driving greater efficiency and new technology, while reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Fourth, we must protect the pioneering State efforts that are already \nunderway. The States have been leading the way on this issue and doing \nit in the most bipartisan fashion. In my own State of California, we \nhave seen trailblazing there with a Republican Governor and a \nDemocratic legislature. I believe my State has the gold standard bill. \nA total of 29 States have completed comprehensive climate action plans, \nand many have set mandatory reduction targets. We don't want to \ninterfere with their work.\n  Fifth, it is a moral imperative to do what we can to ease the impacts \nof global warming--not only on the American consumer but on world \npopulations suffering from drought, floods, and famine. The religious \ncommunity has worked very closely with all of us on this moral \nimperative.\n\n  Finally, a bill must take into account the actions of countries that \nare not making progress toward a clean, sustainable energy future and \nmust help level the playing field. Countries that want to export goods \ninto the United States must take steps consistent with our global \nwarming policy or be accountable for their emissions.\n  All of these elements I have mentioned are included in the Lieberman-\nWarner bill. Some of us may want to make them stronger, and some of us \nmay want to make them weaker. But here is the important point: We have \nthe framework. Every single issue anyone could raise about global \nwarming has been raised and addressed in this bill, giving us a perfect \nplace to start.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have introduced bills to deal with \nglobal warming. Each bill has made an important contribution to the \ndebate, and I know each bill has helped Senators Warner and Lieberman \ncraft an excellent piece of legislation. We have this framework. We can \nbuild on it; it embodies all of the key concepts. The bipartisan \nprogress on the bill is a reflection of how far we have come and brings \nus that much closer to the day we will have comprehensive legislation \nto deal with this great challenge of our generation.\n  It is with great pride that I yield the floor to Senator Joe \nLieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair of our \nEnvironment Committee. I thank her for her very kind and informed \nremarks, but, more broadly, I thank her for the steadfast encouragement \nshe has given to Senator Warner and me and for her principled, \npassionate, and very effective leadership. She understands that global \nwarming is real and wants to use the chairmanship she has now to see \nthat we, together, fashion a solution to this very real problem. I \nthank her.\n  I hope and believe myself that she is right--that we will look back \non this day, as we stand here together across party lines to introduce \nthis legislation, as the beginning of something very significant that \nfinally happened. I have said before, and I will say it again, at this \nmoment, I feel as if we had been in a race between tipping points. The \nchallenge would be that we get to the political tipping point where we \ncould come together and do something about global warming before we \nreach the environmental tipping point, after which it would be harder \nto avoid the worst consequences of global warming.\n  I think today we have begun to reach that political tipping point, \nand there is no one who is more responsible for that than the senior \nSenator from Virginia, my dear friend, John Warner. His partnership \nwith me on this and his commitment to get this done have made all the \ndifference.\n  I am pleased to stand with my friend from Virginia to announce today \nthe introduction of the America's Climate Security Act. I am proud to \nalso say that we have five original cosponsors--Senators Cardin, \nColeman, Collins, Dole, and Harkin. The doors are wide open for \nadditional cosponsors as this day and the days after go on.\n  This day comes after several months of work with Senator Warner, with \nour staffs, with stakeholders, environmentalists, business community \npeople, and numerous hearings before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  This legislation, S. 2191, America's Climate Security Act, is the \nresult of all that work. It is a pleasure now to yield to the \naforementioned great Senator from Virginia, John Warner. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first thank our distinguished chairwoman \nfrom California. From the very moment she seized the reins of the \nchairmanship of this committee, she indicated a strong desire to \naddress this problem.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut. He is the chairman of the \nsubcommittee with primary jurisdiction over this matter. I purposely \nchose, as the longest serving member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on the Republican side, to be ranking for the purpose \nof this day coming to the floor of the Senate and indicating to our \ncolleagues that we had formulated a starting point for the Congress to \nassume its leadership which I believe, as a coequal branch of our \nGovernment, we have.\n  I am proud of the achievements we have made to date. I shall address \nthem further, but at this time, I yield the floor to our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Inhofe, the ranking member of the full committee, \nand thank him. While we differ on the substance of these matters \nprocedurally and we work our will in the subcommittee and eventually \nthe full committee, I do hope we can have his cooperation.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask that the hour for this debate be \nextended from 10:30 a.m. to 10 minutes to 11 to accommodate Senator \nInhofe, who now will give his remarks, and then Senator Collins and \nSenator Alexander.\n  Once again, I thank my distinguished chairman and ranking member. We \nare off, we are out of the starting gate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Mr. President, I had to come down here. \nQuite frankly, I didn't find out until last night--actually, until this \nmorning, really--any of the parameters of this bill. My good friend \nfrom Connecticut just said they have been working on it for months and \nmonths, and yet nobody knows what it is. So only this morning I \nreceived some information.\n  I see it is very similar to the McCain-Lieberman bill that passed. I \nremember we stood here and debated that bill for 5 days, I guess it \nwas, a couple of years ago. I hope--and with the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee here--that we are going to have \nhearings on this legislation and spend some time, get into it because \nwe do not get into something this big without hearing very significant \nissues.\n  I will give a couple examples. First, let me ask a question. How much \ntime do I have, I ask my friend from Virginia?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator wants 5 or \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will go ahead. That is fine. I will initially mention a \ncouple of points that are of concern to me.\n  First, this has been something my colleagues have worked on for a \nlong period of time. I understand that is true because I have heard my \nfriend from Virginia tell that to me and others on the committee. But \nwe really didn't find out what it is.\n  I am reading something that came out of the Congressional Quarterly \nthis morning. One sentence:\n\n       Emissions caps would start at the 2005 level in 2012 and \n     decrease annually, reaching the 1990 levels in 2020 and 65 \n     percent below 1990 levels in 2050.\n\n  I assume that is an accurate description.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. As I recall, the other bill we had 2 years ago was that \nemissions caps would start at the 2004 level by 2012, and there was no \nintermediate step at that time. So it went down to one-third below the \nbaseline by 2050. That is my understanding. I think that is accurate. \nSo there is not that much difference. If anything, it is lower because \nthis is one-third below the baseline, and this one is 65 percent below. \nIt would be even more of a cut by 2050.\n\n[[Page S13082]]\n\n  The reason I bring up this point is because these issues don't happen \nin a vacuum. These are issues that are very costly. The term ``tipping \npoint'' was used recently. I agree there is a tipping point, and I am \ngoing to be reserving more than 2 hours in the next few days on the \nfloor, and I don't want my good friends to endure the whole 2 hours but \nat least give consideration to what is happening right now, and it is \nunbelievable.\n  I have never seen such a change in science as we have witnessed in \nthe last 5 months. The entire speech I am going to give is talking \nabout what has happened in the last 5 months. Let me give an example.\n  In August alone, the University of Washington claims to be ``the \nfirst to document a statistically significant globally coherent \ntemperature response to the solar cycle.'' They came out and said it is \ndue to natural causes. They were on the other side of this issue \nbefore.\n\n  A Belgium weather institute, August 27--all of this is in August of \nthis year, 2 months ago--natural causes.\n  A peer-reviewed study published in ``Geophysical Research Letters'' \nfinds natural causes.\n  Here is a significant one now because over and over, I say to my good \nfriend from California, we have heard that 1998 was the hottest year. \nNow NASA has come along and said, no, it was 1934. Interestingly \nenough, 1934 precipitated the largest increase in CO2 going \ninto the atmosphere. After 1940, there was an 80-percent increase going \ninto the atmosphere.\n  But here is the one, if my colleagues are not listening to anything \nelse, and I have a feeling they are not, I say to my friend from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am with you.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Listen to one point. I appreciate it. In the same month, \nAugust, they peer-reviewed scientific literature, all of the literature \nfrom 2004 to 2007. In this report--this is 539 papers. These were the \nsame ones used before as an example of what is going on. This is what \nthey are going to review. It has not been released yet. It was done in \nAugust:\n\n       Less than half of all published scientists endorse the \n     global warming theory.\n\n  Less than half. Then it says:\n\n       Of 539 total papers of climate change, only 38--\n\n  That is 7 percent ``gave an explicit endorsement'' that man is the \nmajor cause of climate change. That is huge. That wasn't here until \nAugust of this year.\n  I only bring these points out to say that anyone who says the science \nis settled to at least give me their attention for 2 hours. I will be \ntalking about these issues.\n  Here is what the American people need to know. I don't know what the \ncost of this would be if we were to pass the Warner-Lieberman bill. I \nhave no way of knowing because I didn't see it until this morning. No \none has made an evaluation. If we go back to the old Kyoto reductions, \nthe Wharton Economic Survey said it would cost the average family of \nfour in America $2,700 a year. Then when MIT came out addressing the \ntwo bills--the Boxer bill that is not yet introduced--it would cost the \nenergy system, it would increase the cost of energy an amount equal to \n$4,500 for a family of four, and this bill apparently, or at least the \nold McCain-Lieberman bill, which this is very similar to but a little \nbit more aggressive in the later years, it would be $3,500 per family \nof four.\n  I remember coming down to this floor, I say to my good friend from \nTennessee, back in 1993 during the largest tax increase in the last few \nyears prior to that. It was called the Clinton-Gore tax increase. It \nwas an increase that was equal to about $300 per family of four. Here \nwe are talking about something that will be 10 times the largest tax \nincrease in the last three decades.\n  This fact cannot be ignored if there is some question in terms of \nscience. They will say there is not, that it is settled. I am going to \nbe quoting facts that will shoot that down, and people should look at \nit. We have to realize we have a lot of families in America, and we \nhave to consider what kind of a tax increase this will impose on them.\n  My hope is this--and I say this to the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee who will be joining me in about 3 minutes in \na hearing--let's have some hearings on this legislation. Let's bring it \nout. Let's really spend some time because this is very significant if \nwe are looking at something that is going to cost the average taxpayer \nsomething like 10 times the largest tax increase we have experienced in \nthis country. I look forward to it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. As I said to Senator \nLieberman, before Senator Inhofe and I go to a hearing we are having in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I thank my colleagues for \nparticipating in this conversation. Senator Inhofe is right. This is a \nvery important moment in time. The cost of doing nothing, according to \nthe leading economist on this topic in the world, Nicholas Stern, is \nfive times what the cost will be to address this issue now. So let's be \nwise about what we do.\n  The second point is, I am looking forward to Senator Inhofe's 2 hours \non the Senate floor. I really am. Mr. President, I say to Senator \nInhofe, I am giving him a compliment.\n  I said, I am looking forward to hearing Senator Inhofe for 2 hours on \nthe Senate floor, and I hope he will stay for my 2 hours when he is \ndone. I will, in fact, do that because many of the points Senator \nInhofe makes--it is cherry-picking information.\n  I think it is very important that we have this debate. In many ways, \nit is good we are chairman and ranking member--and the last time it was \nthe opposite--because I do think certainly the Senate gets the benefit \nof the broad viewpoint on this subject of global warming.\n  I yield the time back to Senator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nand I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. Obviously, we are going to have \na spirited debate on this subject.\n  What I want to say is the pleasure I have in having announced the \nseven original cosponsors. As Senator Inhofe indicated, I had partnered \nwith Senator McCain on an earlier version of a climate change bill. We \nbrought it before the Senate twice. It failed twice.\n  To me, the most remarkable and specific fact today that gives me \nencouragement is of the seven original cosponsors--that is, Senator \nWarner and I and the five others who have just come forward without us \nreaching out to them--four of those seven voted against one or both of \nthe iterations of the McCain-Lieberman bill. So this issue is moving in \nthe right direction. It is moving in the right direction because we \nhave answered in this bill some of the questions and concerns that \nSenator Inhofe expressed about the economic consequences.\n  First, I wish to say America's Climate Security Act is for real. It \nachieves necessary emissions by putting a cap on America's greenhouse \ngas emissions over electric power, transportation, and manufacturing \nsources that account for 75 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions \nand by strengthening energy efficiency standards for appliances and \nbuildings.\n  I note the presence on the floor of our colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander. I know this was of particular interest to him. He \nmade a significant contribution to this bill in that regard.\n  Now, what does this achieve? It does what we have to do. It doesn't \ndo everything everybody wants to do. I have already heard from some who \nhave said it doesn't go far enough. But let me set up this standard: \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the group of more than \n2,000 scientists from around the world who just shared the Nobel Prize \nwith our former colleague Al Gore, has said the goal should be to keep \nthe concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere below 500 parts \nper million, because that will avoid what they describe as the high \nrisk of severe global warming impacts here in the United States, which \nobviously has to be our first concern, but also around the world.\n  I am pleased to say that if you take the Environmental Protection \nAgency's analysis of the McCain-Lieberman bill and apply it to this \nbill that Senator Warner and I are introducing, you will find the \nconcentration of greenhouse gases will be well below that danger level \nof 500 parts per million by the end of the century.\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\n  Secondly, Senator Warner and I are as committed to promoting and \nsustaining American prosperity as we are to protecting America's \nenvironment and the global environment from the danger of climate \nchange. Senator Inhofe made an interesting point. This is different \nfrom McCain-Lieberman, which had big jumps, or I should say big drops \nin greenhouse gas emissions. We create a steady glidepath down, and \nthat is going to be easier for the sources of emissions to deal with.\n  Yes, we set a good solid goal in 2020 to make it clear that this is \nreal, a 20-percent reduction, bringing us back down to where the 1990 \nlevels were. So it is real, but it moves slowly. And in this cap-and-\ntrade system, with the auctioning of credits and the opportunity to \nsubsidize some and provide free credits to other businesses while they \nare in the transition, we are going to smooth the impact.\n  We have also created a mechanism--a carbon market efficiency board, \nvery creative--which comes out of work Senator Warner did with Senators \nGraham, Landrieu, and Lincoln, a kind of Federal Reserve Board for \nclimate change cap and trade, which can step in during times of \neconomic stress to smooth this out so the American economy will \ncontinue to grow. And, of course, the basic premise here--cap and \ntrade--is to set the standard: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Make \nsure you are reducing them.\n  Others have said: Why don't we pass a carbon tax? Well, I suppose a \ncarbon tax would reduce carbon-emitting fossil fuels, but we don't know \nthat for sure. Look how the demand for gasoline has stayed up even as \nthe price has gone up. So you don't want to tax people without a \ncertainty of result. Mandatory cap and trade guarantees the result: We \nwant to protect our environment, our lives, our health, our wildlife, \nand our beautiful natural places. It does it in a way that will drive \ninnovation and entrepreneurship. The market this bill creates will do \nwhat we in this country have known that markets do best--they get the \njob done and drive prices down.\n  I say finally that this legislation includes many provisions that \nwere drafted, suggested and, in fact, in some cases introduced by \ncolleagues in the Senate. This is an incomplete list, but I want to be \ncertain I mention Senators Collins and Alexander, who are on the floor, \nSenator Coleman--and I will come back to him specifically--Senators \nBoxer, Lautenberg, Sanders, McCain, Bingaman, Specter, Dole, Harkin, \nKlobuchar, Carper, Lincoln, Casey, and Baucus. \n  Senator Coleman particularly has made a contribution to this \nlegislation that responds to a statement Senator Inhofe made. What is \nthe impact this is going to have on average working people in this \ncountry--middle income, low income? We are concerned about that, and \nSenator Coleman has essentially inserted a provision here that we \nworked on with him that will ensure that low- and middle-income \nAmericans do not bear the brunt of paying for this program.\n  This bill is a synthesis of an enormous amount of work on the part of \nmany Members of the Senate. Senator Warner and I are deeply grateful \nfor their contributions. Let me say it specifically: We are introducing \nthe legislation today. Our subcommittee is going to have a hearing next \nweek. We are going to do the markup the week after that, the week of \nOctober 29. This is an ongoing process.\n  Our doors, Senator Warner's door and mine, are open. We are putting \nbefore the Senate today exactly what he said, a framework, a strong, \ndetailed, politically credible bill that has a real chance of passing, \nbut we are not claiming perfection here, and we welcome the opportunity \nto work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is not a \npartisan issue and it certainly is not a partisan problem to fix it \nbefore our children and grandchildren suffer from it.\n  Finally, before I yield back to Senator Warner, I again want to come \nback to him. John Warner and I have worked together on many matters, \nmostly regarding America's national security, as I have served under \nhis leadership on the Armed Services Committee. His decision to come to \nthe leadership of this effort to stop the onward movement of climate \nchange has made all the difference. I can't say it any better. It is \nthe tipping point, as far as I am concerned, in this Chamber. I believe \nhe is doing it for the same reason that has motivated him in the other \nwork we have done in the Armed Services Committee. He feels America is \nthreatened by this environmental problem and he wants to be part of the \nsolution to it.\n  We all know our colleague is retiring, after enormous service to our \ncountry, at the end of this session. I think that together we have the \nopportunity, with his participation, for this to be, in a long life of \ngreat service to America both in this Chamber and in service in the \nmilitary, one of the great acts of service and leadership that John \nWarner has done for America. I thank him from the bottom of my heart as \na dear friend and a wonderful partner in this effort.\n  I also want to thank his extraordinarily tireless legislative \nassistant, Chelsea Maxwell, who has worked so well with Dave McIntosh \nand Joe Goffman on my staff. This is the day of a breakthrough, but it \nis only a beginning. We have kind of crossed the 50-yard line here, I \nthink, my friend from Virginia, and we have some work to do before we \ngo into the end zone, but with your help, we are going to do it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor back to my \nfriend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this wonderful organization, the Senate, \nhas strong friendships. That is the way we operate. It may not be \napparent. We tend to be a little contentious. Partisanship has always \nbeen a part of the legislative process since its very inception, but we \ndo have mutual respect for one another in this Chamber across the \naisle.\n  I thank my dear colleague from Connecticut for his very heartfelt \nremarks, and I assure him I return in full measure the compliments he \nhas bestowed upon me, such as I can bestow the same upon him.\n  Now, I am not as sure we are on the 50-yard line. I want to drop back \na little bit. I think we have caught the punt and we are beginning to \nmove down the field. This is going to be a very long and contentious, \nas it should be, piece of legislation. But somehow, I have a measure of \nconfidence that the Senate, as a body, will eventually act on a bill \nfor climate change. I am also confident that bill, in its final \nanalysis, will have the basic goals we are outlining today.\n  I say to my good friend from Oklahoma, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the full committee, yes, we just finished the bill last \nnight, but that is often the way things go around here. I have been \nabsent a few days, but I am hopefully back now for an extended time to \nget this bill underway in our committee. But we did sort of open our \ndoors for business, as the commercial world says, in August. That \nbrought forth a very important forthcoming from the widest possible \ndiversity of sources in the private sector, and not only the business \nworld but the educational world, the philanthropic world, and on it \ngoes. They came to accept our offer to work with us to try and fashion \nthis bill. So together with our colleagues and others, we have put this \ntogether and we are launching it today.\n  I want to make certain that time is given to my other colleagues, so \nI will give my remarks later, but I stress the work that has been done \nby so many of our colleagues prior to this bill being introduced today: \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill, which my colleague from Connecticut has \nmentioned; the Bingaman-Specter bill. Senator Lieberman and I have made \na point of personally going to the offices and visiting with each of \nthe principal cosponsors, I believe, of all of these various bills and \nindicating to them our desire to take a portion of their work product \nand weave it into this, the bill that is before the Senate as of today: \nThe Alexander powerplant bill, and Senator Alexander will soon be \naddressing the Senate on that; the Landrieu-Graham-Lincoln-Warner cost \ncontainment bill; the Kerry carbon capture and storage bill; the \nColeman CO2 pipeline bill; and the Klobuchar-Snowe registry \nbill.\n  We readily acknowledge the ground that has been broken, the important \ngains thus far of so many of our colleagues. But with due respect to \nthe\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\nadministration, the basic difference between the administration's \napproach and our approach is we feel that voluntarism will not achieve \nthe goals, the leadership that America must simply take on this issue \nto join the other nations of the world that have taken up leadership. \nThe only way we feel to do this is by law.\n  Essentially, we are asking the infrastructure in America--the \nindustrial infrastructure, the transportation infrastructure, the power \ninfrastructure--to consider very significant investments, calling upon \nthe investment community in America to bring forward the private sector \nresources and begin to make those commitments now so we can attain the \ngoals in the future. And, quite frankly, we have recognized from the \nbeginning there will be a burden on the American taxpayers.\n  There will be a burden, in fact, on almost every single American, and \nit will be financial in some respects. We do not anticipate exactly how \nmuch it will be, but every time you fill up your car with gasoline, \nsome portion of that will go toward America's role to lead in global \nclimate change. The power industry, the transportation industry, they \nwill all have to make their respective contributions.\n  So I join my good friend from Connecticut in acknowledging the work \nthat has been done by our respective staffs, the staff of our chairman \nand others, but this is like a great ship that has been launched today. \nAnd as we say in the Navy, you launch them and then you finish \noutfitting them. Now it is up to our colleagues to come forward with \ntheir ideas. We approach it with an open mind. This body will \neventually shape the bill.\n  We will move it into subcommittee next week, do our markup, hopefully \nreport that out successfully, move on to full committee, and in this \ncalendar year finish a product by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee such that next year our respective leaders can determine when \nis the appropriate time for this measure to be brought to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of the time \nbe equally divided between Senators Coleman, Collins, and Alexander, in \nthat order, and that they be given the opportunity, even though they \nare not at this point in time sponsors, to address the body. So that I \nbelieve the hour for this debate will continue from now until the hour \nof 11 a.m.\n  I so make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We did that in consultation with our respective leaders. \nI ask the time equally be divided between these two Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator will have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor to Senator Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut and \nesteemed colleague from Virginia for their work on this critical issue \nof climate change. We spend a lot of time in this debate talking about \nlarge numbers: the number of species that could be lost, the millions \nof metric tons of CO2, the billions of dollars at stake for \nour economy if mitigated incorrectly. But it is smaller numbers I am \nmost concerned about--hundreds of dollars. That is what the annual \nburden could be for a household making around $15,000 a year should we \nattempt to transform our energy supply without holding struggling \nfamilies harmless. One elderly woman waiting at a bus stop in \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, when it gets to be about minus 15, minus 20, \nsometimes minus 25, who is on a fixed income, who can't find money for \nher other needs if energy rates go up--this is the price paid if we do \nnot address climate change responsibly; the young daughter who hopes \nher dad can keep his job mining taconite up on the Iron Range in \nnorthern Minnesota. This is the family we must protect if China decides \nit won't take responsibility for its emissions. It is the numbers our \nneighbors count that raise the most critical issues in the climate \nchange debate, the little things that end up becoming the big things.\n  That is why, when I signed on to Senator Lieberman's Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act several months ago, we came to the floor \ntogether and signed our names to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nstated that any comprehensive, mandatory greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction program enacted by Congress must also take care of low-income \nAmericans, who will see their energy costs rise, prevent U.S. workers \nfrom being undercut by foreign industries that produce goods in \ncountries without comparable greenhouse gas reduction programs, and \nincentivize the production of clean energy technologies so that \nAmericans can create more green jobs at home while diversifying our \nenergy supply.\n  Senators Lieberman and Warner have listened to my concerns over the \nlast few months as they have worked to craft this legislation. This \nbill is hard evidence that they took those concerns to heart and that \nthey too care about the small numbers that affect our fellow Americans \nthe most.\n  There are several provisions I am particularly proud of in America's \nClimate Security Act, including provisions to provide an estimated $275 \nbillion for low- and middle-income families to help hold them harmless \nagainst increased energy costs, including additional funding for \ncritical programs such as LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram--programs that the Senator from Maine, who is on the floor, \nchampioned, because we know how important they are for those, the least \namongst us, who are impacted so greatly by energy costs.\n  This bill includes $30 billion through 2030 for job training for new \nclean energy jobs that provide new employment opportunities in the new \ngreen economy. It authorizes the President to require importers of \ngreenhouse-gas-intensive manufactured products credits if their home \ncountries have not taken comparable action. It incentivizes clean \nenergy technology by investing an estimated $400 billion through 2030 \nin zero and low carbon technologies, to accelerate our transition to a \nclean energy future.\n  This bill does not just take care of the environment; it takes care \nof our children. It is a major step forward in addressing global \nclimate change in a manner that brings the Senate together. This is, a \ntremendous bipartisan coalition. Some folks were not on this side a \nwhile ago, but understand the problem is real and the path we are \ntaking is a responsible path.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I thank both Senators for their \nhard work and determination. They have proven they are committed to \naction. I am proud to stand by their side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nLieberman-Warner America's Climate Security Act. This bill will address \nthe most significant environmental challenge facing our country and I \nwant to add my praise to that already heard of the two leaders, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Warner. I am convinced this bill does represent a \ntipping point because of the coalition brought together to advance this \nbill.\n  The scientific evidence clearly demonstrates the human contribution \nto climate change. According to recent reports from the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, increases in greenhouse gas \nemissions have already increased global temperatures and likely \ncontributed to more extreme weather events such as drought and floods. \nThese emissions will continue to change the climate, causing warming in \nmost regions of the world, and likely causing more droughts, floods, \nand other societal problems.\n  In the United States alone, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas, \ncarbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Climate \nchange is one of the most daunting challenges we face, and we must \ndevelop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  That is why I am truly excited about this coalition. Senator \nLieberman deserves much praise for his longstanding leadership, for \nworking with Members on both sides of the aisle. Senator Warner's \ncommitment to taking on this cause gives me much hope that for the \nfirst time we are actually going to get a bill through that is going to \nmake a difference.\n  This bipartisan bill presents a practical, economically sound \napproach to\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\nreducing America's greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent over 2005 \nlevels by the year 2050.\n  I also thank Senator Coleman for his contributions to this bill, for \nmaking sure that we looked at the economic impact, particularly on low-\nincome families.\n  I have observed in person the dramatic effects of climate change. I \nhave had the opportunity to be briefed by the most preeminent experts \nin this field.\n  On a trip to Antarctica and New Zealand, for example, I learned more \nabout the groundbreaking research done by scientists from the \nUniversity of Maine. One of those professors, a distinguished National \nAcademy of Sciences member, George Denton, toured parts of sites in New \nZealand with us. He showed us sites that had been buried by massive \nglaciers at the beginning of the 20th century but are now ice free. \nFifty percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860--an \nevent unprecedented in the last 5,000 years.\n  The melting is even more dramatic in the northern hemisphere. In the \nlast 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice covering an area 10 times as \nlarge as the State of Maine. At this rate that area is going to be ice \nfree by the year 2050.\n  In Barrow, AK, I witnessed the impact of the melting permafrost. I \nsaw telephone poles that had been planted decades ago in the permafrost \nthat are now leaning over. I talked to native people who told me they \nwere seeing insects that they have never seen that far north; that \nthere has been an extraordinary change in the pattern of fish spawning \nin the area.\n  These are dramatic changes. The time has come to take meaningful \naction to respond to climate change--not only talk about it but to pass \nlegislation. My colleagues have worked so hard to develop this \nlegislation that will preserve our environment for future generations \nwhile providing reasonable, achievable emission reduction goals, \noffsets, and incentives for the industries covered by this bill.\n  The America's Climate Security Act covers U.S. electric power, \ntransportation, and manufacturing sources that together account for 75 \npercent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It requires these sectors to \nreduce their emissions to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. I am \npleased that the bill also strengthens energy efficiency standards for \nappliances and buildings, and sets aside credits and funding to deploy \nadvanced technologies for reducing emissions and helps protect low- and \nmiddle-income Americans from higher energy costs.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by again applauding the leadership and the \nhard work of my colleagues from Connecticut and Virginia. I urge all of \nour colleagues to consider joining us on this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senators from \nConnecticut and Virginia for their leadership. Their presence in front \nof this bill makes a huge difference in this Chamber. I congratulate \nSenator Collins, Senator Coleman, Senator Dole, and the other \ncosponsors.\n  The question before the Senate is not whether to act on climate \nchange, or when to act on climate change, but how to act on climate \nchange. How shall we, in this Congress, begin to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions with the most certainty, least complexity, and the lowest \ncost? The Lieberman-Warner legislation prefers an economy-wide cap-and-\ntrade approach. I prefer a sector-by-sector approach, that is, devising \nthe lowest cost, least complex approach tailored to each of the three \nlargest sectors of the economy that produce the most greenhouse gases.\n  Since my first year in the Senate in 2003, first with Senator Carper \nand then with Senator Lieberman, I have introduced legislation to put a \ncap on carbon emissions from the first of these three large sectors, \nelectricity powerplants. These plants produce 40 percent of the carbon \ndioxide and 33 percent of the greenhouse gases in the United States. I \nwill now broaden my legislation to include two other major sectors of \nthe economy, one, a low carbon fuel standard for the fuels used in \ntransportation--transportation produces another one-third of America's \ngreenhouse gases--and, third, an aggressive approach to building energy \nefficiency. I am grateful to the sponsors for including energy \nefficiency in their legislation.\n  Tailoring our approach to only these three sectors--powerplants, \ntransportation, and buildings--would cover about two-thirds of all U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I believe I heard Senator Lieberman say the \nLieberman-Warner bill would approach 75 percent of the greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  As we implement laws reducing emissions from these three large \nsectors, we could learn more and move on to the other sectors in the \nfuture. A sector-by-sector approach minimizes guesswork. For example, \nthe United States has 16 years experience with a cap-and-trade program \ndesigned to reduce acid rain pollution from powerplants. The program \ncosts less than expected. Utilities have experience with how it works, \nand we have in place right now the mechanisms we need to measure and \nregulate carbon from utility smokestacks. Cap and trade, which the \nLieberman-Warner bill employs, and which my legislation employs for the \nutility sector, is a Republican idea, advanced by the first Bush \nadministration in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. With cap and \ntrade, the Government sets the limits and the deadlines, and the market \nsets the price. With a carbon tax, on the other hand, the congressional \ntax committees and the Internal Revenue Service set the price.\n  Cap and trade creates a more certain environment than a tax. Congress \nwould have to revisit the carbon question to determine whether the tax \nis high enough to achieve the environmental goal, which could result in \nconstantly changing limits and taxes. With a carbon tax there is more \npossibility that the cost of the tax will simply be passed along to the \nconsumer.\n  A sector-by-sector approach of the kind I advocate allows us to build \non steps already taken. For example, in the transportation sector, \nCongress has already begun to mandate renewable fuels to reduce \ngreenhouse gasses.\n  This year the Senate enlarged that mandate and adopted fuel \nefficiency standards for cars and trucks. I believe we should add to \nthose steps a low-carbon fuel standard; that is, requiring \ntransportation fuels to decrease gradually the amount of carbon in the \ngasoline they contain, which is a logical and manageable next step.\n  In addition, both in the Energy bill of 2005 and the Energy bill the \nSenate passed earlier this year, Congress began to encourage more \nefficient buildings. Making those steps more aggressive holds the \npromise for enormous carbon savings at the least cost.\n  I believe a sector-by-sector approach will do the least harm. It \navoids imposing new regulations directly on the manufacturing sector, \nwho nevertheless may have higher costs for fuel and electricity, and \ntherefore avoids adding to the pressure to ship jobs overseas.\n  By minimizing guesswork, my approach avoids grand plans that sound \ngood but may turn out to invoke the high law of unintended \nconsequences. I also believe a sector-by-sector approach is the easiest \napproach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe it is the easiest approach \nfor Members of Congress to understand and explain to our constituents \nthese very complicated issues. As the recent debate on comprehensive \nimmigration should have taught us, this is not an insignificant \nconcern.\n  The Lieberman-Warner economy-wide climate change legislation is an \nimportant contribution. I will not be a cosponsor as this point because \nI prefer sector by sector, but I will be a full participant in the \ncommittee and the Senate to produce a sensible piece of legislation in \nthis Congress.\n  The question before the Senate is not whether to act on climate \nchange or when to act, it is how to act. And we should act in this \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, Senators \nColeman, Collins, and Alexander. Each of you made a contribution.\n\n[[Page S13086]]\n\n  I thank the leadership of the Senate who made available this very \nimportant hour for our bill to be laid down. Now the work begins.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation which was \nintroduced this morning, America's Climate Security Act. I congratulate \nand commend a number of our colleagues but especially Senators \nLieberman and Warner for their work on this important legislation that \nslows, stops, and reverses global warming. I also thank Senator Boxer \nfor her continued leadership and unwavering commitment to bringing \nglobal warming legislation to the Senate.\n  There are going to be people in this Chamber and other places who \nwill find fault with this bill, I am sure. Some will say it goes too \nfar. Some will say it doesn't go far enough. But the most important \nthing is that this legislation, America's Climate Security Act, is a \nbipartisan bill. I believe we must have a full and robust debate on \nglobal warming, and we need to do it now. That is why this bill is so \nimportant. This legislation is both thoughtful and comprehensive. It is \nwhat we need to bring global warming to the forefront in American \npolicy.\n  I personally thank Senators Lieberman and Warner for their \nwillingness to work with me on issues critically important to working \nfamilies in Pennsylvania and America. I come from a State with a lot of \ncoal and a lot of manufacturing. I believe the future of Pennsylvania \nand the people living there is closely linked to the future of both of \nthese industries: manufacturing overall and coal itself. I believe we \nhave a moral obligation to end our contribution to global warming, but \nI am also optimistic that we can do this in a way that protects workers \nand creates manufacturing jobs. Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman \nunderstand how important this is to bring our workforce with us into \nthe new jobs created by greenhouse gas reduction and the programs that \nsupport that. Both Senators have agreed and have graciously offered to \nwork with me to refine a placeholder provision currently in their bill \nthat we call the climate change worker assistance program which we \nworked together to draft. I look forward to my continued work with them \non this program and their legislation. I am proud to say I am an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  Finally, I thank Chelsea Maxwell from Senator Warner's staff and \nDavid McIntosh from Senator Lieberman's staff for their work with my \nstaff, especially Kasey Gillette of my staff, who worked so hard to \nmake this possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I also want to say a few words on climate change and the \nissue of global warming. Let me begin by quoting from an op-ed that \nappeared in the Burlington Free Press, my hometown newspaper, on \nOctober 7, by Bill McKibben, well known as one of the most savvy and \nbest known environmental writers in the world. He happens to teach at \nMiddlebury College. He said:\n\n       It's not Democrats negotiating with Republicans or \n     environmentalists negotiating with business interests. It's \n     human beings negotiating with chemistry and physics, and \n     chemistry and physics don't really do much in the way of \n     bargaining. Science has told us what we need to do: cut \n     carbon emissions quickly in the next few years, and keep that \n     pressure on til we've trimmed our emissions at least 80 \n     percent by midcentury. No loopholes for vested interests, no \n     hard-to-quantify offset schemes, no giveaways to the \n     utilities. Just a commitment to stop vetoing the laws of \n     nature. That commitment has got to come soon . . .\n\n  The point that Bill McKibben and many other scientists and \nenvironmentalists have made is, we are up against very serious laws of \nphysics. That is what we are dealing with. It is not what I say or what \nanybody else says. It is whether we are going to get a handle on global \nwarming. Because if we don't, this planet is going to suffer severe and \nirreparable damage.\n  I begin my remarks by thanking Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner \nfor their hard work in putting together America's Climate Security Act. \nAs a member of that same subcommittee, I look forward to playing an \nactive role in strengthening that legislation. I look forward to \nworking with them on this issue.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank the 18 cosponsors of the \nlegislation Senator Boxer and I introduced in January of this year, S. \n309. Those are Senators Akaka, Biden, Cardin, Casey, Clinton, Dodd, \nDurbin, Feingold, Inouye, Kennedy, Klobuchar, Lautenberg, Leahy, \nMenendez, Mikulski, Obama, Reed, and Whitehouse.\n  This legislation, S. 309, tackles global warming as best we could \nbased on the science. To be more specific, this bill is based on the \ndesire to limit the global increase in temperature to no more than 2 \ndegrees Celsius, and to meet this goal science tells us we must \nstabilize global CO2 concentrations at no higher a level \nthan 450 parts per million. This level only provides us, the scientists \nsay, with a 50/50 chance of keeping the worst from happening. These \nodds are not great. It is a gamble. If we were cautious and \nconservative about these things, we would err on the side of safety and \nkeep the pollution down lower than this level in order to protect the \none and only world that we have.\n\n  I thank all of the cosponsors of the legislation that Senator Boxer \nand I introduced for standing with science. We should also be clear \nabout one other thing. This is a very important point. What the \nscientists are now telling us is, in terms of their projections, in \nterms of their analyses, they have been too conservative. What they are \nnow telling us is the problem of global warming and the rapidity of the \nglobal warming changes is more severe than they had previously \nanticipated. In other words, we have to be even more aggressive, not \nless aggressive, in addressing this major planetary crisis.\n  It may well be that the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced is \ntoo conservative, but it is for sure that we should be going forward \nand not backward.\n  Let me take this opportunity to quote from some of the major \nenvironmental organizations in terms of what they are saying about the \nlegislation introduced today by Senators Lieberman and Warner. I think \nit is best that I read from them rather than giving my views at this \nparticular point.\n  This is what the U.S. Public Interest Research Group says:\n\n       We applaud Senators Lieberman and Warner for their \n     leadership on global warming. Time is running out to stop the \n     worst effects of global warming, and this bill is an \n     important starting point for action.\n\n  U.S. PIRG then goes on to say:\n\n       To rise to the challenge of global warming, this new bill \n     must be strengthened. Three changes are essential:\n       (1) The bill must achieve faster and deeper cuts in \n     pollution, which is what the science demands. The pollution \n     caps in the bill aim to reduce total U.S. global warming \n     emissions by about 11 percent by 2020 and by just over 50 \n     percent by 2050.\n       Additional, modest reductions may be achieved through other \n     policies in the bill, but those reductions are difficult to \n     quantify and are not guaranteed. According to the current \n     science, the United States must reduce its total global \n     warming emissions by at least 15% by 2020 and by at least 80% \n     by 2050. In addition, periodic reviews of the bill's \n     scientific adequacy must trigger additional pollution-\n     reduction requirements.\n       (2) Flexibility mechanisms in the bill must be tightened to \n     prevent undermining the goals of the bill. The bill currently \n     allows companies to exceed their pollution limits by paying \n     sources not covered by the program to reduce emissions. \n     Ensuring that a ton of pollution from such ``offsets'' equals \n     a ton of real reductions is a major challenge. In addition, \n     offsets delay the transition to cleaner technology that will \n     be needed to achieve deep future cuts in emissions. Under the \n     bill, a company could theoretically meet its entire 2020 \n     pollution-reduction requirement through offsets. The number \n     of offset reductions allowed under the bill must be \n     significantly lowered.\n       (3) Polluters must be required to pay for every ton of \n     pollution they put into the atmosphere. The bill gives \n     hundreds of billions of dollars to polluters for free, which \n     will create windfall profits, such as has occurred in Europe, \n     and take vital resources away from easing America's \n     transition to a clean energy future. In the United Kingdom \n     alone, windfall profits from emission trading have been \n     estimated at nearly $2 billion. These profits come directly \n     from the pocketbooks of consumers. Under this bill, just \n     under half (49%) of the pollution permits would initially be \n     given to polluters for free, and it will take 25 years (until \n     2036) before we stop handing polluters free money.\n\n  That is what U.S. PIRG had to say.\n  Let me go to another group, an even better known environmental group, \nand that is the Sierra Club. Let me tell you what they said today in \ntheir press statement. I quote from the Sierra Club:\n\n       The bill is a significant political step forward for the \n     U.S. Congress, but unfortunately the legislation as \n     introduced still\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\n     falls short from what is demanded by the science and the \n     public to meet the challenge of global warming. This comes \n     even as U.S. states, cities, and counties move forward with \n     ambitious, science-based proposals to tackle the issue. We \n     look forward to working with Senators to seek the additional \n     improvements necessary for the bill to sufficiently address \n     the challenge before us.\n\n  I continue to quote from the Sierra Club:\n\n       At this crucial moment, we must continue to insist on a \n     global warming bill that is committed to scientific integrity \n     and economic fairness. In order to prevent the most \n     catastrophic effects of global warming, we must cut emissions \n     80 percent by 2050--an achievable annual reduction of about 2 \n     percent. In order to get the market moving and bring \n     America's clean energy future to life, any bill must start \n     out strong by seeking a short-term reduction on the order of \n     20 percent of total emissions by 2020. Disturbances to the \n     climate have come more quickly and forcefully than even the \n     most pessimistic among us predicted. The Lieberman-Warner \n     bill, as introduced, leaves us in serious danger of reaching \n     the tipping points that scientists tell us could lead to \n     catastrophic changes to the climate.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the Sierra Club statement of today:\n\n       While the bill has moved in the right direction, it gives \n     too many free allowances to polluters for far too long--\n     enriching executives and shareholders instead of generating \n     the funds needed to help us meet our emissions goals and \n     ensure a smooth transition to the clean energy economy.\n\n  That is some of the statement from the Sierra Club.\n  Let me now quote from another organization, an organization of \nphysicians. It is called Physicians for Social Responsibility, a well-\nknown group. They have also issued a statement today. Let me quote from \nthe statement of the Physicians for Social Responsibility:\n\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility appreciates the \n     efforts of Senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner to craft \n     legislation to address global warming but calls on the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee to make necessary \n     improvements before passing the bill.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       The reality of global warming is becoming more apparent \n     every day, and the science is clear as to what action we need \n     to take. In order to prevent this world-wide disaster, we \n     must stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse \n     gases. And, the U.S. must meet the challenge of starting now \n     and reaching a goal of 80 percent reductions below a 2000 \n     baseline. Unfortunately, the bill drafted by Senators \n     Lieberman and Warner will not meet that goal.\n\n  Let me continue quoting from the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, who, of course, are physicians. This is what they say, \nproviding an interesting analogy:\n\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility's approach to this \n     [global warming] is similar to the manner in which a \n     physician treats a patient: what are the symptoms, what are \n     the causes and how do we treat the disease? We would not \n     prescribe half of the needed medication to a patient, and we \n     cannot support a bill that does not fully address the causes \n     of global warming. To protect human health and reverse global \n     warming, we need to begin aggressive treatment right away.\n\n  That is Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n  I could sit here and quote from many other press statements or talk \nto my colleagues about the science, but I will not do that. This is \nwhat I want to say: If we are concerned about the future of this \nplanet--I know every Member here is--and the lives and well-being of \nour kids and our grandchildren, not only in this country but all over \nthe world, we are going to have to rise up to this issue.\n  It is not just a bargain here and a bargain there. Because you can \nhave all the bargaining you want, and all the nonpartisanship you want, \nand yet this planet will face catastrophic damage unless we deal with \nthe reality of the science. It is not whether we are nice guys or bad \nguys. This is what we are facing. We are facing science. What the \nscientists are telling us is their projections were too conservative. \nThe problem is more severe than they had anticipated.\n  I note my friend and colleague, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, made a \nvery important point that others have made, which is, as we deal with \nthe issue of global warming, let us not forget about the workers who \nare impacted, the consumers who are impacted. Certainly and absolutely \nwe must do that. One of the bright aspects, the positive aspects about \nthis whole discussion of global warming is if we get our act together--\nif, for example, we begin the process of breaking our dependency on the \nautomobile and expand our rail system; if, in fact, we produce cars \nthat get the kind of mileage we know Detroit can produce--we can grow \njobs in the transportation area, not see them shrink.\n  If we begin to move intelligently toward energy efficiency, if we \nretrofit our homes and our offices and our schools, we can create huge \nnumbers of good-paying jobs through the installation and the production \nof the products we need to make this Nation much more energy efficient. \nIt is all sitting there waiting to happen. If we have the courage to \nmove away from fossil fuel, to move to solar energy, to move to wind, \nto move to other forms of sustainable energy, we can create millions of \ngood-paying jobs.\n  I would mention to my colleagues that right now out on the Mall--I \nwas there last evening--there is a wonderful display of solar homes put \ntogether by the Solar Decathlon. We have universities from all over the \nUnited States of America, and from Europe as well, showing us what we \ncan do today in making energy-efficient homes and utilizing the \npotential of solar energy. California is making progress. Germany is \nmaking progress. We are not moving anywhere near the degree to where we \nshould be moving.\n  Think about the jobs we create when 10 million homes in America have \nphotovoltaic units on their rooftops. Think of the energy we produce \nthrough solar plants in the South and the West and the Southwest of \nthis country. Think about what it means when we have small wind \nturbines all over rural America. It is not only moving away from fossil \nfuels, which are destroying the planet, not only moving to clean \nenergy, it is creating millions of good-paying jobs.\n  We know how to do this. We know how to do it. The technology is there \ntoday. It will only get better. Our country has to start investing in \nthese technologies. We can create the jobs. We can reverse global \nwarming.\n  I conclude by saying this: I applaud Senator Lieberman and Senator \nWarner. I hope we can work together. But I think we have a distance to \ngo to make that legislation better, stronger, more consistent with the \nscience that is out there. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2192. A bill to establish a user fee for follow-up reinspections \nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would \ncharge a reinspection fee for goods that fail FDA inspection for good \nmanufacturing practices. Currently, businesses do not have to pay for \nthe second inspection if they fail. Essentially, then, the FDA is \nabsorbing this extra cost. This Nation faces difficult enough choices \nwithout subsidizing private companies that fail basic inspections. I am \npleased to credit the administration for identifying this proposed \nsavings of an estimated $23 million per year in its fiscal year 2008 \nbudget. Over 5 years, this could save as much as $115 million.\n  We must ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is being used efficiently and \neffectively, and this measure would help in our ongoing efforts to \nstreamline government programs and reduce the Federal budget deficit. \nFDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach testified about these fees \nbefore the House Agriculture, Rural Development, and FDA Appropriations \nSubcommittee in 2006. He believes, and I agree, that the reinspection \nfee will motivate businesses to comply with long-established health and \nsafety standards. Businesses that do not meet federal standards should \nbear the burden of the reinspection, rather than getting a free pass at \nthe taxpayer's expense.\n  One of the main reasons I first ran for the U.S. Senate was to \nrestore fiscal responsibility to the federal budget. I have worked \nthroughout my Senate career to eliminate wasteful spending and to \nreduce the budget deficit. Unless we return to fiscally responsible \nbudgeting, Congress will saddle our Nation's younger generations with \nan enormous financial burden for years to come. This bill is one small \nstep in that direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent the the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S13088]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF USER FEE FOR FOLLOW-UP \n                   REINSPECTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall assess and collect a \n     user fee from each manufacturer of a food, drug, device, \n     biological product, or animal drug for which a follow-up \n     reinspection is required to ensure correction of a violation, \n     found by the Secretary during initial inspection of the \n     manufacturer, of a Good Manufacturing Practices requirement \n     under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 \n     et seq.).\n       (b) Payment of Fee.--The user fee required by subsection \n     (a) shall be due from a manufacturer upon the reinspection of \n     the manufacturer as described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Amount of User Fee.--The amount of the user fee \n     required under subsection (a) shall be established by the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the terms ``animal drug'', ``device'', ``drug'', and \n     ``food'' have the meanings given those terms in section 201 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321);\n       (2) the term ``biological product'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 262); and\n       (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2197. A bill to establish the Federal Labor-Management Partnership \nCouncil; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nLabor-Management Partnership Act of 2007 to restore the labor-\nmanagement partnerships and council that were established by President \nClinton in 1993. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nRepresentative Danny Davis, D-IL, who is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House, and Senator Hillary Clinton, who is \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  On October 1, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order \n12871 establishing a National Partnership Council of Federal agency \nrepresentatives and labor organizations to advise the President on \nmatters involving labor-management relations. The Executive Order was \nin response to long-standing labor-management conflicts and the need \nfor greater cooperation between labor and management in Government.\n  In the early 1990s the Government Accountability Office and others \nidentified labor-management partnerships as contributing to increased \nproductivity, better customer service, and higher employee \nsatisfaction. The Office of Personnel Management, OPM, concurred with \nthose findings in 2001. In a the letter to President Clinton \naccompanying the report, then-OPM Director Janice Lachance said, ``The \nevidence shows a real shift toward labor-management cooperation and \naway from the adversarial approach so common in the past. I see a \nstrong, consistent desire on both sides of the table to continue on the \npath toward collaborative labor-management relations and no interest in \nreturning to the old ways of doing business.''\n  Despite the success of the program, President Bush revoked the \nClinton Executive Order on February 17, 2001, less than one month after \ntaking office. Since that time, labor-management relations have \ndeteriorated throughout the Federal Government. The new personnel \nsystems at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, which have \nreduced collective bargaining rights for those employees, have lowered \nemployee morale and heightened the adversarial nature of labor-\nmanagement relations in the federal government. It has become clear \nthat participation in the decision making process through labor-\nmanagement partnerships often leads to greater employee understanding \nand acceptance and a smoother transition to the new policy or program. \nAs the Clinton Executive Order said, ``Only by changing the nature of \nfederal labor-management relations so that managers, employees, and \nemployees' elected union representatives serve as partners will it be \npossible to design and implement comprehensive changes necessary to \nreform government.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in encouraging labor-management \npartnership and a cooperative solution to resolving Federal workplace \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain foreign nonqualified deferred \ncompensation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Representative Emanuel and I are \nintroducing the Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 which \nwould put an end to the practice of allowing unlimited amounts of \nincome to be deferred offshore. Recently, it was brought to our \nattention that U.S. hedge fund managers were deferring millions of \ndollars of compensation offshore. Less generous deferrals have been \nused by corporate executives for years.\n  Recent Internal Revenue Service data shows that the richest \nAmericans' share of national income has hit a postwar record. The \nwealthiest one percent of Americans earned 21.2 percent of all income \nin 2005. At a time when our personal savings rate has reached a 73-year \nlow and CEOs are paid 349 times as much as the average worker and the \ntop twenty-five hedge fund managers earned a total of $14 billion in \n2006, we should not be providing a tax advantage to allow income to be \ndeferred offshore and invested on a tax-free basis. Low-income and \nmiddle class families who are struggling are the ones who need tax \nincentives to save for retirement.\n  Taxpayers can defer paying taxes immediately on their compensation, \neither through ``qualified'' or ``nonqualified'' deferral arrangements. \nMost taxpayers make qualified deferrals such as contributions to 401(k) \nplans and individual retirement accounts, IRAs. Nonqualified deferred \ncompensation arrangements are usually used by senior executives or \nother high-income taxpayers who want to defer amounts in the excess of \nthe qualified plan or IRA limits.\n  There are no limits on the amount on nonqualified deferred \ncompensation that can be deferred. Offshore nonqualified compensation \narrangements have the potential to be more abusive than similar \narrangements in the U.S.\n  U.S. companies that grant nonqualified deferred compensation to their \nemployees are unable to receive a tax deduction equal to the deferred \ncompensation until the compensation is paid to the employee. By \ncontrast, offshore employers can locate in no-tax jurisdictions, \nprovide deferred compensation to their U.S. employees, and suffer no \neconomic loss, since the timing of the deduction is not relevant when \nthe employer does not have any tax liability. Accordingly, there is a \npreference in the Code for U.S. taxpayers to defer compensation in \ncertain offshore jurisdictions: it provides a significant tax benefit, \nwithout any tax disincentive/disadvantage to their offshore employer.\n  There is a fundamental difference between middle class Americans who \ncan defer up to $15,500 of income into a 401(k) and $4,000 into their \nIRAs and higher-income taxpayers who can defer unlimited amounts \noffshore. The Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 would \neliminate the ability of U.S. taxpayers to defer nonqualified deferred \ncompensation in offshore tax havens. Offshore nonqualified deferred \ncompensation paid by a foreign corporation will be taxable income when \nthere is no substantial risk of forfeiture to the compensation. A \nsubstantial risk of forfeiture exists where the receipt of compensation \nis conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services in \norder to receive that compensation. Individuals who currently take \nadvantage of such tax planning and who wish to make deferrals would be \nlimited to making deferrals under qualified arrangements which are \nsubject to annual limitations.\n  The Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 is not intended \nto prohibit a foreign deferred compensation arrangement if the foreign \ncorporation entering into the arrangement is subject to tax on \nsubstantially all of its income and denied an immediate deduction for \ncompensation that is deferred. For purposes of the legislation, a \nforeign corporation would be any foreign corporation unless \nsubstantially all of its income effectively connected to a trade or \nbusiness in the U.S. or is subject to an income tax imposed by a \nforeign country that has a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., and \na deduction is allowed for compensation under rules that are \nsubstantially similar to the way in which the U.S. provides deductions \nfor compensation. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is given \nauthority to determine whether a foreign corporation that operates in a \ncountry without a formal tax treaty with the U.S. can qualify for the \nexemption.\n  There are many different ways to structure an offshore deferral \narrangement. A prototypical structure would be an executive who elects \nto defer his or her year-end bonus in an offshore investment fund for a \nperiod of time, typically, 5 to 10 years. The bonus and any associated \nearnings would not be taxable until the end of the term of the \narrangement, assuming it complies with the Code Section 409A \nrequirements. This legislation only affects compensation which is \nearned, vested, and deferred after 2007.\n  The Offshore Deferred Compensation Act of 2007 only addresses \noffshore nonqualified deferred compensation because these arrangements \nhave the potential to be more abusive than onshore arrangements. This \ndoes meant that I believe that we should not continue to look at \nlimiting all nonqualified deferred compensation. I will continue to \nwork with the Finance Committee on this issue.\n  This legislation will put an end to offshore deferral arrangements \nbeing used as unlimited IRAs. I look forward to working will my \ncolleagues to address this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the use of Federal funds for flexible \nfinancing of Indian tribal municipal, rural, and industrial water \nsystem construction projects by certain federally recognized Indian \ntribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are still parts of this country \nwhere having access to a clean, reliable water supply is not \nguaranteed. Believe it or not, there are still places, many of which \nare on Indian reservations, where individuals must haul their daily \nwater for drinking, cooking, and cleaning.\n  Over the years, Congress has authorized several municipal, rural and \nindustrial water supply projects for tribes; however, funding for those \nprojects has lagged significantly. This, coupled with construction \ncosts that are increasing on average about 10 percent a year, makes it \ndifficult for tribes to assemble cost-effective bid packages to get \nthese projects built in a reasonable time frame. As a result, many of \nthe projects have stalled or have yet to be built.\n  One mechanism to address this dilemma would be to allow tribes to \nutilize flexible financing to construct these vital projects. Under \nthis option, tribes could issue tax exempt bonds or enter into other \nloans to construct these projects now, and then utilize Federal \nappropriations to pay financing costs over time. This concept has been \nlaunched in the Indian Reservation Roads IRR, program, which has become \na model for financing tribal infrastructure projects. The Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe in my State was the leader in securing the initial \nagreement in the IRR program. This agreement has allowed the tribe to \nundertake a major road construction project and complete it in a few \nshort years. Without this flexibility, the project would have taken \nupwards of 20 years and $27 million more to complete, according to the \ntribe's analysis.\n  A Department of Interior administrative ruling issued on December 22, \n2005, held that debt financing is an allowable use of Federal funds \nunder a tribe's self-determination agreement if the debt instrument is \nused to pay for valid water construction costs. Unfortunately, this \nruling applied to only one tribe. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday would affirm the ruling for all tribes, making them eligible for \nreimbursement of such financing costs. This will provide tribes with \nthe necessary flexibility to get their projects built now as opposed to \nhaving construction drag out for years, which will only increase the \ncosts to the Federal Government and delay the delivery of safe, clean \ndrinking water to many.\n  We have a trust obligation to meet the needs of Indian tribes. \nEnsuring a safe, reliable water supply is part of this obligation. In \nthe 21st century, no home in this country should be without access to \nquality water.\n  I am pleased that Senators Johnson and Tester are original \ncosponsors, and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 2201. A bill to provide for the penalty-free use of retirement \nfunds for mortgage delinquency relief; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home \nOwnership Mortgage Emergency Act, HOME Act, my good friend Senator \nMartinez.\n  This bill seeks to provide a measure of relief to those homeowners \nwho are having troubles meeting their mortgage payments and as a result \nare facing the prospect of having their homes foreclosed.\n  As a former Mayor, I know the value and importance homeownership has \non our communities. Housing is after all one of the foundational assets \nof our society. Policies encouraging homeownership is a good thing, not \njust for our communities but also for first-time homebuyers who through \nhomeownership can be a part of the ownership society.\n  Over the years, we made great progress as the homeownership rate has \nincreased from 64 percent in 1994 to 69 percent in 2006. That is why I \nam very troubled by the significant increase in the number of \nforeclosures that have occurred already and the projections of worse to \ncome, as a record number of adjustable rate mortgages are due to reset \nin the months ahead, putting an increasing number of homeowners at \nserious risk of losing their homes. According to one estimate, $515 \nbillion in adjustable rate mortgages are due to reset this year and \n$680 billion next year.\n  To underscore the seriousness of the situation, Mr. President, just \nconsider these sobering figures. My State ranks 4th in the Nation in \nterms of the percentage of subprime mortgages in foreclosures, and \ncurrently 17 percent of subprime adjustable rate mortgages are past \ndue. More generally, the number of foreclosures has increased 183 \npercent in the last year. Nationally, foreclosures have almost doubled \nin the last year, and more than 14.5 percent of subprime mortgages are \npast due.\n  While there is no one single solution to the housing crisis, there \nare a number of reasonable, measured efforts we can undertake that can \nhelp folks stay in their homes in these difficult times. To that end, I \nam introducing the HOME Act, which would allow low-to-middle income \nhomeowners penalty-free access to their retirement savings and allow \ntax free distributions from their retirement savings so as long as the \nwithdrawals are paid back to the retirement accounts.\n  More specifically, my bill would allow homeowners who are 60 days \nlate in their mortgage payments to withdraw penalty-free up to $100,000 \nthrough 2009 to be used to refinance into an affordable mortgage or \navoid foreclosure. Except for very limited cases, a 10 percent penalty \nis applied to early retirement distributions. As the tax code currently \nwaives this penalty for distributions from Individual Retirement \nAccounts for first-time home purchases, I think it is only fair that we \nwaive this penalty for those who want to keep their homes.\n  Bottom-line, this bill is about helping homeowners help themselves. \nWhile the 10 percent penalty is well-intentioned in that we want people \nto avoid using their retirement savings during their working years, \ntimes like these require us to recognize that sometimes such rules can \nbe counterproductive. Both on a homeowner level and on a community \nlevel, I believe that it makes sense to enable those, who can, to keep \ntheir homes. Ultimately it is up to the homeowner to\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\ndecide whether it makes financial sense to turn to their retirement \nsavings to keep their homes. At the very least however, for those who \ndo decide to do so, we should not penalize them for trying to keep a \nroof over their heads and wanting to remain a part of the community \nthey have called home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure as we seek to help out \nhomeowners in trouble.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Ownership Mortgage \n     Emergency Act'' or the ``HOME Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAX-FAVORED WITHDRAWALS FROM RETIREMENT PLANS FOR \n                   MORTGAGE DELINQUENCY RELIEF.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall not apply to any qualified mortgage delinquency \n     relief distribution.\n       (b) Aggregate Dollar Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the \n     aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual \n     which may be treated as qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n     distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed the \n     excess (if any) of--\n       (A) $100,000, over\n       (B) the aggregate amounts treated as qualified mortgage \n     delinquency relief distributions received by such individual \n     for all prior taxable years.\n       (2) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a distribution to \n     an individual would (without regard to paragraph (1)) be a \n     qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution, a plan \n     shall not be treated as violating any requirement of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats \n     such distribution as a qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n     distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such \n     distributions from all plans maintained by the employer (and \n     any member of any controlled group which includes the \n     employer) to such individual exceeds $100,000.\n       (3) Controlled group.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the \n     term ``controlled group'' means any group treated as a single \n     employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section \n     414 of such Code.\n       (c) Amount Distributed May Be Repaid.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who receives a qualified \n     mortgage delinquency relief distribution may, at any time \n     during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date \n     on which such distribution was received, make one or more \n     contributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount \n     of such distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which \n     such individual is a beneficiary and to which a rollover \n     contribution of such distribution could be made under section \n     402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as the case may be.\n       (2) Treatment of repayments of distributions from eligible \n     retirement plans other than iras.--For purposes of such Code, \n     if a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with \n     respect to a qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n     distribution from an eligible retirement plan other than an \n     individual retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to the \n     extent of the amount of the contribution, be treated as \n     having received the qualified mortgage delinquency relief \n     distribution in an eligible rollover distribution (as defined \n     in section 402(c)(4) of such Code) and as having transferred \n     the amount to the eligible retirement plan in a direct \n     trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of the \n     distribution.\n       (3) Treatment of repayments for distributions from iras.--\n     For purposes of such Code, if a contribution is made pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) with respect to a qualified mortgage \n     delinquency relief distribution from an individual retirement \n     plan (as defined by section 7701(a)(37) of such Code), then, \n     to the extent of the amount of the contribution, the \n     qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution shall be \n     treated as a distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of \n     such Code and as having been transferred to the eligible \n     retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer \n     within 60 days of the distribution.\n       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) Qualified mortgage delinquency

  \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  2204. A bill to assist wildlife populations and wildlife habitats in \nadapting to and surviving the effects of global warming, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very real \nand serious issue of global climate change, and specifically our \nefforts to help America's fish and wildlife, public lands, and oceans \nadapt to and survive global warming.\n  I am aware that there remain some in this country, and even in this \nchamber, who choose to reject the overwhelming scientific evidence that \nglobal warming is occurring today, and will worsen severely if nothing \nis done. For years, Congress and the Bush administration have delayed \nthe implementation of swift and aggressive measures to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions. We can delay no longer. But as we work to \nmitigate the causes of global warming, we must also take urgent action \nto address its effects.\n  Climate change can have a devastating impact not only on the \nenvironment, but on the living things that depend on it. The early \nwarning signs of climate change--taking place not just in the far \nreaches of the Arctic but also right in our own backyards--have shown \nthat the world's wildlife is particularly vulnerable.\n  In Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, the state's most distinctive \necological feature, the gradually-warming water\n\n[[Page S13092]]\n\ntemperature has contributed to a significant ecosystem shift. This \nwarming has already resulted in a documented increase in ocean \ntemperatures, leading to massive fish kills, like we experienced in \nGreenwich Bay in the summer of 2003, and other ecological damage.\n  The changing environment in the Bay has had a broad and significant \nimpact on fish and shellfish. Cold water species, such as winter \nflounder, that were once abundant in the Bay and had a high commercial \nvalue have been replaced by warmer water species, such as scup, that \nhave a lower value. This has happened in just the past 20 years--a \nfrighteningly quick timeline and apparently not what Nature intended. \nThe shift in species has serious implications for Rhode Island's \nfishermen, whose work has been part of our State's economy for \ngenerations.\n  When I recently traveled to Greenland to witness firsthand the most \nsevere and visible effects of climate change, one of the most striking \nof these was global warming's impact on Greenland's population of polar \nbears. The Greenland ice cap is melting at a rate never before seen in \ndocumented history. Melting sea ice and glaciers there and in other \nparts of the Arctic are gradually raising sea levels around the world, \nshrinking polar bears' habitats and bringing them into increasing \ncontact with humans. In some cases, we were told, villagers have been \nforced to shoot polar bears with their cubs forced into populated areas \nin search of food.\n  Global warming represents the single greatest threat to our natural \nenvironment and wildlife, and we must act decisively if we are to avoid \ndisaster.\n  America's ocean and terrestrial wildlife is a fundamental part of our \nnational heritage, and conservation of our wildlife is a core value \nshared by all Americans. Climate change is directly related to the \nspecies decline we have experienced over the last two decades, both on \nland and in our waters. The combined impact of climate change, loss of \nhabitat due to development pressures, and exploitation of our natural \nresources threatens to drive many species over the brink to permanent \nextinction.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will help bolster our oceans \nand wildlife against one of the most significant of these pressures--\nthat of global climate change.\n  The Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act represents the first \ncomprehensive approach to mitigate the impact of climate change on \nAmerica's wildlife, oceans, and other natural systems. I am proud and \npleased to have the distinguished chair of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Boxer, join me as an original cosponsor of \nthis bill.\n  The bill has three primary goals: first, it will create a coordinated \nnational strategy, based on sound science, to guide Federal, State, and \nlocal agency actions to address global warming's threat to our oceans \nand wildlife. The Secretary of Interior will develop a national \nstrategy for managing terrestrial wildlife and the habitats they depend \non, and the Secretary of Commerce will develop a national strategy for \nour oceans, coastal, and great lakes ecosystems. Both Secretaries will \nconsult with other affected federal agencies, States, tribes, local \ngovernments, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders to \ndevelop the strategy.\n  Second, the bill will support improved science capacity for Federal \nagencies to respond to global warming, including the establishment of a \nNational Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center in the U.S. \nGeological Survey for terrestrial wildlife and a comparable Science \nAdvisory Board within the Department of Commerce to provide scientific \nand technical advice to respond to the impacts of global warming on \nocean and coastal ecosystems.\n  Finally, the bill directs that funding for implementation of the \nnational strategy be allocated in a balanced, strategic, and efficient \nway to the Federal programs, States, and tribal agencies charged with \ncarrying out the national strategy.\n  The impact of climate change on our oceans and wildlife is an issue \ntoo important to ignore. Human activity has caused climate change and \nwe must be responsible for solving it. We have an obligation to our \nchildren and grandchildren to leave behind a natural environment as \ngood, and we would hope and pray better, than the one we inherited. \nPreserving America's wildlife and oceans so that the next generation \ncan enjoy an unspoiled natural environment, and our many traditions of \nhunting, fishing and other outdoor recreation, is a responsibility we \nmust uphold.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 21. A joint resolution proposing amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to contributions and \nexpenditures intended to affect elections; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to join Senators Schumer, \nSpecter and Cochran in introducing a constitutional amendment to \noverturn the 1976 Supreme Court decision in the case of Buckley v. \nValeo and restore Congress's power to regulate campaign finances.\n  This constitutional amendment is a necessary first step in restoring \nconfidence in our system of government. The Court's decision in \nBuckley, which equated money with speech, was fundamentally flawed. \nUnfortunately, since that decision, our democracy has been perverted. \nCosts of elections have spiraled out of control, office seekers are \nrequired to spend more time than ever raising money, and special \ninterests correspondingly have greater access than ever before. As a \nresult, the integrity of our democracy continues to wane.\n  Make no mistake, I am extremely reluctant to amend the Constitution. \nAmending the Constitution rightly is an extraordinary step that has \nseldom been done in our history. But, when it has been truly needed, we \nhave done so. Reluctantly, I have reached the conclusion that it is \nneeded now. Without this amendment, our nation is simply too limited in \nits ability to deal with corruption and to restore confidence in our \nelectoral system. The integrity of our democratic system not only deems \nit appropriate for us to approve a constitutional amendment, it \nrequires it.\n  Until we have the ability to truly create a system of campaign \nfinance, we will continue to have an escalation of spending on \ncampaigns, and an escalation of continued distrust by the American \npeople in their political system. This amendment is a necessary first \nstep and I encourage my colleagues to support this vital measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                             S. J. Res. 21\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years after \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. Congress shall have power to regulate the \n     raising and spending of money, including through setting \n     limits, for campaigns for nomination for election to, or for \n     election to, Federal office.\n       ``Section 2. A State shall have power to regulate the \n     raising and spending of money, including through setting \n     limits, for--\n       ``(1) State or local ballot initiatives, referenda, \n     plebiscites, or other similar ballot measures; and\n       ``(2) campaigns for nomination for election to, or for \n     election to, State or local office.\n       ``Section 3.

Res. 351\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 21, 2007, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13099-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13099-S13100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 352--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n          20TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED STATES-MONGOLIA RELATIONS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Mongolia has made incredible strides to \nimprove its relationship with the United States since 1987. Following \nthe downfall of communism in that nation, our ties have grown \nexponentially.\n  Mongolia has worked hard in the past two decades to create a robust \nand strong democracy and the United States has been a partner in that \neffort from its inception.\n  Although it lies on the other side of the globe and sits between \nRussia and China, Mongolia has long sought close ties with the United \nStates, with some even referring to the United States as its ``Third \nNeighbor.''\n  On the economic front, the United States-Mongolian relationship is \ndynamic and growing with over one hundred U.S. and U.S.-Mongolian joint \nventures registered in areas ranging from oil exploration, textiles, \nanimal husbandry, tourism, mining, and banking. The United States is \nalso one of Mongolia's largest sources of foreign investment.\n  While a large recipient of foreign aid, Mongolia still commits itself \nto giving back to the global community through its significant \npeacekeeping efforts in Africa and Eastern Europe, with personnel in \nSierra Leone and Kosovo.\n  Mongolia is also a strong partner in the War on Terror. Mongolia has \ncontributed engineers, troops, and medical personnel to Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and has participated in training National Army artillery units \nin Afghanistan. Prior to 2000, Mongolia did not have a national policy \nof deploying forces beyond its borders. Yet they were the first \ncoalition country to contribute an infantry battalion to Iraq.\n  Mongolia's contributions mean a bit more to the State of Alaska. \nSince 2003, we have partnered with Mongolia through the Alaska-Mongolia \nNational Guard Partnership. Our National Guard has established broad \nworking relationships and increased exchanges with their Mongolian \npartners. They stand side by side with the Mongolian Armed Forces in \nIraq--in fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Defense specifically requested \nAlaska National Guard support based on Alaska's relationship with their \nnation.\n  The success that the partnership has enjoyed is a direct reflection \nof the willingness and eagerness on both sides to further our \nrelations. The Alaska National Guard tells me that Mongolia is \nenthusiastic about their democratic reforms and is aggressively working \nto meet its goals.\n  So with 2007 being the 20th Anniversary of U.S.-Mongolia relations, I \nam proud to introduce this resolution marking our ties and the \nsignificant progress that has been achieved between our two countries \nin that short time frame. I look forward to what the next 20 years will \nbring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13100-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13100-S13101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 353--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n IMPORTANCE OF A SOVEREIGN, DEMOCRATIC, AND PROSPEROUS LEBANON AND THE \n   NEED FOR FREE AND FAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN LEBANON WITHOUT \n                  INTIMIDATION OR FOREIGN INTERFERENCE\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Martinez, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nSmith, Mr. Bond, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Levin, Mr. Voinovich, \nMrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Upon introduction, the bill \n     shall be referred to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     under paragraph (2). If the bill is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, then any Member of \n     Congress may introduce that bill in their respective House of \n     Congress beginning on the date that is the 5th calendar day \n     that such House is in session following the date of the \n     submission of such proposal with provisions.\n       (2) Committee consideration.--\n       (A) Referral.--A bill introduced under paragraph (1) shall \n     be referred to any appropriate committee of jurisdiction in \n     the Senate, any appropriate committee of jurisdiction in the \n     House of Representatives, the Committee on the Budget and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate, and the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \n     on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     introduction of the bill, each committee of Congress to which \n     the bill was referred shall report the bill or a committee \n     amendment thereto.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If a committee to which is \n     referred a bill has not reported such bill at the end of 30 \n     calendar days after its introduction or at the end of the \n     first day after there has been reported to the House involved \n     a bill, whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed \n     to be\n\n[[Page S13108]]\n\n     discharged from further consideration of such bill, and such \n     bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the House \n     involved.\n       (b) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (1) Consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the \n     date on which a committee has been discharged from \n     consideration of a bill, the majority leader of the Senate, \n     or the majority leader's designee, or the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, or the Speaker's designee, shall \n     move to proceed to the consideration of the committee \n     amendment to the bill, and if there is no such amendment, to \n     the bill.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 351, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 351) designating the week beginning \n     October 21, 2007, as ``National Character Counts Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Domenici and I \nsubmitted a resolution designating next week, the week of October 21-\n27, 2007 as ``National Character Counts Week.'' I have worked for many \nyears on the issue of character education and hope that by designating \na special week to this important cause, students and teachers will come \ntogether to participate in character building activities in their \nschools this week and throughout the year.\n  Senator Domenici and I first established the Partnerships in \nCharacter Education Pilot Project in 1994 and since then we have worked \ntogether regularly to commemorate National Character Counts Week. \nCharacter education is about celebrating what's right with young people \nwhile enabling them to develop the knowledge and life skills necessary \nin order to embrace ethical and responsible behavior. I am pleased that \nwe are continuing our efforts today to help expand the ability of \nStates and schools to make character education a central part of every \nchild's education.\n  While English, math and science provide the figurative bricks of \nschools, character education provides the mortar. Trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship are the six \npillars of character. The standards of conduct that arise out of those \nvalues constitute the foundation of ethics, and therefore, of ethical \ndecisionmaking. Character education provides students a context within \nwhich to learn. If we view education simply as the imparting of \nknowledge to our children, then we will not only miss an opportunity, \nbut we will also jeopardize our future.\n  Currently, there are character education programs across all 50 \nStates in rural, urban and suburban areas at every grade level. I hope \nthat in celebrating National Character Counts Week, that more schools \nin every State adopt similar programs.\n  Character education programs work. Schools across the country that \nhave adopted strong character education programs report better student \nperformance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student \ninvolvement within their communities. Children want direction; they \nwant to be taught right from wrong. Young people yearn for consistent \nadult involvement, and when they get it, according to surveys, they are \nless inclined to use illegal drugs, vandalize property or commit \nsuicide. The American public wants character education in our schools, \ntoo. Studies show that approximately 90 percent of Americans support \nschools teaching character education.\n  Character education can and is being incorporated into children's \nlives in and outside of the classroom. It provides a helping hand to \nour schools and communities to ensure our children's futures are bright \nand filled with opportunities for success. Character education not only \ncultivates minds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may only \nrepresent one-quarter of our population, they are 100 percent of our \nfuture.\n  I submit that character transcends religious, cultural, political, \nand socio-economic barriers. I believe our country is having a renewed \nfocus on character and this resolution sends a wonderful message to \nAmericans and will help those of us involved in character education \nreinvigorate our efforts to get more communities and schools involved. \nSo today, Senator Domenici and I submitted a resolution to accomplish \njust that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring together even \nmore communities to ensure that character education is a part of every \nchild's life. I hope that my colleagues will join us in this important \neffort.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today my good friend Senator Dodd and I \nsubmitted a resolution designating the week of October 21 as the 2007 \nNational Character Counts Week.\n  Our character is the foundation of who we are as people and how we \nare perceived by the world. Every day our character and ethics are \ntested through the decisions we make and the behavior we exhibit. The \nNational Character Counts program focuses on ``Six Pillars of \nCharacter'' which are promoted through school and community based \ncharacter education programs across the country. The six pillars are: \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship.\n  I have supported Character Counts throughout the years because I \nbelieve this program reaches out to all youth and adults, as the \nCharacter Counts Coalition states, no matter the individual's race, \ncreed, politics, gender, and wealth. In my home state of New Mexico, we \nhave run many successful Character Counts programs throughout the\n\n[[Page S13131]]\n\nyears. While many schools initiate Character Counts programs there are \nalso many other organizations that develop character based programming. \nI would like to take the time to recognize some of the successful \nprograms we have had in New Mexico for 2007.\n  Character Counts works in New Mexico because it is truly a community \npartnership. There was a brilliant example last week during the \nAlbuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. The Balloon Fiesta staff \nhosted 60 selected school kids for 2 days of festive activities. \nNorthrop Grumman provided tethered balloon rides. Meals on Wheels fed \nthe young people lunch, and the Albuquerque Balloon Museum gave some of \nthe students a tour of the exhibits to show them the history of hot air \nballoons. These were fun days, but the children certainly learned about \ncivic responsibility with some of our state's top business and \ncommunity leaders. A once in a lifetime experience for many of these \nkids, and exposure to adults demonstrating respect, responsibility, \ntrustworthiness, fairness, citizenship, and caring; the ``Six Pillars \nof Character.''\n  During the week of October 21, I hope everyone takes the time to \nparticipate in a Character Counts event in their local area. I know in \nNew Mexico we will be having some special celebrations. On October 19 \nin Albuquerque, NM, there will be a Character is the Heart of New \nMexico Parade, put on by Duranes Elementary beginning at the Old Town \nPlaza and ending at the Albuquerque Museum. On October 25, Roswell will \ncelebrate 13 years of Character Counts with a Character Counts Super \nCelebration at Roswell High School. And on October 27, Gallup will \ncelebrate with a Character Counts Parade starting at Fourth and Coal \nand ending at Lincoln Elementary School. All of these organizations and \nschools as well as the many others not mentioned here, are to be \ncommended for their hard work in developing these programs and \nspreading the message that character truly does count.\n  I believe this program is making a difference in my home State and \nacross the country. I want to encourage more people to become involved \nwith the Character Counts program, but most of all I hope individuals \nwill take the time to reflect on what the ``Six Pillars of Character'' \nmean to them.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 351) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 351\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 21, 2007, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/18/senate-section/article/S13131-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13131-S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          20TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED STATES-MONGOLIA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I, along \nwith 29 cosponsors, are submitting a concurrent resolution with the \nHouse of Representatives designating October 18, 2007 as Lights On \nAfterschool Day. Lights on Afterschool brings students, parents, \neducators, lawmakers, and community and business leaders together to \ncelebrate afterschool programs. This year, more than 1 million \nAmericans are expected to attend about 7,500 events designed to raise \nawareness and support for these much needed programs. In addition, \nLights On Afterschool 2007 marks the 10th anniversary of 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers, the primary Federal initiative supporting \nafterschool programs.\n  Approximately 90 percent of parents say that having a safe, positive \nplace where their child can go after school will improve their child's \nwell-being. However, 14 million school-age children--or 25 percent of \nall school-age children--are left unsupervised after school and miss \nthe opportunity to attend a safe, positive place that supports their \ngrowth and well-being.\n  Quality afterschool programs benefit youth, families, and \ncommunities. Students enrolled in afterschool programs are more likely \nto be engaged and go farther in education. They are also more likely to \navoid risky behavior and criminal activity. Afterschool programs help \nparents successfully balance their work and home-life. In addition, \nthese programs promote adult involvement with youth, which helps to \ncreate more cohesive communities invested in the future of our \nchildren.\n  In our work on the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I \nhave been working for more than three years to impress upon our \ncolleagues the importance of afterschool and are proud to say that 35 \nof our colleagues have joined the Caucus. We hope that they, along with \nother Members of the Congress, will join us on October 18 to celebrate \nthe importance of afterschool programs in their communities back \nhome.\n\n[[Page S13133]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of S. 2206, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2206) to provide technical corrections to Public \n     Law 109-116 (2 U.S.C. 2131a note) to extend the time period \n     for the Joint Committee on the Library to enter into an \n     agreement to obtain a statue of Rosa Parks, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Rosa Parks has been described as the \n``Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement.''\n  Her actions on a Montgomery bus in 1955 sparked one of the Nation's \nlargest movements against racial segregation: the Montgomery Bus \nBoycott.\n  Due to those brave actions, Rosa Parks became an icon of civil \ndisobedience.\n  In 2005, Congress voted to preserve the legacy of Rosa Parks by \nauthorizing a statue of her to be placed in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary \nHall.\n  A statue of Rosa Parks would be a fitting tribute to the struggle for \nequal rights for all Americans.\n  But two years later, the statue has not been obtained. It is time to \nremove the hurdles, and ensure that Rosa Parks is honored as Congress \nintended.\n  The law designated Congress's Joint Committee on the Library to \nobtain the statue. But it was later determined that the Joint Committee \ndoes not have the technical ability or resources to enter into \ncontracts or pay for the statue.\n  And now that law is set to expire on December 1, 2007, without ever \nachieving its intended goal.\n  So, to correct the problems in the original law, I have introduced a \nstand alone bill that would: designate the Architect of the Capitol as \nthe agent of the Joint Committee; and extend the deadline by 2 more \nyears.\n  This legislation would allow for the Architect of the Capitol to \ndistribute funds on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Library.\n  This legislation has been cosponsored by seven other Senators, \nincluding: Senators Bennett, Kerry, Durbin, Levin, Schumer, Dodd, and \nStabenow. \n  It is so important that we honor this great American.\n  Mrs. Parks' actions on a single day in December 1955 changed the \nlives of so many who followed her.\n  Let me tell you a little more about Rosa Parks:\n  Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913, in \nTuskegee, AL. Her parents were a carpenter and a teacher.\n  Rosa Parks grew up and lived in a segregated South. And when she \nmarried, she and her husband became active in the local NAACP chapter.\n  On December 1, 1955, after a day of work at a department store in \ndowntown Montgomery, AL, Rosa Parks boarded a bus to go home. She paid \nher fare, and took an empty seat in the first row of seats reserved for \nBlacks.\n  As the bus traveled along its route, all of the White-only seats in \nthe bus filled up. When the bus reached its next stop, several White \npassengers boarded.\n  As was standard practice at that time, the busdriver told the Black \npassengers seated in the rows behind the White-only section to move. \nThis included Mrs. Parks and three other passengers.\n  The three other Black passengers moved at the bus driver's \ninsistence. But Mrs. Parks did not.\n  As she recalled in her autobiography, she was simply ``tired of \ngiving in'':\n\n       People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I \n     was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, \n     or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working \n     day.\n       I was not old, although some people have an image of me as \n     being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, \n     was tired of giving in.\n\n  This action of civil disobedience sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, \nwhich became one of the Nation's largest movements against racial \nsegregation.\n  Rosa Parks was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in \n1996. She received a Congressional Gold Medal in 1999. And in 2005, \nCongress voted to honor her with a statue in the U.S. Capitol. The \nArchitect of the Capitol is prepared to work with the National \nEndowment for the Arts to find suitable artists and statues to be \nconsidered for this honor. But until the funds for this project can be \nallocated, the search for a statue will not move forward. The \nlegislation introduced today would fix this problem and allow the funds \nto be released. But more importantly, this legislation would ensure \nthat Rosa Parks an American hero is honored as she so deserves.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (S. 2206) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S13134]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1284, and the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1284) to increase, effective as of December 1, \n     2007, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and \n     indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled \n     veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am speaking in support of Senate passage of S. \n423, the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of \n2007.'' This measure, which I introduced earlier this year and which \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs reported on July 24, would direct \nthe Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to increase, effective December 1, \n2007, the rates of veterans' compensation to keep pace with the rising \ncost-of-living in this country. The rate adjustment is equal to that \nprovided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients and is based \non the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.\n  Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living \nadjustment,''COLA,'' for veterans' compensation in order to ensure that \ninflation does not erode the purchasing power of the veterans and their \nfamilies who depend upon this income to meet their needs. This past \nyear Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Public Law \n109-361, which resulted in a COLA increase of 3.3 percent for 2007. The \ncost-of-living adjustment for 2008 will be 2.3 percent.\n  As I have stated many times, it is important that we view veterans \ncompensation, including the annual COLA, and all benefits earned by \nveterans, as a continuing cost of war. Unfortunately, it seems highly \nlikely that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue \nand this in turn will result in injuries and disabilities that will \nyield an increase in claims for compensation. One million, six hundred \nthousand servicemembers have deployed in support of Operations Enduring \nand Iraqi Freedom, and studies by VA indicate that the most significant \npredictor of new claims activity is the size of the active force.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. Many of the more than 3 million recipients of \nthose benefits depend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide \nfor their own basic needs, but those of their spouses, children and \nparents as well. Without an annual COLA increase, these veterans and \ntheir families would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly \ndwindle, and we, as a Congress, would be in abandonment of our duty to \nensure that those who sacrificed so much for this country receive the \nbenefits and services to which they are entitled.\n  Disbursement of disability compensation to our nation's veterans \nconstitutes a core responsibility of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. It is a necessary measure of gratitude afforded to those \nveterans whose lives were irrevocably altered by their service to this \ncountry.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support passage of this COLA \nincrease.
