Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Today we will be on H.R. 2669, the education reconciliation measure. \nThere are 10 hours of time remaining for that matter. Two amendments \nwere offered yesterday, one by Senator Murkowski, another one by \nSenator Kennedy. We will vote on those amendments at around 12 o'clock \ntoday.\n  For this bill, we have two of the most competent managers we could \nhave, Senators Kennedy and Enzi. It is a great picture for the country: \none Senator from the State of Massachusetts, who certainly is known \nworldwide, and Senator Enzi, who may not be known worldwide, but the \nSenator from Wyoming is one of the most gentle, competent people I have \never worked with. He is a wonderful man. I know the relationship he and \nSenator Kennedy have developed will make it possible to get through \nthis with a minimum amount of strife. I admire both of those men and \nhow they have worked on this bill.\n  The managers expect other amendments to be offered. As Members are \naware, once all time is expired, Members can still offer germane \namendments with no debate time and have them voted on. I am hopeful \nthere will not be a vote-arama at the end of the time and Members who \nhave amendments will work with the managers to get those amendments \nconsidered during the time limit.\n  There is no reason we cannot complete this bill by sometime this \nafternoon.\n  On the Homeland Security appropriations bill, it is hard to \ncomprehend, but I had to file cloture on that bill, a bill to fund \nhomeland security for our country. There was an objection to our moving \nto that bill. I hope an agreement is reached where we would not have to \nvote on cloture tomorrow, which is set. I hope we can complete action \non this bill early next week.\n  SCHIP. I heard on the radio this morning--I had not read the \nPresident's letter to the Finance Committee members that he was going \nto veto the bill. The statement of policy on vetoing bills, it seems \nthey all fit the same pattern. Anytime it helps people who are \nincapable of helping themselves, then the President is anxious to step \nin.\n  I heard on the radio today he wanted to veto this legislation because \nhe felt it should be all handled by the private sector. We would not \nneed this legislation if things were handled by the private sector. We \nhave millions of children in America--not in some other country--\nmillions of children in America who have no health care. That is what \nSCHIP is about.\n  So I appreciate the work being done on a bipartisan basis by Senators \nGrassley and Baucus and Hatch and Rockefeller, the senior members of \nthat committee and respective subcommittee. They have come up with a \nbipartisan bill. It is not a bill that everyone is elated about, but it \nis a good bill that will help provide health insurance for as many as 6 \nmillion children. It is too bad that I assume we are going\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\nto have to file cloture on that. But we are going to work on SCHIP next \nweek. I would hope we could finish Homeland Security, and maybe even \nmove to another appropriations bill. The Finance Committee is meeting \nthis morning to report out a bipartisan bill that we can take to the \nfloor dealing with health care for millions of American children.\n  Conference reports. The 9/11 conference report is moving along well. \nThe conferees are meeting today. They hope to move this conference \nquickly so we can finish it next week.\n  For the ethics conference, we still do not have the appointment of \nconferees. I am trying to figure out some other way to complete that; \notherwise, we will have the necessary cloture votes to get that to \nfinality. It is a shame it is being held up. It was the No. 1 bill we \ntook up this year. Why? Because it was the No. 1 problem people \nidentified when Congress was elected last November. The culture of \ncorruption was so rampant, that was one of the things people focused \non.\n  While it may not be the No. 1 issue today because of Iraq stepping \nahead of it, it is still an extremely important issue, and I think it \nis a shame we have not been able to go to conference on this measure \nbecause of objections from the Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9534-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9534-S9574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2669, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2669) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 601 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kennedy amendment No. 2327, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 2329 (to amendment No. 2327), to \n     increase the amount appropriated for the college access \n     partnership grant program.\n       Kennedy amendment No. 2330 (to amendment No. 2327), to \n     amend the amounts appropriated for Promise grants for fiscal \n     year 2014 through 2017.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  We continue the debate and discussion on the legislation that has \nbeen reported out of our Education Committee, which has strong \nbipartisan support. This legislation is being considered under a time \nlimit, but certainly there is sufficient time to debate any of the \nkinds of issues or questions dealing with education this morning. We \nwill have the two votes, as the leader has pointed out, at noontime. \nSenator Enzi and I are both here ready to discuss, debate, and work \nwith any of our colleagues on this legislation. But we are very strong \nbelievers in this legislation.\n  This is the largest assistance to middle-income and working families \nthat we have had since the end of World War II and the GI Bill. This is \nvery substantial help and assistance. I think all of us, when we go \nhome to our States, hear from families who talk about the increased \ncost of school, the increased cost of tuition, and the increased cost \nand burden associated with going to college.\n  We are also very much aware of the necessity of providing additional \neducational opportunities that are so essential for families, so \nessential for communities, so essential for States, countries, and the \nUnited States in a world economy.\n  Education is the equivalent, effectively, of hope and opportunity for \nthe young people of this country. We are making a strong downpayment to \nhelp and assist the sons and daughters of working families.\n  My State of Massachusetts is blessed with many fine schools and \ncolleges. About 80 percent of all those who go on to college get some \nkind of help and assistance over the course of their time they are in \ncollege, whether they go to one of our community colleges, one of our \nfine public colleges, or one of our fine private colleges.\n  So when we say we are providing help and assistance, through \nscholarships or through Pell grants, we are making a difference in the \nopportunities for our fellow citizens.\n  Our future depends on education. The future of our economy depends \nupon having educational opportunities. We are building on excellent \nlegislation that was completed in the Congress earlier this year.\n  The COMPETE Act came through our committee, with the great leadership \nof Senator Bingaman and Senator Alexander. Our bipartisan effort gave \nadditional focus and attention to enhancing the opportunities for young \nstudents to study math, science, engineering, and other areas that are \nparticular needs for our country in the future.\n  This legislation builds upon that legislation in a very important way \nin terms of opportunity. That is what we wish to talk about briefly \nagain this morning. By enhancing educational opportunities, we are \ngoing to strengthen our economy, we are going to be more effective in \ndealing with globalization, we are going to be more effective in terms \nof our national security because we are going to have better trained, \nbetter equipped personnel and better technology for those who serve in \nour military forces.\n  We also will equip the next generation with the ability to ensure \nthat our democratic institutions at the local, State, and Federal \nlevels work more effectively.\n  So education is the key. We are proud of this legislation and the \ndifference it will make.\n  This legislation will provide a historic increase in the need-based \ngrant aid. That is the enhanced help and assistance in the Pell \nprogram.\n  We will have better repayment options that cap a borrower's monthly \npayment at 15 percent of their discretionary income. That means all \nthose who are going to be out there working are never going to pay more \nthan 15 percent of their discretionary income on their student loans. \nThat is particularly important in terms of what we call the public-\nsector jobs, where there is an enormous need in this country--enormous \nneed. Our society needs more teachers, more emergency management and \nlaw enforcement professionals, more public health doctors and nurses, \nmore social workers, more librarians, more public interest lawyers, and \nmore early childhood teachers.\n  This bill also offers loan forgiveness program for borrowers in \npublic service jobs: After they work as a schoolteacher for 10 years, \npaying no more than 15 percent of their discretionary income during \nthat time, all their debt--all their debt--will be forgiven.\n  These are the key elements of this legislation. We want to show what \nhow we have tried to ensure that educational opportunity will be \navailable to all of our fellow citizens here in America--including \nmiddle income and particularly the low income families. We know from \nexperience the challenges that are out there.\n\n  This chart gives an idea about the increases in tuition at public and \nprivate colleges. There have been enormous increases in tuition. We \nhave tried to address that with our increase in Pell grant funds.\n  I want to take a few moments this morning, though, to talk about the \nfocus we have given to the Pell program. Over 5 million Americans--5 \nmillion Americans--all across this country participate in the Pell \nprogram. With the commitment we had back in 1965 when we passed the \nHigher Education Act, we wanted to make education available to all \nAmericans--all Americans and we understood that those who had \nparticular financial needs were from working families. We developed \nthis under the leadership of Senator Pell of Rhode Island, our leader \nand then-chairman of the Education Committee. His name will be \nassociated with this program for as long as it exists, along with other \nvery worthwhile programs, including the National Endowment for the \nHumanities programs, the National Endowment for the Arts, and others.\n  This chart shows the help and assistance in the Pell area. The \nprogram targets families who are generally making $50,000 or less. \nIndividuals with moderate income still can gain some benefit, but they \nare not the target.\n  Let's look at this chart here. What does it show us? It shows that \ntoo few low-income students are prepared to attend college. This shows \nlow income, moderate income, middle income, and high income. You see \nthat those who are completing high school in the higher numbers, they \nare dependent on income. You see the higher income students are \nprepared to attend college,\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\nand 47 percent of the lower income students are projected to be \ncollege-qualified high school students in 2004. I know these statistics \nare from 2000 and 2004, but we know the result is still the same. These \nare the figures as a result of publications last year. This shows we \ncan have well-qualified, low-income students, but only 47 percent of \nthem are going to be college qualified, to be able to go on to college.\n  Once these students graduate from high school, we see what happens. \nOnly 20 percent of them are going to be able to earn a bachelor's \ndegree. Why is it 20 percent? The reason it is 20 percent is because \nof, by and large, the financial burden. So we have the lower income, \nmoderate income, middle income, and high income. If we are going to be \none country with one history and one destiny, one Nation, we have to \nhave at least the opportunity in the areas of education; which is so \nbasic. I think we need it in health care and other areas of public \npolicy as well, but education is key. If we are starting off with a \nmodel where income largely determines who will be able to get the \neducation and who will not, we have a divided Nation. If we say we want \nto give equal opportunity to the citizens of this Nation, we cannot \nhave this kind of disparity.\n  What have we done now with the proposal? We have said, for those \nindividuals who would be eligible, as I mentioned on those first two \ncharts, we have increased the Pell grant. This will directly help those \nindividuals who are going to be unable to complete their education \nbecause of the funding levels. The Higher Education Access Act will \nbuild on what we started by increasing the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 \nnext year--a $790 increase--and to $5,400 in 2011. We know that Pell \ngrants have opened the door of opportunity for countless young students \nover the years. It is imperative for Federal and State legislatures to \ncontinue offering financial aid programs to colleges and universities \nacross the county in order to even the playing field for the \nunderserved and disadvantaged. It is an important targeting of \nresources to those children who are the neediest and need the greatest \nhelp, but also individuals who have competency and are able to gain \nadmission to these schools and colleges. They have ability, but they \ndon't have the financial ability. This is targeted to try and help and \nassist them.\n  Now, what else are we doing for those individuals? We are going to \nhave the loan forgiveness provisions. How does that work? You have an \nindividual, for example, who has gotten into the grant program and then \nthey borrow some money to complete their education. That individual \nwants to go on and be a schoolteacher. The annual salary in my State of \nMassachusetts for a teacher is $35,241. The average loan debt is \n$18,169. That is about the national average, and it has doubled in the \nlast decade.\n  So we say we are targeting these resources. Of the $18 billion we \nhave taken from the lenders, we have close to $1 billion, that will go \nfor deficit reduction, and we have taken the other $17 billion, a major \nportion of which will be used to help and assist those students who are \nindividuals of ability, but who lack the financial help and assistance \nto go on to fine schools and colleges. We are giving them the bulk of \nthe resources to help and assist them to go to the schools and the \ncolleges.\n  Then we say--when they graduate, they are going to have a rather \nsizable debt. These individuals want to give something back to the \ncommunity, and we find out they want to be a schoolteacher. So if they \nare $18,000 in debt, how are they going to be able to pay that off?\n  We say they are going to be starting in what is a public sector area. \nThis is a schoolteacher in this case. They are $18,000 in debt. When we \nput the cap on the amounts they are going to have to repay of their \ndebt, it is going to save them $732 a year from what they would \notherwise have paid--$732 a year--if they go into public service. That \nis the amount, because of the 15-percent cap that we put on their \nannual salary. That is a big chunk of change; $732 is a big chunk of \nchange for students just out of college.\n\n  Then we say if they did this for 10 years, if they teach for 10 \nyears, then we forgive the remainder of their debt, which is over \n$8,000. That debt will be forgiven. We reduce their annual yearly \npayment by $700 and forgive their debt by $8,000. These are individuals \nwho are going into a profession where there is an enormous need. We \nneed to have tens of thousands of teachers within the next decade.\n  Now this is the chart for a teacher. I can give an example of another \npublic service provider, and I will do that in a minute or two. But \nthis is illustrative of what this legislation does. It is heavy in \nterms of the targeting, in terms of the Pell programs, and in terms of \nthe loan forgiveness. We also have the provisions, as was brought out \nduring the debate and the discussion, to permit these younger people to \nearn more when they are in various work-study programs, or working even \nas they are going to the universities. It used to be if they earned too \nmuch, they would lose their need-based aid because they no longer \nqualified. We give greater flexibility, which will encourage younger \npeople to earn something in addition, that will maybe help them buy \nmore books or help them buy computers. We increase the eligibility for \nauto-zero from $20,000 to $30,000. It doesn't sound like a great deal, \nbut there will be further opportunities for those who are in working \nfamilies to be able to participate in this Pell program.\n  I use this example of a student who will be a public defender. I will \nput up the list of all of the examples. I am using the example a \nteacher, but the bill forgives the direct loan graduates of their debt \nwho work for 10 years in any form of public service, including \nemergency management, public safety, public law enforcement and \ngovernment, education, early education, and childcare. The need we have \nnow is for teachers. This bill incentivizes people to pursue jobs in \nearly childhood education, among others. That is a key element. If you \nread the great book ``From Neurons To Neighborhoods'' by Jack Shonkoff \nfrom my State of Massachusetts, it brings together all of the National \nAcademy of Sciences evaluations for the support of children in the \nearliest months of their lives, let alone the earliest years, and how \nthat helps stimulate the synapses in the child's brain, helps develop \nthe sense of confidence, the sense of inquisitiveness, the sense of \ncapacity for learning, for early childhood education. We have expanded \nthose opportunities in another piece of legislation Senator Enzi and I \nworked on; the reauthorization of the Head Start Program.\n  The work of public servants is so important. We have public \neducation, early childhood education, childcare, and all the public \nservices working with the disabled and the elderly. We know the \nincreasing requirements so many of our parents have, in terms of being \nable to live independently and to live with dignity. So this bill will \nencourage those who want to work with the disabled and the elderly, or \nin public interest legal services as prosecutors of the public defense. \nWe want our judicial system to work and to work fairly for people, to \ngive them the kinds of protections but also give them the kinds of \ndefense. Public school libraries, library sciences, and other public \nschool-based service providers. Also, teaching full time at tribal \ncolleges or universities.\n  We find, as I am sure other Members do, when you go to the fine \nschools and colleges across this country--I find it in my State of \nMassachusetts--the amount of volunteerism that is out there among the \nyoung people. Many of them go, in my State, into the City Year program, \none of the great programs of volunteerism we have had. The program has \nspread in this country and around the world in many respects. They go \ninto public service programs to help and assist and volunteer at the \nschools and colleges in the communities. We have a wonderful small \ncollege, Stonehill College, and one of their defining aspects as a \ncollege is to help young people start nonprofit agencies. They give \nthem help and assistance in how to start nonprofit groups. They, for \nexample, started eight nonprofit groups to try and relieve the problems \nof hunger in southeastern Massachusetts.\n  Young people want to get involved. Young people want to make a \ndifference in people's lives. Young people\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\nwant to provide service. This legislation will do more to give them the \nopportunity when we have areas of critical need than anything we have \ndone in recent times. This is an area that says, look: You want to work \nand work in the public--you want to give something back to your \ncommunity, local community, or State, if you want to do that, we are \ngoing to give you help and assistance. We are going to recognize it, \nand we are going to make it manageable for you to do it. We have the \nconstant illustrations, particularly in medical schools, where the \ngreat majority of young medical students in their first year want to \nbecome general practitioners--the overwhelming majority. Then by the \nsecond year or the third year, that group is down to a handful. Why? \nPrimarily because of student debt. They know when they get out of \nmedical school, they too often are making decisions about their areas \nof specialty based on the profession that is going to permit them to \npay off that student debt, rather than be able to go into a \nneighborhood health center and to provide help to those who need it.\n  So we have made this as wide as we could in terms of trying to \nrespond to that sense that is out there in our schools and colleges, in \nall parts of our country, urban areas and rural areas, to say: Look, if \nyou want to give something back, we are going to make it possible. We \nare going to give you a greater opportunity for you to go to college, \nparticularly if you are from working families and low-income. We are \ngoing to give you a better opportunity to do that. With the amendment \nof our friend from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, it is going to help and \nassist States to take many of the younger people who need help and try \nto give them focus and get them on the pathway to school and colleges. \nWe are going to give that encouragement and help the States.\n  Many States have established these kinds of nonprofit agencies that \ndo a superb job. We have some in my own State of Massachusetts. They do \na breathtaking job in encouraging people to do it. And then we have, in \nour authorization, the extraordinary work of Senators Enzi and Jack \nReed to simplify the student loan application and permit people who \ndon't have a lot of student advisers and extra help to be able to use a \nmore simplified form so they can understand what it is to be able to \nbegin to make the application for school and college. We give greater \nassistance there.\n  This is all part of the efforts we have been making in our committee \nin terms of early education. We are going to make the changes to No \nChild Left Behind, and we are going to try to tie in kindergarten \nprograms. We are going to have a seamless web so that will work more \neffectively, and those who go to college are going to be able to have \nmet the initial college requirements. We want to try to do that more \neffectively. All that for another time. But in this legislation, we \nhave gone in this direction.\n  Mr. President, this is just a brief survey of what I think are the \ncompelling aspects. We decided initially that on higher education, we \nhad to bring in lenders. We were not sure, going back over the years, \nhow much incentives we could provide to the lenders to make sure the \nsystem would work. We found out they have made it work, and there are \nsufficient resources that we are going to continue to give to these \nlenders to make them profitable. But we can take the resources we have \nhere and target those resources to the students who need it the most. \nWe believe very deeply that educational opportunity is key to \nindividuals' future and our country's future.\n  If we are going to be one country, as I think all of us believe we \nshould be, we do not want to have the kinds of divisions that are \nincreasingly putting pressure on the young people of this country at \nthe present time. This legislation is doing a very important job in \ntrying to address that situation and, again, I thank all of our \ncolleagues because we have been able to, as Senator Enzi realizes, on \nthe committee, in the areas of education, we have been able to rise \nabove the issues of partisanship. We have had wonderful chairmen, \nincluding Senator Stafford from Vermont, and we had Senator Pell from \nRhode Island, and we had our colleague, Senator Gregg, and Senator Enzi \nhas been chairman of those committees. We have areas where we have our \ndifferences, although I must say I think on our committee we try to \nfind common ground in areas of difference.\n  In the area of education, which is so important across the board, we \nhave worked very closely together. I think this legislation represents \na splendid opportunity to make a real difference for families in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis outstanding job of explaining a number of the provisions that are \nin the bill before us today. This is the reconciliation bill, which has \nto deal with savings in the budget. We are hoping that anybody who has \namendments to it will bring them down. It is a privileged motion, which \nmeans there will be a maximum of 20 hours of debate on it. We don't \nhave to do the full 20 hours if there are not 20 hours' worth of \namendments. So I hope people will bring the amendments down and get \nthem debated and voted on. There is an essential piece that is not \nincluded in reconciliation because it doesn't deal with savings in the \nmandatory programs. It is actually most of higher education. We need to \nget to that part too. It should be done in conjunction with the \nreconciliation bill. For parliamentary reasons, it is difficult for \nthat to happen. We were not able to get to it in the last 2 years. We \nneed to get to it now.\n  We talk about deficit reduction. This is not the first time we have \ndone deficit reduction. During the last 2 years, we did a major deficit \nreduction. We took away subsidies from the lenders and put some of that \ninto deficit reduction, and a good chunk of it went into help for \nstudents. I don't know whether we ought to use the term ``deficit \nreduction,'' though. For the most part, what we are doing is spending \nmoney, and we are spending money we don't have. So that is why the \ndeficit reduction piece was put in as a piece of legislation, to allow \nus to actually grapple with trying to save the Federal Government \nmoney.\n  Of course, when it gets into the area of students, it is hard for us \nto have any constraint, particularly if it appears we are taking it \naway from students. We are adding to what the students get, just as we \ndid in the last 2 years when we did deficit reduction. We gave parts to \ndeficit reduction from the lenders, which decreased the amount of money \nwe were spending that we didn't have, and we continued to increase some \nof the programs for students.\n\n  That is what we are doing again here, but we are not doing much \ndeficit reduction. There are people who are very concerned about that. \nWe are making a substantial reduction again in lender subsidies. At \nsome point--we don't know what that point is--lender subsidies will get \nto the point where lenders will not be interested in working with \nstudents because it takes employees to do that, it takes facilities to \ndo that, and there is even risk in doing that. All of those have a \ncost. When the cost exceeds what they are able to take in, they will no \nlonger be interested in it, and without the thousands of people in this \nNation who are servicing these loans, as well as informing people how \nto get them and helping them to get them, there will be a lot of \nstudents who will not be able to get the help they need to have.\n  So we need to be very careful in doing these things. One of the areas \nwe have taken great care has been in instituting a pilot project, and \nthat pilot project is to do, on a portion of the loans we have, set up \nan auction--to have people actually bid to see what the real dollar \nnumber is they would be willing to give up in the way of subsidies in \norder to have the business at those universities. That will give us a \nbetter indication of where the subsidy should be, and I am glad we are \ndoing it in a pilot project way. When you move out into the area of \ndoing something totally different than you did before, it is good to \nstart fairly small, with maybe 10 percent of the loans, so if it isn't \nquite right, it will not destroy the whole college program. Also, it \nwill give us an indication not only of the process we ought to be using \nto make it as fair as possible and make sure students are taken care of \nas well\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\nas possible, but it will also give us an indication of things that \nought to be done differently.\n  So I am pleased that we are able to start on a small basis like that \ninstead of a big basis because one of the things that happens when you \ndo a change is that there is an estimate of how much revenue will be \nsaved. There isn't anything really to base that estimate on, but there \nis an estimate of how much will be saved. What we are doing with this \nbill is we are spending the estimates of what could be saved. We are \nnot spending what actually will be saved but the estimates of what will \nbe saved. As everybody knows, estimates don't always come out the same \nin reality. Sometimes they come out bigger and sometimes less. \nUnfortunately, with the Federal Government, when we are talking about \nthe amount of revenues that will be coming in, we are usually \noverestimating that, and on the spending side we are underestimating, \nwhich means we are spending more than we are taking in and compounding \nit.\n  In all of these programs, we have the sense of wanting to do generous \nthings, but we also have a responsibility for making sure we can pay \nfor our generosity. Our goal, of course, is to have as many students as \npossible have access to college. Money is one of the problems, but \nthere are other problems too.\n  I wish to speak about the importance of the legislation that is under \nconsideration, but I wish to reiterate the importance of taking up the \nHigher Education Act reauthorization and, hopefully, doing that right \nafter this reconciliation bill. That is why I encourage people to bring \namendments down, so maybe we can yield back some time. There may be \ntime today to cover the other part, which is a bigger part than \nreconciliation, and it is more important.\n  The reconciliation bill provides for additional need-based grant aid, \nand that is a critical component of increasing access and \naffordability. Additionally, by increasing the income-protection \nallowance, we have increased the ability of working students to receive \nPell grants. That change is particularly important and one I have been \nsensitive to. I worked during junior high and high school so that I \ncould afford to go to college, and that all counted against me when I \ntried to apply for any kind of aid. I wasn't eligible for it.\n  My daughter ran into a similar situation. We made sure all of our \nkids worked toward their education. She had saved some money, and we \nalways gave them a little incentive: we would match anything they came \nup with, whether it was scholarships or money they earned and saved. So \nthe first time she applied for any kind of assistance, scholarships, or \nanything need-based, they said: You know, you have this money in \nsavings, you should have spent that on a car. A car doesn't count. So \nwhat are we teaching our kids? Don't save for college, spend your \nmoney. That is not right.\n  We have tried to set it up so that working students have a great \nability to receive Pell grants. This change is particularly important \nas the student population in our colleges become more and more \nnontraditional. However, it is not only important to ensure that more \nstudents enroll in college prepared to learn but that more students \nhave the support they need to complete college with the knowledge and \nskills necessary to be successful. America's ability to compete in the \nglobal economy depends on increasing the number of students entering \nand completing college.\n  Of the 75 percent of high school seniors who continue their studies, \nonly 50 percent receive a degree in 5 years, and that is within 5 years \nof enrolling in college. Only 25 percent of them receive a bachelor's \ndegree or higher.\n  These numbers are even worse for students from low-income families. \nAmong eighth graders in 1988, only 16 percent of them from low-income \nfamilies attained a bachelor's degree by the year 2000. The fact is \nthat over four times as many eighth graders from high-income families \nattain bachelor's degrees as their peers from low-income families. Pell \ngrants are aimed at providing low- and middle-income undergraduate \nstudents with resources needed to enroll in college and persist through \ngraduation.\n  America's competitiveness depends not only on the investment in \nscientific research and technology but the investment in human capital; \nthat is, our students.\n  Two years ago, Congress invested the savings it achieved through \nreconciliation in students by providing $9 billion in new spending for \nstudent benefits, including $4 billion in additional need-based grant \naid through Academic Competitiveness grants and SMART grants. This \ngrant aid is in addition to the basic Pell grant award for Pell-\neligible students.\n\n  For first- and second-year undergraduates, the Academic \nCompetitiveness grants are designed for Pell-eligible students who \ncomplete a rigorous high school curriculum. These grants are important \nbecause recent data shows that slightly less than one-third, 31 \npercent, of public high school students are prepared for postsecondary \neducation as demonstrated by the academic courses they pursued.\n  Let me repeat that. These grants are important because recent data \nshows that slightly less than one-third of all public high school \nstudents are prepared for postsecondary education, and that is \ndemonstrated by the academic courses they pursued.\n  It is also demonstrated by the number of remedial courses they have \nto take when they get to college. That is something we hope to fix in \nNo Child Left Behind, concentrating on the high school years so there \nisn't that wasted senior year of education and then there are the \ncourses they have to take in college just to get up to the entry level.\n  The Academic Competitiveness Grant Program not only provides \nadditional need-based grant aid to low- and moderate-income students, \nbut it encourages those students to take the rigorous high school \ncourses that will enable them to enter college, not needing remedial \neducation. Well-prepared and well-supported students are more likely to \npersist to degree completion, to succeed in obtaining needed knowledge \nand skills to compete in the 21st century global economy.\n  National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent grants, that \nis SMART grants, are designed for third and fourth year undergraduates \nmajoring in physical, life, or computer sciences, mathematics, \ntechnology, engineering, or a critical foreign language. These grants \nserve a dual purpose, and that is to provide needed grant aid and to \nencourage students to major in and enter a field where there is a \nnational need.\n  The reconciliation bill before us today provides for additional need-\nbased grant aid to students as well, through the creation of Promise \ngrants. The provisions of the bill move us in the right direction. Low-\nincome students who are striving to attend college will know there is \nfinancial aid available to them to access college or career and \ntechnical education.\n  What is missing from this debate? We have a pretty complete \nexplanation of what is in the bill, but consideration of the rest of \nthe Higher Education Act is essential. The bill before us today focuses \non a very narrow slice of the Higher Education Act, one piece which is \ndependent on the other foundational programs that are not part of \nreconciliation. We are only seeing a fraction of the higher education \npicture by debating this bill separately from the larger higher \neducation reauthorization package.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how essential it is to cover the whole \nhigher education package. By discussing only the reconciliation \nprovisions affecting higher education, we are leaving behind financial \naid application simplification. We have touted that a lot, and it needs \nto be simplified. Previously, in filling out an application for \nfinancial aid assistance, it was necessary to do both sides of this \nlong form, using these many instructions. Mr. President, does that look \nformidable to you? It looks pretty formidable to me. As a result, a lot \nof people who could qualify for financial assistance have not qualified \nfor financial assistance because they did not do the paperwork, and it \nis easy to understand why they did not do the paperwork. Who needs all \nthat?\n  One of the things we have done is to simplify that form so it is both \nsides of one page. It is much easier to answer. The reason we are able \nto simplify it is\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\nthat the questions that are asked on it are the ones that are essential \nto being able to determine whether the student needs financial aid or \nnot. So it is much more concise. This application gathers a lot of \ninformation. We couldn't find out who used the information. So if we \ndon't know who uses it, why gather it? We have simplified that \napplication which should increase the number of students who can fill \nit out. If we do not do the other higher education package, that will \nnot be done.\n  There are also student loan disclosure requirements and year-round \nPell grants in the reauthorization bill. Right now a student is limited \nto a school year rather than year-round. A lot of the technical schools \ngo year-round, which means there is a portion of the year they cannot \ncover with Pell grants.\n  There are additional supports for nontraditional students. That is \nvery important. As we are talking about a lifetime of employment, there \nare a lot of people training and retraining, and they are \nnontraditional students. They didn't just get out of high school. They \nare ready to go back and learn something additional. They are usually \nvery motivated people because they understand the importance of what \nthey don't have and what they desperately want.\n  Graduate and international education would be covered in the other \npackage; financial literacy and better borrower information; privacy \nprotection; also improvements to the Academic Competitiveness grants \nand SMART grants. We always want to be improving those grants and \nencouraging the sciences, technology, engineering, math, and medical \nfields.\n  There is also a college cost watch list, a little more information \nfor everybody; and quality teacher preparation programs. We need to be \nencouraging teachers. We are going to lose a lot of them shortly \nthrough retirement with the baby boomers, and they need to be replaced. \nThe basis of education is having quality teachers.\n\n  We are, once again, faced with the possibility of only dealing with \nthe mandatory spending programs and leaving comprehensive \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act undone. I wish we could \nhave combined the two. I guess we still could, but it is not going to \nhappen because reconciliation gets special consideration with a \nlimitation of 20 hours of debate.\n  We are cutting the bottom line if we do not deal with the quality and \nsubstance of the important programs I mentioned. We have to have the \nwhole package. The American success story of higher education is at \nrisk of losing the very qualities that make it great--competition, \ninnovation, and access for all.\n  Our goal should be to promote innovation and new technologies to keep \nthe cost of college down, to expand the availability of information to \nkeep students and parents in a position where they can make more \ninformed decisions, and improve financial literacy across the board so \nthat students have a better understanding of how they can manage their \nloans and monthly payments. Schools and colleges have to do more to \nincrease accountability and seek efficiencies that bring down the cost \nof postsecondary education. When we raise the Pell grant amounts, it \ndoesn't help the students if the cost of college goes up an equal \namount or greater.\n  The complexity of the Federal student aid system has to be tackled. \nRight now filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \nprevents many students, as I mentioned, from even considering college. \nThat was never our intent. It is time to make that less complicated \nthan filling out our tax forms, and for an accountant to say that is \nreally something.\n  Also, it is our responsibility to ensure that students and their \nfamilies have the information they need to make informed decisions \nabout the investment of time and money they are making to secure a \ncollege education. The cost of college has risen dramatically, and at \nthe same time the need for a college education is greater than it has \never been before.\n  America's students must have the tools they need to complete higher \neducation and to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to become \ncompetitive in the 21st century economy. This can be accomplished, but \nit will take both the reconciliation and reauthorization bills together \nto reach that goal.\n  I am again stating for the record that I hope the Senate Democratic \nleadership will provide us with an opportunity to have a full and open \ndebate on all aspects of the Higher Education Act. Both pieces are \nessential to ensuring students have access to a quality education. It \nis no longer an option whether to pursue college or skills \ncertification that is nationally recognized. Everyone needs to have all \nthe tools to understand and shape their future. They need these \noptions. It cannot happen with just the reconciliation part of the \npackage. The money without the capability doesn't do it.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Kennedy and colleagues on my \nside of the aisle so we do not let this opportunity pass by once again.\n  So far we have two amendments that have been submitted. I need to \ntalk a little bit about those two amendments.\n  One of them is the Murkowski amendment. We have this interesting \nprocess under reconciliation. It is supposed to be for deficit \nreduction, but any time there is deficit reduction, it leaves money \nhanging out there, and that money can be used in amendments in a number \nof different ways. It just works on our minds to know that there is \nmoney out there that could be spent. So we have a couple of amendments \nthat will use up the money.\n  There are a lot of people who would prefer we didn't use up the \nmoney, especially since we are talking about deficit reduction, which \nmeans we are spending more than what we have, so what we are spending \nis money we don't have. But we are going to take this estimate of \nexcess revenue that we are saving and spend it under both amendments.\n  The first amendment is a relatively small amount, $176 million over \nthe next 2 years. It does some very important things. Not-for-profit \nlenders, particularly small ones, might not be able to participate in \nthe auction pilots and, thus, they will lose funding. This will allow \nthem an opportunity to still be able to participate in the college \nmarket and conduct outreach and do all the important things those \nnonprofits are already doing for students, that they lose out on the \nauction. When we are talking about money around here, $176 million is a \nmicro-dot in the budget.\n  The other amendment is the Promise Grant Program. It is to spend the \noutlying money. There is some money that comes in further down the \nroad. It is actually pretty big money, $5.7 billion, and this spends a \ngood portion of it.\n  So the decision people will have to make is actually whether they \nwant to save any money or whether they want to take some of the money \nwe don't have and put it into some new programs.\n  I wanted everybody to know what the situation is. From an accounting \nstandpoint, I feel compelled to point that out.\n  We do have an important bill before us. I hope we can make it through \nthat bill today. I know we can because the rules require us to do that. \nIf we can finish it a little earlier, perhaps we can get to that second \npackage, the one that has good stuff in it, the one that has to be done \nin order to have a complete package.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the name of the bill before us today is \nthe College Cost Reduction Act, as it has been called. But just as \nappropriately it might be called ``Restoring the American Dream Act'' \nbecause that is exactly what is at stake with this critically important \nbill.\n  We all know that higher education is the key to success in today's \nglobal economy. It is the key to Americans' success as individuals, but \nit is also the key to America's success as a nation. But over the last \n6 years, the cost of college has skyrocketed 40 percent. Meanwhile, the \nbuying power of Federal grant aid has fallen, and too many young \nstudents are being forced to turn to private loans with high interest \nrates.\n  As a result, college has become a distant, unattainable dream for \nmany Americans. For millions more who are\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\nfortunate to attend college, they graduate with two things: a college \ndiploma and a mountain of debt.\n  With the bill before us today, we intend to reverse these negative \ntrends. We intend to put a college education and a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream back within the reach of every American, including those \nof modest means. We might think of this bill as restoring the ladder of \nopportunity for millions of Americans.\n  This is a bipartisan bill with support on both sides of the aisle. I \nthank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their bipartisan leadership \nin getting this bill through committee and getting it to the Senate \nfloor. At the same time, I take pride in the fact that college access \nfor all was one of the six priorities we annunciated last fall.\n\n  The crisis in college affordability has grown worse year after year. \nYear after year, Congress failed to act. Last year, we Democrats said \nto the American people: You give us the leadership reins and we will \nchart a new course. We, today, are making good on that promise.\n  The bill before us will accomplish a number of things. Most \nimportantly, it will increase the maximum Pell grant, and it will \nincrease the income level at which students automatically benefit for \nthe maximum Pell grant. It will encourage public service by providing \nsome loan forgiveness for graduates who go into fields such as \nteaching, social work, nursing, and service as legal aid lawyers. The \nbill will give protection to borrowers by capping the monthly payments \nat 15 percent of discretionary income.\n  This bill is a classic win-win-win. It is a win for the Government \nand for students and for taxpayers. For years, we have been concerned \nabout the widespread abuses and excesses within the private student \nloan industry. What this bill does is cut excess subsidies to the \nprivate loan program by $18 billion and channel most of those savings \ninto Pell grants.\n  Earlier this year, in the fiscal year 2007 joint funding resolution, \nwe were able to increase the maximum Pell grant by $260 to a total of \n$4,310. That was the first increase in Pell grants in 5 years, since \nthe last time Democrats had the majority and I chaired the \nAppropriations Subcommittee for Education and Health Programs in 2001.\n  Now, with the bill before us today, we are pleased to build on that \nprogress by joining with Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi to boost the \nmaximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year and $5,400 by 2011.\n  I also wish to salute Senator Kennedy for crafting this Senate bill \nin a way that is a big improvement over the House bill. The House bill \ncuts interest rates on all student loans. Well, that is very expensive, \nand it also provides benefits to many who don't need them, such as \nupper-income families. The Senate bill concentrates the savings on \nincreasing grant aid to low-income students, while providing some loan \nforgiveness for graduates who enter teaching, nursing, and other \nimportant but relatively low-paying jobs.\n  Bear in mind that before the increase earlier this year, the value of \nthe Pell grants had been drastically eroded since 2001. I wonder if \nthere are any colleges in America that charge the same amount for \ntuition as they did 6 years ago. I don't think so. In fact, high school \nguidance counselors tell me that, for the first time, they are seeing \nkids giving up their dream of college because they simply can't afford \nit, even with loans and grants.\n  I recently received a letter from a constituent from Indianola, IA, \ncounty seat of my home county. She told me about her daughter who \ngraduated from college last year. Let me quote from this mother's \nletter.\n\n       We faithfully saved for our daughter's education every \n     month from the time I knew I was pregnant, even during a six-\n     month period when my husband was unemployed. Since Rhiannon \n     needed to attend a specialized college, our savings for her \n     were not nearly high enough. Last year, Rhiannon's monthly \n     loan payment suddenly increased to around $700 a month. How \n     many families can afford to do this? How is this generation \n     of young adults ever to afford the American Dream to own a \n     home? This is not good for the future of our economy, for how \n     will these young people be able to have purchasing power or \n     be able to afford marriage and children? College educations \n     must remain a choice for all of our youth in order for our \n     Nation to compete in this global economy.\n\n  This is not an exceptional case. We have all heard similar stories \nand received similar letters. Today, with the College Cost Reduction \nAct, we have an opportunity to address the crisis in college \naffordability in ways that will make a dramatic difference. As I said, \nthe centerpiece in this bill is the significant increase in the maximum \nPell grant and the expansion of Pell grant eligibility. Over the years, \nthe Pell Grant Program has been enormously successful. This is \nAmerica's largest need-based student grant program, and it has given \nmillions of low-income students the opportunity to attend college, many \nof them the first in their families to do so.\n  Over the years, the value of the Pell grant has eroded dramatically. \nThink about this: Two decades ago, the maximum Pell grant covered 51 \npercent of the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board at a public 4-\nyear college--51 percent. By the 2004-2005 academic year, it covered \nonly 35 percent of those costs, and it has fallen even more over the \nlast couple of years.\n  In my State of Iowa, two decades ago, the Pell grants covered 61 \npercent of the average cost of a public 4-year college tuition, fees, \nand room and board--61 percent. Today, it covers about a third--about \n33 percent--of those same costs.\n  Without adequate Federal grants, students have had to rely \nincreasingly on student loans, many with very high interest rates. More \nstudents and their parents are taking out loans and borrowing larger \nand larger amounts. Today, more than 60 percent of undergraduates at 4-\nyear colleges take out loans, and the average student loan debt is more \nthan $19,000. Indeed, Iowa students at 4-year colleges and universities \ngraduate with an average of $22,727 in debt--the second highest rate in \nthe country, I might add.\n  Make no mistake, when students graduate from college with a mountain \nof debt, this has a major impact on their career choices. For many \nheavily indebted graduates, pursuing public service careers as \nteachers, social workers, legal aid attorneys or a host of others \nbecomes out of the question. A recent study found that 23 percent of \npublic college graduates and 38 percent of private college graduates \nwould have an unmanageable level of student debt if they tried to live \non the starting salary of a teacher.\n  The burden of student debt also has a big impact on major life \ndecisions. A student loan survey found the probability of owning a home \ndecreases as the level of student debt increases. Well, that makes \nsense. In a survey, 30 percent of students said they delayed buying a \ncar because of student loan debt, 21 percent said they delayed having \nchildren, and 14 percent said they delayed getting married.\n  I know of one very talented member of my own staff who, even in his \nmid 30s, was burdened with tens of thousands of dollars of debt while \nattending law school. He then got married, he and his wife had a couple \nof children, and he felt increasingly burdened by the debt. He finally \nhad no choice but to leave his relatively modest-paying Senate job for \na more lucrative position in the private sector. He concluded this was \nthe only way he would ever be able to pay off his college loan debt so \nhe could then start saving for his own children's college education. I \nbelieve there are more and more young people like that--they want to do \npublic service-type jobs, but with the amount of debt they have, they \ncan't afford to do so.\n  The College Cost Reduction Act is a sound bill. It is a good bill. \nWhat is more, it would not cost the taxpayers a dime. As I said, the \nbill saved $18 billion by cutting wasteful, excessive subsidies to \nprivate lenders, and of that amount $17 billion will be used to fund \nincreases to Pell grants and the income-based loan repayment program, \nwith the remaining $1 billion dedicated to deficit reduction.\n  Predictably, the private lenders have mobilized a small army of \nlobbyists to argue that reductions in their subsidies would be \ndevastating to their industry. Well, this simply is not true. The fact \nis that it is high time we eliminated the waste and gross excesses in \nFederal subsidies to some of these private lenders. Because of those \nsubsidies, the student loan industry has reaped huge profits and become \none of the most lucrative industries in America.\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\n  Take Sallie Mae, for example, the Nation's largest student lender--\nfantastically profitable, thanks to these overly generous subsidies \nover the past 30 years. The corporation now is moving forward with \nplans to sell itself. This corporation that has been loaning money to \nstudents now is going to go private, sell itself, with a windfall of \nsome $25 billion. Together, Sallie Mae chairman Albert Lord and their \nCEO, Tim Fitzpatrick, have collected total compensation--get this, the \ntwo of them--of $367 million since 1999. Two people. And we are \nwondering why students have such high debts. In fact, as the Washington \nPost reported a short while ago, Mr. Lord, the Sallie Mae chairman, is \ncurrently building his own private golf course on 244 acres in suburban \nMaryland at a cost of up to $15 million. This is the head, folks, of \nSallie Mae, the largest student loan industry in America.\n  So we shouldn't shed any tears for the private loan companies and \ntheir executives. They are doing quite well. Quite frankly, they are \ngoing to continue to receive Federal subsidies. They are going to \ncontinue to make loans. They are going to continue to make profits. But \nmaybe some of the future CEOs in this industry will have to forgo the \nluxury of having their own private golf course.\n  The College Cost Reduction Act is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will consider this year. It will make college affordable \nfor our young people, especially those of modest means. It will go a \nlong way toward ensuring our young people are not overly burdened with \nstudent loan debt after they graduate so they can afford to pursue \ncareers that not only benefit them but make the world a better place in \nwhich to live. It will put the American dream and that ladder of \nopportunity once again within the reach of every American.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this long overdue and vitally \nimportant bill. Again, I wish to compliment Senator Kennedy for so many \nyears of leadership on this issue, especially the issue of education \nand making sure that college is affordable to our lowest-income \nstudents. I thank him, I thank Senator Enzi for working together on \nthis bipartisan bill, and, hopefully, before the day ends at not too \nlate an hour, we can pass this bill and give more hope and opportunity \nto a lot of these young people I see sitting on the Senate floor and to \nso many other young people throughout America.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his outstanding leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the good Senator from Iowa for all his work on \nour education proposal. He has been a key member of our Committee on \nEducation, and he has not only worked on it in terms of our committee \nbut also as one of the important leaders on the Appropriations \nCommittee to make sure that what we have authorized actually gets \nfunded. I hope the young people in Iowa understand that, because we \ncertainly understand it, and we are very appreciative of it.\n  Quickly, though, the Senator has outlined in careful detail how we \nhave put the greatest amount of the savings of $18 billion, $17 billion \nto provide relief for the students in the Pell grants. But I want to \nunderline one other aspect of the program which says that if young \npeople are going to volunteer in terms of public service, they will pay \nno more than 15 percent of their income in return. Therefore, they will \nsave a good deal of the amount that otherwise they would have to save, \nand then they will get the loan forgiveness at the end of the day.\n  I just list here the various areas of public service. His particular \ninterest would be about halfway down, since the Senator from Iowa has \nalso been our great leader dealing with the challenges of disabilities, \nand also with the elderly--public services for individuals who work \nwith the disabled, also with the elderly, also with independent living \nissues as our population grows older.\n  So we have public health and social work in public service agencies, \neducation, early education, childcare, our legal system, public \ndefenders and libraries--working, even in the tribal areas.\n  As the Senator from Iowa found in his travels around Iowa in many of \nthe schools and colleges, young people welcome the opportunity to be a \npart of giving something back to the local community, giving something \nas a teacher or helping the disabled. They are glad to do that. In too \nmany instances, they can't afford to do it because they have too big a \ndebt, but under this bill they will be able to do that, and at the end \nof the day, a grateful nation will say: If you do it for 10 years, your \ndebt is forgiven.\n  I ask if the Senator will not agree with me that this is really one \nof the important provisions in this legislation, one of the compelling \nprovisions? We have tried to provide help and assistance to those in \nthe Pell program, but we are also trying to incentivize and give \nopportunity to young people who want to give something back to their \ncommunities by showing a grateful nation will forgive their debt.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for pointing this out. I especially \nwant to underline what the Senator said about the public services for \nindividuals with disabilities and the elderly.\n  Because of the Olmstead Supreme Court decision, because of what is \nhappening now, as you know, we are moving more and more people out of \ninstitutional-based settings and into community-based settings. A lot \nof these people are going to need some help and personal assistance \nservices to get going so they can earn money and pay taxes.\n  I often tell the story of my nephew Kelly. Of course, he was injured \nin the military, so he has always had VA services. But he has a nurse \nwho comes in. He is a paraplegic. He gets up in the morning, a nurse \ncomes in, gets him ready for the day, he goes to work, comes in, and \nwhen he gets home at night, someone takes care of him. If it weren't \nfor that, he wouldn't be working and paying taxes. That is, thankfully, \nbecause he is in the VA and they do that, but for anybody else who has \na disability, they don't get that kind of service.\n  More and more, we will be working with people, individuals with \ndisabilities, in this sector. A lot of people want to do this. They \ncannot do this, I say to the Senator, with the mountain of debt they \nhave. They just can't afford to do this work.\n  The only thing I might disagree with the Senator on, he said this is \none of the most important aspects. I think this is ``the'' most \nimportant aspect of the bill.\n  I would say to the Senator, I started my life as a legal aid lawyer. \nSo many low-income families need assistance, just legal assistance with \ndebts, housing, divorces, family problems. They can't afford it. A lot \nof young people want to become a legal aid attorney. They may not stay \nthere all their lives, but they would like to do this for a few years. \nIt is public service. They get their feet wet right away in a lot of \nlegal work.\n  I always tell young people in law school: If you really want to \nfigure out what legal work is all about, become a legal aid attorney \nout of law school. You will get the cases no one else wants. You will \nget the cases people have given up on. I tell you, that will make you a \nbetter lawyer than anything in your lifetime.\n  A lot of young people want to do this. They cannot do it with the \ndebt they have now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will just look at this chart. You \nmentioned about the public defender--annual salary, this will be a \npublic defender in Indiana. Here is the average loan debt, probably as \na public defender. The average is $19,000 but probably $51,000 if that \nperson has gone to law school. We save them $2,800 a year in loan \npayments. If we do this for 10 years, I show the Senator from Iowa, if \nwe do it for 10 years, their loan forgiveness is $33,000--$33,000 is \nforgiven.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope the Senator doesn't mind if I hold one up for \nIowa. This is a teacher in Iowa: average salary, $27,284; average loan \ndebt, $27,727. Here are your monthly payments. Under this bill right \nnow, the relief will be $1,344, and the amount forgiven, $16,057. This \nis going to be great for teachers, going into teaching in the State of \nIowa. I can't speak for what it is like in Massachusetts, but in Iowa \nwe are losing about upwards of a third to half of our teachers in the \nsecond or third year because they cannot afford to teach and pay back \ntheir loans.\n\n[[Page S9541]]\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his great leadership. As I said, \nthis, to me, is the core of what we are trying to do with this bill. It \nis not only to help these students get the Pell grants to go to college \nbut also so they can pursue their dreams and do the kind of work they \nwant to do, not what they are forced to do because they have a mountain \nof debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield such time as the two Senators need, until 11:40, \nwhich I think has been reserved for the leaders; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request has not been granted at this \ntime.\n  Mr. ENZI. OK. I yield them such time as they need to present their \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2337 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n           (Purpose: To amend the special allowance payments)\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise alongside my colleague \nand friend, Senator Burr from North Carolina, on an issue of great \nimportance to America's middle class; that is, the affordability of \nhigher education.\n  I call up amendment No. 2337.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Burr, proposes an amendment numbered 2337 to amendment No. \n     2327.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, even at the University of \nNebraska, which offers a quality and cost-effective education, the \naverage graduate holds over $16,000 in debt as they enter the working \nworld. That is the equivalent for many starting out of a near mortgage, \nalthough they don't own a house. For many students across the Nation, \nthe picture is even more bleak, as students graduate with the \nequivalent of a home mortgage, in many instances. Over the last 10 \nyears, the problem has grown worse. Average tuition and fees at 4-year \npublic and private institutions have increased by 38 percent.\n  The class of 2008 will be the largest high school class in U.S. \nhistory, with nearly 3.2 million high school graduates facing the \ndecision of whether they can afford to go to college. A key part of \nthat calculation will be the financing options at their disposal, \nincluding grants, Federal loans, and private financing.\n  I applaud Senator Kennedy for leading the charge, investing \nadditional Federal dollars in Pell grants which provide need-based aid \nto 5.3 million Americans each year. An estimated 90 percent of Pell \ngrant recipients considered to be dependent upon their parents had \nfamily income below $40,000. This provides essential support for many \nunderprivileged families but only starts to address student need as \nloans are often required to supplement this aid and many middle-class \nfamilies ineligible for Pell grants are left searching for financing \nsolutions.\n  In a time of mounting challenges for America's middle class, I urge \ncaution and moderation in cutting funding for the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program, known as FFEL, on which 8 out of 10 schools \nrely to serve their students' financial needs at the present time. \nEight out of ten schools rely on these private financing situations for \nstudents' financial needs.\n  The Federal Government partners with loan providers to ensure that \nthe student loan marketplace is fully capitalized and students have \naccess to affordable higher education financing options. This market-\nbased approach has solidified access for student loans, preserved \nattentiveness to the needs of borrowers and schools, while providing \nvaluable discounts to middle-class families.\n  That said, our amendment preserves significant cuts to the student \nloan industry. However, it does so in a tempered and moderate manner \nwhich bridges the desires of Members on the one hand to increase need-\nbased aid for low-income families and on the other hand to avoid \nincreasing loan costs for millions of families and doing significantly \nirreparable harm to the public-private FFEL Program. In addition, our \namendment preserves the maximum Pell grant levels established in the \nHigher Education Access Act and does not reduce financial aid for \nstudents.\n  Many will come and speak about past grievances in which a select few \nin the student loan industry have been involved. I am as troubled as \nanyone by these past actions, and I applaud the HELP Committee for \ntaking action in the higher education reauthorization bill to make sure \nthese problems do not occur again.\n  That said, the Federal Family Education Loan, FFEL, has afforded \nyoung Americans the opportunity to attend college for over 40 years and \nis a critical part of making college a reality for many in the middle \nclass. Over the life of a loan, the FFEL Program delivers on average \n$2,800 in discounts and savings to middle-class Americans. Amazingly \noften, we speak about the magnitude of student loan cuts as if they \nwill cost nothing. Americans rely on the FFEL Program, and I encourage \nMembers to ask their FFEL schools how valuable the program is for \nstudents in their State. Our amendment tempers the FFEL cut, preserving \n$15.65 billion in reductions to lenders.\n  Reports are circulating that the Nelson-Burr amendment would set \naside less money for Pell grants. What has not been relayed accurately \nis that the Nelson-Burr amendment increases grant aid to the exact same \nfunding levels as the Higher Education Access Act. The amendment does \nnot degrade the amount dedicated to Pell grants; rather, it uses a \ndifferent baseline from which the CBO cost calculations are made. We \nassume the $4,600 Pell grant appropriation which was accommodated in \nthe budget resolution--the same budget resolution which created these \nreconciliation instructions. This assumption is less than the House of \nRepresentatives' Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill which funds it as $4,700 for Pell grant maximum.\n  Our focus is on the end result for students. A vote for Nelson-Burr \nnot only assures that the most needy families see the same increases in \nPell grants but also helps mitigate the damage to competitive student \nloans that deliver savings to middle-class families and students, many \nof whom are ineligible for Pell grants and other aid.\n  Let me make the point clear.\n  No. 1, 8 out of 10 schools rely on the FFEL Program.\n  No. 2, we must proceed with caution and moderation in making these \ncuts because this will reduce the amount of capital available for \nstudent loans for middle-class families.\n  No. 3, these cuts directly impact students' and middle-income \nAmericans' pocketbooks, those who have to rely on loans for higher \neducation.\n  No. 4, our amendment does not reduce student aid or the maximum Pell \ngrant set out in this bill, as some have said.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Nelson-Burr \namendment. I ask that my colleague, Senator Burr, have whatever \nremaining time might be required for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Nelson. I take the \nopportunity to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, who have played \nthe leadership in trying to find the balance of what our policies \nshould look like--the policies of competition, the policies of access, \nthe policies of direct Government loans.\n  It is not easy when there is so much we want to do, but we are \nconfined by how much money we have to do that. It is my hope, as \nSenator Enzi said earlier, that we do not stop with this reconciliation \nbill, that we quickly reauthorize Higher Education. I believe that is \nabsolutely essential, and many things we have in that make a tremendous \ndifference.\n  Senator Nelson has done a beautiful job of laying out for everybody \nwhat is at stake. I suggest to you that what we need to focus on, more \nthan does the loan come from the private sector or from the Federal \nGovernment or this or that, is students. This debate is about students. \nIt is about are we going\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\nto provide an opportunity for every child in this country who wants to \nseek higher education, as part of the tools they possess for their \ncompetitiveness in the future, are we going to provide that for them \nregardless of where they come from, regardless of the income of their \nfamily, regardless of the school they choose?\n  Senator Nelson stated very clearly, 80 percent of the schools in the \ncountry chose FFELP loans as their No. 1 tool to provide the financing \nstudents need to get their education.\n  Why? Well, one, because they are more competitive in most cases. \nThose that provide FFELP eliminate the origination fee. They discount \nthe loans. In many cases they are a point or more under what the \nGovernment direct loan is.\n  Now, I would expect some would say since Senator Nelson and I are \nsuggesting that since nonprofits we're reducing by 35 basis points in \ntheir spread, and for-profits 50, that 50 they can live with. They may \nbe right. But the fact is that none of us knows. If one lender drops \nout of the marketplace, we have now constrained the choices and the \noptions every student has.\n  I think what Senator Nelson and I suggest is, let's do 35 and 35. \nLet's treat the for-profit and not-for-profit in the same way. In the \ncase of North Carolina, I should be fine with where nonprofits are, \nbecause 65 percent of all student loans written in North Carolina are \ndone by the College Fund of North Carolina, a not-for-profit \ninstitution.\n  When you look at added services over and above the discount rate and \nthe ease of doing business with the College Fund of North Carolina, and \nwith the for-profits in comparison to the Government Direct Loan, which \nis Washington driven, it is bureaucratic, it is not consumer friendly, \nit is not responsive to the families or the students, you realize why \neight out of 10 schools choose it; but, more importantly, why parents \nand students choose that as the No. 1 option.\n  FFELP has a history. It is a history that shows tremendous benefits \nto students and to their parents. In most areas of the U.S. economy, we \nfind that when we encourage competition, the beneficiary is the \nindividual who reaches a lower price point. We are saying: Let's not \nrisk it. Let's go to where we know nobody is harmed, but let's not go \nfurther than that. Let's make sure we have incorporated into the \npackage for those low-income families the grant proposals Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi have incorporated in their bill, but let's not \nbe too punitive to the system, going into the unknown, that we actually \neliminate clients who exist in the marketplace.\n  Very simply, our amendment focuses on students. It uses the strength \nof the FFELP program to say we are going to make sure the competition \nthat existed up to this point exists well into the future.\n  As Senator Nelson says, our amendment cuts for all lenders $15.65 \nbillion over 5 years at a time when it is not just a domestic economy, \nit is a global economy. I believe every Member of the Senate--more \nimportantly, every parent in America--understands, regardless of their \neducation level, that for their kids to have an unlimited future they \nhave to have an opportunity to get the best education they want to \npursue so their opportunities in life are unlimited.\n  I think we can safely say with a reduction of $15.65 billion, we feel \nfairly confident we can make that promise to parents across this \ncountry, that we have not diminished the opportunity for unlimited \nopportunities for their children. But I think it is safe to say Senator \nNelson and I and others believe if you cut further and you diminish the \ncompetition in the marketplace, you have now diminished the \nopportunity, not just the educational opportunity but the economic \nopportunity, of the next generation.\n  I don't necessarily agree with the philosophy that if we get it \nwrong, there is a Government Direct Loan program to service them \nregardless, and they will access loans; they will access it through a \nprogram that does not eliminate the origination fee; that does not \ndiscount the product; is at least a percentage point or higher, because \nthey have no competition; it is not user friendly; it is not \nresponsive; its application process is not predictable. It sounds a lot \nlike the visa process for people in the United States, for people on \nthe outside looking in.\n  But the reality today is we need a system that every student and \nevery parent understands. I have two children in higher education. I \ncan tell you the most difficult thing is for a parent to sit down and \ntry to figure out the application process, how to fill it out, how to \nqualify, and whether, in fact, you do qualify.\n  Senator Enzi alluded earlier to the need for additional reforms. I \nthink we agree, in a very bipartisan way, that there are other things \nwe need to do. But the wrong thing to do would be to hurt students, to \nhurt parents right from the beginning with their access to affordable \neducation.\n\n  The spirit of where we are going is right; it has just gone a little \ntoo far. And rather than to go into the unknown and not know what the \nreactions will be in the for-profit market, I believe the responsible \nthing is to roll back the change slightly, to treat for-profits and \nnot-for-profits the same way, to assure every family that the \neducational opportunities we continue to see expand for all Americans; \nin fact, continue in the future, and they are not limited or \nconstrained in a way that families look at it and try to find \nfinancing.\n  Senator Kennedy has proposed in this bill a number of ways to create \nincentives for specific individuals, and I think in most cases this \napproach is embraced; as Senator Harkin very passionately displayed, \nprobably long overdue in a lot of cases. As we focus on how to expand \nit, as we focus on how to be a little more attuned to what the needs \nare, it strikes me we would cut in a way that might--I stress the word \n``might''--constrain the choices parents and students have.\n  It is simple: If we want to eliminate the word ``might,'' and say it \ndoes not, all we have to do is roll back slightly the cut we propose. \nIn doing that, we still make the investment in low-income subsidies \nthrough FFELP and other programs, we still give the assurance to every \nfamily that there is a way to finance college education, we still \nassure students that once they get that diploma, that diploma is the \nanswer to the payback of that student loan, because they now have the \ntools for an unlimited future which brings with it an unlimited \nearnings opportunity.\n  The answer is easy. I hope my colleagues will support what I think is \na very responsible amendment to a very well-intended bill. I believe \nnot to do it is to accept the responsibility that some kids will win \nand some kids will lose; that the possibility exists that when you \ndiminish competition, you actually raise the cost of education, not \nlower the cost; that for some who might have access today but might not \nhave access tomorrow to anything other than the Direct Loan from the \nGovernment student loan program; that that option may be too expensive; \nit may be too cumbersome; it may be too difficult to understand; it may \nnot be predictable enough; and that period of decision, as one \ncompletes a senior year in high school and potentially makes a decision \nabout not just where they go but whether they go, that one change may \ninfluence them to say: Well, you know what, 12 years is enough.\n  I come from a State that has had, I think, the largest transformation \nin our economy of practically any State in the country. Twenty years \nago traditional manufacturing drove every job that was in North \nCarolina, and that was in textiles and furniture. Through the changes \nin trade and through the creation of a global economy, I do not need to \ntell my colleagues where textile and furniture jobs are today, but they \nare not in North Carolina.\n  If it were not for higher education in North Carolina, we would not \nhave reeducated and retrained an older workforce, but we also would not \nhave the capabilities, without higher education today, to take the next \ngeneration that is coming through to give them the educational skills \nthey need to compete in the 21st century jobs we are creating today.\n  You see, for a State that I felt got kicked when we were already \nknocked down, we moved from what was the norm in 1950 to today jobs \nthat are being created that are in the next sectors of the economy we \nare just now\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\ncreating. They demand and require a different level of educational \nproficiency. Sure, if they do not have it, they can fill out the \napplication, but if they do not have the educational qualifications, \nthey will never get invited for the interview. It does them no good.\n  We are encouraging our colleagues today: make sure every student who \nfills out the application for that job has the educational \nqualifications to be invited for the interview because we have not \ndiminished the tools they can use to pay for the education.\n  There is a lot at stake. Clearly, this Congress, this body, under the \nleadership of the chairman and the ranking member, have moved the ball \nwell down the road in the right direction--Senator Nelson and I might \nsay a little bit too far as it relates to the for-profit lenders.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize that. I hope they will keep \nfocused on the students and the parents, and if in the future we see \nthat the spread can be rolled even further, I am sure at that point in \ntime we will find a worthy investment we can make in students and in \nparents and in education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 12 noon today be for debate with respect to the Nelson-Burr \namendment, with the time until then equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote; that the vote with respect to the amendment occur upon \ndisposition of the Kennedy amendment which is covered under a previous \nunanimous consent agreement; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote; and that the second and third votes be 10 \nminutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Enzi and I have 7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First, I thank our friends, Senators Burr and Nelson, for their \ninterest in this issue. Senator Burr is a strong member of our \ncommittee and much involved in educational issues. We always profit \nfrom his suggestions and ideas, as well as Senator Nelson. As much as \nwe profit generally, there are times when we do not. This happens to be \nthat one time.\n  I have in my hand the pending legislation, which is Kennedy-Enzi, and \nthe Nelson-Burr amendment. All one has to do is look on page 1 of both \nand they will see what the difference is. On Kennedy-Enzi, paragraph \n(A) is $2.6 billion; on Nelson-Burr, it is $1.6 billion. Paragraph (B) \nis $3 billion on Kennedy-Enzi; $2 billion on Nelson-Burr. Paragraph (C) \nis $3 billion according to Kennedy-Enzi; $2 billion on Nelson-Burr. \nParagraph (D) is $3.9 billion; on theirs it is $2.8 billion. The point \nI am making is, it is $4.2 billion less in student aid. That is the \nbasic point.\n  Is there a question about the economic stability of primarily Sallie \nMae? This chart may be difficult to see, but if you look at the bottom, \nright here on the bottom right are Sallie Mae's own projections. All \nduring the 1990s, at the time we made some modifications in giving the \nstudents more help, and Sallie Mae had always indicated that they were \ngoing to have more and more trouble. If you look at the end here in the \nblue, this is their projections in terms of their revenues and profits \ngoing out to 2006. This is their document, not ours. They are going to \nbe financially secure in terms of the future.\n  The debate really is, do we want to do more for students or more for \nbanks?\n  The final point I will make is, if you look at what the cuts are \ngoing to be, this chart represents for every State the effect of the \nNelson-Burr amendment in reducing assistance for students. My State is \n$59 million. The State of the Senator from Rhode Island is some $16 \nmillion. But for every State in the country, this chart represents a \nreduction in student assistance.\n  The economic and financial advisers have indicated that these \nfinancial institutions are going to have ample profits. My concern is \nwhether we have done enough in terms of the students, not have we done \ntoo little. That is why I believe students will be best served by \nresisting the Nelson-Burr amendment. They will benefit the most under \nour proposal.\n  If we are going to say we will leave it up to the appropriators, what \nare they going to do? They make certain assumptions that the \nappropriators are going to appropriate more money and, therefore, there \nreally won't be a loss. If the appropriators appropriate more money, it \nwill go to the benefit under our proposal. So Pell grants will go up \nand students will benefit even further. We provide effectively $800 in \nterms of Pell grants. They provide $500.\n  I hope this amendment will not be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, one has to look a little further at what you \nget for the money. If you look at the nonprofit world and the for-\nprofit world, they market student loans. They educate parents about \nwhat is available to them. For any parent who has gone through the \nprocess, one of the most difficult things is, when you look at the pot \nof savings you have as you have seen college cost escalate, when you \nrealize what the cost is, you realize you don't have enough. When the \nlikelihood is between grants and loans, you are going to have to do \nboth. Where do you go? Part of the beauty of the system of a \ncompetitive private sector is they are competing, which means they are \nmarketing. They are sending out information. They are educating parents \nand students. By the way, marketing is extremely expensive.\n  There is another piece to it, and it is called financial literacy, \nthe challenge every parent and student goes through about what their \nresponsibilities are. What is the choice we are going to leave? Are we \ngoing to take away so much money that marketing and financial literacy \nare no longer a benefit, a service, a tool that lenders provide? I \nguess some would suggest we do.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator from North Carolina yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BURR. In one second.\n  The solution, then, is that you let the Government entity, the direct \nto the student loan from the Government, be the education source. We \nhave a long history. We don't do that well. As a matter of fact, we \ndon't do it at all. So our expectations that financial literacy would \nexist or would improve would not be the reality.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wanted to follow up, if I may for a moment, on the \npoint raised by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who has \njust indicated that the effect of this amendment on my home State of \nRhode Island would be $16 million less in student loans available for \nstudents. I ask the distinguished Senator from North Carolina if this \nis, in fact, correct? And if it is correct, where does that $16 million \ngo that could otherwise be supporting higher education for students in \nmy State?\n  Mr. BURR. Let me respond to my colleague that what Senator Kennedy \ndisplayed was a simple mathematical calculation. We raise $4 billion \nand a few in change less money out of the system, and we believe that \nthat is a prudent thing to do based upon the unknown as to whether that \nwould reduce competition. So we have $4 billion less to work with. We \nhave the same challenge, and that is, how do you invest that in a way \nthat families and students feel the beneficial effects. I believe as \nyou look at it and you say that money is now in the system, I can also \npoint to the fact that the competition that exists in the FFELP program \nsavings, the entire program, is $6 billion a year. So if you eliminated \nit, the $4 billion savings, if it were to knock out all the for-\nprofits, you have lost it on the competition that exists in that system \nand the lower prices, the elimination of origination fees, the \ndiscounts, set aside the fact that we do marketing and we do financial \nliteracy programs that only the private sector seems to be able to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield for another question, does \nthat mean that there is, in fact, with all of that said, still $16 \nmillion less available to Rhode Island students as a result of this \namendment?\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. I don't know the calculations that Senator Kennedy went \nthrough, but I have never found his charts to be incorrect.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the point raised is, with these kinds of \ncuts, will it somehow eliminate the competition? CBO said we could \nactually have a three-quarters of 1 percent cut and there would still \nbe profitability in the system. We didn't take three-quarters of this. \nWe have taken 50 percent of one and 35 percent in the other. We haven't \nreached the three-quarters. So under the CBO, there is going to be \ncompetition. If you take Sallie Mae's own future projections, there is \ngoing to be competition. We have included in this legislation something \nthat is enormously important, a trial program to have real competition \nout there to see who will compete for the lowest possible additional \npayments and ensure that we are going to get the benefits for the \nstudents rather than for the lenders. That would be enormous. That \nwould be real competition. We are not there yet. We have a trial \nprogram in this legislation. Even under the administration's own \nfigures, we haven't really threatened any of the potential lenders.\n  As the chart just showed, Sally Mae, the principal figure in this, is \ngoing to have ample profit over future years. I hope every Member takes \na look at the charts and recognizes what is going to happen in terms of \nstudents in their particular States because under their program, there \nwill be important reductions in terms of that assistance, particularly \nin the Pell Grant Program.\n  Do I have any further time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand now we are going to have three votes. \nThe last vote will be on the Nelson-Burr amendment. I believe I am \ncorrect. The effect of that will be a reduction of some $4 billion that \nis provided in student aid. I hope that amendment will not be \nsuccessful, and we will stay with the bipartisan recommendation that \ncame out of our committee with an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I will not use the full time yielded back. I \nwant to once again thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for the \nleadership they have shown on not just the reconciliation but hopefully \non passage of a reauthorization of higher education.\n  Let me make this point: The fact that 80 percent of the students in \nthis country choose the FFELP program for their student loan is a great \nindication of the value of this program, of the competition it provides \nbut, more importantly, the savings that is apparent that this program \nprovides to parents and students. If the Government Direct Loan \nprogram, which is the default, a bureaucratic, Washington-driven, loan \nprogram is the default because we have calculated incorrectly, then \nonly 20 percent of the students are going to be happy because that is \nall they are choosing today. Eighty percent are going to be unhappy.\n  The question is, how do you influence their decision in their senior \nyear in high school about the need, the desire, and the ability to go \non to higher education?\n  As I look at the pages sitting in front of us, I understand it is \nthem we are talking about. For most of us in the room, it is not about \nour kids because we have now aged out of that. The reality is, we have \na next generation for which we are responsible to make sure they have \nequal to, if not better, opportunities than we as parents had. This is \na time I am not willing to risk who is right. I am willing to say: \nLet's be cautious. Let's stand on firm ground. In this institution we \nhave the ability to use CBO for or against us. When it is advantageous, \nwe mention it; when it is not, we don't. I realize that. But I hope \nMembers will use what they know and what they see. What you see with \nthis program is, 80 percent of the students and the parents choose it. \nThey have confidence in it. It brings real value. By the way, it saves \na student $3,000 over the life of the loan because FFELP brings that \nlevel of competition. That is worth saving, and it is worth preserving.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I don't believe we have asked \nfor the yeas and nays, so I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on all the other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on those \nother amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the remaining \namendments?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2329\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided on amendment No. 2329 offered by the \njunior Senator from Alaska.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my amendment would change the amount to \nbe authorized and appropriated for the College Access Partnership Grant \nProgram. It would change it from $25 million to $113 million for both \nfiscal year 2008 and 2009.\n  What the College Access Partnership Grant Program does is make \npayments available to States to assist them in carrying out specific \nactivities relating to increasing college access for low-income \nstudents in the State.\n  Currently, about 64 percent of our higher income students who enroll \nin college get a bachelor's degree, while only 21 percent of our lower \nincome students do so. The College Access Partnership Grant Program is \nspecifically designed to help States put together services and benefits \nthat are most likely to get more of their low-income students to apply \nfor, to be accepted by, and to, ultimately, succeed in college.\n  The amendment is paid for by the $176 million in excess deficit \nreduction funds above those required by the budget resolution.\n  What we specifically provide for is outreach, information on \nfinancing options, on promoting financial literacy, on assisting the \nstudents to have access to these very important programs.\n  I urge support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Alaska for \nher efforts for not only the State of Alaska but for all our States and \nfor the initiation she has provided for this amendment.\n  As she has quite correctly stated, one of the great challenges is \nthat we have many qualified students, but they do not have the \nknowledge or support to be able to find the educational opportunities \nthat are out there. There are nonprofit agencies in the respective \nStates. This will help the States reach out to various groups and \nindividuals in their State to assist them in finding the path toward \neducation--the provisions that are included in this legislation.\n  This amendment is very much needed, and it will make an important \ndifference. We have more than 400,000 students now who are not in \ncollege who are qualified to go.\n  The Senator's amendment is a positive one. I hope we will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2329.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order, please.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we know, under the budget, we \nconsidered the legislation for 5 years, but the results of the \nrecommendations that came out of our committee will carry on into the \nfuture. Obviously we will have a reauthorization and the Senate will \nmake whatever judgment, but in the meantime, we are going to make sure \nthat those resources in the future, after the 5 years, are going to go \nto the benefit of students.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a reconciliation bill. The purpose \nof reconciliation is to not radically grow the size of Government but \nto control the size of Government. Under this bill, unfortunately, the \nsize of Government will grow by $19 billion. The actual savings in the \nbill is now down to $750 million. So for every $1 of savings, there is \nnow $19 billion of new spending--new spending. That is not the purpose \nof reconciliation.\n  What the Senator is suggesting now is that in the second 5 years, \nwhen there is $40 billion of new spending, that another $2.3 billion of \ndeficit reduction which was supposed to occur will be grabbed and also \nspent. This makes no sense at all. We are supposed to use \nreconciliation to reduce the rate of growth of Government, not to \nspend. This is an attempt to increase the spending, which is already \n$40 billion in the second 5 years, by another $2.3 billion, which was \nsupposed to go to deficit reduction.\n  I hope people will vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided on amendment No. 2337 offered by the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to urge support for the \nNelson-Burr amendment which is next in line for voting.\n  In a time of mounting challenges for America's middle-class families, \nI am urging caution and moderation in cutting funding for the Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program which 8 out of 10--80 percent of the \nschools--rely on to serve their students' financial needs.\n  The Nelson-Burr amendment does preserve significant cuts of $15.65 \nbillion to the student loan industry, but it does so in a tempered and \nmoderate manner which bridges the desires of Members on the one hand to \nincrease need-based aid for low-income families and on the other hand \nto avoid increasing loan costs for millions of families and doing \nirreparable, significant harm to the public-private FFELP program.\n  In addition, our amendment preserves the maximum Pell grant levels \nestablished in the Higher Education Access Act. There is information \nthat says it is not doing it that way. That information is incorrect.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all you have to do is pick up the Nelson-\nBurr proposal and the one recommended by the committee and you will see \nthat there is $4 billion in cuts. Those are benefits that are going to \ngo to students.\n  The question is, Are my colleagues going to support the students or \nare they going to support the banks? That is the issue. That is the \nquestion. Every State will see a reduction in the funding for students \nunder this proposal. CBO has indicated, in evaluating our proposal, \nthat the lenders, talking about the industry, are going to have \nprofits--I will include their report--large and small alike. This is a \nquestion of whether we are going to support the students who need that \nhelp, need that assistance who are the future of our economy and of our \nnational security or whether we are going to support the banks. That is \nthe issue. This is the time.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2337.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally vote has been changed to reflect the above \norder.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see my friend from Maryland here who \nwishes to address us, and I hope our Members will pay close attention.\n  We have been making important progress during this last hour or so on \nsome very important amendments, and we are grateful for the interest \nand the involvement of all our colleagues. We have a number of our \ncolleagues who wish to address the Senate on this education \nlegislation. We will hear from several of them at this time.\n  We are very grateful for all of the support the Senator from Maryland \nhas given, and I yield such time as he might want on the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I also thank Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi for their extraordinary leadership in bringing forward the Higher \nEducation Access Act. I think this is one of the most important bits of \nlegislation that we will be considering during this term of Congress. \nTo me, it speaks to one of the highest priorities of our country, and \nthat is making education--quality education--available to all of our \nfamilies.\n  Affordability of higher education is a critically important issue \naffecting families throughout our Nation. In 1965, we made a commitment \nin the Higher Education Act that every family--every family in this \ncountry--should be able to send their children to college and that the \nfinancial considerations should not prevent a family from allowing \ntheir children to get the benefits of higher education in America. We \nenacted the Pell grants, which was a huge program at the time, opening \nopportunities to many families who had never had it before.\n  Over the last 20 years, we have seen a considerable erosion of the \naffordability of higher education to families in the United States. In \nthe last 20 years, college costs have increased threefold. Yet the \nbuying power of Pell grants has actually declined during the past 20 \nyears. Madam President, 20 years ago, 55 percent of the cost of a \npublic 4-year college could have been financed through Pell grants. \nToday, it is less than one-third. It is estimated that 400,000--\n400,000--children in our country each year see the doors of higher \neducation barred to them because they just can't afford to pay the \ntuition and costs of going to a postsecondary school. This is important \nto our country.\n  When I graduated from college, 15 percent of the new jobs required \nsome form of postsecondary education. Today, that number is in excess \nof 60 percent. This is important for the individual, in order to \nbenefit from the opportunities of America, but it is important for our \ncountry. If we are going to be competitive internationally, we need to \nhave an educated workforce. So this is a public investment. It is not \njust for the individual. It benefits our Nation by allowing it to \ncontinue to grow economically so that our standard of living can \nincrease.\n  The cost of higher education can determine what school an individual \nwill attend because the cost affects many families who may say: Gee, I \nknow you could benefit from going to this particular college or \nuniversity, but we just can't afford it, so we will try this college or \nuniversity. That second choice may work and it may not.\n  The cost of higher education also affects the careers that graduates \nchoose because they have these huge loans they have to repay. We have \nstudents who would like to become teachers or would like to become \nnurses or go into law enforcement or some other field they feel a \ntalent for or are committed to, but they take a look at their college \nloans and they have to opt out in order to repay those loans. So we \nlose out on the creativity of those college graduates.\n  Finally, the cost of higher education may also affect when a graduate \nstarts a family or whether he or she can buy a home.\n  This financial burden truly has affected much of this Nation--the \ntype of country that we are--and that is why this legislation, to me, \nis one of the most important that we will be considering during this \nterm in Congress.\n  Fifteen years ago, about half the students in colleges took out \nloans. Today, that number is over two-thirds. The average debt for a \ncollege graduate is $19,000. We have a chance to do something about it \nin this legislation.\n  I might point out to my colleagues that, along with Senator Snowe, I \nhave introduced the Master Teachers Act of 2007, which provides a \nFederal tax incentive for teachers who go into careers to help \nunderserved areas, such as our rural areas and those areas where the \nschools are not meeting the expectations of No Child Left Behind--high \npoverty areas. That is an important bill that will help.\n  But we have an opportunity in this legislation to make a major \ndifference in the affordability of higher education. I was proud to be \na part of the Budget Committee, and I congratulate the leadership of \nour Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, for finding a way in which we \ncould consider this legislation and to say that our priority is in \nhigher education and making quality higher education affordable to \nAmerican families.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have taken up that charge in \nbipartisan legislation that we have before us. It clearly moves us in \nthe right direction to help families in this country and to help our \nNation become more competitive.\n  This legislation provides $17 billion of additional college aid to \nstudents, the biggest increase since the GI bill. Pell grants that \ncurrently max out at a little over $4,300 will be increased to $5,100. \nIt also increases income levels, making more students qualified to \nreceive Pell grants, and caps the monthly loan payment at 15 percent of \ndiscretionary income.\n  This is a huge improvement on affordability for families. College \ngraduates now know they will be able to work after they graduate and \ncan go into careers they want to go into, knowing there will be a limit \nas to how much they have to repay on an annual basis from their \ndiscretionary income on their college loans. That is a major policy \nstatement we are making, that we want college graduates to go into \nfields where they can best contribute to our society.\n  It does a lot more. It protects working students. They are not \npenalized because they are working. That is an important policy. It \nencourages public service, with a loan forgiveness program for those \nwho go into public service and commit to a 10-year requirement. I think \nthat, again, is a policy that is important for our country--to say, \nyes, we do want young people to go into public service.\n  It is fiscally responsible. There are offsets to make sure we are not \nadding to the deficit. It holds colleges accountable. If the cost of a \ncollege exceeds its peers', there are ways the\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\npublic can put on pressure to keep college costs down.\n  This bill is very important. It helps families in Maryland. This bill \nwill provide $32 million in new grants next year to families in my \nState of Maryland, and, over the 5-year period, $273 million in new \ngrants.\n  For the historically Black colleges and universities, it will provide \n$5 million in new grants next year, and $40 million in new grants over \nthe 5 years of this legislation.\n  The bottom line: More families in Maryland are going to be able to \nafford to send their children to college. More children will be able to \ngo to their first preference, as far as the school they want to attend, \nwhich college or university, and will not be prohibited because of the \ncosts. There will be more opportunities for so many families that have \nbeen left out of the American dream in my State of Maryland and more \nMarylanders will be able to choose the type of career where they can \nbest add to their own self-fulfillment and to help our community.\n  This is an important bill. To me it speaks to the priorities of what \nthis Nation should stand for. I am proud to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I wish to first recognize my friend, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \non his efforts to produce this fine bill before us today. His efforts \nto improve higher education affordability and his willingness to make \ntough reforms in student lending are going to make a major difference \nto America's students.\n  One area in which this bill particularly excels is Pell grants. Pell, \nas we all know, is an important program. I have long supported it. I \ncommend my colleagues for making such a meaningful investment in the \nPell grant program.\n  We all know, whether you are middle class or poor, going to college \nthese days is a necessity almost. Yet it is harder and harder to afford \nit. This bill takes care of both the poor and the middle class in a \nvariety of ways, and makes it easier to go to college. That makes it \nbetter for the students and the prospective students who will be \nhelped. That will make it better for their families. It will also make \nit better for America.\n  The Pell grant program is a critical resource for financially needy \ncollege students. In the 2005-2006 academic year, 5.3 million of the \nNation's undergraduates received Pell grants. It makes an enormous \ndifference to students whose family incomes are very limited. Most have \nincomes of less than $20,000; over 1 million in New York alone. One of \nthe great things about America is that we provide ladders up. We are \nnot going to give you an escalator. You are going to have to work to \nclimb. But the Pell grant is a ladder. If you work hard and succeed and \ngo to college, it will be easier for you to go despite the high cost of \ntuition.\n  This aid and improvements to the loan programs are critical. In fact, \nthe typical student now graduates with $17,000 in Federal student loan \ndebt. That is a mountain of debt for a working adult, which is becoming \nincreasingly difficult to avoid. It is undeniable that sustaining a \ntalented, college-educated workforce is essential to our success in a \nglobal economy. College education has become almost a necessity in the \nworld our young people are facing, and yet it is priced as a luxury. \nYet, since 2001, tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges and \nuniversities have risen 41 percent. That is after inflation.\n  Families in New York are certainly struggling with education costs. \nEven after financial aid is taken into account, 33 percent of the \nmedian family income in New York is needed to pay for just 1 year of a \n4-year public college. The Federal student loan programs are a critical \nresource for America's students. Parents deserve a pat on their back \nwhen kids graduate from college, not bills and repayments that may \nbreak them.\n  Families trying to afford a college education need our help, whether \nthey be poor, working families, or families well into the middle class. \nThat is why I was proud to author a law that allows students to deduct \n$4,000 from their tuition. That is why I am proud to be a supporter of \nthis legislation, which helps students--poor students--with increased \nPell grants, significantly increased Pell grants, but also those who \ntake out Stafford loans. We limit how much they have to pay back to 15 \npercent of their disposable income. That will dramatically help those \nkids.\n  Democrats have said we are going to take America in a new direction. \nWe said we are committed to strengthening America's middle class. This \nbill does both of those things, and I am happy to support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nyielded time off the bill to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I begin by commending our leading sponsors \nand managers of this legislation, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, for \nthe leadership they provided in working on this important legislation. \nIt is especially important to most American families, because all of us \nnow are beginning to appreciate how expensive it is to receive a higher \neducation--tragically, I point out--and what a higher education can \nmean to more and more Americans--the quality of life, individual \nsuccess of our citizenry, but also the collective health of our country \nas well when we have a well-educated population.\n  I have often quoted the statistic made by Thomas Jefferson more than \n200 years ago that:\n\n       Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects \n     what never was and never can be.\n\n  Certainly as we enter this 21st century of global competitiveness, \nthe children of my State are not just competing with the children of \nMissouri, the home State of the Presiding Officer, but also competing, \nobviously, with children from all over the world, from Beijing, \nJohannesburg, Moscow, New Delhi--everywhere. This is going to be a very \ndifferent world for children growing up in the 21st century. The extent \nwe provide them with the tools and preparation necessary to compete and \nsucceed under these circumstances--very different from what most of us \nhave grown up with--is going to be extremely important, and the work \nthis body does in the coming days is extremely important.\n  I believe the National Science Foundation reported that the abrupt \nchanges that will come in this country will be staggering if we don't \ndo a better job in preparing ourselves for the educational challenges \nthat we will face in the 21st century. The cost of a college education \nobviously is a major factor here. It is vital for children and families \nand for America's long-term success. According to recent statistics, to \nput it in graphic terms, a person with a higher education, a college \neducation, their earning power jumps by almost $1 million. Not that \nthis ought to be the sole criterion whether someone gets a higher \neducation, but the earning power of an individual is substantially \nenhanced. There are other, more important issues than earning power, \nbut certainly the issues of individuals being able to do better, \nprovide for the long-term financial security of themselves and families \nis critically important. But there are issues that go beyond how much \nmoney you make that have to do with an education. We have to support \nthe institution we embrace as Americans, as Jefferson was suggesting \nback in the beginning of the 19th century. I would argue even more \nimportantly, the subtleties of a Bill of Rights will depend upon a \npopulation that embraces them, understands them, is willing to do \neverything they can to protect them so future generations will enjoy \nthe benefits of our form of governance as well.\n  Today's tuition levels are one of the great barriers to people going \non to higher education. I was stunned to learn, even in the last 2 \nmonths, the number of people in our country who completed high school, \nwere accepted\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\nfor higher education and did not go because of financial barriers. I am \ntold the numbers hover around 400,000 young people in this country. \nThat is a deeply troubling statistic. If we have as many as 400,000 \npeople in our country who cannot afford to go on to higher education \ndespite having done everything else well, then America truly will be \npaying a price in no time.\n  The average cost of attending a public university is roughly $13,000. \nThe average cost of attending a private university stands at $30,000. \nThat is the average. I know people here can cite numbers and statistics \nthat make that $13,000 on average seem small and the $30,000 on average \nper annum seem small.\n  But just think of that, $30,000, for one individual to attend 1 year \nof higher education; even at a public institution, it costs around \n$13,000. Then consider where the average family is in their income, and \nwhether they have more than one child and other obligations, obviously, \nas they try to prepare for their own long-term financial security; not \nworry about health care costs, including rising premium costs, if they \nhave health insurance. Additionally, the mortgage payments on their \nhome with adjustable rate mortgages, all of those factors crowding in \nas families try to do everything possible to see to it that their \nchildren can have the benefit of a higher education.\n  How many families have planned and spent years and years watching \ntheir children mature and grow, with the full expectation of all the \nadmonitions: Work hard, do your homework, get involved in things, learn \nas much as you can, pay attention, and all of that. Then, arriving at \nthe moment, where they do everything they are supposed to have done, \nthey say now we want to send you on to college, but we cannot afford to \ndo so. Or the loans are so expensive that you will be left with such \ndebt that the benefits of getting a higher education seem daunting, to \nput it mildly.\n  So imagine how daunting these levels are to a single parent or a \nfamily struggling on a minimum wage, for instance. You can even forget \nabout it at minimum wage. Clearly, we must do more to ensure that \nskyrocketing tuition does not put out of reach the dream and the \nability of obtaining a higher education.\n  That is why this bill is so important, maybe one of the most \nimportant bills. We have had long debates on immigration, long debates \non Iraq, all very important issues. But the long-term effects of what \nwe do on this legislation may have more to do with the well-being of \nour country than almost anything else in the coming days and weeks.\n  This bill will help us move toward a society where equal opportunity \nfor all is more than just high-blown rhetoric. We hear too often in \npublic speeches about doing something to make a difference in the lives \nof working families. There are a number of key provisions in this bill \nwhich accomplish those goals. For example, the bill caps the borrower's \nmonthly loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income. While \npayments are still costly at 15 percent, this is a major achievement.\n  This cap, if you will, will make repayment more manageable and \nborrowers will be less likely to default on their loans, which ought to \nbe important for the lending institutions.\n  This bill will also increase the auto zero threshold, as they call \nit, to allow additional low-income families to automatically claim zero \nexpected family contributions when filling out financial aid forms. \nThis change will allow students of these families to be eligible for \nincreased Pell grants.\n  Too often what we have done with the Pell grants is consider these \nother factors, such as expected family contribution. It drives a \nstudent out of the Pell grant qualifications when, frankly, what the \nfamily has to contribute is so little that it would amount to almost \nnothing, and yet would disqualify them from receiving the Pell grant \nfunding they need.\n  Furthermore, we have raised the cap on economic hardship deferments \nfrom 3 years to 6 years to ensure that students are not finally crushed \nin times of financial difficulty.\n  We have also strengthened our commitment to those who provide high-\nquality childcare services as well as all other public service \nemployees by offering them further opportunities for loan forgiveness.\n  One of the items contained in this bill that I am most happy about is \nthe increase in the Pell grant. I have been involved in this for many \nyears. It has been terribly frustrating over the last 6, 7, 8 years to \nwatch how little this administration is willing to support even modest \nincreases to the Pell Grant Program in our country.\n  The Pell grant in this bill will be raised to $5,100, in 2008 and up \nto $5,400 by the year 2012. Frankly, that is paltry. Candidly, I wish \nit were much higher, especially considering what a Pell grant used to \nprovide only a few short years ago toward the cost of a public \neducation. The grant used to cover 80 percent of the average tuition, \nfees, room and board at a public university.\n  Today the Pell grant covers 29 percent. So even with a Pell grant you \nare still looking at having to come up with roughly 70 percent of the \nadditional costs of that higher education when you take all of these \nfactors together.\n  As a result, low- to middle-income students who attend college are \nforced to finance their education with an ever-increasing percentage of \nloans, including private loans. This increase in the debt burden of \nstudents, in some cases, keeps them from going to college at all. As I \nmentioned the numbers earlier, somewhere close to 400,000 students are \nnot going on to higher education because of financial burdens.\n  This year alone, it is estimated that 400,000 high school graduates \nwho are prepared and ready to go to a 4-year college will be unable to \ngo because their families cannot afford it. While I continue to \nadvocate for even greater increases in the Pell grant, I commend my \ncolleagues for taking the first steps in getting us back to the 80-\npercent tuition coverage we achieved in 1975. I am pleased that \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi are doing that.\n  Until we reach the goal of 80 percent of students' tuition being \ncovered by Pell grants and other forms of Federal aid, many students \nwill be forced to turn to private and direct consumer and student \nloans, which are also not guaranteed by the Federal Government and are \nnot subject to loan limits.\n  In fact, the market for private student loans has grown significantly \nand is now the fastest growing segment of the $85 billion student loan \nindustry, as traditional sources of student aid have failed to keep \npace, with both the tremendous demand and the cost of higher education.\n\n  The underwriting for private loans is similar to that used for other \nforms of consumer credit. This means student borrowers, who usually \nhave little or no credit history, poor credit scores, or no parental \ncosigner, or whose parents have poor credit histories, will typically \npay higher rates than those with good credit histories and those with \nparental consigners with good credit.\n  In many regards, this model runs counter to the longstanding Federal \npurpose of student aid, which is targeting low-cost financial \nassistance to students with the greatest needs and those from the \nhumblest of backgrounds, one of the great success stories of our \ncountry.\n  We have heard the anecdote repeated hundreds and hundreds if not \nthousands of times of what a difference a college education has made \nthroughout history. We have tried desperately to make sure that no one \nin this country would be deprived of the opportunity of a higher \neducation because they or their family lacked the financial resources \nto do it.\n  If you had the drive, the ambition, the determination to get a higher \neducation, America stood ready to see to it that this pathway was \navailable to you. It has only been in the last few years that we have \nallowed a situation to develop where too often those young people and \nthose families are being told: Because you are in those circumstances, \nyou are not going to be able to get that higher education that you need \nand you deserve.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, 400,000 young people who will not go on \nto 4-year colleges, at a time when we enter a global marketplace, where \nwe need to have the best prepared generation America has ever produced, \nwe seem to be heading in the wrong direction.\n  This bill reverses that trend. Again, I commend my colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy particularly, and Senator Enzi,\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nfor their work in reversing this trend line. I hope it is the beginning \nof several steps that we take in the coming years.\n  I am further alarmed by reports uncovered by the Congressional and \nState investigators which detail aggressive and questionable private \nloan marketing practices and other unseemly industry practices, ranging \nfrom conflicts of interest to kickback schemes to consumer fraud.\n  I want to particularly commend Andrew Cuomo, the attorney general of \nthe State of New York, who has taken a leadership role in this \nnationally, in uncovering some of these schemes and kickbacks and other \nfinancial activities that have put these loans at even higher costs to \nstudents.\n  I was pleased we had him testify before the Banking Committee only a \nfew weeks ago to talk about this and the steps that we will be taking \nto try to correct some of those matters at the appropriate time.\n  I also was troubled by issues uncovered at a hearing that I just \nmentioned in the Senate Banking Committee that suggests some lenders \nmay be using as part of their loan underwriting criteria subjective \nrankings of academic institutions, and demographic information about \nthe students who attend these schools who, that be discriminatory and \ndisparately impact the quality and type of loans made available to \nstudents based on their race and socioeconomic background, in effect \nred-lining, where they are taking entire institutions, based on some \ndata and so forth they collect to deny individual students within those \ninstitutions the lower cost access to financial support.\n  That amounts to red-lining, as we saw in housing issues only a few \nyears ago. If that is the case, and we believe it may be, we will be \ntaking steps to correct that as well. Students seeking to finance the \ncost of a higher education should have access to the most competitive \nand affordable loans available through private student loan markets, \nwith appropriate consideration given to the credit worthiness of the \nstudent and any cosigner, without regard to the type of institution \nthat student chooses to attend.\n  Students should have full and timely access to all of the information \nthey need regarding the terms and conditions of private student loans \nin order to make a well-informed decision regarding the financing of \ntheir educational needs.\n  Given the growth of this market and its enormous impact on the \neducational and economic future of student borrowers, I view it as \nimperative that we address these issues as part of the consideration of \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We should ensure that \nthe market is well regulated and accessible and affordable as an \nalternative source of higher education funding for those who need the \nloans in our country.\n  We can do that, in my view, by prohibiting industry practices like \nrevenue sharing and co-branding that present conflicts of interest by \nproviding student borrowers with better, more timely disclosure \ninformation so that students understand the rates, the terms, and the \nconditions of the loans they are going to receive.\n  We must work to make sure that private student lending practices are \ntransparent so the public can be confident that students and families \nare obtaining the most competitive and affordable student loans with \nthe fairest terms.\n  I plan on working with my friend and colleague, Senator Shelby of \nAlabama, who is the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, and \nall members of that committee for that matter, on this bill. We are in \nthe process of doing that now. I would say under the circumstances that \nthis bill is coming up, we would be prohibited, under Senate rules, \nfrom raising that issue on this particular vehicle.\n  I do not in any way suggest that what they are doing is not the right \nthing to be doing, it is the right thing to be doing, but our bill that \ndeals specifically with student financing and lending institutions will \nbe presented at an appropriate time, possibly when the full higher \neducation bill is before us--but we are determined on a bipartisan \nbasis to address some of these issues, if not all of them, that I have \nraised briefly this afternoon.\n\n  Indeed, this bill before us provides all students with the tools that \nmake it possible to access and afford a postsecondary education. If we \nare serious about leaving no child behind, as I know all of us are as a \nnation, then we must reinvigorate our commitment to higher education, \nto ensure that students have access to a higher education, to a college \neducation.\n  If America is to remain the land of opportunity that all of us want \nit to be, then we must ensure that college is available to all of our \ncitizenry. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this long \noverdue legislation.\n  I often cite the fact that in our Nation's history, it has always \nbeen a stunning commentary about our country, as it has evolved and \nmatured over the years, that one of the very first bills that ever \npassed the United States Congress in the 18th century, in the early \n1790s, was the Northwest Ordnance. My colleague from Colorado probably \nis more familiar than I, given he represents a State in the far West, \nbut the whole idea being to set aside land for educational purposes.\n  The Morrill Act, which was adopted in the mid-1860s--in fact, right \nin the middle of the Civil War, Senator Morrill of Vermont offered \nlegislation to create land grant colleges. So even in the midst of this \ngreat contest to determine whether we would remain one Nation, one \nUnion, the Congress of the United States, under the leadership of \nAbraham Lincoln and Senator Morrill of Vermont, fought to create land \ngrant colleges. The University of Connecticut is one of those \ninstitutions that provides incredible opportunities for young people \nall across the Nation, again understanding the value of education to \nour country.\n  So in the 18th and the 19th centuries, and then of course in the 20th \ncentury, we saw, even before World War II was concluded, the Congress \nof the United States passed the GI bill, which provided, of course, a \nwhole generation of service men and women coming back from that war the \nability to get an educational opportunity.\n  That investment in the GI bill has been repaid to the U.S. Government \ntenfold because of the earning power of the individuals who went \nthrough the GI bill who were able to improve their economic \nopportunity. The resources they paid back into our country have dwarfed \nthe cost of that legislation.\n  Today we do not even think about legislation like that, given the \ncost, regrettably, I might add, because when you consider that \n400,000--think of that, 400,000 of our young people in this country \ntoday are not going to go on to a higher education because of cost. \nThat is, 400,000 young people who did everything they were asked to do, \nI presume, having been accepted on to higher education--will not get \nthat chance because we do not have the resources or the will to come up \nwith a system to make that possible.\n  We talk about being a major competitor nation in the 21st century. I \npromise you, our major competitors around the world are not making that \nmistake. They will create the opportunities for their young people to \nget that education. This bill is a major step to reverse that trend in \nour country.\n  There are other things we need to do, such as a proposal regarding \nprivate lenders that we will be offering shortly. I wish I could offer \nit today but, it would be subject to at least two points of order. So \nit would require a 60-vote margin to deal with it. We probably don't \nhave a number of Members willing to go that far, I regret to say that. \nSo I will wait for another opportunity in the coming weeks to do so. I \nwill do that with Senator Shelby as we work on this together.\n  But my hope is, shortly we will have an opportunity to present \nlegislation that will close up some of these abusive practices that \nhave contributed to rising costs and depriving families and their \nchildren of having the best possible arrangements for the student loans \nthey need to get a higher education.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, many years ago, President Lyndon B. \nJohnson said:\n\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\n\n       We have entered an age in which education is not just a \n     luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has \n     become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in \n     this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered \n     the century of the educated man.\n\n  Those are important words to ponder as we consider the legislation \nnow before the Senate. I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their \nextraordinary leadership on this issue as well as so many others, and \nfor the opportunity I have to speak today.\n  I am here to talk about an initiative that revolutionized higher \neducation in America, and that is the Pell grant. Inside this desk at \nwhich I stand are the names of Senators who have occupied it before me. \nI can actually open this drawer, take out the stuff in the drawer, and \nin the drawer I can see the names of Senators who have gone before me \nat the bottom. Here is John O. Pastore of Rhode Island, who served with \ngreat distinction and was my last Democratic predecessor in the Senate. \nIt is hard to see because he was not a proud man and wouldn't write it \nin great big letters, but I can see, very carefully written, ``Pell, \nRI,'' Senator Pell of Rhode Island. It is a remarkable thing for me to \nbe here in this context because Senator Claiborne Pell and his wife \nNuala have long been cherished friends. Senator Pell is both a mentor \nto me and a constant reminder of the positive impact an individual \nperson can have through public service.\n  I am so glad the Senator Salazar from Colorado is presiding at this \nparticular moment because I wish to describe to everyone a remarkable \nevent that I was privileged to witness a few years ago. I was at an \nevent in Rhode Island with a number of Senators, including the Senator \nSalazar. During that event, Senator Pell came to the tent we were all \nunder in his wheelchair. As many of our colleagues know, he habitually \nuses a wheelchair now. The group became very quiet as he entered out of \nthe respect we in Rhode Island have for this great and dedicated public \nservant. The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, went over to Senator \nPell, took his hand and shook it and told him: I would not have been \nable to attend college if it had not been for the support of the Pell \ngrant program. Now, I am standing here before you today, a United \nStates Senator, thanks to the vision and foresight you showed years \nago, your vision that every American should be able to get a college \neducation.\n  It was an unforgettable moment then; it gives me goosebumps to \nrecount it now. It happened because Senator Pell understood the \ndifference that higher education could make in the lives of America's \nyoung people--from the Ken Salazar, who now serves with such \ndistinction in this great institution, to those who will seize the \nopportunities of America in the decades to come.\n  Today, the program that bears Senator Pell's name is in our hands.\n  Each spring, high school seniors in Rhode Island and across the \ncountry wait anxiously for acceptance letters from the colleges of \ntheir choice. I have been through this experience recently with my \ndaughter and all of her classmates. But for many American families, \nalmost as important as those letters from the admissions office are the \nletters from the financial aid office. I have heard from so many \nfamilies in Rhode Island who look ahead to the day when their children \nwill go off to college and seize their bright futures, but wonder how \nthey will ever be able to afford it without some form of financial aid, \neither from the institution itself or from the Federal Government.\n  As the cost of higher education soars higher, up 35 percent in 5 \nyears, students and parents face ever more difficult financial choices. \nMany go into debt, not only through Federal student loan programs, but \nincreasingly to private lenders. Many shoulder enormous burdens of debt \nthat can stay with them throughout their lives. When that high school \nsenior receives a Pell grant, money that does not have to be paid back, \nthe dream of college becomes more of a reality.\n  Since the Pell grant program began, these grants have been a critical \nform of Federal aid that has helped literally millions of young people \nacross this country achieve a level of education that was previously \nout of their reach. Unfortunately, Pell grants now represent only 33 \npercent, one-third, of the total cost of a 4-year public university. \nTwenty years ago, a Pell grant would have paid 60 percent of that cost.\n  As higher education for Americans has become more and more important, \nnot just to their individual opportunities but also to our national \neconomy and competitiveness--remember the words of Lyndon Johnson so \nmany years ago: ``We have truly entered the century of the educated \nman''--we need education to compete. Through that time Pell grants have \nactually lost value versus the actual cost of college. But the support \nfor low-income students through the Pell grants has slid away over the \nyears, until it is now only 33 percent of the cost of a public \nuniversity. So we must recommit ourselves to making college affordable \nto all students.\n  The Promise grants created by the Higher Education Access Act will \nguarantee that students who qualify for the maximum Pell grant will \nreceive $5,100 for the 2008-2009 academic year and $5,400 by 2011. For \nus in Rhode Island, this will mean $10 million in additional grant \nfunds for Rhode Island students next year and, over the next 5 years, \n$86 million. It will also expand family access to Pell grants, better \nreflecting today's economic realities.\n  Senator Pell is part of a strong tradition of Rhode Island Senators \nwho have committed themselves to making higher education accessible to \nall Americans. This tradition is proudly carried on by Senator Pell's \ndirect successor in this Chamber, my friend, Senator Jack Reed, a \nchampion of higher education access and affordability. I admire his \nwork to provide more Pell grant aid for students who need it the most--\nthose who work and those whose family income is under $30,000.\n  We see in this Chamber and across the country every day--every year \nin September when a new group of students go off to college--the \ntremendous influence the work of Senator Pell has had on the fabric of \nour Nation and on the lives of the millions of young Americans who have \nused Pell grants to make their dream of higher education a reality.\n  I applaud this important legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi have worked hard together in a wonderful bipartisan spirit to put \ntogether legislation that will advance the strength of our country and \nthe opportunity for our young people. This is a vital step and an \nimportant investment we must make in the future of America's young \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my friend from Rhode Island to take note of the \nfact that we are conscious of Senator Pell's great contributions to \nAmerica. The Pell grants have helped a lot of young people in \nunfortunate circumstances have a chance to succeed in life. It is a \nwonderful legacy. I know you see him from time to time, and I hope you \nwill tell him we haven't forgotten the great contribution he made to \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will be sure to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I stand here today because of a number of things. I am \nfortunate to have a good family, friends, and role models, fortunate to \nhave good luck in politics, and fortunate that in 1957, the Soviets \nlaunched a satellite. It is one of the reasons I am standing here. The \nsatellite was known as Sputnik. Sputnik was the first satellite \nlaunched into outer space, and the United States, which thought it was \nthe most powerful Nation in the world, stepped back on its heels, \ncouldn't believe it: the Soviets had launched a satellite, and we knew \nthey had nuclear weapons. A panic spread across Washington, DC, and the \nNation: The Soviets are winning the space race; they could conquer the \nUnited States; if they can find a way to put that nuclear weapon into a \nsatellite, we could never knock it down.\n  What did Congress do? It did something that was breathtaking and \nunprecedented. It decided the best way to fight the Soviets was to make \nsure we had a force that could equal the Soviets, not just a military \nforce--we always had a great military--but a force of private citizens \nwith the training and knowledge to compete with the Soviet Union and \nevery other country that might be our enemy in the future.\n  There was an obscure Congressman who came up with an idea: Why \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\nthe Federal Government loan money to college students? Nobody thought \nof that before. It was radical. Some said it was too big, the \nGovernment was getting too involved. But he prevailed in the fear and \nthe climate in the post-Sputnik era.\n\n  So they created something called the National Defense Education Act. \nIt was in place in the early 1960s. The National Defense Education Act \nsaid to America's high school graduates: Go to college. Get educated. \nWe need you in America for our future, for our defense.\n  Well, there were a number of young people who heard that message, and \nI was one of them. So I borrowed money through the National Defense \nEducation Act to go to college and law school, at a time when I could \nnever have afforded to do it otherwise. The terms were very reasonable. \nUnder the terms of the National Defense Education Act, you borrowed \nmoney throughout your academic career, and then, 1 year after \ngraduation, you had to start paying it back. So they gave you a year to \nget back on your feet. The interest rate was capped at 3 percent. Think \nabout that. So I paid it back over 10 years, even though when I \ngraduated I did not think it was possible. It turned out to be fairly \nsimple because with my law degree and college education, I made a \nlittle bit more money, so I could pay back my student loan.\n  Now, repeat that story millions of times over, and you have an \nexplanation as to why America is where it is today. We decided to \ninvest as a nation in making certain we had a new generation of college \ngraduates. We took higher education, which had been fairly elite to \nthat point in our history, and democratized it. It was no longer just \nthe smartest kids and the richest kids and the sons and daughters of \nalumni who were admitted to colleges and universities. Now, this kid \nfrom East Saint Louis, IL, whose mother and father went as far as the \neighth grade, had his chance, and many more like me. Well, I would like \nto think, as I stand here today, that Government program paid off not \nonly for me but for this Nation, and that story is repeated over and \nover again.\n  But now what has happened? What has happened is that the cost of \neducation has gone up dramatically. I took a look at what I paid at \nGeorgetown University in the early 1960s, and I would be embarrassed to \ntell you the numbers. It did not take much to get through a university \nin those days. You could borrow $1,000 a year and make it through if \nyou worked during the school year and worked during the summer and were \ncareful with your expenses.\n  That is, of course, not even close to the reality of today. Whether \nit is a public university or private university, the cost has gone up \nsubstantially. Students, as good as they are, when admitted to those \nschools understand that if they do not receive a lot of financial \nassistance, they will have to borrow some money. Borrowing that money, \nheaping up that debt, means as they graduate they have a burden they \nnever anticipated--not the burden I faced back in 1969 but a much \ngreater burden today for the cost of higher education.\n  Then the scene changed. We went from the National Defense Education \nAct--a Government program with a fixed rate of interest--and decided: \nWell, let's let the private sector get into this. And they did. First, \nwe had an organization called Sally Mae, which was created as kind of a \nquasi-Government operation, which was going to be a transition between \nthe private sector and public sector. Well, over the years, Sally Mae \nevolved into a completely private corporation. It is now one of if not \nthe largest student loan lender in America. It is also one of the most \nprofitable businesses on the New York Stock Exchange. Think of it. This \nlender, loaning money to our children and the next generation of \nAmericans, is flush with cash. They are making a lot of money. They are \ndoing it, quite honestly, at the expense of these kids. A lot of these \nyoung people sign up for loans, and they have no idea what they are \nsigning up for.\n  If you think I am being critical of them, I will also quickly add \nthat very few of us flip over the monthly credit card statement to read \nthe fine print about what we are getting into. We just trust everything \nis going to work out.\n  Well, for a lot of young students, they sign up for loans which \ndramatically increase in cost. For example, it is not unusual for a \nstudent to borrow money in his freshman year and then be told: Don't \nworry, you don't have to pay anything back while you are still in \nschool. The student breathes a sigh of relief and continues on and \nborrows some money the next year. But many times, the loans they are \nborrowing are increasing in cost each year while they are not making a \npayment. The $5,000 you borrow in your freshman year that you do not \npay back for 3 or 4 years turns out to be $10,000 at graduation. Now, \nmultiply that times four, and you get an idea what students are into. \nSo the debt students carry out of colleges and universities is much \nhigher today. Companies such as Sally Mae are very profitable, at the \nexpense of these students.\n  Now, the companies--like Sally Mae--argue: Could you think of a worse \nrisk than a recent graduate from high school? We are willing to run \nthat risk of loaning money to that high school graduate, uncertain as \nto whether they will graduate or ever find a job. So you have to give \nus a break.\n  I will concede that point. But when you take a look at the actual \ncost of the loan, it is pretty clear this industry is doing more than \ncovering its risk; it is making an awful lot of money.\n  Senator Kennedy has been our leader on this issue. This bill we have \nbefore us today is a bill which will dramatically change the kinds of \nstudent loans which will be available and student assistance available \nto students across America. I think it is long overdue. We need to make \ncertain we have money available for young people to go to school, under \nterms where they can afford to repay. That is part of this bill--a big \npart of this bill.\n  The average student in America today is graduating with nearly \n$20,000 in debt. In many places, that is more than a downpayment on a \nhome. So how do we expect our kids to prosper if they spend the next 10 \nto 20 years digging out of a financial hole?\n  The Pell grants, which Senator Whitehouse just referred to, are \nbasically scholarships given to the lowest income students. It is the \nright thing to do to give these kids a fighting chance. Until the \nchanges offered in this bill we are considering today, the maximum Pell \ngrant did not change for 5 years. What happened to the cost of college \neducation in 5 years? It went up. So students trying to make up the \ndifference had to borrow more money.\n  Interest rates on a program called the Stafford loans went up last \nyear. In fact, last year President Bush signed a bill passed in the \nRepublican Congress which increased the interest rates on student \nloans. Think about that. Congratulations, recent graduate, your \nGovernment has just given you a bigger mortgage to pay in terms of your \nstudent loan. That is what we did.\n\n  We also limited the opportunity of students to consolidate their \nloans and bargain them into lower interest rates. My wife and I own a \nhome in Springfield, IL. When a good mortgage rate comes along, we talk \nabout refinancing our home. Most people do. Students, under the bill \nsigned by President Bush, unfortunately, were limited as to how and \nwhen they could consolidate their loans and look for lower interest \nrates.\n  Even with these Pell grants, Stafford loans, work income, and, if a \nstudent is lucky enough, scholarships, many young people are forced to \nturn to private student loans to pay for college.\n  What about private student loans? I had a couple come into my office \na few weeks ago. They are in the private student loan business. They \nsaid they were just trying to fill in the gaps that the Pell grants and \nthe Government loans did not take care of.\n  So I asked them: ``What is the interest rate you charge on these \nstudent loans?''\n  She said: ``oh, it's about 8 percent.''\n  I said: ``Now, is that the highest rate?''\n  ``No. The highest rate is 19 percent.''\n  Quite a difference. Think about your home mortgage at 8 percent as \nopposed to 19 percent. Think about the possibility you will ever pay \nthat loan off.\n  Oh, incidentally, something happened on the floor of the Senate that \npeople did not notice. Senator Kennedy did. Remember when we had the \nbankruptcy bill up. Do you recall what we\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\ndid in the bankruptcy bill? Let's go back in history for a minute.\n  There was a time when some students who had borrowed money from the \nGovernment to go to school waited until they graduated and filed \nbankruptcy, discharging their student loans in bankruptcy, never paying \nthem back. We said: Wait a minute, if the Government is going to pay \nfor your education, then you have an obligation to pay it back because \nthat money goes to another student. It gives another student an \nopportunity. So we said under the bankruptcy law that you cannot \ndischarge a Government student loan in bankruptcy.\n  Well, in the last bankruptcy bill, the people who are in the \ncompanies with private student loans put themselves in the same \ncategory. So if a student, unknowingly, signs up for a 19-percent \ncollege loan and then gets out of school and has an illness, ends up \nthey cannot find a job, and files for bankruptcy, they are stuck with \nnot only a Government loan but these private companies and their loans. \nThey will haunt that student to the grave. That person cannot discharge \nthat loan in bankruptcy under any conditions except the most extreme \nfinancial circumstances.\n  This bill is long overdue. According to the College Board, tuition, \nfees, and room and board at public 4-year schools have risen by 42 \npercent over the past 5 years--from $9,000 to almost $13,000.\n  I wish to make that point. I have fought, as Senator Kennedy has, for \nbetter terms in student loans, larger Pell grants, more direct loans \nfrom colleges to students to take the lending institution and the \nmiddle man out of the operation, and I will continue to do it. But make \nno mistake, we are shoveling against the tide with this legislation. If \ncolleges and universities decide: Well, if they are going to loan them \nmore money at lower interest rates, we will just raise our cost--they \nhave been doing that year after year after year. So my message, in \nvoting for this bill, to colleges and universities is that we certainly \nexpect them to use restraint and good judgment in terms of what they \nare charging students today.\n  Let me give you one footnote to that. Twenty-five percent of the debt \ncollege students take out of college is because of expenses at the \nbookstore. If you as a student sign up for a course, and you are about \nto take the course, you notice there are a handful of textbooks you \nhave to buy. You go down to your bookstore to buy the textbooks and \nfind out that textbook, which is only for sale at this bookstore, costs \n$100. Not unusual. Well, it turns out in any given semester a student \ncould end up with hundreds of dollars of debts just for textbooks.\n  I made a proposal, introduced a bill, which we will bring up at a \nlater time when the Higher Education Act comes before us, that \nbasically requires colleges and universities to disclose to students \nthe textbooks and the costs as part of their course offerings. Oh, \ntextbook publishers scream bloody murder: How could you do that? How \ncould you require us to disclose the costs of our textbooks before the \nstudents sign up for the course? And the professors say that inhibits \nacademic freedom. No, it does not. They can pick any textbook they \nwant.\n  We do something else: We also require them to put in what is known as \nthe ISBN code. This is a universal code for a book. Why? So the \nstudents can go shopping on the Internet. Maybe they can find that \ntextbook a lot cheaper. I do not think that is a bad idea in this day \nof Internet sales. Well, we do not have it as part of this bill, but we \nwill offer it as part of the next bill. But colleges and universities \nwhich are dedicated to bringing down costs for students ought to take a \nlook at not only tuition and room and board but the cost in the school \nbookstores as well.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is considering this Higher Education \nAccess Act today. It is going to help a lot of students.\n  Many of us have been calling for an increase in the Pell grant for \nyears, none more vocally than the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell grant for low-income and working-\nclass kids covered about 55 percent of the cost of a 4-year public \neducation. Today, the maximum of $4,050 covers 30 percent--almost half \nof what it covered a few years ago. The bill on the floor today will \nraise the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year and $5,400 by the year \n2011. I am glad the Senate defeated an earlier amendment which would \nhave reduced that amount. I think the Senate showed good judgment, \nunderstanding the Pell grant is really absolutely essential for a lot \nof kids from low-income families.\n  Over the next 6 years, this bill will provide over $850 million in \nnew grant aid to students in my State of Illinois. This will do a great \ndeal to help the neediest students get a college education. This bill \nwill cap monthly student loan payments at 15 percent of a student's \ndiscretionary income. I talked to Senator Kennedy about this earlier, \nand I believe he is moving in the right direction, so that students \nwill realize that when they graduate they will not have to pay any \nmore, each year, than 15 percent of their discretionary income. That is \ngoing to give them some relief in terms of their repayments and give \nthem some opportunities to choose jobs they really want.\n\n  I have run into students--and I bet the Presiding Officer has too--\nwho really want to be teachers, and we need them as teachers. But when \nthey end up with $20,000 to $30,000 in student loan debts, they take a \njob which pays a little bit more so they can have a basic life and \nstill pay off their student loans. This bill is going to help students \nunderstand they won't have to repay more than 15 percent of their \ndiscretionary income if they work in certain professions that have \npublic importance to us.\n  I can't tell you the number of college graduates who have come to me \nasking for relief from these high monthly student loan repayments. Many \nof them are just starting careers and barely scraping through. So I \nthink this is a positive aspect of the bill. It will cover teachers. It \nwill cover those who go into public defense, prosecutors, legal aid \nattorneys, and many others. It will accomplish all of this, not only to \nthe benefit of these students but to the benefit of America.\n  We are actually reducing the deficit with this bill, I might add, \nthrough cuts to the already substantial Federal subsidies to the \nlenders. The lenders are going to claim we have gone too far. A recent \nstudy shows that lenders spent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \ntheir subsidy on benefits for borrowers. That means the average \nborrower saves only $118 through lender benefits. Let's not forget that \nthese are the same lenders who many times have been involved in the \nscandals we have been reading about in the newspapers; lenders like \nSallie Mae, whose former CEO Albert Lord used his generous compensation \npackage to build a private, personal, 18-hole golf course in suburban \nMaryland. Well, it is time for Mr. Lord and his ilk to step aside. It \nis time for Congress to take control of the situation again. It is time \nto be more sensitive to the students and their families than to the \nwealthy owners of these limited corporations.\n  An investment in education is an investment in our Nation. The cost \nof education is a hurdle for many students, and we can help them clear \nthat hurdle with this bill. If America is going to succeed in the 21st \ncentury, if our college graduates are going to be ready for that \nchallenge, we need to make certain they have the best education. \nBright, hard-working students deserve the best opportunity to receive \nan education, and we can't afford not to invest in them. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for the Higher Education Access Act.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  I would like to say one final word, and I know the Presiding Officer \nis very sensitive to this issue as well. I don't think it will be \npossible on this bill, but I will look for every bill I can to \nintroduce legislation known as the DREAM Act.\n  Today in America, we have tens of thousands of high school graduates \nin undocumented status. These are people, young people, who came to \nAmerica as children, brought here by their parents; many of them have \nnever known another country. They have grown up here. They have \ngraduated high school, and they want to be part of America's future. \nBut because they don't have a legal status in this country, they are \nuncertain as to whether\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\nthey can go to college and if they graduate, whether they can even work \nhere. At a time when we are importing tens of thousands of workers into \nAmerica legally, with visas, to supplement our workforce, why would we \nturn these young people away?\n  So for the past 5 years, I have been fighting for this DREAM Act. I \nhave had the strong bipartisan support of many of my colleagues, and I \nthank them for it. It is basic. If you came to America before the age \nof 16, if you have been here at least 5 years, if you graduated high \nschool, and if you are able to complete 2 years of college or enlist in \nour military, you will have a path to legalization. That is what it \nboils down to.\n  I have met a lot of these young people. I know the Presiding Officer \nhas too. These are some of the best and brightest, the most idealistic \nand energetic people you are ever going to meet. They are young people \nwho want to be part of America's future.\n  I have talked to the sponsor of this legislation. I am not sure we \ncan put this as an amendment on this bill, but I wish to remind my \ncolleagues that as we speak about college education and the future of \nAmerica, we should understand there is a group out there yearning for \nan opportunity to make this a better Nation through the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator be good enough to yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator speak very \neloquently today about the elements of the legislation and his outline \nof his strong, continuing, ongoing support for the DREAM Act which I \nwelcome the opportunity to support and will work very closely with him \nto try to achieve this very important legislation.\n  I have listened to him also talk about the division that is in \nAmerica--whether we are growing as one country or whether we are \nfinding out that we are really growing as different nations.\n  The Senator remembers very well, in the postwar period, if you look \nback at the economics, the lowest income, the medium income, the \nhighest income families--all of them moved along together. They all \nimproved together. We had the GI Bill which, over a 6-year period, \ninvested the equivalent of a third of the total Federal budget for the \nyear 1951. That is the kind of priority we had as a nation in terms of \neducation, and many believe it is the principal cause of the creation \nof the great middle class in our country, the backbone and the strength \nof our democracy, our economy, and our national security.\n  I listened to the Senator talk about the DREAM Act, but I have also \nlistened to him talk about the divisions that exist in our country. \nThis is a chart here, which is really self-explanatory, which shows \nthat low-income students are far less likely to graduate from college. \nThis is what is happening today. As one who is committed to seeing that \nwe are going to be one country with one history and one destiny, does \nit not underline the point that we have important responsibilities to \ntry to ensure that all students, regardless of family income, can earn \na college degree?\n  I am interested in, if we are really talking about the divisions that \nexist in our country--we see them so dramatically in the area of \neducation--whether we have some real responsibility to try to equalize \nthose disparities, and would he not agree with me that if we don't do \nthat, we are going to be a nation that is going to continue to be a \ndivided country with all of the implications that it has in terms of \nfairness and equality and opportunity for the future?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. When \nyou consider the fact that low-income students in America today and \nminority students are about 50 percent likely to graduate from high \nschool--many of them drop out--they are out there. They are somewhere \nin America. They haven't reached their full potential and may never.\n  What the Senator shows us with this chart is that those who are lucky \nenough to get started toward earning a college degree--and the lower \nincome categories have the toughest time--you have to believe, as I do, \nthat many of those students who don't finish is because of financial \nreasons. These are students who are struggling and doing their best. I \nhave seen them.\n  I can recall a young student in Springfield attending Lincoln Land \nCommunity College. She was a young woman who had a child while she was \nin high school, but she was determined that she was going to make it \nthrough college. She used to take her baby with her on a bus out to our \ncommunity college, which is not in town but in the outskirts, and she \nhad to get the last bus back into town every night. When I think about \nthe sacrifice she was making to take that baby and catch that bus and \nmake it out there, you knew how much she wanted it, but you also knew \nthat she was right on the edge financially at any given moment, whether \nshe could complete her education.\n  So what you are doing in this bill in giving these students a helping \nhand is not only going to mean more college graduates but, to the point \nthe Senator raised, it is going to result in a fairer society in \nAmerica, more opportunity, so that the disparity between incomes, the \nhighest and lowest levels in America, is reduced. I thank the Senator \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator may remember the \nextraordinary work that was done in this area of education by a former \nmentor of his and a very close personal friend of ours, Senator Simon \nof Illinois. Whenever we had the debate on higher education, he always \nreminded me of the great debate we had in this country in 1960.\n  One of the principal issues that divided the two political parties at \nthat time was the issue of education. At that time, Senator Kennedy \nbelieved that what we ought to have in higher education is a program \nthat is going to give assurance to every young person in this country \nthat if they have the ability to gain entrance into any college, that \nregardless of their resources, they were going to be able to put \ntogether a student aid package that would permit them to go where their \ntalent leads them. He believed the country was a lesser country unless \nwe were going to have that opportunity. Talent was going to be lost in \nterms of our Nation and our people. That was basically the philosophy \nbehind the Higher Education Act.\n  As my colleague knows, two years ago the maximum Pell grant covered \n55 percent of the costs at a public four-year college. Of course, that \nhas completely been reversed in recent years, with the resulting \ndisparity we see here. The maximum Pell grant covers just one third of \nthe costs today.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that we ought to at least set the \ngoal that ideal we had at the time of the passage of the act; that is, \nany young person who has the ability and wants to work, can put \ntogether whatever their family can contribute and receive the aid they \nneed to attend college. But we ought to, as an ideal and as a nation, \nmove toward that particular goal where we are going to give assurance \nto every young person that if they work hard, they can afford a higher \neducation. This is a matter of national priority; our belief in young \npeople, our belief in their families, and our belief in the future of \nthis country demands it.\n  I was always impressed by Congressman Silvio Conte, who is a \nRepublican, and like so many people in this body--we heard from Senator \nMurray who talked about members of her family who are all professionals \nnow who got the Pell grants, and Senator Cantwell, a very successful \nentrepreneur before she entered the Senate.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that this is an investment we should \nbe involved in as a matter of national priorities, and that we ought to \nbe, as a country and as a people, really leading the way toward having \na goal of providing that kind of help and assistance to our country as \nwell as to the individuals?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly agree. When someone like Bill Gates of \nMicrosoft comes and says: You have to give me visas so I can bring in \nforeign-trained engineers for my expanding information technology \ncompany, it really is a challenge to us. Why aren't we producing \nengineers here at home?\n  It comes to this point: Will there be the kind of support, financial \nsupport for those promising students to get into math and science and \nengineering\n\n[[Page S9554]]\n\nor will they be discouraged at an early age and give up on it?\n  The same thing is true--and I know the Senator from Massachusetts is \nwell aware of it--when it comes to the field of nursing. We are just a \nfew years away from being 1 million nurses short of what we need in \nAmerica. As the baby boomer generation reaches a point where it needs \nmore medical help, there will be fewer medical professionals available. \nWe don't want to see that happen. It compromises the quality of care \nand also puts pressure on the United States to poach--to go after \nmedical professionals in developing countries to attract them to the \nUnited States.\n  So when we talk about this investment in education, it means a lot to \nthe high-tech industry. It means a lot to every American in terms of \nbasic health care. It means a great deal when it comes to the teachers \nwe need.\n  I had the university presidents, several of them from Illinois, in my \noffice just a few weeks ago, and they talked about math and science \nskills, how that is the one thing that troubles them as they look \nahead, that our students aren't keeping up in the world in terms of \ndeveloping their math and science skills. How do they reach that point? \nBetter classroom teachers, which means more young people graduating \ncollege, going into the teaching profession, who can make that call \nbecause they are not worried about paying back their debt.\n  It all works together. If we start cutting back in terms of higher \neducation, arguing we can't afford it, we will pay for it for decades \nto come.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, the Senator remembers that this \nbody passed the COMPETE Act, which was legislation that came out of our \ncommittee--Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, Senator Alexander from \nTennessee were leaders on that bill--which had very strong, virtually \nuniversal support here, which gave focus in terms of encouragement in \nthe areas of math and science and engineering. This is something, I \nknow the Senator agrees, we ought to make sure we are going to invest \nin.\n  When we passed the GI bill, over those 6 years, we produced 450,000 \nengineers--450,000. We had three Presidents of the United States who \nused the GI bill, three Justices who served on the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, and several Senators who were educated under the GI \nbill. This is investing in education.\n  We know what to do. The question is whether we have the will and \nwhether the American people are going to be responding to this \nchallenge.\n  I thank the Senator. I think we have work to do in this area. We have \nbeen able to find additional resources for the downpayment toward \nclosing these gaps, and I give the assurance to the Senator that we \nwill work closely with him to make sure we get the DREAM Act achieved \nand passed and we will also continue to eliminate the disparities in \nthese charts.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I encourage my colleagues to support \npassage of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I guess the parliamentary procedure is \nthat I can speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \ngiving me the opportunity to speak. I wish to say a few words--general \nwords--about the student loan program in our country.\n  The Direct Loan program--the program by which the Federal Government \nitself loans money to college students across our country--began when I \nwas the U.S. Secretary of Education, and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts was chairman of the Health and Education Committee. We \nhad a Democratic Congress and a Republican President named Bush, \nalthough a different Bush. Senator Kennedy will remember the Deputy \nSecretary was David Kearns, a very distinguished former business \nleader, head of Xerox. Bill Ford was chairman of the House Education \nCommittee. Chairman Ford very much wanted a so-called Direct Loan \nProgram. He wanted the Government to loan money to students. The law we \nhave today is named after him. He made a great contribution to our \nNation's education.\n  I thought about the Direct Loan Program at the time and, generally \nspeaking, I wasn't in favor of it. There were three reasons for my \nskepticism then. One was that it seemed to me the enormity of the \nprogram would mean the Government--our Federal Government--would \nsuddenly find itself being a massive bank. Ever since Andrew Jackson, \nthe idea of a big national bank had been something our country hasn't \nliked. We let the private sector have the banks. The problem with the \ngovernment operating as a bank was we would have to borrow a lot of \nmoney and add to the Federal deficit.\n  Second was the size of the student loan program. Millions and \nmillions of students--one-half of our college students across the \ncountry--have a Federal loan or grant to help them pay for college, and \nmay choose among any of the accredited colleges. We have about 6,000 \ninstitutions that qualify or receive students with these loans. So it \nis a massive administrative challenge.\n  I could not see how the Federal Government--the department I was in \ncharge of at that time, the U.S. Department of Education--with the \npersonnel, as dedicated as they are--could do a better job than the \nprivate sector on such a big administrative challenge.\n  Finally, while I didn't know at the time, I didn't believe there was \na way for the Federal Government, with its built-in efficiencies, to do \na less expensive job of managing this massive program than the private \nsector could. I was relying on my gut instinct, which is generally that \nif you can find it in the Yellow Pages, the Government probably ought \nnot to be doing it. So I came down on the side of having a federally \nbacked student loan program, a generous one, which has grown since \nthen, but that was managed by the private sector.\n  The Government can do a great many things well. Regulation is one of \nthe things it does well. One of the things it generally doesn't do as \nwell--with the exception of the military--is manage large programs. The \nresult of that debate was the creation of the Direct Loan Program. In \nthe end, I saw that as an advantage for the country because it at least \nwould give us the opportunity to measure the way the Government would \nadminister a loan program against the way the private sector did it. In \nother words, it was something we could look at and compare. That is the \nway we have operated over the last 15, 16 years that this has been in \nplace.\n  Now, I have not changed my view on the so-called Government program, \nor the Direct Loan Program. I believe almost every aspect of our higher \neducation system in our country can be viewed as a success, including \nthe FFELP student loan program. There are roughly 3,200 lenders today \nparticipating, with a loan volume of over $50 billion in the current \nyear. The Direct Loan Program was approximately $13.5 billion. The \ntotal outstanding amount of loans, FFEL and direct loans, now \napproaches half a trillion dollars, about $448 billion. We are talking \nabout an immense program that creates great benefits for students all \nover America.\n  Now, the question that is before us is, if we have this private \nsector program out there--and we have been debating this in committee \nand we have had innumerable meetings on it and we had a vote earlier \ntoday--is the subsidy for the private lenders set at the right level? \nObviously, we have all agreed that it is too high. Congress agreed it \nwas too high last year. The President agreed it was too high this year, \nand he proposed some cuts. Now our committee in the Senate is making \nadditional cuts. My concern is that we are guessing what the subsidy \nlevel ought to be. We have our finger up in the wind and are making \narbitrary judgments.\n  I am interested in the auction model that has been introduced into \nthis bill. I think that is a useful way to find out what the private \nmarkets would tell us about what the right level of taxpayer subsidy \nis, so this program which loans\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\nmoney to students, who aren't the best credit risks, is at about the \nright level. But the last auction program was a colossal failure. So \nthat auction program may not tell us much.\n\n  Another way we might find out the proper level of subsidy would be to \ntry to develop a body of knowledge in the same way that State utility \ncommissions do. In Tennessee and other States--well, Tennessee is \ndifferent because we have the Tennessee Valley Authority. But in most \nStates, a State utility commission regulates the rate set for \ntelephones or electricity, and it allows the private company providing \nthat service a reasonable profit. Over the years despite there being a \nlot of politics involved, which I remember that very well--there has \ndeveloped quite a body of knowledge around the idea of what is an \nadequate level of subsidy for private companies providing a public \nservice, such as electricity or telephones or, as I suggest, federally \nbacked student loans. Perhaps that is something we could do more of.\n  There was talk about asking the Government Accountability Office to \nstudy the subsidies in this bill. I don't know whether that sort of \nstudy ended up in the legislation. I hope it did. Looking ahead to the \nnext time we reauthorize this ordeal with student loans, I would like \nto find out if there is a way to set up an appropriate way to measure \nwhat the level of subsidy ought to be for a private company.\n  So we have, first, the idea of the auction which might teach us \nsomething. We have the cost of the Direct Loan Program. That could \nteach us something about the appropriate cost. Finally, perhaps in this \nlegislation, before it is through, if it is not in already included, we \ncan ask GAO to create indices that would help legislators make a better \njudgment than guessing what an appropriate level of subsidy is. We have \nan indication from the marketplace. Last week, an equity firm that was \nseeking to buy Sallie Mae, I believe, said our changes in the level of \nsubsidy made that deal such that they felt it was not profitable for \nthem. So as I understand it, they have backed down. That is a signal \nthe levels we are setting in this bill may make it more difficult to \nattract a large number of private lenders to the program and, in \neffect, turn the student loan program more and more towards the Direct \nLoan Program.\n  In other words, by cutting the subsidies deeper and deeper, we will \nbe driving banks out of the business, especially the smaller ones--the \nones that serve students perhaps in rural areas or in different areas--\nand we might be reducing the opportunities students have to benefit \nfrom the services that these banks offer.\n  I know some of my colleagues would prefer we turn the whole thing \nover to the Government. I hope we don't do that--through the front door \nor through the back door--by squeezing out all of the private lenders. \nMy concern is not for the lenders; my concern is for the students who \ntoday get loans from 3,200 lenders. I like for students and \nuniversities to have those choices. And over the last 15 years, \ngenerally speaking, they prefer the program that involves private \nlenders instead of dealing with the Direct Loan Program that the \nGovernment runs. Eighty-three percent of the schools prefer to use the \nprivately backed student loan program, and 76 percent of the student \nloans are originated by those lenders. Only 1,310 schools participated \nin the Direct Loan Program, which is a small proportion of the loan \nvolume. The reason may be that the consumers who like choice and who \nlike to have different options have looked at both options--the program \nrun by the Government and the program run by the private lender--and \nthey find, the universities and the students, that the privately \noperated program is better for the students.\n\n  I am here today more to talk about looking ahead, not condemning this \nbill or the effort that has been made here. I am here today also to say \nthat the work of the Senate and House committees and some of the States \nhas uncovered abuses by student lenders, some of which have been \ncorrected and the rest ought to be. There is absolutely no excuse for \nthat. But correcting abuses by private student lenders is one thing; \ncutting the rates to such a point that we end up through the back door \npushing the student loan program into a Government-run program, or \nlargely into a Government-run program, is another thing. It would be an \nunwise step for us to take, and if we are to consider that step, I hope \nwe will do that on a very careful basis.\n  In conclusion, my opinion has not changed based on experience over \nthe last 15 years about the merits of a program largely run by private \nand nonprofit organizations--3,200 of them right now--to offer choices \nto millions and millions of students who attend 6,000 universities. To \nme, almost by definition, the Government is not a good manager of such \na large program. In fact, if it were a Government-run program, the \nGovernment would have to contract it out.\n  In general, I still support a properly regulated and appropriately \nsubsidized program that allows for the maximum number of student \nprivate lenders leaving students and universities choices.\n  Second, I am not persuaded that the Government-run program costs less \nthan the student program. I know there are reports and studies which \nsuggest that it might, but that is because we count money up here in \nstrange ways. If you just take real dollars and compare them to real \ndollars, I have seen no real evidence that the Direct Loan Program is \ncheaper for the taxpayers than the program run through the private \nlenders.\n  Finally, I don't like the idea of the Federal Government suddenly \nbeginning to assume a debt which approaches a half trillion dollars and \nput it on our books at a time when we are trying to reduce the deficit.\n  If it doesn't cost less, and if the Government is not likely to \nmanage it better, and if we don't need another half trillion dollars of \ndebt in the Federal Government, then why would we want to encourage the \ngrowth of a Government-run program over a privately run program?\n  I appreciate the chairman being here while I am making these remarks. \nI look forward to working with him because he has long experience on \nthis program and he has distinct views on it. I suggest that one of the \nmost constructive things we can do over the next few years is try to \ncreate, either through the auction suggestion or by listening to the \nprivate markets or from the Government Accountability Office or some \nother way, something other than a guess about what the private level of \nsubsidy is. Otherwise, we will be doing through the back door something \nthat I really don't think we should be doing through the front door \neither.\n  I thank the Senators from Massachusetts and Wyoming for their time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record some elaboration of my \nremarks that have to do with the cost comparisons of the Federal and \nthe private programs, the evidence, or lack of it, that the Government \ncan do it better than the private sector, and some questions about why \nthe Federal Government would want to assume more debt.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Federal Family Education Loan Program and the Federal Direct Loan \n                                Program\n\n       There is a lack of definitive evidence to suggest one \n     program is less costly to the taxpayer than the other.\n       In October, 2005 the Government Accountability Office \n     identified the following challenges in providing an accurate \n     comparison of student loan program costs:\n       Significant re-estimates of subsidy costs over the past 10 \n     years illustrate the challenges of estimating the lifetime \n     costs of loans.\n       Certain federal costs and revenues associated with the \n     student loan programs are not included in subsidy cost \n     estimates, such as federal administrative expenses, some \n     costs of risk associated with lending money over time, and \n     federal tax revenues generated by both student loan programs.\n       If current assumptions correctly predict future loan \n     performance and economic conditions, the originally estimated \n     gain to the government from the FDLP made in fiscal years \n     1994 to 2004 will not materialize, and instead these loans \n     will result in a net cost to the government. In reality, \n     however, subsidy cost estimates of FFELP and FDLP loans made \n     in fiscal years 1994 and 2004 will continue to change as \n     future re-estimates incorporate actual experience and new \n     interest rate forecasts.\n       While subsidy cost estimates may include many of the \n     federal cost associated with FFELP and FDL loans, they do no \n     capture all federal costs and revenues associated with the \n     loan programs. Consideration of all\n\n[[Page S9556]]\n\n     federal costs and revenues of the loan programs would be an \n     important component of a broader assessment of the costs and \n     benefits of the two programs.\n       It is important for policymakers to understand how credit \n     reform subsidy cost estimates are developed and to recognize \n     that such estimates will change in the future. Decisions made \n     in the short-term on the basis of these estimates can have \n     long-term repercussions for the fiscal condition to the \n     nation.\n       The GAO warns against comparing the FDLP based on their \n     short-term cash flows. Doing so may distort the view \n     primarily because of timing--many FDLP borrowers will not \n     fully repay their loans for another 20-30 years.\n       The Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) of 1990 introduced \n     bias into the comparisons of the projected costs of direct \n     loans and guaranteed loans. Therefore, the estimating \n     methodology used by both the Congressional Budget Office of \n     Management and the Office of Management and Budget is flawed \n     by the requirements of the FCRA.\n       While subsidy cost estimates include many of the federal \n     costs associated with FFELP and FDLP loans, they do not \n     capture all federal costs and revenues associated with the \n     loan programs. Because federal administrative expenses--in \n     accordance with FCRA--are excluded from subsidy cost \n     estimates, these estimates can underestimate the total \n     lifetime costs of FFELP and FDLP loans. Other costs and \n     revenues are also not considered in subsidy costs estimates, \n     including interest rate risk inherent to lending programs, \n     and federal tax revenues generated by private-sector activity \n     in both FFELP and FDLP. (GAO, 2005)\n       The government does not really `make money' providing \n     student loans--the subsidy calculations under FCRA are not \n     designed to fully capture the economic costs to the \n     government of the assistance that the student loan programs \n     provide, nor do they capture all of the effects of the \n     programs on federal spending revenues. (CBO, 2005)\n       FCRA fails to appropriately value risky cash flows coming \n     into the Treasury, such as student loan repayments. Scoring \n     omits loan administration costs, indirect programmatic \n     effects on Government receipts, and the risk of programmatic \n     failures. (Budget Scoring Barriers to Efficient Student Loan \n     Policy, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, December, 2006)\n       There is a lack of definitive evidence to suggest that the \n     federal government can service loans better.\n       In March, 2007 a suit was filed against the U.S. Department \n     of Education for imposing late fees on borrowers even though \n     borrower's payments were made on time. Overcharges were \n     allegedly caused by a computer glitch that caused more than 3 \n     million FDLP borrowers to be billed hundreds of millions of \n     dollars more than they owed--though no exact amount has been \n     stated. (Washington Post)\n       More than 3 in 4 schools relied exclusively on FFELP loan \n     providers. An estimated 600 have switched to FFELP after \n     participating in FDLP. (American Student Loan Providers)\n       Anecdotal evidence from financial aid professions suggest \n     that this switch has happened for the following reasons:\n       FFELP provides students a choice of lenders.\n       FFELP allows students to pay lower upfront fees, get better \n     interest rates and more generous repayment incentives than \n     FDLP.\n       FFELP lenders offer a portfolio of unpriced borrower \n     benefits--fee waivers, rate reductions, etc.--credit \n     counseling, expedited delivery, superior information \n     technology, college access in initiatives and other \n     enhancements and programs not offered by FDLP, but no easily \n     quantified.\n       The Department of Education contracts out the bulk of the \n     origination, servicing and other administrative tasks \n     entailed in operating the FDLP. (Holtz-Eakin).\n       Why would the federal government want to assume more debt?\n       FDLP loans are funded by U.S. Treasury borrowing, while \n     FFELP loans are originated with funds generated via private \n     capital markets.\n       Federal government subsidizes FFELP loans by paying a \n     portion of the interest costs and by providing for a guaranty \n     to the lender against borrower default. FDLP loan funds are \n     directly provided via the U.S. Treasury to make the same type \n     of loans. (Holtz-Eakin).\n       At the end of FY 04, DL owed taxpayers $96 billion, but had \n     only $86 billion in outstanding student loans to cover this \n     debt. (FY 04 Performance and Accountability Report)\n       In FY 04, the federal dollars actually spent on FFELP was \n     less than $900 million to support the $245 billion in \n     outstanding guaranteed loans--less than four-tenths of a cent \n     on ever outstanding dollar. (President's FY 06 Budget)\n       Default rates for FFELP are 11.7 percent and FDLP is 16.65 \n     percent. OMB has predicted that DL will experience a weighted \n     average default rate 5 percentage points higher than the \n     FFELP for FY 08. More than $6 billion of loans in the FDLP \n     are in default. (FY 04 Performance and Accountability Report)\n       Private companies may be better suited than government \n     agencies for keeping track of borrowers, and have a greater \n     incentive to be innovative and follow others in the industry.\n       Since FDLP's creation in 1993, it has spent $13 billion \n     more on interest payments than it has collected in interest \n     and fees, not counting default costs or program \n     administrative costs.

The Senator may \nproceed with amendment No. 2333.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2333\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the education bill before us is \ntroubling in the fundamental ways that Senator Judd Gregg, the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee, has pointed out, in that it \nutilizes our reconciliation process to, instead of containing spending \nand helping to balance the budget, actually increase spending \nsubstantially for a lot of new programs. I wish to talk about one of \nthose programs today that I think should not be a part of this \nlegislation. So I have offered this amendment to strike that provision. \nIt is an idea that sounds good. It is something about which I have had \nat one time or another individuals ask me to support, always for their \nparticular business, their particular agency of Government, and I have \nfelt that I could not support it. One reason was, how can we justify \nsupporting one agency of Government over another? So I guess, in one \nsense,\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\nthis legislation fixes that problem and covers everybody, and more. Let \nme tell my colleagues what it does.\n  The idea is, if a person pays their loan debt and they are part of a \ndirect Government loan program, that after 10 years they could get a \nlarge part of that debt forgiven. That sounds good, but let me discuss \nwhy I think this is bad public policy, why it is a new Government \nprogram we should not start, and why it is absolutely inevitable that \nit will grow and cost more and more as time goes along.\n  Let me show how broad this program is. There would be a student loan \nforgiveness program that would provide forgiveness of loans to public \nemergency management employees, government employees, public safety, \npublic law enforcement--these could be State, county, or local, I \npresume--public health, public education, public early childhood \neducation, public childcare, social work in a public child or family \nservice agency, public services for individuals with disabilities, \npublic services for the elderly, public interest legal services, public \nlibrary services, public school library sciences, or other public \nschool-based services, or those on full-time faculty at a tribal \ncollege or university. That is what is included. That is a big deal. It \neliminates one of my concerns of why pick and choose Government \nagencies; it just covers them all.\n  Let me express why I think there are some good principled public \npolicy concerns and objections and why I do not think this is a good \nstep for us to take.\n  For example, there is no limit in this legislation on the total \namount of loan forgiveness, which creates a discrepancy between the \nrich and the poor. Graduates of expensive schools with a lot of debt \nwould receive quite a sizable benefit under this program, while \nstudents who work their way through college, go to a community college, \nwould receive nothing if they didn't have any debt.\n  The National Association for College Admission Counseling reports \nthat the average cost of a community college is less than half of that \nfor a public college and one-tenth of a private 4-year college. So who \nis being helped here? Half of low-income students attend community \ncolleges while only 1 in 10 high-income students attend community \ncolleges.\n  Further, the lowest priced colleges are 2-year public colleges in the \nWest, for example, with average tuition fees of $1,300. The highest \npriced colleges in the country are 4-year private colleges in New \nEngland with average tuition fees of $28,000.\n  Section 401 then creates a perverse incentive to take out the maximum \namount of student loans. Rather than encouraging better public policy, \nI submit, that would encourage students to work their way through \ncollege and families to help them make their way through college \ninstead.\n  Instead of moving in that direction, this bill would clearly move us \nin the direction that one would borrow more money and have the \nexpectation that the Government will help them pay it off at some point \nlater on.\n  Also, I ask why we would single out public service Government workers \nfor this kind of benefit--there are millions of Government workers--and \nexclude productive citizens working in low-income jobs in the private \nsector who could also benefit from a similar program? Why are they left \nout? What principled argument is there for that? Certainly, most people \nworking in private businesses don't have as good a retirement plan or \nhealth care plan as Government employees do. Now we are going to help \nthem pay their tuition from taxpayers' money that comes from people in \nthe private sector who are not getting these benefits.\n  Why should a public employee be elevated to a higher class of \ntreatment of loan forgiveness than those in the private sector, those \nhard-working American taxpayers who are not lucky enough to have an \nair-conditioned office and a Government-sector job?\n  Public service is an honor, and as public servants, I don't think we \nneed to ask or should think to ask to elevate our number to a higher \nstatus than that of average working Americans.\n  There are many hard-working Americans in the private sector who \ncontribute to society and who would benefit from the program. I think \nabout attorneys who need help. What about small town attorneys working \nhard to start a practice, or nurses, educators, inventors, small \nbusiness employees, a cook who has gone to college to try to get a \nfinancial business degree so they can one day run a restaurant, \ndepartment store managers who want to be CEO's one day, electricians or \nplumbers who want to establish their own businesses and go back to \ncollege and work their way through and keep their debt down? These \npeople pay taxes that benefit a Government worker who has a lifetime \njob, probably making more than they are, certainly with a lot more job \nsecurity than they would have, and countless others around the \ncountry. Why should we benefit one and not the other? These are people \npaying taxes too. I haven't seen that we have difficulty getting people \nto take Government jobs. They are pretty attractive out there, the \ntruth be known.\n\n  So somebody goes off to a big expensive college and gets a big \nexpensive degree and owes $75,000 or $100,000. Well, the Government is \ngoing to help them pay that back but not help the guy out there on the \nstreet corner trying to make a living to pay his back--the same person \nwho is paying the taxes that are paying not only the salary now for the \nGovernment employee but now will pay their education costs. There is no \nprincipled basis that justifies them to be entitled to loan repayments \nmore than there would be for someone in the private sector.\n  There is no means test for this program. It doesn't matter under this \nprogram if the public employee has millions of dollars in the bank. If \nyou had millions of dollars in the bank, and you knew you were going to \nget a job where the Government was going to help you pay back the loan, \nwhy wouldn't you borrow the money to go to college instead of paying \nfor it yourself? This incentivizes people, I suggest, perversely, to \nborrow money to go to college rather than working their way through or \nutilizing the millions of dollars they may have.\n  Let me say this. I am not against assisting people to pay for a \ncollege education. But we are spending billions of dollars on higher \neducation through direct benefits to colleges and universities, loans, \nsubsidies, and grants. Total student aid, including grants from all \nsources, plus loans, work study, and tax benefits from the Federal \nGovernment, increased by 95 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars over \nthe decade from 1995-96 to 2005-06. So we are spending more to help our \npeople go to college, by putting more Pell grants and loan money out \nthere.\n  I think Senator Kennedy's concern about abuse of the private loan \nprogram is valid. I was inclined to support the Burr amendment, but I \nam of the view that the program was subject to too much abuse and we \nneeded to fix it. But I will note this about this amendment: It creates \nan unequal footing between the Direct Loan Program and the Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program--Senator Alexander was referring to those \nprograms--because the only people to get benefits under this loan \nrepayment program would have to go through the Direct Loan Program. The \ncompetition between these two programs, it has generally been held, and \nthe Senate believes, will benefit students, and that is why we didn't \neliminate the private loan program even in this bill we are passing.\n  So allowing loan forgiveness solely through the Direct Loan Program \nis not principled, I think, at all. It will undoubtedly give an \nadvantage to the Direct Loan Program as students have no other route in \nwhich to receive loan forgiveness than to borrow under the Direct Loan \nProgram.\n  Let me say this--and I didn't realize this until recently: 82 percent \nof the schools in my home State of Alabama do not use the Direct Loan \nProgram but participate in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. \nStudents graduating from my small alma mater, Huntingdon College, a \nliberal arts college, would not be eligible because Huntingdon is not a \ndirect loan school. Schools choose FFELP because the private sector \noffers the better services, they think, and saves them money. \nNationally, this statistic is around 80 percent. So 80 percent of the \ncolleges and universities in our country are not in the Direct Loan \nProgram, and under this plan you wouldn't benefit unless you were in \nit.\n\n[[Page S9558]]\n\n  They say: Well, you could consolidate your loans under the Direct \nLoan Program and, therefore, then you could get repayment. But isn't \nthat a tilting of the scales and a perverse benefit to the Direct Loan \nProgram, which is supposed to be on a competitive basis to see who \noffers the best incentive to the students to get a good loan program? \nThey get to choose now which they think is best. So I don't think that \nproviding this incentive to clearly favor the Direct Loan Program and \nexclude the other is good public policy. I am not aware that those who \nvoted for it understood it might have done that.\n  Studies show that when you extend your loan, sometimes you end up \npaying more interest than going on and paying them off. The Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program is far more popular than the Direct Loan \nProgram at present because they have tended to offer lower interest \nrates and quality service, but I think there are some abuses, too, and, \nhopefully, this bill will tighten that up.\n  I will conclude on this matter by saying this is the kind of program \nthat truly, colleagues, should strike fear in the heart of anyone \nconcerned about the expansion and growth of Federal spending and \nFederal programs. It will create a new Federal bureaucracy. Next year, \nI predict--since this bill says you have to be regular in your payment \nof your student loan to qualify for this program--I will predict next \nyear we will be providing exceptions to those who have lost their jobs, \nwho have had an illness or who have had other kinds of problems; or we \nwill be having lawsuits and administrative hearings over whether this \nor that person qualifies to have part of their loan forgiven based \nsimply on the fact they work for some Government or public agency.\n  If we want to help public employees, let us do it in a more direct \nmanner. Why should we provide a benefit program that helps those who go \nto some expensive college, maybe don't work while they go to college, \nand end up with a big debt? Let's say two individuals are working at \nthe county health department or the EMA and one of them ran up a big \ndebt and the Government helps them pay it off; while the other one, who \nworked their way through college, doesn't get anything. That is not a \ngood way to help people, in my view.\n  It is also, again I submit, bad public policy because it encourages \nand incentivizes people not to pay their way through but to borrow \nmoney. We would like to have a different incentive. Good public policy \nshould do that. I also see no principled basis to provide this benefit \nsolely to the Direct Loan Program and not to the other loan programs. \nIt is a clear tilt from one side to the other when 80 percent of the \nAmerican colleges and universities are not in the Federal Direct Loan \nProgram.\n  So I would say, first of all, the way it is structured today it will \nnot be a huge, costly program for our country, but it is not based on \ngood principles, No. 1; No. 2, it is going to be expanded, you can be \nsure, in the future; and No. 3, it will create another bureaucracy, \nanother Government program, when we already have Pell grants and loan \nprograms that we are pumping more and more money into every year.\n  I suggest if we have ideas about helping people with their loans, we \nfocus on existing loan programs and not create this one that is \nunprincipled in its results.\n  Mr. President, has Senator Kennedy had an opportunity to think about \nthat other amendment I was going to call up?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will be kind enough to let me examine it. \nThat is dealing with the alternative minimum tax and deductibles that, \nquite frankly, as I was thinking about it, the Finance Committee deals \nwith, and they would probably be the most valuable to try to address \nthis. If we could deal with this first issue first, and then, if I \nmight, try and get some member on the Finance Committee to come over \nand respond to the Senator's question because I think it deals with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  I am not trying to delay, but I see the Senator from Maryland is here \nand would like to speak. I will be glad to respond to the Senator's \npresentation and move ahead in a timely way.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the floor--I believe I still \nam recognized--I know Senator Kennedy has never offered a finance-\nrelated amendment on a bill that hasn't cleared the Finance Committee.\n  I am teasing a little bit because we all knew this bill is open to \nthis kind of amendment, I think, and that is why I wanted to offer that \nAMT fix. We have voted on it before. It is something that I think we \nneed to be more educated about and that is the reason I wanted to offer \nthat.\n  I will not offer it at this time, if Senator Mikulski wishes to speak \non the education amendment, but I hope that will not bar me from \ngetting the floor a little later and seeking to call up that extra \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The senior Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak enthusiastically in \nfavor of the Higher Education Access Reconciliation Act and to also \nspeak against the Sessions amendment to eliminate the debt forgiveness \nprogram for entering public service.\n  I can't tell you how happy I am today to be speaking on legislation \nhelping our young people have access to higher education. Finally, \nafter a very dark week, where we were gagged and muzzled from trying to \ndeal with bringing the Iraq war to an end, we now have an open debate \non how to achieve the American dream. This is what I came to the Senate \nto be able to do. This is what the voters wanted us to do when on \nNovember 7 they held a national referendum and put the Democrats back \nin charge so we could change the tone, have a civilized debate such as \nwe are, and also to change the priorities--and changing the priorities \nSenator Kennedy has, by leading us in a direction where we can expand \nopportunity for our young people without expanding our deficit.\n  We will not expand our Federal deficit and we will help families not \nexpand their family deficit, as they try to help their kids achieve \nhigher education. This legislation pending before us today should be \npassed in a swift, expeditious, uncluttered way. This bill is \nabsolutely a great bill for students and it is a great bill for \nAmerica. It gives our students access to the American dream. It gives \nour young people access to the freedom to achieve, to be able to follow \ntheir talents, and to be able to achieve higher education in whatever \nfield they will be able to serve this country. We do it by providing an \nincrease in Pell grants.\n  But the bill is also fiscally responsible as well as socially \nprogressive. It cuts subsidies--big, lavish, bloated subsidies--to \nbanks. In eliminating these bloated, unneeded subsidies in today's era \nof cheap money, what we are able to do is put that back into student \naid. So we up the student aid, but we don't create more borrowing in \norder to do it.\n  The bill also has other reform elements to it. It reforms the \napplication process. Anybody in here who is a mom or a dad--or an Aunt \nBarb--knows that, boy, is that process complicated. You almost have to \nhave been to college in order to apply for student loans to be able to \ngo to college.\n  The other thing it does is it keeps an eye on those colleges and \nuniversities. We have seen tuition creep--we have seen tuition gallop--\nto where now there is an ever-increasing escalation. We worry if we \nincrease the Pell grants, are they then going to increase tuition? So \nthere is reform methodologies in this, and we salute Senators Kennedy \nand Enzi for being able to do this. So this is why I am so enthusiastic \nabout this bill.\n  As I travel around my own State of Maryland and I talk about what we \nwant to do with our Federal legislative initiatives, I often say to \naudiences--and I say here today to my colleagues--we in this country \nenjoy many freedoms--the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the \nfreedom of religion--but there is an implicit freedom our Constitution \ndoesn't lay out but which brings people to this country and excites the \npassions and hopes and dreams and that is the desire and the ability to \nhave the freedom to achieve; to take whatever talents God has given \nyou, to fill whatever are the passions in your heart, to be able to \nlearn so you can earn and make a contribution. That is what I call the \nfreedom to achieve.\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\n  The freedom to achieve should never be stifled in this country \nbecause of economic reasons. Your freedom to achieve should never be \ndetermined by the ZIP code you live in, by the color of your skin, or \nby the size of your family's wallet. It should be, in a democratic \ncountry, that everyone has access to be able to do that. That means \naffordable education. That means access to the opportunity ladder that \nstudents and families can count on, because we know a degree is \nsomething no one can ever take away from you.\n  When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls high school, my \nfather and mother encouraged me to seek higher education. My father's \ngrocery store had a terrible fire, and I offered to not go on to higher \neducation but to work in our little family grocery store. But my father \nsaid, no, Barb, you have to go, and your mom and I will find a way, \nbecause no matter what you do or what in life happens to you, no one \ncan ever take that degree away from you. As your father who wants to \nhelp you and to protect you, the best way I can protect you is to make \nsure you will be able to earn a living all of your life.\n  My father gave me the freedom to achieve. But tuition costs were \ndifferent in those days, and now people rely upon student loans or \nstudent assistance. That is what we need to continue to do.\n  We also know when we are helping our young people, or not-so-young \npeople who return, the value of higher education doesn't only accrue to \nthe individual, it accrues to the Nation as a whole. Every time we help \nsomeone be able to go on and have that freedom to achieve, we might be \neducating someone who is going to find the cure for cancer. We are \ngoing to be educating the cop on the beat who might save that old lady \nfrom being mugged. Whatever we do, that education lifts not only that \nperson but it lifts the level of attainment of the Nation as a whole.\n  That is why this is an important public investment. This is why on \nthis day, this week, we finally have some light coming into the Senate.\n  We know higher education is a great opportunity. As I said, this \nmeans there will be people who are young and not so young who will \nbless us for what we are doing today. Getting a college education is \nthe core of the American dream, and I am going to be sure that every \nstudent has access to that dream and make sure that when they graduate, \ntheir very first mortgage isn't their student debt.\n  My colleagues have spoken eloquently about how often that debt is \n$20,000 or more. I know in my home State college tuition is on the \nrise. The tuition at the University of Maryland, a land grant college, \nhas increased by almost 40 percent since 2002. Financial aid is not \nkeeping up. Pell grants now only cover 30 percent of what a 4-year \npublic college costs, but 20 years ago those Pell grants covered 80 \npercent of the cost.\n  We look at our families, our middle-class families, and they are \nstretched and they are stressed. Families in my State are worried about \nmany things. They are worried about their jobs, worried about the cost \nof raising a family, gas prices are up, the cost of utilities is up, \nthe cost of health care is up--you name it, everything is up but wages. \nThey are racing from carpool to work and back again. While they might \nbe taking care of mom and dad who need assisted living, they are also \nwondering how are they going to assist their kids to go to college so \nthey are assisting their kids with learning how to earn a living. Our \nfamilies need help. By gosh, I believe that help begins at home.\n  This is what this legislation does. It will increase student aid by \nincreasing Pell grants from $4,300 per year to $5,400 per year. It is a \n$1,100 increase. This is wonderful. That is already a $5,000 break over \na 4-year program. If you are looking at a community college, this could \nhelp you pay for this. For so many of our young people, the community \ncollege is the first access to higher education.\n  These families and these students will know exactly what this means. \nThe simple expansion of Pell grants is going to take that opportunity \nladder and take that first rung and make sure it is reliable and \nstable.\n  There are other important aspects in this bill in addition to that. I \nam so proud we have extended our deferred loans for our men and women \nin the armed services. Under the old law, servicemembers could only \ndefer their student loans for 6 months. They are fighting in Iraq. I \nthink we ought to defer it indefinitely, but we will take what we can \nget in the law. That is an important step.\n  I want to say a word about the comments about public service. Why is \nit every time we talk about public service jobs it is in a snide and \nsnarky way? I am tired of people talking about public service jobs in a \nsnide and snarky way. Somehow or other, in private sector jobs you work \nhard. I know for those hedge fund managers, walking down that rugged \nterrain of Wall Street, fighting their way to get a latte, is tough \nwork. But why is it if you are an FBI agent we are going to talk about \nyou in a snarky way? What about if you are a nurse in the VA helping \nfit that prosthetic device for that injured warrior coming back? We \nhave to remember that civil service is honorable and civil service is \nhard work, and public service makes contributions to the public good.\n  I hope we then in this debate also follow the kind of rubric that has \nbeen developed by our colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich. He is \nworried, too, about all the retirements that are coming in civil \nservice. We are going to recruit, but let's talk about specifically \nwhat this does. This is debt forgiveness where we are facing shortages. \nWe are talking about debt forgiveness in law enforcement. Law \nenforcement all over the United States is facing shortfalls in \nrecruitment. There are people who no longer want to be cops on the beat \nbecause it is a dirty, dangerous job. We have a shortage of nurses. \nLet's talk about our teachers--oh, our most important asset is our \nchildren. We will not pay to recruit and retain, but we will \noverregulate our teachers. We have to be able to get them in.\n  When we talk about the fact that if you are an elementary \nschoolteacher or you are that preschool teacher who gets our kids \nreading ready, often they are very poorly paid, paid less than if they \nhad worked in fast food operations. We have to help our teachers.\n  Then I want to talk about an area that is very near and dear to me, \nthe nursing shortage. I have worked on a bipartisan basis with the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, on how to deal with the nursing \nshortage. It is now achieving a critical mass. Over 40 percent of our \nnurses will be retiring in a very short time. It is difficult also to \nretain our nurses. We need to be able to recruit and retain our nurses.\n\n  When we hear about: Why don't they work their way through? Let's work \nour way through. Have you ever been to a nursing school? Have you ever \nbeen in a nursing school? I have. Nursing school is tough, demanding, \nunrelenting. If you are in a nursing college program, whether it is a \ncommunity college or a 4-year college, you have to do your lab work, \nyou have to do your clinical work. You can't take time off to go work \nto earn that tuition. You have to be there learning to be a nurse. \nThere is practically no way that, if you want to be a nurse, an x-ray \ntechnician, an occupational therapist, a physical therapist--anything \nin allied health--you can take time off to work your way through. But \nyou are mounting debt. This is a way that gives you a break.\n  I believe in giving help to those who will be able to help us in our \ncommunity.\n  To finish my point and my momentum here, I believe the Kennedy \napproach on student debt forgiveness is wise and prudent, and I believe \ncan be implemented in a way that does not create abuse. Let's respect \npublic service. Let's try to deal with the fact that we are facing \ncritical shortages. Let's also begin to work together to solve our \nNation's problems.\n  We are willing to spend thousands of dollars to recruit in critical \nareas in the military. I happen to support that, to keep that sergeant, \nto recruit that lieutenant and so on--I absolutely think we should.\n  I urge the passage of the Higher Education Access bill and at the \nsame time the defeat of the Sessions amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from Maryland be good enough to yield \nfor a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is familiar with the fact--I am wondering if \nit is true about the students in Maryland--the average indebtedness of \na student now graduating from a 4-year college has gone up \nsignificantly from 1993, from $9,200, to 2004, where it is over \n$19,000. It may vary in different States, but by and large the average \nis about $19,000.\n  Let's take the starting salaries.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, if I could respond to the Senator, that is \nexactly right. We are experiencing the same situation for that level of \npublic indebtedness in our public universities. If one would then go on \nto a private university such as Johns Hopkins, it would also be \nsubstantially more.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the Senator understands, if you go on to medical \nschool, more often than not you are probably closer to $100,000, by and \nlarge, by the time you finish medical school. But let's take the \naverage college graduate, someone who might have gone through community \ncollege and then gone on to finish 4 years of college. They are ending \nup with about $19,000 in debt.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that here in Massachusetts, a \nstarting teacher gets paid $35,000 a year? Let's take a social worker \nin Tennessee. He or she earns $33,000. A public defender earns $43,000. \nThey obviously have to borrow more because they need the additional \nprofessional training. This example here is of a public defender in \nIndiana. Their debt is $51,000.\n  Now, as I heard the Senator from Maryland, and we could go on across \nthe line in terms of some of the areas of public need in this country, \nbut if we take a school teacher, if we take a public defender, the size \nof their debt and the size of their income, is there any question in \nthe Senator's mind those individuals, with that kind of debt and that \nkind of salary, that virtually that kind of obligation to repay at the \npresent time is going to effectively make it impossible for those \nindividuals who might want to go into those professions to do so?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be happy to respond, if the Senator would allow \nme to focus on the allied health professions of which I am quite \nfamiliar, that it affects, first of all, when you look at what you \ncould owe, it affects your major. So if I want to major in nursing, or \nwhere there is another shortage, x-ray technology, and you look at what \nyou are going to earn, and what you are going to owe, well, you will \ntake perhaps an easier path, and something that will be more lucrative \nat the end of graduation.\n  So it starts in the freshman year when they are looking at that. \nSecond, let's go to another issue in nursing. As the Senator knows, we \nhave a problem with having enough people to teach nursing. That \nrequires graduate training, master's, plus doctoral. Well, if you come \nout and you owe this bucket of bucks, and you are trying to pay off \nyour undergraduate loan, working the terrific shifts the nurses work, \nand you are thinking about graduate school, you are not going to go get \na master's or a doctorate to teach nursing, and we have little in the \nway of helping you. So we are, No. 1, affecting the shortages we have \nin these areas, and we are also exacerbating the people who would then \nhave to go on to graduate school to teach the very people we need to \nteach.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, let me ask the Senator something.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does that help?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is certainly both understandable and expressing the \nreality of today. Say we are trying to attract a math teacher or a \nscience teacher. We understand that if we are going to be competitive \nin the world, it is going to be in the new industries, the innovative \nindustries. I do not know what it is in Baltimore, but I can tell you \nin Boston, it is difficult to get good math teachers to teach in our \npublic school systems. It is very difficult to get good science \nteachers in there and good chemistry teachers to teach in there.\n  In the sciences, it is extremely difficult, because if someone is \ngoing to have the ability to be a good teacher, understanding their \ncourse structure, they are going to have to graduate from college, and \nthen they may even have to go on to earn an advanced degree.\n  Now if they are still going to be paid a very modest salary, what do \nyou think that math or science teacher is going to do? Do you think \nthey are going to go to work in the private sector for $100,000 a year \nor go and teach the citizens in Baltimore or the citizens in Boston at \na very modest salary?\n  What do you think is in the best interest of our Nation in terms of \nits competitiveness?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I can answer that, Senator, because we see it every day \nin the State of Maryland, which has a profile not unlike the State of \nMassachusetts. We have schools in the Baltimore-Washington corridor \nthat are desperately, as of now, in getting ready for the school year, \nrecruiting people in math and science, both at elementary and high \nschool.\n  We also have a robust science program in the private sector. First of \nall, we have defense jobs, we have biotech jobs. If you are working as \nthat science teacher at $38,000, with this big debt, you can go to work \nin pretty interesting private sector jobs, some under Government \ncontract.\n  As we like to say, Government work is often getting contracts with \nthe private sector. They are going to walk out and they are going to \ntake the $70,000, the $80,000 or the $100,000, not because of the \nmoney, they want to pay down their debt and they want what everyone \nelse wants, the ability to have a family, buy a home. You know, a \nstarter home now in our community is $400,000. That is starter--\nstarter.\n  Can you imagine that? So, of course, they are going to make those \nchoices, or, if they do come, they stay a very short time, a very short \ntime.\n  So we think that this is a good way to get them into teaching and get \nthem to stay in teaching. We believe that once they come, and once they \nstay a few years, they will stay for a while, particularly if we help \nthem follow their dream, while they are helping these other young \npeople to get ready to follow theirs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, to the Senator, in this legislation, we have \nprovided individuals in public service professions with loan \nforgiveness. We are talking about those working in public safety; we \nare talking about law enforcement; we are talking about public \neducation, early child education, and child care.\n  We are talking about individuals who are going to work with the \ndisabled and the elderly. The Senator has spoken so eloquently about \nthe changing demographics in the country, and increasing concerns for \nour elderly to make sure that there are going to be alternative choices \nfor those elderly people such as independent living. This bill also \nprovides loan forgiveness for those in public legal services, library \nsciences, school-based service providers, and those who work at tribal \ncolleges.\n  These are areas where there are critical shortages. Would not the \nSenator agree with me that these represent--represent--professions \nwhich are making a difference for other people, for other individuals? \nIf we are able to have dedicated, competent, able, gifted people who \nwork in those years, we are going to be a better Nation for doing it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator has pinpointed exactly the point I wished \nto make. These are in fields that are making important contributions to \nthe public good, be it public safety to health or public health, the \neducation of our children at all ages, pre through 12.\n  I do not know how it is in Boston, but we are experiencing a spike in \nviolent crime in Baltimore. We have a considerable number of vacancies \nin the Baltimore City Police Department. At the same time, they have \ntried to cut the COPS Program, local law enforcement--the subject of \nanother debate on appropriations. But I will tell you, Mayor Dixon is \nout there, we are trying to recruit. If we are going to fight crime, \nfight crime with police officers in the way of enforcement, you fight \ncrime with education and other professions.\n\n  So you have pinpointed it exactly. That is why I can understand some \nof the flashing yellow lights raised by the Senator from Alabama.\n  I wish to say one thing. I spoke out about my mother and father. \nSure, I helped them at the local grocery store. But I was working as a \nchild abuse worker. When your brother was elected President, I was \nworking as a foster\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\ncare worker at Catholic Charities. I wanted to prevent family breakups. \nI went to work at the Department of Social Services. I was a child \nabuse worker for a couple of years. That is pretty tough, what those \nsocial workers do.\n  But I wanted to go to graduate school so I would know how to do \nbetter, so I would be more effective, so I could intervene. Well, I was \nan emancipated adult. Graduate school at the University of Maryland was \ngetting underway.\n  But thanks to the war on poverty, and thanks to a grant at the \nNational Institutes of Health--again, which your brother started, and \nyou have so steadfastly continued, community mental health--there were \ncommunity mental health grants for Barb Mikulski to go to the \nUniversity of Maryland and get her master's in social work.\n  Well, given my style of debate, people might not say I have a \n``therapeutic'' personality, but I will tell you what I learned on the \nstreets of Baltimore as a child abuse worker and what I learned with my \nprogram at the University of Maryland, I think that Baltimore is better \nbecause of what I learned. But I could not have done that, nor could I \nhave taken out those loans--I was already an adult--to be able to do \nthat, had not the U.S. Government said: We are willing to invest in you \nif you are going to put your heart and soul back into America.\n  I say hats off to those programs that give all those other programs \nthat chance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wish to thank the good Senator from Maryland. She has \na way of speaking and taking complicated issues and simplifying them \nand getting to the core and the root of them. She has done so in a very \nimportant way, which addresses an underlying aspect of the Sessions \namendment; that is, the value of work in the public sector, the value \nof work in the public sector as differentiated from the private sector, \nbecause of the value it makes and the difference it makes to other \npeople.\n  That is what we have tried to do in this legislation, in providing \nthe loan forgiveness.\n  I wish to thank the Senator for her eloquence, and I wish to thank \nher for helping on this particular amendment. Effectively, the Sessions \namendment would eliminate the provisions in this legislation that say \nthat after 10 years, after 10 years of working in the public sector, \nthe remainder of your loan would be canceled.\n  Now, that is the provision he has made. Now, a couple points I wish \nto address in terms of the Senator's representation. The fact is, in \nthe legislation there is what we call an income cap. The earnings have \nto be less than $65,000. So if you go to work in a public service place \nand somehow you earn in excess of $65,000, you do not have your loans \nforgiven.\n  So this is targeted to the kind of individuals whom Senator Mikulski \nhas talked of, the examples we have given out here, those who are in \nlaw enforcement, those who are teachers, those who are working in the \nnursing professions, those who are working in special needs; those \nprovisions on page 30 of the legislation.\n  We feel strongly that this loan forgiveness is a critical part of \nthis bill, and this is the distinction we draw from the Sessions \namendment, and it has been stated so eloquently by the Senator from \nMaryland, the distinction between the public and the private sector and \nthe great needs we have in terms of the public sector. That is very \nimportant.\n  I wish to remind my friend from Alabama, according to this \nlegislation, he is one of the fortunate Senators in higher education, \nthe increased grant aid for students for the State of Alabama is going \nto increase to $442 million over the period of the next 5 years. My own \nState of Massachusetts is $319 million. Alabama has come out very well, \none of the most favored States in terms of the totality. We always try \nto look out after the Senator from Alabama and Alabama. I thought the \nSenator would be interested in that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would you yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have supported the loan programs and the Pell grants. \nI like the Pell Grant Program. That is focused on a person of lower \nincome. We probably do have lower income students in Alabama, and we \nprobably benefitted nicely under the Pell Grant Program compared to \nmore blessed States such as Massachusetts.\n  I simply would ask the question, the question I raise is: If you have \ntwo persons in nursing school and one is maybe already a nurse but \ntrying to get a higher degree and she works and keeps her debt down, \nthe one who does not do that gets more benefit than the other. It does \nonly favor those in the public sector and not in the private sector.\n  I believe this bill continues the emphasis, which I support, on maybe \nhaving better Pell grant provisions for those who do math and science \nand some of the areas in which we have shortages. I believe it goes \nfurther than that, does it not? I know we did that last year. I think \nthat was a good step in trying to help deal with shortage areas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I am a very strong believer in the \nnursing profession, and have been. I think they are the backbone of our \nwhole health care system. We provide relief for nurses in this bill, \nwhether they are in the public or private sector. For those in public \nhealth, there is loan forgiveness after 10 years in the profession. And \nfor all graduates, we provide income-based repayment, which caps their \nmonthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income. If a \nnurse works in the private sector, works at Mass General Hospital, gets \na good salary there, or works out in the community in terms of trying \nto work with foster children or otherwise, they would both get some \nkind of student loan debt relief under this bill.\n  But on the loan forgiveness, the Senator is quite correct. We have \ntargeted those individuals who are going to be working in what we \nconsider to be the public sector, for the common good, for a larger \nsense of purpose for the country, as expressed so eloquently by the \nSenator from Maryland, to be eligible for the forgiveness. That is the \npoint the Senator has made.\n  For example, under this bill, as I understand, a public school \nteacher in Alabama who earns $31,000 and the average loan debt in \nAlabama is $17,559, they could have the loan payments capped at 15 \npercent so it reduces his or her monthly payment by $59, from $203 to \n$104. That is about a 30-percent reduction which is not insignificant. \nThen after 10 years of teaching, under our legislation, all the \nremaining debt would be forgiven. In this case, a benefit of some \n$10,000, which is very significant. But they would have to teach for 10 \nyears to be eligible for this. We think this is a better investment, a \nbetter trade, than continuing to give so much in Federal subsidies to \nthe banks. We have taken it effectively from the profits of these \nlending institutions, and we see they are going to survive. We have the \nCBO figures that show that they are. We have their own figures, for \nexample, from Sallie Mae, that show even with this legislation the \nprofits they are going to make over the next several years. We think \nthis is a good trade. This is a good policy matter.\n  I saw the Senator from Alabama leave the Chamber. I haven't talked \nwith my friend and colleague, but we will be ready to move ahead and \nvote on that at the appropriate time. We will talk with our colleague \nand see if we can't figure out the best time to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield time from the bill to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am speaking on an amendment that I will \ncall up later. It is amendment No. 2334. It is the Coleman-DeMint-\nThune-Inhofe amendment that would prohibit the FCC from reinstating the \nso-called fairness doctrine.\n  The amendment says:\n\n       The Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe \n     any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, or other \n     requirement that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or \n     repromulgating (in whole or in part) the requirement that \n     broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial \n     issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the \n     ``Fairness Doctrine''.\n\n  For those students following debate on the education reconciliation \nbill, they may well wonder what the fairness doctrine controversy is \nall about.\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nAfter all, this bill is about the podcasting, blogging, U-Tubing, \nchannel-surfing generation that knows nothing but choice and vigorous \nfreedom of expression. These students have grown up in today' s info-\ntech world of rich and diverse media sources, in which they, just like \nthe rest of us, can get the information they want, how they want, and \nwhen they want it--free of any government content restriction. I want \nto keep it that way. It hasn't always been like this. It was only 20 \nyears ago that we did away with the fairness doctrine.\n  On its surface, the fairness doctrine sounds harmless enough, but at \nits core, the fairness doctrine would threaten our constitutional right \nto free speech and fundamentally undermine the workings of our \ndemocracy.\n  The Government has no place monitoring ideas on our public airwaves \nand penalizing broadcasters who don't meet the Government's definition \nof fair and balanced. There is a reason why our first amendment is \nfreedom of speech; Because all freedoms are at risk when Government \nmonitors and controls the broadcast of ideas.\n  That is why I will be offering this amendment which will protect \nAmerican's constitutionally granted right to free speech. After all, \nwhat sort of message are we sending to our future leaders when there \nare some on the other side who are seeking to restrict free speech?\n  Our Founding Fathers knew very well the importance of free speech to \nour Nation's democracy.\n  The genius of our system of Government is the conscious choice to \nleave decisions in the hands of regular people, by explicitly \nrestricting the power of Government to make them. It is not by \ncoincidence that the Framers of the Constitution established free \nspeech, along with freedom of the press, in the first amendment. They \ncome together in the first amendment.\n  Beyond first amendment principles, there are also market principles \nat stake. Since the end of the fairness doctrine in 1987, talk radio \nhas flourished because of consumer-driven market demand, not because of \nGovernment command, not because of Government control. The history of \nthe fairness doctrine is actually one of chilling freedom of speech. \nThe reality is, if you are a broadcaster and you know that you have a \nGovernment regulator monitoring what is on your channel, your station, \na pencil and paper in hand and marking with probably a stopwatch the \namount of time that you discuss idea A, and then all of a sudden if you \ndon't give what the Government regulator feels is the right amount of \ntime to give a varying opinion to subject A, in the end you risk \npenalty. You put yourself and your business at risk.\n  The reality was during the years in which the fairness doctrine was \nin play, it chilled freedom of expression. Some folks probably would \nsay: Let's just play country music. Let's just do something else, but \nlet's not talk about things because it is going to put us in jeopardy, \nput our livelihood in jeopardy. That is not what America is all about.\n  At the end of the day, there is nothing fair about the fairness \ndoctrine. The issue is not which broadcaster is fair and which one is \nnot: the issue is who makes that decision.\n  I believe fairness is what the American public decides is fair, not \nsome Washington politician or bureaucrat. Americans love a fair fight \nbut there is nothing fair if the intent is to silence debate just \nbecause a Government bureaucrat or politician disagrees with it and \nthen employs a Government bureaucrat to chill the expression of ideas.\n  In the end, our Nation, our democracy, is best served when we let \ncompeting ideas enter the political marketplace freely, and let the \nbest ideas win.\n  One of my hometown newspapers, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, put it \nwell the other day when it said in an editorial entitled ``Fairness is \nbeautiful, especially when it's optional'':\n\n       . . . let the gabbers gab--right, left, center, wherever--\n     without government-imposed balance. Americans can make \n     listening and viewing decisions according to their own sense \n     of what is fair. To have faith in the marketplace of ideas--\n     as we do--is to believe that, over time, good ideas will rise \n     by their merits.\n\n  We live in an age of satellite radio, of broadband, of blogs, \nInternet, cable TV, broadcast TV. There is no limitation on the ability \nof anyone from any political persuasion to get their ideas set forth.\n  The public, in the end, will choose what to listen to, and that is \ntheir right. It is not Government's right. It is not Government's \nobligation or responsibility to monitor and regulate that. That is very \ndangerous.\n  The fairness doctrine is a flawed idea from a bygone era that has no \nplace in today's information age. My amendment seeks to continue to \nprotect Americans' right to free speech and to allow for our \nbroadcasters to contribute to our national dialog without Government \ncensorship, without Government demand and control. That is the beauty \nof democracy. It is the world to which the students we will improve \nwith this reconciliation, which contains a lot of good things, will go. \nIn the end we want to have people who have access to the free flow of \ninformation. We want to have old people who have access to the free \nflow of information. We don't want to step back into a bygone era where \nGovernment was monitoring ideas, monitoring content. That is very \ndangerous.\n  I will ask my colleagues at a later time to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been very deeply disappointed with \nthe response of Senate Democratic leaders to the President's nomination \nof Judge Leslie Southwick to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  I had expected that his nomination would move expeditiously through \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate. He is emminently well \nqualified. But the opposition of some members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and some outside political interest groups has slowed action \non the nomination.\n  I have known Leslie Southwick for 30 years. His qualifications are \nbeyond question. During his distinguished career, as a lawyer and a \nState court judge, he has earned the respect and admiration of liberals \nand conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, as well as fellow lawyers \nand judges who have worked closely with him and who know him well.\n  He is fair and thoughtful and would be an outstanding Federal court \nof appeals judge. The judiciary would be well served by his leadership \nand his knowledge of the law. He will reflect credit--enormous credit--\non the Federal judiciary.\n  He graduated cum laude from Rice University in 1972 and from the \nUniversity of Texas School of Law in 1975.\n  Following law school, he clerked for the chief judge of the Texas \nCourt of Criminal Appeals in Austin and then, in 1976, for Judge \nCharles Clark on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The next year he began the practice of law in Jackson, MS, with the \nfirm of Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, one of our State's most \nrespected law firms. He quickly became a respected member of the bar.\n  From 1989 to 1993, he served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General \nin the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. While there, \nhe supervised the Federal Programs Branch and the Office of Consumer \nLitigation.\n  In November 1994, Judge Southwick was elected to serve on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals. He was reelected to a second term in \n1998.\n  During 8 of the first 10 years on the court of appeals, Judge \nSouthwick wrote the most opinions of anyone on the court. He has been \ninvolved in more than 7,000 opinions during his service on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals, and he personally wrote almost 800 of \nthem.\n  Judge Southwick also has a distinguished record of service in the \nJudge\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nAdvocate General's Corps of the U.S. Army Reserves and has been an \ninstructor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n  In August 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Southwick and the 155th Brigade \nCombat Team of the Mississippi National Guard were mobilized in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit was deployed in Iraq from January \nto December 2005, where he served as the staff judge advocate. He spent \nmuch of his time in Najaf, an area of significant insurgent activity.\n  In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, one of Judge Southwick's \nfellow soldiers wrote this:\n\n       He also took on the task of handling the claims of numerous \n     Iraqi civilians who had been injured or had property losses \n     due to [the involvement of] the United States Military in our \n     area of operations. This involved long days of interviewing \n     Iraqi civilian claimants, many of whom were children, widows \n     and elderly people, to determine whether the United States \n     Military could [or should] pay their claims. He always \n     listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently and treated them \n     with the utmost respect and kindness. He did this not just \n     out of a sense of duty but because he is a genuinely good and \n     caring person.\n\n  Judge Southwick is currently a professor of law at the Mississippi \nCollege School of Law. He teaches courses in administrative law, \nconsumer law, evidence, statutory interpretation, and judicial history.\n  He has written several legal and historical articles that have been \npublished in the Mississippi Law Journal, the Mississippi College Law \nReview, the Wall Street Journal, and other publications. He is the \nauthor of a book entitled: ``Presidential Also-Rans and Running \nMates.'' It won an American Library Association prize as the ``Best \nReference Work of the Year'' in 1985.\n  Judge Southwick has served as president of the American Inns of \nCourt, as a member of the American Law Institute, and on the Curriculum \nCommittee of the American Bar Association's Section on Legal Education. \nHe was honored by the Mississippi State Bar in 2004 with the Judicial \nExcellence Award.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously concluded that Judge Southwick is ``well \nqualified'' to serve as a Federal appellate judge. This is the highest \nrating a judicial nominee can receive.\n  After being nominated on June 6, 2006, to serve as a U.S. district \ncourt judge in the Southern District of Mississippi, he received a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and was unanimously \nreported with a favorable recommendation for confirmation.\n  After two nominees for the Fifth Circuit from our State were turned \ndown, Senator Lott and I recommended Judge Southwick for that court, \nand President Bush submitted his nomination to the Senate on January 9, \n2007.\n  In an editorial published in June 2006, the Clarion Ledger of \nJackson, MS, called Judge Southwick's nomination ``an outstanding \nappointment.''\n  In an editorial published in June 2007, the Clarion Ledger stated \nthat Judge Southwick had built a reputation based on ``professionalism, \nhard work, and integrity'' and that support of the nominee's home State \nSenators is an important indicator of broad consensus on the \nnomination.\n  This vacancy on the Fifth Circuit has now existed since 2004. This \nseat is considered a judicial emergency by the Federal judiciary, \nmeaning the efficiency and efficacy of the court are negatively \naffected by this vacancy.\n  I am confident Judge Southwick will serve with great distinction on \nthis court, and he will reflect great credit on the Federal judiciary, \nif he is confirmed.\n  I am proud of the recommendation Senator Lott and I have made to the \nSenate, and the Senate should confirm this nomination.\n  I mentioned the support of community leaders in my earlier remarks. I \nhave been handed by staff members of mine a number of letters that have \nbeen sent.\n  Here is one, June 1, 2007, to Senator Leahy and Senator Specter. This \nis from the adjutant general of the Mississippi National Guard, MG \nHarold Cross. He mentions his experiences with Judge Southwick in Iraq. \nHe started with a story I had not heard until I read this letter \nearlier today:\n\n       Lieutenant Colonel Southwick joined the Army Reserve in \n     1992--obtaining an age waiver to allow him to join; even \n     though he knew from the outset his age would necessarily \n     prohibit him from serving long enough to vest a military \n     pension. In 1997, then-Captain Southwick transferred into the \n     Mississippi National Guard.\n       While Lieutenant Colonel Southwick was originally assigned \n     to what was then called State Area Command, in 2003, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Southwick volunteered to transfer into the \n     155th Separate Armor Brigade, a line combat unit. This was a \n     courageous move; as it was widely known at the time that the \n     155th was nearly certain to mobilize for overseas duty in the \n     near future.\n\n  He then goes on to talk about the leadership, the military \nleadership, the assets and qualities that he brought to the 155th \nBrigade Combat Team on active duty near Najaf in Iraq.\n  He served, as my remarks indicated, as staff judge advocate for the \n155th, and it was located at Forward Operating Base Kalsu.\n  After his service in Iraq, Lieutenant Colonel Southwick transferred \nback to Joint Force Headquarters of the Mississippi National Guard. He \nmakes this comment--General Cross does--in closing--\n\n       While there are many core qualities critical to a \n     successful military officer, one attribute I have found \n     particularly important during my many years of service is \n     sound temperament. In that regard, Lieutenant Colonel \n     Southwick has both a considerate and measured personality. I \n     can tell you without hesitation that I have always found \n     Lieutenant Colonel Southwick to treat everyone with whom he \n     comes into contact with both kindness and respect.\n\n  Another letter, this one from a young lawyer with Brunini, Grantham, \nGrower & Hewes, the firm where Leslie Southwick practiced law for a \nnumber of years. This letter is addressed to Senator Arlen Specter.\n\n       Dear Senator Specter:\n       I am an African-American partner at the law firm of \n     Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC, where Judge \n     Southwick was once a member. I believe in fairness for all \n     people and salute our leaders for giving their lives to \n     assure that fairness. While I share the sentiments of other \n     African-Americans that the federal judiciary needs to be more \n     diverse, I believe that Judge Southwick is imminently \n     qualified for the United States Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals and write in support of his nomination.\n       I met Judge Southwick during my third year of law school \n     when I interned with the Court of Appeals of Mississippi. \n     That internship allowed me an opportunity to work with most \n     of the Judges on the bench at that time. I was most impressed \n     with Judge Southwick because of his work ethic and his serene \n     personality. When I finished law school in 1996, I believed \n     that my chances for landing a clerkship were slim because \n     there was only one African-American Court of Appeals judge on \n     the bench at the time and there were very few Caucasian \n     judges during the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or \n     the Court of Appeals (which was fairly new) who had ever \n     hired African-American law clerks. In spite of the odds, I \n     applied for a clerkship. Judge Southwick granted me an \n     interview and hired me the same day. While Judge Southwick \n     had many applicants to choose from, he saw that I was \n     qualified for the position and granted me the opportunity.\n       During my tenure as clerk with the Court, Judge Southwick \n     thought through every issue and took every case seriously. He \n     earned a reputation for his well thought out opinions and his \n     ability to produce the highest number of opinions in a term. \n     It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color, or \n     stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge \n     Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly. Judge \n     Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the \n     discussions of issues presented for decision. Having worked \n     closely with Judge Southwick, I have no doubt that he is \n     fair, impartial, and has all the other qualities necessary to \n     be an excellent addition to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       In addition to serving our State, Judge Southwick has also \n     honorably served our country. During his mission to Iraq in \n     2005, Southwick found the time to write me often to let me \n     know about his experiences there. Upon his return to the \n     United States, Judge Southwick shared with others his \n     humbling experience serving our country. It is clear from his \n     writings and speaking that he served with pride and dignity.\n       Over the years, Judge Southwick has earned the reputation \n     of being a person of high morals, dignity, and fairness. It \n     is unfortunate that there are some who have made him the \n     chosen sacrifice to promote agendas and have set out to taint \n     all that Judge Southwick has worked so hard to accomplish. I \n     am prayerful that those efforts will not preclude Judge \n     Southwick from serving as our next judge on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Yours truly, Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, A. L'Verne \n     Edney\n\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other letters. There are two \nfrom the School of Law, Mississippi College where Judge Southwick has \nbeen a member of the faculty. One is from the\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\ndean of the law school. Another is from the associate dean, Phillip \nMcIntosh. I was impressed with his strong feeling that comes through in \nthis letter that I detected and interpreted.\n\n       Judge Southwick is a man--\n\n  And this is to Senator Specter and to Senator Leahy. He wrote each \nthe same letter, dated June 4--\n\n       Judge Southwick is a man of highest integrity, honor and \n     intellect. As a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, he \n     scrupulously did his judicial duty in following the law in \n     his judicial opinions. I am greatly disappointed that some \n     have taken the opportunity to try to score political points \n     by characterizing Judge Southwick as intolerant or having \n     ``very fixed, right-wing world view,'' seeking to imply that \n     he would not be fair and impartial in applying the law. In my \n     personal and professional dealings with him, I can attest to \n     his fine character. I have not the slightest doubt regarding \n     his impartiality and commitment to fairness.\n       As an example of the regard with which Judge Southwick is \n     held by the law faculty at Mississippi College, he was \n     offered a position as a visiting faculty member following his \n     resignation as a judge for the Mississippi Court of Appeals \n     and pending the approval of his nomination with the Fifth \n     Circuit. The suggestion to make this offer was made by one of \n     our faculty members and the recommendation was unanimously \n     approved by our faculty. We have a politically and racially \n     diverse faculty, but not one note of concern about Judge \n     Southwick's integrity, fairness, or impartiality was sounded. \n     His appointment to our faculty was strongly supported by all \n     of our faculty members. I might even mention that his \n     teaching partner for trial practice this past semester is an \n     African American attorney and former Mississippi Circuit \n     Court judge whom Judge Southwick personally recruited to \n     partner with him for the course.\n       I hope that you will support the nomination of this \n     outstanding man to the Fifth Circuit. He is an exceptional \n     candidate and deserving of confirmation.\n\n  There are other letters similar in tone. Here is one from--I couldn't \nhelp but notice--the University of Mississippi School of Law, the Law \nCenter at the university where I graduated from law school, and it is \nwritten by John Bradley. It caught my attention because John Bradley \nwas a law student when I was a law student. John Robin Bradley is what \nwe called him then. He is now a professor of law at Ole Miss. He was \none of the most liberal members of the faculty when he joined the \nfaculty, and he has lived up to that tradition very proudly ever since.\n  I have a very high regard for John Bradley. He was editor in chief of \nthe Law Journal, and when I was a first-year student, I had the honor \nof being invited to go to a Law Journal conference at William and Mary \nwith John Robin and then the next editor to be, and I kept thinking I \nhad just been anointed and I would be in line to be editor in chief \nalso. That wasn't to be, but let me just say this: I am not sure John \nRobin Bradley has ever voted for me. He probably hasn't because I am a \nRepublican and he is a very serious-minded Democrat. But here is a \nletter he wrote to Pat Leahy--and he also gave a copy to Arlen \nSpecter--about Leslie Southwick, judicial nominee, dated June 5, 2007:\n\n       Gentlemen:\n       I write to comment to you and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary on the judicial and legal ability of Leslie \n     Southwick. I do so not in generalities but in the context \n     that I especially know about. It is my hope that this \n     specific information will give you insight into how he has \n     undertaken his role as a judge.\n       My detailed knowledge of Leslie Southwick's work as a judge \n     on the Court of Appeals of Mississippi concerns the law of \n     workers' compensation and its important overlap with other \n     areas of law, principally tort law. For a number of years I \n     have taught and written about these topics. Consequently, I \n     pay extremely close attention to the court decisions. \n     Although based on statutes, this area of law has become \n     intricate and often complex, so much so that lawyers \n     specialize in the field in order to be effective.\n       When Judge Southwick started as a first-time judge with the \n     newly-created Court of Appeals, he and some other judges had \n     little or no experience with this area of law. This showed up \n     in several opinions that I considered to contain incorrect \n     analyses. In articles that I wrote and in oral presentations \n     at law conferences, I often detailed the reasons that I \n     regarded some of the opinions as incorrect, including \n     several that Judge Southwick wrote or concurred in.\n       My observation was that Judge Southwick recognized that he \n     and other judges needed to learn the intricacies and \n     complexities. He set about doing that. I saw him at all law \n     conferences at which I was a speaker, and I know he read and \n     often cited my publications. Sometimes he agreed and \n     sometimes he disagreed with my explanations, but the point \n     is--\n\n  And this is in italics--\n\n       But the point is that he challenged himself to learn about \n     a field of law in which he had no previous experience, topics \n     which came to his court frequently.\n       His court heard appeals in all areas of law, and we expect \n     broad institutional competence. Lawyers do not come to the \n     bench with all-encompassing experience, but the good ones can \n     and will learn. This is no small task. Judge Southwick--\n\n  And this again is in italics--\n\n       Judge Southwick rose to the challenge by hard work, legal \n     ability, and dedication. I saw him struggle and I saw the \n     evidence of his learning about this field.\n       This is what we hope for in our judges. Judge Southwick did \n     this and earned my respect for his legal and judicial \n     ability. My expectation is that he will continue on this path \n     as a judge.\n\n  That is the end of the italics.\n\n       In my view his achievement in this regard is a significant \n     indicator that he has what it takes to be a good judge, one \n     of those humans to whom we entrust our halls of justice.\n       Sincerely yours, John R. Bradley, Professor\n\n  This next letter is written in hand--handwritten--by Kay Cobb. Kay \nCobb is the presiding justice of the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The \nletter is written to Senator Arlen Specter in reference to Judge Leslie \nH. Southwick.\n\n       Dear Senator Specter.\n       This letter is enthusiastically written to urge you and the \n     Committee to confirm Leslie H. Southwick to serve on the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I've known him for many years \n     and I'm honored to give him my highest recommendation without \n     reservation. In every way he is worthy to serve.\n       Judge Southwick's scholarship and character are stellar. \n     The opinions he wrote during his 10 years on the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals reflect his thoroughness and fairness, as \n     well as the depth of his knowledge and the quality and \n     clarity of his reasoning and writing.\n       In every respect of his legal career and life in general, \n     Leslie Southwick has excelled. He has a long and consistent \n     record as a devoted family man, a courageous military leader, \n     an accomplished author, and an excellent appellate judge. His \n     awareness and attention to promoting fairness and equality \n     with regard to race and gender are exemplary.\n       Our country needs conscientious and independent judges of \n     impeccable integrity, and I cannot think of anyone--\n\n  And she underlines ``anyone''--\n\n     who is better qualified for this appointment.\n       Sincerely, Kay B. Cobb, Presiding Justice, Supreme Court of \n     Mississippi.\n\n  There are other letters. I am not going to prolong my remarks. This \nis one from the dean of the Law School where he is on the faculty, \nanother from one of his former partners. This one may be a little \ndifferent. John Henegan--here is another Democrat, I think. I hope he \nis not upset with me for publicly identifying him in that way. He is a \nbright guy, widely respected. I know him. He has written a letter that \ntalks about:\n\n       One area where we have not worked closely together--\n\n  He is addressing Arlen Specter--\n\n       One area where we have not worked closely together is in \n     the political arena.\n\n  I was right.\n\n       I am a life long member of the Democratic party at all \n     levels of the political spectrum; namely, local, county \n     State, and Federal, and I have previously served as the Chief \n     of Staff and Executive Assistant to the former governor of \n     Mississippi who is also a life long Democrat. Accordingly, \n     although I am not qualified to call myself what we \n     affectionately refer to around here as a ``yellow dog \n     democrat,'' because I have at least on a handful of occasions \n     voted for a Republican candidate for public office, it is \n     very fair to say that I have never been a supporter of the \n     Republican Party or many of its policies, positions, or for \n     that matter certain Federal judicial nominees submitted to \n     the United States Senate in the past.\n       In this context, I have been reading what has been said and \n     written about the qualifications of Leslie for this current \n     post, including an editorial in yesterday's New York Times, \n     and I cannot disagree more strongly with the personal attacks \n     that are being made against his character, integrity, or \n     fitness for office, or about his commitment to civil rights \n     for all people, regardless of their race, color, sex, creed, \n     religion, or national origin. It is an abomination that he \n     should have to experience these unfair and unjust personal \n     attacks, because they are quite simply untrue and cannot be \n     made by anyone who has had the opportunity to meet, work, or \n     be around Leslie for even an abbreviated period of time.\n       In his many years of public service at the State and \n     Federal level, Leslie has served his State and his Nation \n     with honor and distinction at sacrifice to his personal gain. \n     I candidly can think of no one whom I would trust more to \n     carry out the oath of office that he will be required to take \n     and to uphold the\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\n     laws of and Constitution of the United States if he is \n     confirmed by the United States Senate.\n       I respectfully urge you to confirm his nomination. \n     Respectfully Submitted, John C. Henegan.\n\n  I am not going to read all of the letters, Madam President. I know \nothers may want to speak on the legislation that is pending before the \nSenate.\n  This one is from a fellow member of the Mississippi Army National \nGuard. They were deployed together in Iraq recently and his observation \nis that ``he shouldered a heavy load of regular JAG duties, which he \nperformed excellently.'' He talked about Southwick being a kind and \ncourageous man, being in a combat zone with him, and how it was \nstressful and challenging. He said:\n\n       Leslie always listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently \n     and treated them with the utmost respect and kindness. He did \n     this not just out of a sense of duty but because he is a \n     genuinely good and caring person.\n\n  This is from Norman Gene Hortman, Jr. He is from Laurel, MS, a lawyer \nwith his own law firm there, a very respected person in our State.\n  There are other letters. I thought you might be interested in this \none. It is from Jose Cantu. He is writing Chairman Leahy. This is a \ncopy of his letter:\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy.\n       I read recently in the Houston Chronicle about the \n     nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The article was \n     questioning his character in light of a case in a Mississippi \n     appellate court involving a racial incident where a ruling \n     was in favor of a white plaintiff. Since I grew up with Judge \n     Southwick in Edinburg, Texas, located in the Rio Grande \n     Valley, I was shocked to read about the opposition to his \n     nomination on this basis. I was a classmate of Judge \n     Southwick in high school and knew him very well. I always \n     found him to be extremely polite and absolutely fair with \n     everyone. What the paper and the political activist \n     referenced in the article imply is that Judge Southwick is a \n     racist because of the ruling on the Court. This is absolutely \n     ridiculous and totally unfair. The Valley has a large \n     Hispanic population, and Leslie never showed the type of \n     discriminatory attitudes that are implied in the article. To \n     the contrary, I remember him as treating everyone fairly and \n     with respect.\n       What was equally disturbing in the Chronicle article was \n     LULAC's opposition to the nomination. Being a Hispanic \n     American, my immediate and extended family want to voice our \n     strong disagreement with LULAC on this issue. Since this \n     organization is portrayed by the media to speak for all \n     Hispanics, I want your office to know that it does not. My \n     family and I wholeheartedly support the nomination of Judge \n     Southwick. It is apparent from the article that LULAC has no \n     first-hand knowledge of Judge Southwick's character or \n     integrity, but merely wanted to jump on the bandwagon and \n     oppose this nomination because it was submitted by President \n     Bush. Growing up in the Valley, both my family and I have \n     been lifelong Democrats. Now I live in Houston and am \n     beginning to believe that politically motivated actions, like \n     opposition to the nomination of this fine individual and \n     jurist, will force many of us to seek the Republican Party as \n     a viable alternative. I respectfully request that you support \n     the nomination of Judge Southwick and confirm his appointment \n     for the Court of Appeals.\n       Sincerely, Jose Alberto Cantu, CPA, PrimeWay Federal Credit \n     Union.\n\n  Here is someone I noticed because she has been an active Democrat all \nher adult life, a good friend of mine, Kathryn H. Hester, a shareholder \nin the Jackson, MS, law firm of Watkins Ludlam Winter & Stennis. You \nhave heard of Winter and Stennis. You may have heard of Watkins and \nLudlam. They are both deceased. It reads:\n\n       Re: Nomination of Leslie Southwick for the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy.\n       I write in support of my colleague Leslie Southwick's \n     nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit. You will have before you Leslie's resume. It \n     is outstanding, and it reflects both a sense of duty and an \n     intelligence appropriate for service as an appellate judge.\n       Judge Southwick succeeded me as President of the Charles \n     Clark Inn of Court--named for the former Chief Judge for the \n     Fifth Circuit for whom Leslie clerked after law school. \n     Leslie was selected to that position by trial and defense \n     lawyers of the utmost professional skill and integrity.\n       Leslie is diligent in performing his obligations, he is \n     smart, he has integrity, and he is temperate in his actions \n     and decisions. Leslie is passionate about love of country, \n     his alma mater's baseball team (Rice), and his adopted State, \n     Mississippi.\n       If a man of intelligence, temperance and integrity, who has \n     served his country, his State, and his profession honorably \n     and with dignity, is not qualified to be on the court of \n     appeals, then the process is faulty. The legal profession and \n     the parties who will depend on his intelligence and his \n     integrity deserve to have a person of his caliber on the \n     court.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       Sincerely yours,\n       Kathryn H. Hester,\n       Shareholder.\n\n  Madam President, I think I have read enough letters. I didn't mean to \nread as many as I did. But I hope that Senators will see from these \nletters they are not form letters organized by any political party or \nany special interest group. These are letters that were written because \npeople care about and know about Leslie Southwick and are convinced he \nis being treated unfairly by the Senate if he is not confirmed.\n  I know the Judiciary Committee has had a hearing. I was pleased to \nintroduce Leslie Southwick at that time, with my colleague Senator \nLott. It never occurred to me at any moment that there would be any \nquestion raised about his integrity, his sense of fairness, his \nqualifications, or his fitness to serve as a U.S. Court of Appeals \njudge during the consideration by the Senate of this nomination. The \nfact that I feel obliged to be here on the floor, after I had made my \ncomments about how I thought he was a good choice to serve on the \ncourt, is probably superfluous. I apologize if anybody is bored by \nthese remarks. But I hope you can sense the sincerity and seriousness \nof purpose of those who have written and the high quality of the people \nwho authored these letters.\n\n  To me, it is a dark and sad day in the Senate if one of its \ncommittees, the Judiciary Committee, is considering recommending that \nJudge Southwick not be confirmed for service on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. It is unthinkable. But from information I have gotten from \nthose who talked to all of the members of the committee on the \nDemocratic side, that might happen. I don't know when a meeting is \nscheduled or when that is going to occur, but I hope there is an \nopportunity for reflection and careful consideration of action before \nthat meeting does occur. I served my first 2 years in the Senate on the \nJudiciary Committee. I succeeded Jim Eastland, who had been chairman of \nthe committee, when he retired from the Senate. That was in the Carter \nadministration, and we had a lot of hot-button issues come before the \ncommittee. It was an interesting challenge to be on the committee \nduring such a period of national transition. Alan Simpson and I were \ntwo junior Republicans on the committee that year.\n  I guess the point is, I listened to presentations made before the \ncommittee for judicial nominees. I was observing and we were living \nthrough the transition in the South--the integration of organizations, \nof schools, of churches, on and on. It was a very challenging time in \nthe history of our country. Ted Kennedy had just become chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. It was a pleasure to serve and get to know all the \npeople on the committee at the time. But I also remember thinking \nsomewhere along after about 6 months of experience on the committee \nthat maybe the best thing I could do for my career in the Senate was \nget the heck off the Judiciary Committee and get on something a little \nmore attractive from a political standpoint. So as it happened, it \nworked out that 2 years later I was able to move to the Appropriations \nCommittee. I gave up that seat on the Judiciary Committee to do so. I \nhave always felt a special kinship for the members of that committee, \nknowing about the workload, the volume of information that has to be \nprocessed by the members to stay up to date with the legislation that \nis referred to the Judiciary Committee. So I have an appreciation for \nthe challenges that are faced and particularly on a nomination that \ncomes along that is not from your State, not from your area of the \ncountry. You take a look at what the facts are, make a decision, and \nmove along.\n  Well, I hope the Judiciary Committee will take another look at this \nnomination and look at what has been said about the nominee and his \nqualifications, and look at his entire career, which has been one that \nhas reflected good judgment, a concern for his fellow citizens, whether \nthey are Black, White, or Hispanic, or whether they are Democrats or \nRepublicans. He is the ideal choice for this kind of job. And to \nabsolutely contrive reasons to persuade others to vote against the \nnominee creates a bad feeling and a sense of unfairness that is \npervading the body.\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\n  Madam President, I have said enough.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I did read from be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of Mississippi, Military Department, Office of the \n           Adjutant General, Jackson, MS, June 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing you concerning Leslie H. \n     Southwick, who serves under my command as a Lieutenant \n     Colonel in the Mississippi National Guard. During my tenure \n     as Adjutant General, I have had the pleasure coming to know \n     LTC Southwick personally.\n       LTC Southwick joined the Army Reserve in 1992--obtaining an \n     age waiver to allow him to join; even though he knew from the \n     outset his age would necessarily prohibit him from serving \n     long enough to vest a military pension. In 1997, then-Captain \n     Southwick transferred into the Mississippi National Guard.\n       While LTC Southwick was originally assigned to what was \n     then called State Area Command, in 2003, Southwick \n     volunteered to transfer into the 155th Separate Armor \n     Brigade, a line combat unit. This was a courageous move; as \n     it was widely known at the time that the 155th was nearly \n     certain to mobilize for overseas duty in the near future.\n       In fact, in August 2004, the 155th mobilized for duty in \n     support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, as the 155th Brigade \n     Combat Team. From August 2004 to January 2006, LTC Southwick \n     served on active duty, distinguishing himself as Deputy Staff \n     Advocate at Forward Operating Base Duke near Najaf--and later \n     as Staff Judge Advocate for the 155th, located at Forward \n     Operating Base Kalsu. After his service in Iraq, LTC \n     Southwick transferred back to Joint Force Headquarters, \n     Mississippi National Guard.\n       Both before and after his service in Operation Iraq \n     Freedom, LTC Southwick has worked directly with me on \n     numerous matters of significance to the Guard. I have always \n     found his counsel sound, his bearing exemplary, his judgment \n     exceptional and his character beyond reproach.\n       While there are many core qualities critical to a \n     successful military officer, one attribute I have found \n     particularly important during my many years of service is \n     sound temperament. In that regard, LTC Southwick has both a \n     considerate and measured personality. I can tell you without \n     hesitation that I have always found LTC Southwick to treat \n     everyone with whom he comes into contact with both kindness \n     and respect.\n       I hope you find this information useful, as you consider \n     matters coming before your Committee. Thank you for \n     permitting me the opportunity to correspond with you \n     concerning LTC Southwick.\n                                                  Harold A. Cross,\n     Major General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Mississippi College,\n\n                                        Jackson, MS, June 4, 2007.\n     Re The Honorable Leslie Southwick.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to you to express my \n     strong support for the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have known Judge Southwick \n     for several years while he has been an adjunct professor and \n     visiting professor at Mississippi College School of Law. As \n     Associate Dean, Hiring of adjuncts comes under my \n     responsibilities for the law school. We have been honored to \n     have him on our faculty and look forward to a long and \n     beneficial relationship with him. Our students likewise hold \n     judge Southwick in highest regard.\n       Judge Southwick is a man of highest integrity, honor and \n     intellect. As a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals he \n     scrupulously did his judicial duty in following the law in \n     his judicial opinions. I am greatly disappointed that some \n     have taken the opportunity to try to score political points \n     by characterizing Judge Southwick as intolerant or having \n     ``very fixed, right-wing world view,'' seeking to imply that \n     he would not be fair and impartial in applying the law. In my \n     personal and professional dealings with him, I can attest to \n     his fine character. I have not the slightest doubt regarding \n     his impartiality and commitment to fairness.\n       Judge Southwick would make an outstanding judge for the \n     Fifth Circuit. I know that the will uphold the law and apply \n     it regardless of his personal view on a particular subject. \n     He is a very thoughtful man, a true scholar. I also know that \n     he is not racist and does not hold racist views. Such an \n     allegation is ludicrous, insulting, and without foundation.\n       As an example of the regard with which Judge Southwick is \n     held by the law faculty at Mississippi College, he was \n     offered a position as a visiting faculty member following his \n     resignation as a judge for the Mississippi Court of Appeals \n     and pending the approval of his nomination to the Fifth \n     Circuit. The suggestion to make this offer was made by one of \n     our faculty members, and the recommendation was unanimously \n     approved by our faculty.\n       We have a politically and racially diverse faculty, but not \n     one note of concern about Judge Southwick's integrity, \n     fairness, or impartiality was sounded. His appointment to our \n     faculty was strongly supported by all of our faculty members. \n     I might even mention that his teaching partner for Trial \n     Practice this pass semester is an African American attorney \n     and former Mississippi Circuit Court Judge, and whom Judge \n     Southwick personally recruited to partner with him for the \n     course.\n       I hope that you will support the nomination of this \n     outstanding man to the Fifth Circuit. He is an exceptional \n     candidate and deserving of confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Phillip L. McIntosh,\n     Associate Dean and Professional of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Butler, Snow,\n\n                                        Jackson, MS, June 6, 2007.\n     Re Nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States Court \n         of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is written in support of the \n     nomination of Honorable Leslie Southwick as a Circuit Judge \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n     I have known Leslie for over 30 years, since August of 1976, \n     when he and I served as law clerks to the Honorable Charles \n     Clark, then Circuit Judge on the Fifth Circuit. I have worked \n     with him professionally both in that capacity and in \n     connection with local area bar association activities and \n     have also appeared before the Mississippi Court of Appeals \n     while he served as an appellate judge there and followed and \n     read not only many of his judicial opinions but his scholarly \n     legal articles as well. He and I corresponded several times \n     while he served his country in the current war in Iraq.\n       One area where we have not worked closely together is in \n     the political arena. I am a life long member of the \n     Democratic party at all levels of the political spectrum, \n     namely, local, county, state, and federal, and I have \n     previously served as the Chief of Staff and Executive \n     Assistant to a former Governor of Mississippi who is also a \n     life long Democrat. Accordingly, although I am not qualified \n     to call myself what we affectionately refer to here as a \n     ``yellow dog democrat'' (because I have on at least a handful \n     of occasions voted for a Republican candidate for public \n     office), it is very fair to say that I have never been a \n     supporter of the Republican party or many of its policies, \n     positions, or, for that matter, certain Federal judicial \n     nominees submitted to the United States Senate in the past.\n       In this context, I have been reading what has been said and \n     written about the qualifications of Leslie for this current \n     post, including the editorial in yesterday's New York Times, \n     and I can not disagree more strongly with the personal \n     attacks that are being made against his character, integrity, \n     or fitness for office, or about his commitment to civil \n     rights for all people regardless of their race, color, sex, \n     creed, religion, or national origin. It is an abomination \n     that he should have to experience these unfair and unjust \n     personal attacks because they are quite simply untrue and \n     cannot be made by anyone who has had the opportunity to meet, \n     work, or be around Leslie for even an abbreviated period of \n     time.\n       In his many years of public service at the State and \n     Federal level, Leslie has served his State and his Nation \n     with honor and distinction at sacrifice to his personal gain. \n     I candidly can think of no one whom I would trust more to \n     carry out the oath of office that he will be required to take \n     and to uphold the laws and Constitution of the United States \n     if he is confirmed by the United States Senate. I \n     respectfully urge you to confirm his nomination.\n       Thank you for considering my views and opinions in this \n     matter and for your service to our Nation.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     John C. Henegan.\n                                  ____\n\n         Hortman Harlow Martindale Bassi Robinson & McDaniel, \n           PLLC, Attorneys at Law,\n                                         Laurel, MS, June 6, 2007.\n     Re Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States \n         Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Specter: Thank you for the \n     opportunity to offer my opinion regarding the nomination of \n     Judge Leslie Southwick to the United States Fifth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       I am a practicing attorney in a small law firm in Laurel, \n     Mississippi. I am also a Lt. Col. in the Mississippi Army \n     National Guard. I have known Leslie Southwick by reputation \n     as a practicing attorney and appellate judge and personally \n     for almost ten (10) years as a fellow officer in the National \n     Guard. Leslie Southwick and I also served together in Iraq in \n     2005 with the 155th Brigade Combat Team of the Mississippi \n     Army National Guard. Therefore, I feel that I am qualified to \n     express an opinion about Leslie Southwick's suitability for \n     the Fifth Circuit.\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\n       Leslie Southwick is a superb nominee. He is brilliant, \n     able, dedicated to the profession, experienced as a lawyer, \n     judge, military officer, husband and father, well respected \n     among his peers, thoughtful, fair, hard working, honest, good \n     humored, and patient. In my opinion, he is the finest person \n     you could nominate for the position.\n       Leslie Southwick is also a kind and courageous man. As you \n     know, service in a combat zone is stressful and challenging, \n     often times bringing out the best or worst in a person. \n     Leslie Southwick endured mortar and rocket attacks, travel \n     through areas plagued with IEDs, extremes in temperature, \n     harsh living conditions, sometimes bad chow, seeing the same \n     ugly mugs everyday--the typical stuff of Iraq. He shouldered \n     a heavy load of regular JAG Officer duties which he performed \n     excellently. He also took on the task of handling the claims \n     of the numerous Iraqi civilians who had been injured or had \n     property losses due to accidents involving the U.S. Military \n     in our area of operations. This involved long days of \n     interviewing Iraqi civilian claimants, many of whom were \n     children, widows and elderly people to determine whether the \n     U.S. Military could pay their claims. Leslie always listened \n     to these Iraqi claimants patiently and treated them with the \n     utmost respect and kindness. He did this not just out of a \n     sense of duty but because he is a genuinely good and caring \n     person. His attitude left a very positive impression on all \n     those that Leslie came in contact with, especially, the Iraqi \n     civilians he helped. This in turn helped ease tensions in our \n     unit's area of operations while it was in Iraq and, \n     ultimately, saved American lives. And, throughout his \n     service, he was always cheerful and encouraging. Adversity \n     and challenge bring out the best in him.\n       He has the right stuff for the job--profound intelligence, \n     good judgment, broad experience, and an unblemished \n     reputation. I know him and can say these things without \n     reservation. Anyone who says otherwise simply does not know \n     him.\n       I understand that the Committee's vote on Leslie \n     Southwick's nomination is to take place tomorrow and that I \n     need to get this letter in to you without delay. Therefore, I \n     will conclude by saying that Leslie Southwick would make an \n     excellent judge for the United States Fifth Circuit and that \n     all of your Committee members would look back with pride that \n     they had the wisdom and good judgment to approve his \n     nomination.\n       You may call me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Norman Gene Hortman, Jr.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator Robert Byrd, for allowing me to go first to make \na few comments about the importance of education and the bill we are \nconsidering on the floor today, the Higher Education Access Act of \n2007.\n  First, when we talk about education, it ought not to be lost on any \nMember of the Chamber that educational opportunity is the keystone to \nsuccess for all of us in America. In my own personal story, my parents \nnever had an opportunity to go to college or to get a college degree. \nAnd in my family, though we were poor and we grew up without a lot of \nmaterial wealth, they were rich in spirit and believed in the \nfundamental values that have made America great. They believed in hard \nwork and in faith. They believed the community was there for an \nimportant reason. They understood, without a doubt, that education was \nin fact the keystone to success.\n  I often remember sitting there at the ranch in southern Colorado, \nalmost 300 miles south of Denver, with a kerosene lamp on the table and \nthe eight siblings around the table and my father and mother making \nsure we were doing our homework. My father would say to all of us: I \ncannot leave you large ranches or riches, but the one thing I can make \nsure I give to you is an education. It is perhaps because of his \nteachings and his understanding of the promise of America that all \neight of his and my mother's children became part of the American \ndream. All eight became first-generation college graduates, and today I \nstand on the floor of the Senate as a Senator. I have a brother, \nCongressman Salazar, who is in the House of Representatives, also \nserving our great Nation and serving the State of Colorado.\n\n  As I think about those educational achievements we have had, it would \nnot have happened were it not for the promise of America, the programs \nthat have been created by so many people who came before me.\n  I was on the floor earlier serving as Presiding Officer when Senator \nWhitehouse of Rhode Island spoke about Claiborne Pell. It is true that \nI was in Rhode Island not so long ago at an event when Senator \nClaiborne Pell arrived at this event. He was wheeled to the tent, in \nfact, in a wheelchair. Someone whispered to me that the person who just \narrived on the scene was none other than Claiborne Pell. It was for the \nfirst time that I connected the dots. I remember going through college \nand receiving Pell grants that allowed me the opportunity to go to \ncollege. But I never knew that the term ``Pell'' was somehow associated \nwith someone who actually sat two desks to my left here at one point in \ntime. That is the great Senator Claiborne Pell from the State of Rhode \nIsland who came up with the idea that the promise of America was \nsomehow embedded in the opportunity to receive a good education.\n  He believed, as many of us here believe, that economic barriers \nshould not be the reason why someone does not advance in higher \neducation. Everyone who wants to go into higher education should have \nthat opportunity to do so. Yet, somehow today when we look at the \nreality of America, the fact is the educational opportunity that was \nthere for me and hundreds of thousands of my generation is being slowly \ntaken away from our American youngsters. We have been headed in the \nwrong direction, and it is for that reason that this legislation, which \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and the members of the HELP Committee, \nwith a vote of 17 to 3, was brought to the floor of the Senate today.\n  I am proud to be a supporter, a strong supporter, of this legislation \nbecause it will keep hope alive in America with the American dream that \nresults from the education that is provided to the people of our great \nNation.\n  When we look at what is happening today in terms of educational \nopportunities for Americans, it is getting harder and harder for our \nyoung people to access higher education. Madam President, 400,000 \ntalented, qualified students each year--that is 400,000--decide they \ncannot go on to higher education because of economic barriers--400,000 \ntalented young Americans, successful young Americans who should have an \nopportunity to go on to higher education.\n  That is what this bill is all about. This bill is about tearing down \nthose barriers so that these young people, these 400,000 talented young \npeople have an opportunity to be a part of the American dream.\n  When one looks at what has been happening over the last several years \nas we have invested and continue to invest in education, the fact is we \nhave not invested enough. The fact is, when we look at the statistics, \nwhile we have invested in educational opportunities and access to \nhigher education, the investment has been a flat investment. So by the \ntime we take into account general inflation and particularly the high \nrate of inflation in higher education, we have been on a roadway that \nhas been disinvesting in opportunities for the young people of America.\n  If we look at the white lines on this chart, what they show is what \nthe maximum Pell grant has been from 2001 to 2007. We essentially see a \nflat line across right at about $4,000.\n  During that same time period, we see what has happened with respect \nto the cost of education. We have gone from a point of a little over \n$8,000 to an average of over $13,000. The gap has increased. We had a \ngap of $5,282 in 2001, and today the gap is $8,700. What has happened \nin the last 5 years, as a good friend of mine from the University of \nMichigan calls it, is the disinvestment in America's future. What we \nare doing is taking away opportunities for the young people of America. \nThe bill before us today rights that wrong and puts us in the right \ndirection to investing in the education of our young people.\n  This legislation is important because it raises the maximum Pell \ngrant to $5,100 next year. It is about time. It is about time we do \nthat. We have waited far too long to increase Pell grants for young \npeople.\n  Secondly, it provides loan forgiveness for those borrowers who serve \nin areas of national interest--those values of early childhood \neducation, librarians, highly qualified teachers, speech language \npathologists, and others. It makes sure we provide loan forgiveness for \nthose people who decide to take jobs to serve others.\n  In addition, the program creates a forgiveness of a balance due on \ndirect\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\nloans by borrowers who have been public sector employees for 10 years \nand who have made 120 income-contingent payments on their loans.\n  The legislation also makes Federal loan payments by student borrowers \ncontingent by capping payments of 15 percent of an individual's income \nand allowing those borrowers to have their loans forgiven after 20 \nyears of payments.\n  This is an important issue, particularly when we see how much debt is \nbeing put on the saddles of young Americans as they are graduating from \ncollege and graduate schools. There are a number of other provisions in \nthis legislation that are very important.\n  Finally, with respect to my own State of Colorado, I want my own \nState, as every Senator here, to make sure we are providing a maximum \nopportunity for young people, and these programs I mentioned will do \nthat. For the State of Colorado, this means we will have $320 million \nmore in student aid over the next 5 years.\n  I am proud of this legislation. I am proud of my colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, on the HELP Committee who have brought this \nlegislation forward. I urge my colleagues to support it wholeheartedly \nas part of making sure that the American dream we live today is a dream \nthat this generation and other generations behind it will be able to \nachieve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                              dog fighting\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, for several days--for several days--the \nnews has been saturated with stories about the indictment of a well-\nknown professional football player for running a dog-fighting \noperation. I am not going to comment on that particular case. The man \nhas been accused. He has not been convicted. We must wait until all the \nfacts are in and a verdict is rendered. The man cited in these recent \nnews stories is innocent until proven guilty, and Lord help him if he \nis proven to be guilty in a court of law. We must wait for the justice \nsystem to run its course. But the facts are already in, and the verdict \nhas already been delivered.\n  What is it about? What is it about, Madam President? It is about the \nscourge of dog fighting in the United States--dog fighting in the \nUnited States. According to the Humane Society, there are about 40,000 \ndog-fighting operations in the United States. The deputy manager of \ndog-fighting issues for the Humane Society, John Goodman, points out, \n``. . . dog fighting is at an epidemic level'' in the United States. It \ninvolves urban areas as well as rural areas. It involves all sections \nof the country. It cuts across cultures and class and other socio and \neconomic differences.\n  Dog fighting continues even though all 50 States have laws on the \nbooks prohibiting dog fighting. Dog fighting is a Federal crime. Let me \nsay that again. Dog fighting is a Federal crime, and yet animal welfare \nofficials report that dog fighting is more popular today than ever. \nShame, shame, shame.\n  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars have all been at \nstake in the breeding, the training, and the selling of fighting dogs. \nHow inhuman, how dastardly.\n  Two dogs are placed in a pit and turned loose--turned loose--against \neach other. How inhuman, how cannibalistic, how sadistic. Let me read \nthat again.\n  Two dogs--God created the dog to be man's companion--two dogs are \nplaced in a pit--think of that--placed in a pit and turned loose \nagainst each other. And get this: the fight can go on for hours. The \nfight can go on for hours. Do you hear me? The fight can go on for \nhours. The poor dogs literally bite and rip the flesh off one another, \nand bets as high as $50,000 are placed. The brutality goes on until one \nof the poor dogs is seriously injured or killed. So the poor dog died--\ndied. The dog died. And for that reason, dog fighting is regarded as a \nblood sport. A blood sport. While bloody, Madam President, it is hardly \na sport. Hardly a sport.\n\n  It is a brutal, sadistic event motivated by barbarism of the worst \nsort and cruelty of the worst sadistic kind. One is left wondering: who \nare the real animals--the creatures inside the ring or the creatures \noutside the ring?\n  The depravity of dog fighting is a multimillion-dollar business that \ninvolves training innocent, vulnerable creatures to kill--to kill--and \nputting them in a ring to be killed or to kill for the entertainment \nand/or the profit of their owners and other spectators.\n  I have seen one individual in my lifetime electrocuted in the \nelectric chair--in my time. It is not a beautiful spectacle. So I can \nsay I could witness another one if it involves this cruel, sadistic, \ncannibalistic business of training innocent and vulnerable creatures to \nkill.\n  Undercover investigators who have infiltrated the dog-fighting ring \nhave found blood-soaked dogs with life-threatening injuries that are \nleft to die as soon as they are no longer able to compete. Undercover \ninvestigators have found dogs with ripped ears, torn lips, genitals \ndangling from their bodies, eyes swollen shut, and faces riddled with \npunctures so severe that they were barely able to breathe. How inhuman, \nhow inhuman, how sadistic.\n  Dogs that survive a fight often die days or even hours after the \nfight from blood loss, shock, dehydration, exhaustion, or infection. \nWhat a shame. What a shame.\n  If the losing dog survives the ordeal--get this--it is usually so \nmangled that it is no longer of any use and, therefore, it is put to \ndeath--put to death.\n  I have seen a human being put to death for killing another human \nbeing, but why a poor dog--a poor dog? If the losing dog survived the \nordeal it is usually so mangled that it is no longer of any use. How \nsad, sad, sad. It is put to death. Even the winner of a dog fight \ncommonly suffers from massive bleeding, ruptured lungs, broken bones, \nor other life-threatening injuries.\n  The training of these poor creatures--weigh those words--the training \nof these poor creatures to turn them into fighting machines is simply \nbarbaric--barbaric. Let that word resound from hill to hill and from \nmountain to mountain, from valley to valley across this broad land--\nbarbaric. May God help those poor souls who would be so cruel. \nBarbaric. Hear me. Barbaric. Such practices as starvation of the poor \nanimal to encourage malice, and beatings to build endurance are common. \nIt involves teaching the dog to maul by using smaller animals, such as \ncats or rabbits or small dogs as training bait.\n  The result of this most cruel business reaches beyond the fighting \nring itself. There are cases of dogs trained to kill that have broken \nloose and mauled human beings to death. It is reported that dog \nfighters often involve their children in their bloody activities, with \nsevere damaging psychological impact. What a sin. What a sin. Studies \nhave revealed that children exposed to dog fighting develop a greater \nacceptance of aggressive attitudes and behavior. They are taught to \nbelieve that violence--violence--is entertaining, and that it is OK to \ninflict the cruelties they have observed. Dog fighting, reports the \nHouston Chronicle, simply breeds violence.\n  Madam President, as a dog owner and a dog lover, I cannot even begin \nto understand how human beings can be so cruel to man's best friend. \nOver the centuries of time, these creatures of God have made a place in \nour hearts as well as in our homes. Dogs have endured as our devoted \ncompanions. They provide important emotional support to humans so that \nthe mere petting of these social creatures can lower blood pressure in \nhumans. Get that, Madam President? The mere petting of these social \ncreatures can lower blood pressure in humans. The affection that a dog \nprovides is unlimited, unqualified, and unconditional. Ever the loyal \ncompanion, dogs protect us, assist those of us with afflictions, and \nprovide hours of enjoyable companionship. Therefore, I take great \nsatisfaction in knowing that if the people allegedly involved in this \noutrageous business are found guilty, they will have to answer to our \njudicial system--and may God help their souls. Congress has made it a \nFederal crime to engage in dog fighting.\n\n  God, the one, eternal, everlasting God, made man caretaker of the \nEarth. God gave man the responsibility of tending to the natural world \nwith dominion over animal life. We honor God when we treat all of his \ncreatures responsibly and with decency and with respect.\n  The Book of Proverbs in the Holy Bible, King James Bible, tells us:\n\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\n\n       A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast, but the \n     tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.\n\n  The immortal Dante tells us that Divine justice reserves special \nplaces in hell for certain categories of sinners. I am confident that \nthe hottest places in hell are reserved for the souls of sick and \nbrutal people who hold God's creatures in such brutal and cruel \ncontempt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I am honored to follow Senator Byrd to \nthe floor. Today, as on so many other days in the Senate, we are \nreminded why he is not only our distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, but why he is so revered. We thank him for what he talked \nabout today.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n             Global Warming and Climate Change Legislation\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about one of the \nmost important issues facing our country, our world, and our children. \nThe issue is global warming due to climate change. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has a strong interest in this issue. We talked about it, and \nshe has with many of her constituents in Minnesota and beyond. I \nappreciate that commitment.\n  The problem, as you know, is so serious that it could physically and \nirrevocably change the world in which we live. I think we are \nconfronted today with a moral duty to preserve the environment, not \njust so we can have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, but \nbecause this world that we live in is in our care for our children and \nour children's children--God's creation itself.\n  In the State of Pennsylvania we have always held the environment in \nhigh regard. In our State, as in many States, we put it right in our \nconstitution. Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution \nreads as follows:\n\n       The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to \n     the preservation of the natural scenic, historic, and \n     esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania's public \n     natural resources are the common property of all the people, \n     including generations yet to come. As trustee of these \n     resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them \n     for the benefit of all the people.\n\n  That is what our State constitution says. As a public official from \nthat State, albeit in a Federal capacity, I feel an abiding obligation \nto give meaning to that constitutional directive through my work in the \nSenate. For all these reasons I firmly believe we must take action to \nslow, stop, and reverse our greenhouse gas emissions. The United States \nmust stand up as a leader in the international arena to stop global \nwarming.\n  I am not a scientist, and I do not claim to be an expert on \nscientific theories. But I do know something about some of the \nliterature that has been written the last couple of years. One thing I \nremember in particular, and this had a profound impact on me, is a very \nsimple statement, but it tells what we are dealing with here.\n  I remember reading back in 2005 that the percent of the Earth's \nsurface which has been subjected to drought has doubled since about \n1970. So in just about 35 years the percent of the Earth that had \ndrought has doubled. That alone should tell us what the stakes are. We \nknow what drought leads to. It leads to poverty and hunger and \nstarvation and death and darkness.\n  We know it from our recent history, the catastrophic storms and \nflooding, Katrina being an example of that; changes in habitat that \nthreaten species and the potential of a mini ice age in northern Europe \nif melting ice sheets disrupt ocean currents; major ecological changes \ntranslating into major sociopolitical changes. We know various \ncommittees in this Senate--the Foreign Relations Committee being one--\nare dealing with this issue as well, focusing on the implications of \nglobal warming to national security and the military readiness of our \ntroops.\n  There are so many examples. Even in Darfur, a terrible horror that we \nsee unfolding every day--part of that was caused by changes in our \nenvironment. Drought caused people to move into new areas, causing \nconflict.\n  Consider the implications of widespread global drought, storms, \ncoastal flooding, and crop failures among others.\n  Inflicting this future on the children of the world and the children \nof America is unimaginable, and I think unforgivable. Yet that is \nexactly what we are doing if we do not take action, the action we must \ntake. The evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming. \nGlobal warming exists, and human activities are a major factor.\n  The evidence--rising average temperatures, melting glaciers, shifts \nin migratory bird patterns--is telling us something. It is telling us \nthat we are failing in our duties as stewards of God's creation.\n  What shall we do about it? It is a question I have asked and so many \nothers have asked over the course of many months in this Senate and \nmany years. I spent, as did a lot of my colleagues, many hours talking \nwith what we might call stakeholders. People in the manufacturing \nfield, people who might own businesses, labor unions, \nenvironmentalists, scientists--all the way down the list of people and \ngroups that have an interest. They are all determined that a national \nclimate change program that we develop to combat it must accomplish a \nnumber of basic goals.\n  I will read quickly through about 10 of them:\n\n       Making mandatory greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n  The operative word there being ``mandatory,'' not voluntary.\n\n       No. 2. Reduce greenhouse gases at rates and levels \n     identified by international scientists at 80 percent by 2050.\n       No. 3. Take immediate actions to reduce emissions in the \n     short term.\n       No. 4. Reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions.\n       No. 5. Use a market-based approach to reduce emissions \n     while providing some stability in the market, specially in \n     the early years.\n       No. 6. Balance regional differences in the sources of \n     greenhouse gases and the solutions.\n       No. 7. Position the United States as a global leader on \n     climate change while bringing developing countries like \n     China, India, and Mexico to the table.\n       No. 8. Hold States accountable for their own carbon \n     consumption.\n       No. 9. Make major Federal investments in carbon capture and \n     storage research and clean coal technologies.\n       No. 10. Continue reducing other pollutants that pose \n     threats to public health.\n\n  Guided by these 10 principles, I am a cosponsor of three global \nwarming bills. The first is the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act \nintroduced by our colleagues, Senator Sanders and Senator Boxer. I \ncommend my distinguished colleagues from Vermont and California for \ndrafting such an important bill. I believe their bill will be the \nstarting point for the Senate's work on global warming. This \nlegislation makes strong and significant cuts to greenhouse gas \nemissions. The near-term goal of reducing emissions levels by the year \nof 2020 to 1990 levels is a good start, as is the long-term goal, \nmeaning reductions of 80 percent from 2006 levels by 2050.\n  We know the scientists must guide us in this work. We must not do any \nless than what the scientists tell us we need to do to prevent the \ncatastrophic changes in the Earth's atmosphere.\n  The second bill I am cosponsoring, the Low Carbon Economy Act, \nintroduced by Senators Bingaman and Specter--I applaud them for their \nwork in putting together a comprehensive and detailed piece of \nlegislation. Many of the things we will debate in this Senate will be \ncritically important to my home State of Pennsylvania. Any climate \nchange program must include a number of things: First of all, a \ndetailed proposal for a cap-and-trade program for carbon credits; \nsecond, measures to keep our manufacturers competitive--we must again \nbring our international trading partners to the table--and a commitment \nto provide some measure of stability to the new carbon economy.\n  The third and final bill I am cosponsoring is Senator Carper's Clean \nAir Planning Act. This legislation keeps other hazardous air pollutants \nat the forefront of our decision. Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and \nmercury continue to have deleterious effects on the health of \nPennsylvania and America, in terms of asthma in our children, harmful \nimpacts of mercury on early childhood development, and women's \nreproductive health.\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\n  All of this compels us to take action. Each of these bills does. Each \nof these bills has strengths that must be included in any climate \nchange proposal developed by the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand the full Senate.\n  I have discussed with Chairman Boxer her legislation. I appreciate \nher longstanding commitment to getting a climate bill to the Senate \nfloor. I commend, as well, I must say, her leadership on a wide range \nof environmental issues over many years. I thank her for her continuing \ncommitment to work with colleagues like me so we will be at the table \nto work on priorities for our country, as well as Pennsylvania's \npriorities in any chairman's mark on a climate bill.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join the call of the thousands of \npeople who have visited Capitol Hill and come to our offices to talk to \nus about global warming, not to mention the millions of Americans who \ncare very deeply about this issue--Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents alike, east and west, north and south. We have no time to \nwaste when dealing with the problem of this magnitude and gravity for \nour world.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor \nof the following legislation: S. 309, the Global Warming Pollution \nReduction Act; S. 1766, the Low Carbon Economy Act; and, S. 1177, the \nClean Air Planning Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow.) The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have moved along on the issues in \nthis bill and have heard from many of our colleagues. We've had a good \ndebate and discussion. Most of the members of our Education Committee \nand Human Resources Committee have spoken about this measure with very \nconsiderable knowledge and understanding and awareness and made a very \nstrong and convincing case.\n  I think we have had very good opportunity to talk in considerable \nlength and detail about this proposal. I am going to do a brief summary \nof this legislation in a moment and then we will hopefully have our \nleader come to the floor with a unanimous consent request so that we \nmay find a pathway to move toward the reauthorization bill, which is \nvery important.\n  The bill we're debating now--the reconciliation bill--deals with a \nkey part of our education system; that is, the funding that is the \nlifeblood of our higher education system. But the authorization \nprovisions are enormously important. We have worked very carefully \ntogether on the committee and we stand in strong support of those \nproposals. They deal with some very important matters.\n  One is the simplification of the FAFSA, the free application for \nfederal student aid. That might not sound like a very important \nundertaking, but it is extraordinarily important. When you try and go \nthrough the older application, as many students have, or families have, \nthey find it virtually impossible to understand.\n  We give great credit to my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi and \nSenator Reed for their work. We also have provisions that deal with the \nissue of rising college costs. We deal with the funding of students, we \ndeal with addressing the needs of the neediest students in this \ncountry. We have also provided opportunity for the elimination or the \nforgiveness of indebtedness for those who are going to work in public \nservice areas for 10 years. That is very important.\n  In the authorization legislation, we have provisions we think can be \nuseful and helpful in terms of the overall cost of education. We \nsupport and encourage colleges to publish their tuition and fees, so \nthat there is greater transparency and so that students and families \nhave the knowledge to weigh their options. So that is enormously \nimportant. The other part of the authorization, which is absolutely \ncalled for, are what we call the sunshine provisions, the ethical \nprovisions. We reform the student loan industry, so that it works \nbetter for students--not banks.\n  What we have seen over the course of our hearings and investigations \nare instance after instance where those who were involved in the \nlending aspect of the student loan programs at colleges and \nuniversities, and also in the programs themselves, have abused the \nsystem. We've seen instances where lenders give gifts, such as trips \nand performance tickets, in order to gain preferential treatment. \nThat's unacceptable, and we're working to stop those kinds of abuses.\n  We have recommendations in this proposal to deal with that very \nserious problem. The members of our committee are very strong in terms \nof their support for the reauthorization. There are other provisions in \nthe bill as well, but the most important are the ones I have \nidentified. There is strong bipartisan support for those.\n  We know there are members who wish to address some of those issues in \nsome way. We are glad to have debate and discussion on those matters. \nBut it is our desire, certainly my desire, I know Senator Enzi's \ndesire, that we try and move that authorization proposal in a short \nperiod of time. We will have a consent agreement on this shortly. \nHopefully, with that consent agreement, we will be able to conclude the \ndebate on the reconciliation provisions and yield back the time we \nhave, and start the process of considering any of the outstanding \namendments.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Alabama's amendment is a pending \namendment and other members have talked about other amendments. I will \naddress that issue in a few moments.\n  To give a very quick summary of what we have tried to do over the \nperiod of these past weeks in the area of higher education, we have \neffectively taken $17 billion from lender subsidies in order to give it \nto students, and we have deficit reduction distribution of close to $1 \nbillion.\n  This chart gives a pretty good summation about what this legislation \nis all about. People who are watching this program, certainly the \nMembers, now, after we have had a good discussion and debate about the \nprogram, have an awareness of what this program is about. It is a \nhistoric increase in need-based grant aid, the most important increase \nin need-based grant aid since the GI bill in World War II. This Nation \nreached out to so many of the young service men and women after World \nWar II, and provided them an opportunity to go on to college and earn a \nbachelor's degree. What a difference it made for this country in terms \nof building the middle class, and in giving hope and opportunity to an \nentire generation. As we have pointed out time and time again, most \neconomists believe for every dollar that was invested in that GI Bill, \nthe World War II GI bill, $7 was returned to the Federal Treasury. We \nbelieve that to be true.\n  This is something the American people ought to keep in mind. In this \nlegislation, the $17 billion is not coming from the taxpayers. It is \nmoney that is recovered from the lenders in the student loan program. \nSo we have a historic increase in the need-based grant aid in this \nbill--an increase of over $700 next year alone for the maximum Pell \ngrant.\n  We have better repayment options that cap the borrowers' monthly loan \npayments to 15 percent of their discretionary income, discretionary \nincome, I underline, because that is sensitive to individuals, size of \ntheir family, and we are responsive to that.\n\n  This takes into consideration the size of their family, which we \nthink is enormously important. We have loan forgiveness for borrowers \nin public service jobs. We had an excellent debate and discussion \nearlier in the afternoon with the Senator from Maryland on that \nprogram, who told us enormously moving stories about her own life and \nothers that she knew about.\n  This is a very important provision, the loan forgiveness, for \nborrowers in public service jobs. We have great need for more \nprofessionals in public service areas, and we have scores of young \npeople who are interested in entering these fields. Visit any college, \nas I have, and talk to the young people, and the interest of the young \npeople being involved in local community service programs, State \nprograms or Federal programs in public service is extraordinary. I \nthink it is the highest level of interest and involvement I have seen, \nthat I can remember in memory.\n  The loan forgiveness provision in this bill helps address the \nenormous explosion of student loan debt we've seen recently, which \ncloses out opportunities to attend college for far too many Americans.\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\n  We have gone through this in some detail during the course of the \ndebate. We provided some protection for working students by not \npenalizing their earnings. So often individuals are trying to go out \nand work, they are hard pressed in terms of their resources that are \navailable to them and to their families. They go out and earn some \nextra money. What happens, in a number of instances, is they exceed the \nprovisions of existing law and work themselves out of some need-based \naid.\n  We address that issue. The students are going to go out and work and \nwork hard to be able to buy their books, to be able to afford their \nliving expenses. We make sure they are not going to be penalized for \ntheir hard work. We offer longer deferment periods for borrowers in \neconomic hardship. We also have additional consideration for those who \nhave served in the Armed Forces of this country.\n  We had a good review of that program with Senator Murray late \nyesterday afternoon, a very important additional kind of protection for \nour servicemen, particularly those who are on active duty and find out, \nas we know, there are increasing extensions of their duty. We wish to \nmake sure those individuals who are involved in defending this country \nare not bothered or harassed by those who are trying to collect their \ndebt.\n  So this provides these benefits at no cost to the taxpayer by \nreforming the student loan industry so it works for students, not \nbanks. This is not additional money from taxpayers for these programs. \nThis comes from the lenders, from the banks, changing the way that this \nwhole program works to benefit the students in a very important way, \nand in a way, quite frankly, that actually isn't going to cost the \nlending agencies that much profit.\n  Even with this particular proposal, we have seen the various CBO \nreviews, we have these financial officer statements we have reviewed. \nThese lending agencies, they are going to do very well. We reviewed \nsome of the documents of Sallie Mae itself, which pointed out the size \nof their earnings, which are going to be substantial, even with the \ninclusion of this legislation. So we do not need to have crocodile \ntears for the lending agencies. We ought to even strengthen those \nprograms for the students of this country.\n  So this is the broad form and the broad shape of the legislation. \nWhen we talk about the need based aid, what we are talking about \nbasically are the lowest-income families.\n  Pell grants assist 5 million of the neediest students, 5 million of \nthem who are attending our universities. This is very important help \nand assistance. What we see is, as they take advantage of this program, \nit means they may be able to borrow less. By borrowing less, they have \nless monthly payments and this frees them to be able to focus on \nschool, so that students during their breaks and during their free \nhours are going to be talking about their subject matter and about the \nbooks they have read, and their classes and teachers, rather than \nconstantly worrying about the payment of their debt.\n  So this is a very major aspect of how we have allocated a major part \nof the $17 billion. We have, as every person knows who is in this \nChamber, and every family knows who is watching this, an explosion of \ncosts both at private colleges and public colleges.\n  We know many students who go to these public colleges and the private \ncolleges are young men and women of extraordinary ability and talent; \nand many of them are also hard pressed financially. What we have tried \nto do, although we have not done it up to now, is to keep grant aid up \nwith the incredible increase we have seen in the cost. We made a \ndownpayment on that with our increase in the Pell grant maximum to \n$4,310 earlier this year. This bill goes even further, and raises the \nmaximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year and to $5,400 by 2011.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have made some recommendations in the \neducation authorization bill to try and deal with costs in the \nfuture. We have seen those costs go up.\n\n  This is a very important chart. Each year, nearly half of the lowest-\nincome students, who are talented students, cannot go to a 4-year \ncollege because of cost. We know that 400,000 students don't attend a \n4-year college each year because of cost. These are young people who \ncould effectively gain entrance into college but cannot go because of \nthe limitations of income. This is a great loss for this Nation, a \ngreat loss for those individuals. It is an incredible loss in terms of \nour Nation.\n  We tried, with the need-based aid and assistance in this bill, to \nprovide help. We tried through Senator Murkowski's amendment to provide \nthe mechanisms in the States to reach out to these students to assist \nthem, to motivate them so they will go on to college, and explain to \nstudents the complicated financial aid process. That is enormously \nimportant.\n  With the work of Senator Enzi and Senator Reed, we have simplified \nthe form for application for federal aid into two pages compared to the \ncurrent form's eight or nine pages, which are hardly understandable for \nmany parents and students.\n  This is what is happening. This is why we are seeing one of our \ncandidates, Senator Edwards, talking about the two Americas. It is \nright here at the breaking point where we find out that half of the \ncollege-ready students, which means that they have the academic \ncapability to go on to college, do not do so because of the cost.\n  These are the facts. This is the need. This is another way of \nexpressing a similar point; that is, more students must take out loans \nto finance their education. In 1993, less than half of all graduates \nhad to take out loans. But in 2004, nearly two-thirds had to take out \nloans to finance their education--an enormous increase. Students are \nborrowing more, and this is the indebtedness.\n  I see our leader on the floor. Knowing his responsibility, I would be \nglad to withhold and make whatever comments I might have after any \ncomments he would want to make.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Genius \nwithout education is like silver in the mine.''\n  It is unquestioned that a college education is the single greatest \nweight on the scales of success.\n  Yet today, more and more working-class Americans are shut out from \nthe promise and opportunity of a college education because the price is \nout of reach.\n  The Higher Education Access Act is a bill that will restore that \npromise to hundreds of thousands of American students.\n  Over the past 20 years, the cost of a college education has tripled. \nYet the average family's median income has been virtually flat, and \nFederal student aid has not kept pace to make up the difference.\n  As a result, the goal of higher education has never been further out \nof reach for many working class students and their families.\n  Nearly 400,000 students who would otherwise have the credentials to \ngo to college are shut out because they cannot afford it.\n  Imagine the doors to opportunity that a college degree would have \noffered these students, the benefits to our society and the benefits to \nour economy.\n  Over the course of their lifetime, a college graduate will earn $1 \nmillion more than a high school graduate. And the Department of Labor \nprojects that almost 90 percent of the fastest-growing and best-paying \njobs require at least some postsecondary education.\n  Too many students are losing out on all that opportunity. And too \nmany students who do make it to college are shouldering the burden of \nmore debt than ever before.\n  In Nevada, we are fortunate that the cost to attend one of our fine \nState universities is still relatively low. But even in Nevada, the \naverage graduate has almost $17,000 in student loan debt.\n  There is nothing wrong with borrowing money to help pay for college. \nBut when that debt reaches an average of tens of thousands of dollars, \nstudents are buried in debt before they even enter the workforce.\n  The Higher Education Access Act, the bipartisan reconciliation bill \nthat we are today debating will help solve this critical problem.\n  It will do so in a comprehensive way by increasing grant aid, \nexpanding the number of students eligible for Federal aid, making loan \ndebt more manageable, and expanding loan forgiveness\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\noptions for those professions that we all recognize are important to \nsociety--teaching, social work, law enforcement, and health care.\n  The Higher Education Act includes three crucial components.\n  First, the bill includes a significant increase to the Pell grant, \nwhich has long been the foundation for Federal student aid.\n  Twenty years ago, the Pell grant covered half the cost of attendance \nof a 4-year public college. Today, it covers less than a third.\n  In 2000, President Bush campaigned on a promise to increase the Pell \ngrant, but for 5 years, it remained at $4,050. After years of \nstagnation, one of the first acts of the Democratic Congress this year \nwas to raise the Pell to $4,310.\n  This bill takes the next step, increasing the Pell grant to $5,100 \nnext year and to $5,400 in 2012, and makes an additional 250,000 \nstudents eligible.\n  Second, the Higher Education Access Act caps monthly Federal student \nloan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income. This \nwill translate to real benefits for graduates.\n  Under this new income-based repayment plan, a teacher in Clark \nCounty, NV who earns about $45,000 a year, would have his or her \nmonthly payments reduced from $192 to $149, or 23 percent.\n  This bill also increases the amount of student income that can be \nsheltered from the financial aid process. The current levels amount to \nan unfair ``work penalty'' on working, part-time, and community college \nstudents, including the nearly 58,000 students in my own State who \nattend a community college.\n  Third, the Higher Education Access Act expands loan forgiveness \noptions to encourage college graduates to pursue public service and \ncareers in such high need areas as nursing, teaching, or law \nenforcement.\n  We have a tremendous teaching shortage in Nevada, particularly in \nClark County. Clark County is one of the fastest growing school \ndistricts in Nation. They are building, on average, one new school \nevery month. Each year, the district needs to hire as many as 1,000 new \nteachers to fill these buildings.\n  This loan forgiveness program would erase remaining student debt for \nnew teachers after 10 years of teaching.\n  The large banks and lenders tell us that the provisions in this bill \nwill impact the benefits that they provide to students. But they never \ntell us what these so-called benefits really mean for the average \nstudent.\n  This legislation, on the other hand, has clear and tangible benefits \nfor students. The savings generated in this bipartisan bill, through \nmodest cuts to lender subsidies, are sent right back to students in the \nform of $17 billion in new benefits. This would be the largest increase \nin college aid and student benefits since the GI bill.\n  Let me address the issue of lender subsidies. The Federal student \nloan program was established in 1965, before a student loan market even \nexisted.\n  Back then, the Federal Government had to offer incentives and \nsubsidies to encourage private financial institutions to provide \neducation loans.\n  But times have changed. Today, there is no doubt that the student \nloan market is highly lucrative, and one need look no further than $225 \nmillion in compensation that the CEO of Sallie Mae received over a 5-\nyear period to prove this point.\n  Yet the Federal Government continues to provide excessive subsidies \nand guarantees to lenders under the FFEL, Federal Family Loan Program. \nI support the FFEL program Our State's oldest university, the \nUniversity of Nevada Reno, participates in the FFEL Program.\n  But without a doubt, the private student loan industry is heavily \nsubsidized by the American taxpayer. And, in my view, it is past time \nfor the Congress to take a second look at these subsidies. This bill \ndoes that in a bipartisan, responsible, and reasonable way.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the rest of the HELP Committee, \nas well as the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, for \ntheir work in crafting an important piece of legislation that meets the \nreconciliation instructions in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, passing the Higher Education Access Act is one of the \nmost important steps this Congress could take. I can think of few \nthings more important to our country's future than opening the door to \na college education for millions of students and unlocking all the \nopportunity it affords.\n  I also want to amplify what I said this morning about the way this \nbill has been managed. The two managers of this bill, Senators Enzi and \nKennedy, have done an exemplary job. There are some difficult issues to \ndeal with, and they have done it in a graceful manner. They have \nallowed people to offer amendments and debate whatever they feel is \nappropriate. I would hope that in this little vote-athon we have, which \nis one of the quirks in the Senate rules--people may offer amendments \nwhen we are finished--people will keep in mind what we are trying to \naccomplish with this bill. Once this passes, they will be no longer \ntrying. It will really help lots of students to go to school. Things \nare different than when I was a college student. I could work, as I did \nand many others did, and put myself through school with a little \nscholarship here and there. You can't do that anymore. You need, with \nrare exception, student aid. This bill will allow students more money \nto be educated.\n  As has been said here in the last several days on many occasions, a \nperson getting a college education will earn over a lifetime $1 million \nmore than a person with no college education. That really says it all. \nThat is what this is about, to allow more people to be educated.\n  I appreciate very much the manner in which this bill has been \nmanaged. I think it is exemplary. It is how a bill should be managed in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the leader for his comments and \nalso for scheduling this proposal. It is a clear indication of the \npriority this legislation has. We are very grateful that we have been \nable to, hopefully, complete this whole proposal in terms of the \nfunding and the authorization.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief statement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have a number of votes that could start in \nthe next half hour or so, whenever the managers decide we should start. \nBut my goal is to finish the voting tonight. We have this bill started. \nI would hope we could finish it tonight. We are going to give it the \ncollege try. All the amendments that will be offered, we are going to \nvote on them tonight. Many of them will be points of order, a 60-vote \nmargin. I would hope people understand these are procedural votes. I \nhope we can dispose of them as quickly as possible, one way or the \nother. We have a lot to do. We have a cloture vote tomorrow on a very \nimportant appropriations bill. So we are going to move to that. I hope \nthe distinguished Republican leader and I can work out arrangements so \nthat we may not even need a vote tomorrow. If we can proceed to it on \nMonday, we would do that, whenever we finish education issues in this \nnext cycle.\n  It is my understanding that there may even be something more we could \ndo on education Monday. That is not quite worked out yet, but if it is, \nI would be happy to work out the schedule so that we can continue on \neducation and perhaps go to the appropriations bill either Monday night \nor Tuesday sometime.\n  Again, we are going to do everything within our power to finish this \nbill tonight. I hope it is not going to be a night like we had Tuesday. \nI am confident it won't be, but it could go into the late evening \ntonight.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to indicate to the leader that \nwe have a pending amendment, the Sessions amendment. But we have \neffectively ended the debate on education. The students of this country \nand the parents of this country ought to know that we have done our \nduty, our responsibility. It is going to be those who are going to be \noffering amendments that have nothing to do with educating the children \nof this country who are going to be delaying what is a vital interest \nto the students and working families. We have been here, ready to deal \nwith the amendments. We have a pending amendment with the Sessions \namendment. But it ought to be very\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\nclear to every student who is watching this program and every parent \nwho is watching that Senator Enzi, myself, and our committee--we have \ndone our work. We are ready to have final passage. The House of \nRepresentatives has acted on this proposal. We are ready to go ahead \nand get to conference and get these benefits to students. If Members of \nthis body have other issues, they ought to consider those at another \ntime, or in another place. But every parent of every child ought to \nknow, when we start having these dilatory amendments that are being \noffered, who is offering them and who is delaying the most important \neducation program we have had here in the Senate since the GI bill in \nWorld War II. That is what this is about.\n  I thank the leader for both scheduling this and his willingness to \nstick with it. We are fine. It is 6 o'clock on a Thursday evening. We \nare glad to work, and we are glad to work through tomorrow, Monday, \nwhatever it is. But the American people ought to know, when these \namendments that have nothing to do with education are offered, who is \non the side of the students and who is on the side of working families, \nwho is on the side of middle-income families. We have been out here \nready to deal with education amendments. We have one that is pending. \nBut the idea that they are going to use this as some kind of vehicle to \ntack on every single amendment to cause what they consider to be \ndifficult political votes, they are basically insulting the families of \nthis country who know how important this issue is.\n  Make no mistake about it, we will know very soon who is on the side \nof the students and who is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are now waiting for the distinguished \nRepublican leader to come. As further evidence of your good work, we \nhave a unanimous consent request here that will allow us to move Monday \nto the higher education extension which is so important. I, frankly, am \nelated that this is going to happen. This is a gift for the American \npeople. I certainly hope the Senate understands how important it is \nthat the two of you have worked this out. This is really remarkably \ngood.\n  Again, we are waiting for the distinguished Republican leader.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1642\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \nMonday, July 23, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. \n264, S. 1642, the higher education extension, and that when the bill is \nconsidered, it be considered under the following limitations: that \nthere be a total time of 8 hours of debate on the bill and amendments, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between Senators Kennedy \nand Enzi or their designees; that the only amendments in order, other \nthan the committee-reported substitute, be a total of 12 relevant \nfirst-degree amendments relative to the matter of S. 1642 and/or the \ncommittee-reported substitute; there would be six for each manager, and \nan additional managers' amendment which has been cleared by the \nmanagers and the leaders, with no other amendments in order; that upon \ndisposition of all amendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, if \namended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to passage of the bill.\n  Prior to asking approval of this consent, I want the record to \nreflect, I love people who write left-handed. I have a son who is left-\nhanded, and there was nothing meant to disparage left-handers when I \nsaid that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nI was off the floor when the majority leader was talking about the \nmeasure we are on at the moment. Let me just indicate that there will \nbe a number of amendments. I think our colleagues ought to stay \nrelatively close to the floor when we get into a series of amendments. \nI share the majority leader's view that hopefully we will finish that \nbill tonight. But I do think it would be a good idea for people to stay \nclose to the Chamber when we get into the so-called vote-o-rama.\n  With regard to the consent agreement, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am so pleased at what just happened \nhere. We have an important part of higher education in a reconciliation \nbill. In every speech I have made since we started this yesterday, \nalthough it seems like weeks ago, there was a second part that is \nactually a bigger part. There is a whole puzzle, and we are taking care \nof the little red triangle there in the reconciliation bill, but there \nis a lot more to higher education that we need to do. We came close to \ngetting some done a year ago, but we didn't quite get there. The system \nkind of failed for the students. Now we have the chance, and we are \ngoing to do it on Monday. We are going to take care of that bigger \npart, the yellow part there, which is the reauthorization.\n  We have talked about this financial aid form simplification--and even \nshowed the multiple pages that are currently required--bringing that \ndown to one page. That is in there. We have talked about the need for \nbetter loan disclosure for financial institutions, the need to do a \nbetter job of following the rules, and we even interjected some new \nrules. That is in this part.\n  There are year-round Pell grants so students do not have to interrupt \ntheir study when they want to get ready to be in the workforce. There \nis support for nontraditional students that we have not had before for \ngraduate and international education. We have financial literacy and \nbetter borrower information in this part we will be debating Monday. We \nhave privacy protection in there, which is extremely important.\n  We have improvements to the Academic Competitive Grants and the SMART \ngrants which encourage students to get into science and math and \nengineering and technology and languages and medicine. There is some \nadditional incentive for them to do that.\n  There is also the college cost watch list, which will provide more \ninformation to students and to us so we know what we are doing when we \nreauthorize higher education the next time.\n  There is much more. One of those ``much more'' is a very important \npart, which is more money for teacher preparation. Teachers are a key \nto the education system, and they are taken care of in the \nreauthorization part of the package, not in the reconciliation package. \nSo it is very important to get both of them done. I am so pleased we \nhave been able to arrive at a unanimous consent agreement to do both of \nthem.\n  We will finish this one up. I will make a few comments. We will be \nready to yield back time and get on with the vote-o-rama.\n  I wish to echo the sentiment that the amendments are rather limited. \nI hope that is the case. I think the amendments that were really \npertinent to the reconciliation bill have probably already been put out \nthere. There may be a couple of others, but I am hoping we do some \nthings that are pertinent to this reconciliation so we can get that \nwrapped up and get the reauthorization done so that higher education in \nthis country will function the way we envision it. It is always on a \ngood path. It can be better. These two bills make it better.\n  The reconciliation bill, of course, reduces subsidies to lenders by \n$18.5 billion and provides $17.6 billion for students benefits. This \nlegislation, coupled with the Deficit Reduction Act passed 2 years ago, \nwill result in $40 billion in changes to Federal student loan programs.\n  I am pleased we have come to an agreement that will allow the rest of \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to be considered on the \nfloor of the Senate with limited relevant amendments and a limited \namount of time. The bill before us today focuses on a narrow slice of \nthe Higher Education Act. As I mentioned, it will give us a chance to \ndo the entirety of the Higher Education Act, which will ensure the \ncontinued quality of our higher education system.\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\n  Now, as I mentioned, this is the second time in as many Congresses we \nhave been on the brink of systemic reform. We are going to make it \nthrough the reform this time. I am so pleased at that. The students of \nAmerica, whatever age, will benefit from this legislation. We talk \nabout the need for education from the time you are born until the time \nyou retire. We have some other pieces yet that we need to do, such as \nthe Workforce Investment Act, but we are on course to get that done \ntoo.\n  The American system of higher education is renowned throughout the \nworld. America's students will now be provided with the tools and \nassistance contained in both bills to complete their higher education \nand training to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to be \ncompetitive in a 21st-century economy.\n  I supported reporting both bills out of committee. I did ask they be \nconsidered together and had that expectation. So I am very pleased that \nthe Senate Democratic leader has worked with us and provided an \nopportunity to have an open and full debate on the aspects of the \nHigher Education Act.\n  As debate on this bill comes to a close, it is necessary to thank \nthose who worked long and hard on this bill. First and foremost, I \nthank Chairman Kennedy. The bill we will be doing Monday is virtually a \nbill the two of us worked out last year, for which we got to that brink \nof getting done, and then it did not get done. So now we are presenting \nit again. I thank him for his commitment to keeping this process \nbipartisan.\n  Education is bipartisan. There is no partisanship in that. I think \nthat will be displayed throughout the process. And I appreciate his \nworking with me and my Republican colleagues on the HELP Committee \nthroughout this entire process. We have a different process than some \nof the other committees. We use the markup to kind of find the \ndirection, the intent and the intensity of the feelings on the issue, \nand then we actually keep working with people through that time to \neither correct the situation or to get an understanding of what it is \nwe are really doing. Sometimes that even requires coming up with a \nthird way. But that is what has happened in both of these bills, and it \ngets us to this point.\n  Now, it involves a tremendous amount of work on the part of members \nof the committee, but it also involves a tremendous amount of work by \nour staff. They work through weekends. They work late into evenings \ntrying to resolve a lot of these things so it can get to the decision \nat the Member level.\n  So I particularly thank Katherine McGuire, my legislative director; \nBeth Beuhlmann, who heads up the education shop; Ann Clough; Adam \nBriddell; Amy Shank; Ilyse Schuman; Greg Dean; Kelly Hastings; and \nLindsay Hunsicker.\n  I also thank the members of Senator Kennedy's staff for their hard \nwork: Michael Myers, who is doing a marvelous job of coordinating with \nus; Carmel Martin; J.D. LaRock; Missy Rohrbach; Emma Vadehra; Erin \nRenner; Raquel Alvarenga; and David Johns.\n  Finally, I thank all the members of the HELP Committee and their \nstaffs for all their hard work throughout this process. It has been \nhard work making sure everybody had an understanding of all of these \ndifficult issues and getting us to this point.\n  So again I thank the chairman for his hard work and cooperative work \nto be able to get this done for the kids of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9574-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a lot of good news today \nlegislatively.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 159, H.R. 2272, the House competitiveness \nbill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nthe Senate companion, S. 761, as passed by the Senate, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees.\n  Mr. President, let me say this is the end of a long haul to do a bill \nthat is extremely important. This is a bipartisan bill. There are a \nnumber of people who have worked extremely hard on this legislation but \nno one harder than Senators Bingaman and Alexander. I apologize for \nonly mentioning their names. I am sure there are many others who worked \njust as hard as they did. I remember they were the first two who talked \nto me about it, and there has been a lot of time spent on this \nlegislation.\n  It is a bill that was passed in the Senate with little opposition. I \nam so happy we can now go to conference. The House has already passed \nsomething. We can come back with a bill that I think will really help \nproductivity in our country and help the educational aspects of \nstudents, especially in the scientific fields.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill not object--there have been a number of people on both sides of \nthe aisle who have been deeply invested in this America COMPETES Act. \nSeveral of them will be shortly announced by the Chair as conferees.\n  Particularly, I want to single out Senator Stevens, Senator Enzi, \nSenator Ensign, and Senator Coleman, all of whom will be named \nconferees, and, of course, Senator Alexander and Senator Domenici, who \nwere really the leaders on our side, in conjunction with Senator \nBingaman, in developing this important bipartisan legislation.\n  Senator Alexander kept pushing others forward. But, in fact, we all \nknew who the real leader on our side was on this issue. He, in a very \nselfless way, helped move a bipartisan group together to form this \nimportant legislation. I commend Senator Alexander in particular for \nthe role he played in all of this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2272), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. \nColeman conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join the two leaders in thanking our \ncolleagues and thank them for moving this process forward in naming \nthese conferees on the America COMPETES Act. I wish to underline the \nexcellent work that was done under the bipartisan leadership of Senator \nBingaman and Senator Alexander, and the other members of our committee. \nThey have worked long and hard on this legislation.\n  A very distinguished leader in business, Norm Augustine--who has been \nthe head of many of our defense industries and is a real statesman in \nterms of defense policy--was enormously important in helping guide the \nbipartisan group, to get recommendations from the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Science \nFoundation, and others, to help prepare this legislation, and to make \nrecommendations to the House and the Senate.\n  This is an enormously important effort to ensure that the United \nStates can continue to be competitive in the world economy for years \nahead. I think this is a very solid and important bipartisan effort. I \njoin with our two leaders, thanking them for their recommendations in \nterms of conferees, and join in commending the bipartisan effort that \nhas seen this as continuing progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9574-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9574-S9597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think with the consent agreement we are \nprepared to yield back the time we still have. I want to join, first of \nall, in thanking my friend and colleague from Wyoming, as I did in the \nopening of the discussion and debate on education. This reauthorization \nlegislation--the\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\none we will consider on Monday--is legislation that had Senator Enzi's \nname on it until the change in the makeup of the Senate. We had worked \non it in a bipartisan way. I think with the exception of the ethical \nissues, which have been developed more recently, it is by and large a \nreflection of a really strong bipartisan effort, as our reauthorization \non the Head Start Program is as well.\n  That is the way we worked when Senator Enzi was the chairman. We have \ntried to follow that pathway. As he mentioned, there has been a long \nhistory of leaders in education who work on a bipartisan basis in the \nSenate, going back with the Republicans with Senator Stafford and with \nour friend Claiborne Pell, as well as Judd Gregg when he was chairman \nof the committee.\n  So we want to see this passed. Hopefully, by Tuesday sometime, we \nwill be able to look back on these past days and see a job well done. \nBut we still have work to do.\n  I want to take a moment of time, though, to join in thanking the \nstaff. Senator Enzi has said it so well. There has been tireless work \nand a real willingness to find common ground. These staffs have worked \nvery closely with all of us. These issues are of prime concern to every \nmember of our committee. Every member of our committee is involved in \nthese education issues. We have good exchanges on that, and they have \nall been interested for a long period of time.\n  But I wish to thank, certainly, on my staff Michael Myers, who heads \nour committee staff and does such a wonderful job, Carmel Martin, and \nMissy Rohrbach. Missy even managed to get married during this period of \ntime. I don't know how she found that time. J.D. LaRock, Erin Renner, \nEmma Vadehra, David Johns, Liz Maher, Parker Baxter and Nick Bath. For \nSenator Enzi, Katherine McGuire and Ilyse Schuman and Greg Dean, Beth \nBuehlmann and Ann Clough, Adam Briddell and Lindsey Hunsicker. There \nare many others, and I will include those as we go through the evening.\n\n  Mr. President, I was concluding the earlier remarks but I think many \nof our Members are ready to move ahead now.\n  The other major provisions of this legislation were the loan \nforgiveness for those in public service for 10 years, the ceiling on \nloan payments so they don't exceed 15 percent of monthly income, which \nassist people in repaying their loans in a responsible way. It is very \nsolid legislation. It is good legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it \ndeserves to be passed. We know the House is ready to move forward \ntogether on this bill. They have addressed this issue in the committee \nand they are ready to move ahead. I think the country is ready for us \nto move ahead.\n  As we have been willing and able to deal with education issues, I \njoin in the plea of my friend and colleague from Wyoming in the hope we \nwill not extend these amendments that have no relevance to the \neducation of the young people in this country. They are entitled, I \nbelieve, to the kind of respect they should receive with an important \npiece of legislation that has been bipartisan, it has been worked \nthrough, and reflects the Nation's judgment in terms of understanding \nthe importance young people can play and must play in our country and \nin our democracy, in our economy and in our national security. This \nlegislation deserves, I believe, to have a quick and speedy passage.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nwork. I would like to understand, as we apparently go into some votes, \nwhat the requirements and circumstances are. There is no limitation on \namendments at this point as I understand it; is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator understands correctly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask, under reconciliation, I have watched the \nproceedings this afternoon, and I have heard discussions on the \namendments that have nothing to do with this subject and are far \nafield. Is there a germaneness test with respect to amendments on the \nreconciliation portion of this bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, there is. So there will be points of order raised \non amendments where those points of order should be raised.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, let me thank again the chairman and the \nranking member. My hope is we will deal with those amendments that deal \nwith the education of the children in this country and move on and \nfinish this bill. There will be plenty of other opportunities to \naddress subjects well beyond that. I appreciate their work, and I hope \nwe can finish this in due course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator because this is important \nlegislation. There are a lot of other items which all of us are \nconcerned about that the Senate should address. But we have had good \ndiscussions, good debate. This is very important legislation, and it \nreflects the best judgment of the members of our committee and I think \nthe Senate as a whole as well. Hopefully, we can get it passed.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. ENZI. Is the Senator going to be yielding back and then \npropounding a request for 1 minute on each side on each amendment and \n10 minutes after the first vote?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has a question for \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SANDERS. My question was similar to Senator Dorgan's. I was going \nto say that if there was a substantive debate, we are prepared to offer \nseveral second-degree amendments. I hope I don't have to do that \nbecause I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that we are dealing \nwith higher education now, a very important issue, and I think we \nshould keep it clean and move forward. But if something else evolves, \nwe are prepared to offer several second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very \nimportant contributions during the development of this legislation and \nhis excellent statement on the floor.\n  I am prepared to yield back the time, if my colleague is prepared to \nyield back. I think also for any amendments, can we request that we \nhave the opportunity for 2 minutes of debate on any amendment that is \ngoing to be offered to be evenly divided. Furthermore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that after the first vote, the time on each succeeding \namendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if it is all right with the Senator from \nWyoming, we would indicate the first vote then would start at 6:30. I \nsee the leader. That gives people at least some notice, if that would \nbe agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the first vote to begin at 6:30 \nthen, we have 8 remaining minutes. I am glad to divide that with the \nSenator from Wyoming. Does the Senator from Alabama wish to be--I would \nbe glad to divide that time with the Senator from Alabama, if he wishes \nto speak on his amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that we divide the time, the 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the provision in this bill that creates \nan entirely new loan forgiveness program for Government public service \nworkers I believe is unprincipled and can only get worse in the years \nto come. Actually, it has some pernicious aspects to it.\n  For example, it says if you are any Government worker or social \nservice worker, it appears that as long as you are not in the private \nsector, after 10 years, the Government will forgive your loan debt. I \nthink that is an odd thing for us to do, to have that many people have \ntheir loans forgiven.\n  I think, No. 1, when people go to college and they make up their mind \nabout how they are going to pay for college and whether they will work, \nthis will be an inducement for people not to work and to borrow; it \nwill encourage borrowing for loans. No. 2, it\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\ndoes not have any limit on the amount of money involved, so those who \ngo to more expensive colleges will obviously get more of the taxpayers' \nmoney than those who don't go to more expensive colleges in terms of \nthe loan forgiveness. I think that is not a healthy thing.\n  Eighty percent of the colleges and universities in America don't use \nthe Direct Loan Program. Eighty percent do not. You don't get this loan \nforgiveness unless you are part of the Direct Loan Program, or \nconsolidate your loans with it. I think that is an odd bias in the \nsystem that I am not comfortable with. So I will say, again, I think \nthis is creating a new bureaucracy, an unwise way to help workers. I \nwould suggest if we want to help people, we should expand our Pell \ngrants--as we have dramatically and I support--and the loan programs in \ngeneral but not to target a forgiveness program to people who have been \nworking for the Government for 10 years who are probably better able to \npay off the loan than they were the first 2 or 3 years they started to \nwork. It doesn't make sense to me. I don't like this new program and \nall its ramifications.\n  I think our focus should be on Pell grants, on improving the loan \nprogram for everybody equally, and I don't think the plumber who is \ntaking business courses so he might one day run his own business, or \nthe nurse who is advancing her skill level so she might one day reach a \nhigher level of pay, that one ought to be favored over the other.\n  I strongly believe our resources should be directed to overall \nstrengthening of the loan program and not focusing on just Government \nemployees. I am not putting down Government employees, but I will ask \nyou about two Government employees, one who goes to a community college \nand works their way through and ends up with no debt and another one \nwho incurs a good bit of debt, one gets benefits under this program, \nwhereas the other one doesn't. I don't think that is a good principle. \nI think that is hard to defend.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 remaining seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Kennedy. I know \nthe bill does do some good things with regard to Pell grants and to \nfocusing more of our loan money on some of the professions and areas of \nour economy that need more students involved, so I salute that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 4 minutes. Earlier \nin the day, we had a good exchange with the Senator from Alabama. I \npointed out that Alabama, under this legislation, gets an additional \n$442 million over the next 5 years in grant aid. My own State of \nMassachusetts gets $317 million. Alabama does exceedingly well, and \nthat is under the need-based provisions of this program, the need-based \nprovisions of this program.\n  The Senator from Alabama has raised I think three important points, \nand they should be addressed. First of all, the loan forgiveness is \napplicable to those who are on the Direct Loan Program or those who are \non the Pell Grant Program. That is spelled out on page 14 of the \nlegislation. That is spelled out on page 14.\n  Secondly, there is a cap--spelled out on page 30, that requires the \nborrower's annual adjusted gross income or annual earnings to be less \nthan or equal to $65,000 for eligibility. So if they make more than \n$65,000, there is no loan forgiveness. So this is for those individuals \nwho are working--the working middle class and the working poor.\n  Third, we believe, as this chart points out, that there is a value in \nterms of public service employment. We have heard the announcement \nabout the COMPETE Act and about those who are going to go to conference \non the COMPETE Act. That bill addresses math and science education and \nmany other important areas. Try to find a good math teacher to serve \nthe public schools of Boston--it's extremely difficult--a good science \nteacher, a good chemistry teacher to work in a high-need school. Try to \nfind individuals who are going to work with the disabled population. \nIncreasingly, we are finding challenges in meeting the needs of our \nelderly population so they can have independent living. We have listed \nthe range of what we consider to be public service fields in this bill, \nand it is extensive. There is enormous need in America. There is an \nenormous desire of young people to work in those areas. The principal \nbarrier is their indebtedness. They know that if we provide some help \nand assistance, which this legislation does, to provide some \nforgiveness, if they work 10 years--10 years--10 years they have to \nwork in these areas in order to be eligible for some forgiveness. That \nis what the amendment of the Senator from Alabama wants to eliminate.\n  I have mentioned many times, and in traveling around to schools and \ncolleges in my State of Massachusetts, the number of young people who \nwant to do public service and work and make a contribution to their \ncommunity, to their local communities, to their State or to the \ncountry. We were reminded earlier today by the excellent statement of \nthe Senator from Maryland the difficulty in getting law enforcement \npeople to work in many of the areas in the communities in Baltimore. \nThere are important public responsibilities and services. We have a \ngeneration of young people who are prepared to do it. The principal \nthing that is blocking them is the limitation on their salaries. As we \nhave seen, this chart gives you a pretty good example. A starting \nsalary for teachers is $35,000, and the loan debt is $18,000. What this \nwill do is provide some relief annually, up to $732, but if that \nteacher is a starting teacher in Massachusetts, at the end of 10 years \nof working with students in the public school system, they are going to \nget some loan forgiveness.\n  They are going to get a $10,000 forgiveness. This is not taxpayer \nmoney, Mr. President; this is the lenders' money. I hope the amendment \nwill not be accepted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Thune, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n     Isakson, Mr. Allard, Mr. Craig, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n     Graham, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Gregg, \n     Mr. Ensign, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. \n     Corker, proposes an amendment numbered 2334.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prevent the Federal Communications Commission from \n                 repromulgating the fairness doctrine)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FAIRNESS DOCTRINE PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Fairness Doctrine Prohibited.--Title III of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after \n     section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303) the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 303A. LIMITATION ON GENERAL POWERS: FAIRNESS DOCTRINE.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding section 303 or any other provision of \n     this Act or any other Act authorizing the Commission to \n     prescribe rules, regulations, policies, doctrines, standards, \n     or other requirements, the Commission shall not have the \n     authority to prescribe any rule, regulation, policy, \n     doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose \n     or effect of reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in \n     part) the requirement that broadcasters present opposing \n     viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance, \n     commonly referred to as the `Fairness Doctrine', as repealed \n     in General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast \n     Licensees, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985).''.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, this bill is about educating young \npeople. Let them have unfettered access to information. This bill would \nprohibit the Government from monitoring ideas on our public airwaves \nand penalizing broadcasters who don't meet the Government's definition \nof fair and balanced. There is a reason why our first amendment is \nfreedom of speech because all freedoms are at risk when Government \nmonitors and controls the broadcast of ideas.\n  Since the end of the fairness doctrine in 1987, talk radio has \nflourished because of consumer-driven market demand, not because of \nGovernment command, not because of Government control.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment which will protect America's \nconstitutionally granted right to free speech. It will prohibit the FCC \nfrom reinstituting the fairness doctrine.\n  At the end of the day, there is nothing fair about the fairness \ndoctrine. This issue is not which broadcaster is fair and which is not. \nThe issue is who decides. I believe fairness is what the American \npublic decides is fair, not some Washington politician or bureaucrat. \nAmericans love a fair fight, but there is nothing fair if the intent is \nto silence debate because a politician disagrees with it.\n  I ask for my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this has nothing to do with the \nunderlying legislation. Young children in this country want this \nlegislation, and this amendment has nothing to do with it.\n  The pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder pursuant to sections 305(b)(2) and 310(e)(1) of the Congressional \nBudget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is premature. No motion has been \nmade.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2351.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO BAY, \n                   CUBA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the War on Terror, senior members of al Qaeda \n     have been captured by the United States military and \n     intelligence personnel and their allies.\n       (2) Many such senior members of al Qaeda have since been \n     transferred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba.\n       (3) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was the mastermind \n     behind the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which \n     killed approximately 3,000 innocent people.\n       (4) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay also include Majid Khan, who was tasked to develop plans \n     to poison water reservoirs inside the United States, was \n     responsible for conducting a study on the feasibility of a \n     potential gas station bombing campaign inside the United \n     States, and was integral in recommending Iyman Farris, who \n     plotted to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge, to be an operative \n     for al Qaeda inside the United States.\n       (5) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay also include Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was an al Qaeda \n     operations chief for the Arabian Peninsula and who, at the \n     request of Osama bin Laden, orchestrated the attack on the \n     U.S.S. Cole, which killed 17 United States sailors.\n       (6) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who played a major \n     role in the East African Embassy Bombings, which killed more \n     than 250 people.\n       (7) The Department of Defense has estimated that of the \n     approximately 415 detainees who have been released or \n     transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, at \n     least 29 have subsequently taken up arms against the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (8) Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his \n     1998 fatwa against the\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\n     United States, that ``[t]he ruling to kill the Americans and \n     their allies--civilians and military--is an individual duty \n     for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is \n     possible to do it''.\n       (9) In the same fatwa, bin Laden said, ``[w]e--with God's \n     help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to \n     be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans \n     and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it''.\n       (10) It is safer for American citizens if captured members \n     of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not housed \n     on American soil where they could more easily carry out their \n     mission to kill innocent civilians.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior \n     members of al Qaeda, should not be released into American \n     society, nor should they be transferred stateside into \n     facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 6 years ago no one would have thought \nabout deliberately bringing terrorists into American communities, but \nsome of our friends on the other side of the aisle feel differently. \nThe senior Senator from California actually has proposed that we \nrequire the President to move terrorist detainees held at Guantanamo \nBay to the continental United States and to keep them here. That means \nmoving them into facilities in cities and small towns in places such as \nCalifornia and Illinois and Kentucky. I can guarantee that my \nconstituents don't want terrorists housed in their backyards in Fort \nKnox, Fort Campbell or, for that matter, anywhere else in the \nCommonwealth.\n  My amendment would allow the Senate to express its view that it is \nbetter for the safety and the security of the American people that the \nterrorists at Guantanamo Bay are not moved into American communities.\n  The amendment does not prohibit moving the terrorists elsewhere. It \ndoes not rule out closing Guantanamo Bay, although my personal view is \nthat is a bad idea. All it does is say to the American people the \nSenate does not want these terrorists housed on our soil in our \ncommunities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Madam President, there has been no shortage of public debate about \nthe detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Unfortunately, much of the \npublic debate seems somewhat at odds with what is really going on. As \nMorris Davis wrote in a recent editorial in the New York Times, \n``critics liken Guantanamo Bay to Soviet gulags, but reality does not \nmatch their hyperbole.'' Indeed, after an inspection last year by the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Belgian police \nofficial said, ``At the level of detention facilities, it is a model \nprison, where people are treated better than in Belgian prisons.''\n  My trip to Guantanamo confirmed what Mr. Davis and many others have \nconcluded. When I visited Guantanamo, the first detainee I came across \nwas working out on a recumbent exercise bike.\n  It is worth listening to some of the complaints registered by \ndetainees themselves. One high-value detainee has alleged that he and \nothers were given ``cheap branded, unscented soap.'' Perhaps the U.S. \nmilitary should have provided the detainees with St. Ives Apricot Scrub \nor Bath & Body Works Sun-Ripened Raspberry shower gel.\n  Mr. President, concerns over scented soap aside, the fundamental \nquestion is, what do we do with the detainees? There are several \noptions I am willing to consider. I am willing to consider more \naggressive repatriation efforts, for example. Or perhaps modifying the \ncurrent facility or moving the detainees housed there to another \noverseas facility. One approach I oppose, however, is shipping these \nterrorists to our own shores. I am confident that most Kentuckians \nwould not want al-Qaida housed down the street from them, and I would \nassume citizens from other States feel the same way.\n  To me, the fundamental question in taking any action regarding \nGuantanamo should be: does this step make the American people safer? \nAccordingly, does bringing al-Qaida to America constitute the best way \nto protect the American people? I myself am heartened that 528 miles of \nocean separates these dangerous men from the United States.\n  It is perhaps worth recalling that these al-Qaida detainees take \ntheir instructions from Osama bin Laden. These are the words of their \nleader in his 1998 fatwa against the United States: ``The ruling to \nkill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--is an \nindividual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which \nit is possible to do it.''\n  Here is more guidance from bin Laden to his supporters: ``We--with \nGod's help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be \nrewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans and plunder \ntheir money wherever and whenever they find it.''\n  It is because of words like these and actions like 9/11 that our \npolicy in the global war on terror has been to keep al-Qaida out of \nthis country. Better to fight them abroad than in the U.S. Yet now some \non the other side of the aisle would require that we bring terrorists \nto the heartland of America and house them near our very own citizens.\n  Lest we forget, these Guantanamo detainees include Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed. As most of us know, KSM, as he is called, was the mastermind \nbehind the attacks of September 11, 2001. This attack killed \napproximately 3,000 innocent men, women, and children.\n  These detainees also include Majid Khan. Mr. Khan was tasked to \ndevelop plans to poison water reservoirs inside the United States and \nwas responsible for studying how to carry out a gas station bombing \ninside America. He also recommended Iyman Faris to al-Qaida. Iyman \nFaris, it will be recalled, was the man who plotted the destruction of \nthe Brooklyn Bridge.\n  These detainees also include Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Mr. al-Nashiri \nwas responsible for orchestrating the attack on the USS Cole, which \nkilled 17 U.S. sailors.\n  These detainees also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani. Mr. Ghailani \nplayed a major role in the East African Embassy bombings which left \nover 250 people dead.\n  Nor should we forget that approximately 415 detainees have been \ntransferred out of Guantanamo. Of these, no less than 29 have \nsubsequently taken up arms against the United States and its allies.\n  The senior Senator from California and other Democratic colleagues, \nhowever, proposed an amendment to the Defense Department authorization \nbill just last week that would mandate that we bring these terrorists \ninto our own communities all across America, in cities and small towns \nin States like California and Illinois and Kentucky. There, they could \neither escape or litigate their way to freedom and then be among the \ninnocent Americans they have sworn to kill. I guarantee you my \nconstituents do not want terrorists housed in their backyards in Fort \nKnox, Fort Wright, or anywhere else in the Commonwealth.\n  The Feinstein proposal reflects a pre-9/11, ``criminal justice'' \napproach to fighting terror. The amendment I offer today to H.R. 2669, \nthe Education Reconciliation bill, reflects quite a different view; a \npost-9/11 understanding of terrorism; a view that recognizes the \nprofound and enduring peril that terrorism poses to the U.S. and its \ncitizens. My amendment is simply a sense of the senate that the \ndetainees housed at Guantanamo should not be released into American \nsociety or transferred stateside into facilities near American \ncommunities and neighborhoods.\n  For those who wish to close or modify the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, however, my amendment is not a status quo amendment. As \nI discussed, my amendment would permit the administration to handle the \ndetainees in other ways. All my amendment would do is to assure the \nAmerican people that the United States Senate does not want these \nterrorists housed on our soil, in our communities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have reviewed this. This side will be \nwilling to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as our Nation's college graduates head out \ninto the workforce, many of them will be faced with the question of \nwhether they should join a union. Some will get to make that decision \nby secret ballot, while others will not.\n  My amendment is very simple. It guarantees that every American worker \nwill get a secret ballot election when deciding whether to join a \nunion. This is especially important because there are some in this body \nwho want to take this right away and conduct union elections by card \ncheck. This approach would open workers to harassment, intimidation, \nand other forms of union pressure. We need safeguards to allow \nemployees to freely choose without intimidation and coercion from union \nbosses.\n  Recent polls have shown that 87 percent of American people agree that \nevery worker should have the right to a secret ballot election. I urge \nmy colleagues to protect workers' rights and vote for this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, time has not been all yielded to ask for \nthe yeas and nays. Point of order. Is it in order to ask for the yeas \nand nays on whether the amendment is passed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a request for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I make a point of order.\n  I withhold that. I have a minute, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not know what bothers the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, being antiworker, anti-union. We know this is the \nmost antiworker, anti-union administration. This has nothing to do with \neducation. We see what is happening over on this side. Slow the process \ndown so we cannot vote on Iraq. Slow the process down so we cannot vote \non energy. Slow the process down so we cannot vote on giving the young \npeople of this country an opportunity to go to college. When is it \ngoing to end?\n  The students of America and the families of America ought to know \nexactly what is happening out here on the floor of the Senate. This has \nnothing to do with education. It is an insult to the workers' \ncommittees of this country.\n\n[[Page S9580]]\n\n  We know this repeals existing law--existing law, which permits, if an \nemployer wants to have a card check, respect for it, can go along. He \nis repealing that provision.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane, and \nI raise a point of order pursuant to sections 305(b)(2) and 310(e) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold, we are going to try to work \nour way through these amendments. We will see how many more people have \nto offer. We are not going to try to match the amendments offered by \nthe minority. They have a right to offer these amendments. This is a \nvery important piece of legislation. We think we should work our way \nthrough it. We are going to work on this for a little while longer. I \nhave already indicated through the floor staff to my distinguished \nfriend the Republican leader that if we don't finish this pretty soon--\nit is 8 o'clock now--we will just come back tomorrow and work on it. \nThis could complicate things; people should understand that. Tomorrow \nwe are obligated to have a vote on the motion to proceed to Homeland \nSecurity appropriations. If that is granted, that 30 hours will run \nthrough until the weekend. That is the process we are in. So if people \nwant to continue offering these amendments, we will do it for a while \ntonight until people feel that they have offered enough in a way to get \nattention and focus attention away from this very good bill.\n  I have come to the floor several times to talk about what a great \nbill this is and how well it was worked by the two managers. I hope we \nwon't spoil it. We are not going to offer any amendments. Our \nimagination is as good as yours, but we are not going to do that. The \ndecision has been made.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, please: Will the \nChair confirm how many votes are required on a motion to waive the \nBudget Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How many is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If my arithmetic is as good as yours, it is \nabout 60.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair for confirming that the rules require \n60 votes on this matter, and I understand that controversial matters \nrequire 60 votes in the Senate.\n  I move to waive the applicable provisions of the Congressional Budget \nAct with respect to my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2340 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. Kyl, \n     and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 2340 to \n     amendment No. 2327.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide limited immunity for reports of suspicious \n                         behavior and response)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IMMUNITY FOR REPORTS OF SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR AND \n                   RESPONSE.\n\n       (a) Immunity for Reports of Suspicious Behavior.--\n       (1) In general.--Any person who, in good faith and based on \n     objectively reasonable suspicion, makes, or causes to be \n     made, a voluntary report of covered activity to an authorized \n     official shall be immune from civil liability under Federal, \n     State, and local law for such report.\n       (2) False reports.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any \n     report that the person knew to be false at the time that \n     person made that report.\n       (b) Immunity for Response.--\n       (1) In general.--Any authorized official who observes, or \n     receives a report of, covered activity and takes reasonable \n     action to respond to such activity shall be immune from civil \n     liability under Federal, State, and local law for such \n     action.\n       (2) Savings clause.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     affect the ability of any authorized official to assert any \n     defense, privilege, or immunity that would otherwise be \n     available, and this subsection shall not be construed as \n     affecting any such defense, privilege, or immunity.\n       (c) Attorney Fees and Costs.--Any person or authorized \n     official found to be immune from civil liability under this \n     section shall be entitled to recover from the plaintiff all \n     reasonable costs and attorney fees.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Authorized official.--The term ``authorized official'' \n     means--\n       (A) any employee or agent of a mass transportation system;\n       (B) any officer, employee, or agent of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, or the \n     Department of Justice;\n       (C) any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer; \n     or\n       (D) any transportation security officer.\n       (2) Covered activity.--The term ``covered activity'' means \n     any suspicious transaction, activity, or occurrence \n     indicating that an individual may be engaging, or preparing \n     to engage, in--\n       (A) a violent act or act dangerous to human life that is a \n     violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any \n     State, or that would be such a violation if committed within \n     the jurisdiction of the United States or any State; or\n       (B) an act of terrorism (as that term is defined in section \n     3077 of title 18, United States Code) that involves, or is \n     directed against, a mass transportation system or vehicle or \n     its passengers.\n       (3) Mass transportation.--The term ``mass \n     transportation''--\n       (A) has the meaning given to that term in section \n     5302(a)(7) of title 49, United States Code; and\n       (B) includes--\n       (i) school bus, charter, or intercity bus transportation;\n       (ii) intercity passenger rail transportation;\n       (iii) sightseeing transportation;\n       (iv) a passenger vessel as that term is defined in section \n     2101(22) of title 46, United States Code;\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\n       (v) other regularly scheduled waterborne transportation \n     service of passengers by vessel of at least 20 gross tons; \n     and\n       (vi) air transportation as that term is defined in section \n     40102 of title 49, United States Code.\n       (4) Mass transportation system.--The term ``mass \n     transportation system'' means an entity or entities organized \n     to provide mass transportation using vehicles, including the \n     infrastructure used to provide such transportation.\n       (5) Vehicle.--The term ``vehicle'' has the meaning given to \n     that term in section 1992(16) of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     November 20, 2006, and shall apply to all activities and \n     claims occurring on or after such date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine to withhold for a brief statement.\n  Mr. President, I have talked to Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nI think it is appropriate we finish this legislation tonight, or in the \nmorning, whatever the case will be. But we are going to continue \nworking tonight. I think that is the most appropriate thing to do.\n  The one thing I have asked for--and I hope the minority can complete \nthat--is that we should have a finite list of amendments, so we at \nleast can get that done and find out how many amendments we have to \nwork through. I would hope the minority would work on that to see if we \ncan come up with a finite list of amendments before final passage.\n  I apologize to my friend for the interruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, an alert citizenry is one of our best defenses against \nterrorist attacks. That is why the New York City subway system has \nsigns saying: ``See Something, Say Something.'' That is just what a \ngroup of airline passengers did recently in reporting suspicious \nactivity they thought represented a terrorist threat. What was the \nresult? Those passengers, the pilot, the airline, and the airport were \nall sued. The Collins-Kyl-Lieberman amendment would protect individuals \nfrom lawsuits when they, in good faith, report reasonable suspicious \nbehavior that may reflect terrorist activity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Our amendment would protect from lawsuits individual citizens who \nreport suspicious activity. The report would have to be in good faith. \nIt would have to be reasonable.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment is not germane. It is \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I would be \nhappy to hold hearings on it. This is so overbroad that you could have \nall kinds of problems. It could invite racial and religious profiling. \nSuppose somebody is wearing religious garb and it frightens somebody. \nThey could immediately--or maybe it doesn't frighten them, but they \ncould say it does. It broadly protects Government officials from \npotential misconduct. It sets a new standard for a government official \nresponding to reports of activity, and it is basically a court-\nstripping bill.\n  If this is for more than a political point on this bill, fine, bring \nit to the Judiciary Committee. We will hold a hearing on it before the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, anybody who sees something that looks \ndifferent: Hispanic, Black, someone wearing religious garb, they have a \nreasonable ground to turn them in under this. This is far too broad. \nLet it go to the Judiciary Committee--I guarantee we will have a \nhearing--but not on this.\n  I make the motion that the pending amendment is not germane. I raise \na point of order pursuant to section 305(b)2 and 310(e)1 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2356 to amendment 2327:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Since I. Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby previously served as Chief \n     of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney;\n       Since Mr. Libby was convicted in federal court of perjury \n     and obstruction of justice in connection with efforts by the \n     Bush White House to conceal the fact that Administration \n     officials leaked the name of a covert CIA agent in order to \n     discredit her husband, a critic of the Iraq War;\n       Since U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton sentenced Mr. \n     Libby to 30 months in prison to reflect the seriousness of \n     the offense, the sensitivity of the national security \n     information involved in Libby's crime, and the abuse of Mr. \n     Libby's position of trust in the United States government;\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\n       Since President Bush chose to commute Mr. Libby's prison \n     sentence in its entirety, thereby entitling Libby to evade \n     serious punishment for his criminal conduct;\n       Since President Bush has refused to rule out the \n     possibility that he will eventually issue a full pardon to \n     Mr. Libby with respect to his criminal conviction;\n       Now therefore be it determined that it is the Sense of the \n     Senate that President Bush should not issue a pardon to I. \n     Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is, frankly, regrettable that as we \nwork on this floor on an issue that is absolutely important to the \npeople of this country; that is, the future of our children and their \neducation and providing them with the opportunity to have the American \ndream, that we are having to have votes on politically motivated \namendments that are coming forward from the other side. It would be in \nthe best interest of this institution and the American people to stop \nthis and not to go forward with these kinds of amendments.\n  Regrettably, if you are going to shoot this way, we have to shoot \nthat way. I ask my colleagues to send the sense of the Senate to the \nPresident of the United States that he should not pardon Scooter Libby.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe there is an opportunity for someone \nto speak against the amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, until this last amendment, I haven't seen \npolitically inspired amendments before this body, and we don't have to \nvote on politically inspired amendments.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, a suggestion of \npolitical motivation is a violation of the rules of the Senate, and I \ndon't believe that any of these amendments have been politically \ninspired.\n  The next one offered by Republicans has to do with Pell grants. I \nthink the senior Senator from California had a very serious amendment \nwith respect to detainees at Guantanamo, and there was an amendment \nwhich related to that issue. We had an amendment on the fairness \ndoctrine, another on the Secret Ballot Protection Act.\n  These are serious amendments. I am sure my colleague did not wish to \nsuggest they were politically inspired. I hope that we don't get into \npolitically inspired amendments and that our colleagues will vote \nagainst the amendment that has been offered just for that reason.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  (Subsequently, action on this amendment was vitiated.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2357 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2357 to amendment No. 2327:\n\n       Deploring the actions of former President William Jefferson \n     Clinton regarding his granting of clemency to terrorists, to \n     family members, donors, and individuals represented by family \n     members, to public officials of his own political party, and \n     to officials who violated laws protecting United States \n     intelligence, and concluding that such actions by former \n     President Clinton were inappropriate.\n       The Armed Forces of National Liberation (the FALN) is a \n     terrorist organization that claims responsibility for the \n     bombings of approximately 130 civilian, political, and \n     military sites throughout the United States, and whereas, on \n     August 11, 1999, President Clinton commuted the sentences of \n     16 terrorists, all of whom were members of the FALN, and \n     whereas this action was taken counter to the recommendation \n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons, and two United States Attorneys;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     commuted the sentence of Susan L. Rosenberg, a former member \n     of the Weather Underground Organization terrorist group whose \n     mission included the violent overthrow of the United States \n     Government, who was charged in a robbery that left a security \n     guard and 2 police officers dead;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     commuted the sentence of Linda Sue Evans, a former member of \n     the Weather Underground Organization terrorist group, who \n     made false statements and used false identification to \n     illegally purchase firearms that were then used by Susan L. \n     Rosenberg in a robbery that left a security guard and 2 \n     police officers dead;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned Patricia Hearst Shaw, a former member of the \n     Symbionese Liberation Army, a domestic terrorist group which \n     also advocated the violent overthrow of the United States, \n     and that carried out violent attacks in the United States;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned his half-brother Roger Clinton, who had been \n     convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and of \n     distribution of cocaine;\n       Since, on March 15, 2000, former President Clinton pardoned \n     Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory, who had been convicted of \n     conspiracy to willfully misapply bank funds and to make false \n     statements and who, according to news reports, were \n     represented by the former President's brother-in-law, Tony \n     Rodham;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignali, a convicted cocaine \n     trafficker who, according to news reports, was represented by \n     the former President's brother-in-law, Hugh Rodham;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned Almon Glenn Braswell, an individual convicted of \n     money laundering and tax evasion, who according to news \n     reports, was represented by former President's brother-in-\n     law, Hugh Rodham;\n       Since, on December 22, 2000, former President Clinton \n     pardoned former Democratic Representative Dan Rostenkowski, \n     who had been convicted of mail fraud;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     commuted the sentence of convicted sex offender and former \n     Democratic Representative Mel Reynolds, who had been found \n     guilty of bank fraud, wire fraud, making false statements to \n     a financial institution, conspiracy to defraud the Federal \n     Elections Commission, and making false statements to a \n     Federal official;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned his former Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development Henry Cisneros, who had been convicted of making \n     false statements about payments to his mistress;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned Susan McDougal, who had been a key figure in the \n     Whitewater investigation and who had been convicted of aiding \n     and abetting, in making false statements, and who refused to \n     testify against the former President in the investigation;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned Christopher Wade, who was a real estate salesmen \n     involved in the Whitewater matter;\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned his former Director of Central Intelligence John \n     Deutch for his mishandling of national security secrets; and\n       Since, on January 20, 2001, former President Clinton \n     pardoned Samuel Loring Morison, a former Navy intelligence \n     analyst who was convicted on espionage charges: Now, \n     therefore, be it determined that it is the sense of the \n     Senate that\n       (1) former President Clinton's granting of clemency to 16 \n     FALN terrorists, two former members of the Weather \n     Underground Organization, and a former member of the \n     Symbionese Liberation Army was inappropriate;\n       (2) former President Clinton's granting of clemency to \n     individuals either in his family or represented by family \n     members was inappropriate;\n       (3) former President Clinton's granting of clemency to \n     public figures from his own political party was \n     inappropriate;\n       (4) former President Clinton's pardons of individuals \n     involved with the Whitewater investigation, a matter in which \n     the former First Family was centrally involved, was \n     inappropriate; and\n       (5) former President Clinton's pardons of individuals who \n     have jeopardized intelligence gathering and operations were \n     inappropriate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senate has decided to go into \ndebating the appropriateness of future pardons, there is plenty of \nmaterial to go around on past pardons. President Clinton's decision to \npardon a host of individuals convicted of serious crimes then is \ncertainly worthy of Senate comment as well.\n  Many of the individuals were convicted of the crime of terrorism. \nSome\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nwere individuals who jeopardized intelligence gathering. Some were \nfamily members and represented by family.\n  My fundamental point is if the Senate wants to spend the evening \ncommenting on the advisability of pardons that have not yet occurred, \nmaybe we ought to go on record discussing the appropriateness of \npardons that have already occurred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what in the world does the Republican \nleader have against this legislation? The legislation we have here \nbefore the Senate passed 17 to 3. The authorizing provision that \nchanges policy was virtually unanimous. Young people all over the \ncountry are looking in on the Senate. This is about the future of this \nnext generation, their hopes and their dreams. It is about our country \nand being able to compete in the world. It is about the quality of our \nArmed Forces, about getting well-trained, well-educated young people. \nIt is about our institutions, whether they are going to be functioning \nand working.\n  Why can't we go ahead and vote on this legislation? We were here for \n2 days waiting for different amendments on education and few of them \ncame. Why in the world are you holding up this legislation that means \nso much to the future of our young people? We are prepared to vote. We \ndidn't have amendments over here on our side. We want to get this \nlegislation going ahead. We are looking forward to the reauthorization \ndebate for next week, and we are looking forward to getting something \nworthy of this institution.\n  In the 45 years I have been in the Senate under the leadership of \nStafford of Vermont, of Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, of the Members \nwhom we have had here--we have had true commitment.\n  Why are we disrupting this effort?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the Salazar \namendment, the vote be vitiated, stricken from the Record, and that we \nnot have a rollcall vote on the amendment that was offered by my \ndistinguished counterpart, Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I very much agree with the consent \nagreement the majority leader propounded. I think we have a chance here \nto wrap up this bill in the next hour, hour and a half. We are \nwhittling down the amendments. I have given a list to the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do say there has been--I say this with \neveryone here--I said a few things today when no one was here. But I \ncomplimented these two managers of this bill. They have been exemplary, \nthe way they--with two different political philosophies, we all know \nthat, but they have worked together, not just this year but for a \nnumber of years, to put out some good legislation in that committee.\n  I do not want to make any of the chairmen and ranking members feel \nbad, but this committee has a lot of good work they have finished and \nthey will be able to bring to this floor things we have been waiting \nfor for years. I appreciate the intensity of everyone's feelings on \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments remaining in order \non this piece of legislation subject to second-degree amendments be the \nColeman amendment, innocent child; Graham amendment, no Pell grants for \ndrug dealers; Cornyn amendment, H-1B visas; Sununu amendment, tuition \ndeduction permanence; DeMint amendment, adoption tax permanence; Ensign \namendment, Social Security for illegal immigrants; Dole amendment, \nvoter ID; Kyl amendment, AMT repeal.\n  We are going to be very selective in our second-degree amendments. We \nhope we can move through this very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want \nto understand what the majority leader's position is with regard to the \npossibility of second degrees.\n  Mr. REID. I have told the Republican leader we definitely will have \nan amendment on No. 6. I told everybody that. You already have that \namendment. We will look at these others. I haven't seen those. But you \nwill have plenty of time to look at them. They will be relating to the \nsubject matter of the amendment that is offered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my concern is to make sure these first-\ndegree amendments do, in fact, get votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will not prevent votes on these, subject \nto second-degree amendments and points of order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Understood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nask both of the leaders--I have not even given any speeches; you all \nare lucky. But let me ask, is it the intent now that we are at this \npoint that we are not going to--whatever amendments are left, we do not \nintend to get back into the regime of amendments we just got through \ntaking out by unanimous consent? Those ideas are no longer--we are not \ngoing to consider them? I am not agreeing to unanimous consent unless \nyou are agreeing to that. We are not just agreeing to these amendments \nand second-degrees, we are not going to have that kind of amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I would hope on this bill and any other bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not talking about any other bill.\n  Mr. REID. On this bill, yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may, the majority leader has the list. They do \nnot include content of the kind we were dealing with in the last two \namendments, so I think the Senator from New Mexico will be pleased.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2357 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would withhold.\n  Would the Chair withdraw the McConnell amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nMcConnell amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, because I have \nbeen waiting to offer my amendment, if my amendment would be allowed to \nbe the first amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I think we have the list here. We do not personally care. \nWe do not care what order, so it is up to you. You have the next \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I think \nhe should proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2355 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2355.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce document fraud, prevent identity theft, and \npreserve the integrity of the Social Security system, by ensuring that \n   individuals are not able to receive Social Security benefits as a \n                      result of unlawful activity)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PRECLUSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS PRIOR TO \n                   ENUMERATION OR FOR ANY PERIOD WITHOUT WORK \n                   AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Insured Status.--Section 214 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 414) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2)--\n       ``(A) no quarter of coverage shall be credited for purposes \n     of this section if, with respect to any individual who is \n     assigned a social security account number on or after the\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\n     date of enactment of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, \n     such quarter of coverage is earned prior to the year in which \n     such social security account number is assigned; and\n       ``(B) no quarter of coverage shall be credited for purposes \n     of this section for any calendar year, with respect to an \n     individual who is not a natural-born United States citizen, \n     unless the Commissioner of Social Security determines, on the \n     basis of information provided to the Commissioner in \n     accordance with an agreement entered into under subsection \n     (e) or otherwise, that the individual was authorized to be \n     employed in the United States during such quarter.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any \n     quarter of coverage earned by an individual who, at such time \n     such quarter of coverage is earned, satisfies the criterion \n     specified in subsection (c)(2).\n       ``(e) Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall enter into an agreement \n     with the Commissioner of Social Security to provide such \n     information as the Commissioner determines necessary to carry \n     out the limitations on crediting quarters of coverage under \n     subsection (d). Nothing in this subsection may be construed \n     as establishing an effective date for purposes of this \n     section.''.\n       (b) Benefit Computation.--Section 215(e) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 415(e)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (1);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) in computing the average indexed monthly earnings of \n     an individual who is assigned a social security account \n     number on or after the date of enactment of the Higher \n     Education Access Act of 2007, there shall not be counted any \n     wages or self-employment income for which no quarter of \n     coverage may be credited to such individual as a result of \n     the application of section 214(d).''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I hate to be offering an amendment such as \nthis on this bill, but as we know around here, a lot of times we do not \nget to offer amendments. I wanted to offer my amendment on the \nimmigration reform debate, so we are offering it tonight because it is \none of the only chances we will have to offer it this year.\n  My amendment denies Social Security benefits for illegal, fraud-based \nwork. It also ensures an individual who is on a visa overstay, or \nsomeone who has a card in their name but is working here illegally will \nnot get credit for that illegal work.\n  There have been many media reports recently about illegal immigrants \nstealing Americans' Social Security numbers. Last year I spoke about \nAudra, who was a stay-at-home mom since 2000. Over 200 different \nillegal immigrants stole her identity, used her Social Security number. \nShe ended up owing the IRS over $1 million. That is the kind of thing \nwe have to have stopped. We should not reward those who have stolen \npeople's identities with Social Security benefits.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, this has nothing to do with our \neducation bill whatsoever. It is completely not germane.\n  Secondly, it says to every American citizen who was not born here in \nthe United States of America, who might have been an American citizen \nfor 30 years or 40 years, you are going to have to go back in your \nhistory and demonstrate and show you were authorized to be here for the \nlast 30 or 40 years if you are an American citizen, if you are born \noutside of this country.\n  What in the world does that have to do with our education system? \nAbsolutely nothing. This amendment would apply to Henry Kissinger, it \nwould apply to Madeleine Albright, it would apply to Mel Martinez. It \nwould apply to all American citizens who were not born in this country.\n  That is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2358 to Amendment No. 2355\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2358 to amendment No. 2355.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after line 1, page 1 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON ILLEGAL ALIENS QUALIFYING FOR SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY BENEFITS AND PRECLUSION OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY CREDITS PRIOR TO ENUMERATION OR FOR \n                   ANY PERIOD WITHOUT WORK AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Illegal Aliens Qualifying for Social \n     Security Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act, or the amendments \n     made by this Act, shall be construed to modify any provision \n     of current law that prohibits illegal aliens from qualifying \n     for Social Security benefits.\n       (2) Enforcement.--The Attorney General shall ensure that \n     the prohibition on the receipt of Social Security by illegal \n     aliens is strictly enforced.\n       (b) Preclusion of Social Security Credits Prior to \n     Enumeration or for Any Period Without Work Authorization.--\n       (1) Insured status.--Section 214 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 414) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsections:\n       ``(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2)--\n       ``(A) no quarter of coverage shall be credited for purposes \n     of this section if, with respect to any individual who is \n     assigned a social security account number on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, such quarter of coverage is \n     earned prior to the year in which such social security \n     account number is assigned; and\n       ``(B) no quarter of coverage shall be credited for purposes \n     of this section for any calendar year, with respect to an \n     individual who is not a United States citizen if the \n     Commissioner of Social Security determines, on the basis of \n     information provided to the Commissioner in accordance with \n     an agreement entered into under subsection (e) or otherwise, \n     that the individual was not authorized to be employed in the \n     United States during such quarter.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any \n     quarter of coverage earned by an individual who, at such time \n     such quarter of coverage is earned, satisfies the criterion \n     specified in subsection (c)(2).\n       ``(e) Not later than 180 days after the date of this Act \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security shall enter into an \n     agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security to provide \n     such information as the Commissioner determines necessary to \n     carry out the limitations on crediting quarters of cover \n     under subsection, (d), however, this provision shall not be \n     construed to establish an effective date for purposes of this \n     section.''.\n       (2) Benefit computation.--Section 215(e) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 4159e)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (1);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n     inserting ``and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) in computing the average indexed monthly earnings of \n     an individual who is assigned a social security account \n     number on or after the date of enactment of this Act, there \n     shall not be counted any wages or self-employment income for \n     which no quarter of coverage may be credited to such \n     individual as a result of the application of section \n     214(d).''.\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall be effective as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this amendment is very clear. It \nreaffirms that illegal immigrants cannot and will not receive Social \nSecurity benefits. It focuses the Attorney General to strongly and \nvigorously enforce this provision, and it focuses enforcement efforts \nagainst those who are here illegally, not American citizens who are \nnaturalized and here legally.\n  Unfortunately, whether intended or not, the Ensign amendment would \nthreaten the Social Security benefits of millions of Americans. It \nmakes no sense. We need to focus the Attorney General on those who are \nhere illegally, and make it very clear that no one who is here \nillegally can receive Social Security benefits, period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first I want to address what Senator \nKennedy said in case there is misinformation out there in what he said, \nthat Mel Martinez and others would not qualify for benefits under my \namendment. That is absolutely false. We have cleared this, we have run \nthe traps on it. It is necessary to make sure that not just someone who \nis here illegally now who is stealing someone's identity but it is when \nthey become legalized that we want to prevent them from getting Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  That is the problem with the Stabenow amendment, that illegals cannot \nget benefits now. What we want to do is prevent them, if they become \nlegalized--that the work they did when they stole someone's Social \nSecurity number, we don't want them to have benefits.\n  Mr. President, is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is not expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I make a point of order that the second-degree amendment is not \ngermane.\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To discourage drug use among college students)\n\n       Strike section 701 of the Higher Education Access Act of \n     2007, relating to student eligibility.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to do something else unusual. I \nthink we have an agreement to voice vote this amendment. Quite frankly, \nthe amendment is pretty simple. I think that is why we are all going to \nagree to it.\n  Under the current student loan application process you are asked: \nHave you ever been convicted of a drug offense? That question \ndetermines whether or not you are eligible for a period of time to get \nstudent loan money. If you have been convicted of simple possession, \nyou are ineligible for a year; the second offense, 2 years; the third \noffense, indefinite ineligibility. If you sold, first offense, two \nyears of ineligibility from date of conviction.\n  The application has a question that I think makes all this relevant: \n``Have you ever been convicted'' is the question. That has been taken \noff the application. It needs to stay on. I would urge everyone to \nsupport this amendment to keep current law as it is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge our Members to support this \namendment. Those who are ineligible because of drug usage, for the Pell \ngrants, will be ineligible under our legislation. This clarifies it. We \nhad simplified the application form. The Senator's amendment addresses \nthat simplification, and we will accept that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2360) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is \nseeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2359 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2359 to amendment No. 2327.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To protect innocent children)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. INNOCENT CHILD PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any authority, \n     military or civil, of the United States, a State, or any \n     district, possession, commonwealth or other territory under \n     the authority of the United States, to carry out a sentence \n     of death on a woman while she carries a child in utero.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``child in \n     utero'' means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any \n     stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my amendment, the protection of the \ninnocent child, will prohibit any level of government--Federal, \nmilitary, and State governments--from carrying out a death sentence on \na pregnant woman.\n  In existing law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n1994 already prohibits Federal executions of a woman while pregnant. \nHowever, this law does not apply to the military or States. In fact, \nmost executions are carried out by States. Additionally, the existing \nlaw does not recognize the principle of the unborn child is innocent \nand, therefore, must be shielded from wrongful execution.\n  My amendment does not reflect any point of view on the desirability \nor appropriateness of capital punishment. This amendment is grounded in \nthe undeniable fact that a human being is being carried by the pregnant \nwoman and cannot possibly be guilty of a crime and, therefore, should \nnot be subject to the death penalty itself.\n  Women do become pregnant in prison, even at maximum security \nfacilities, from sad and unfortunate situations involving rape or \nhaving relations with a guard. Congress should prevent the government \nat any level from taking the life of an innocent human being by \nprohibiting within all U.S. jurisdictions any death sentence from being \ncarried out when a woman convicted of a capital crime is pregnant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we could accept this antideath penalty \namendment, and we are going to accept it, so we would rather avoid a \nvote, if we might. We are willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2359) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to proceed \nfor 30 seconds. We have three tax amendments and one voter ID. They are \nstill remaining on the list, so that is what we will try to address \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2341 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2341 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2341 to amendment No. 2327.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To permanently extend certain education-related tax \n                              incentives)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF CERTAIN EDUCATION-RELATED \n                   TAX INCENTIVES.\n\n       Title IX of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 (relating to sunset of provisions \n     of such Act) shall not apply to title IV of such Act \n     (relating to affordable education provisions).\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment that \nhas a great deal to do with education. That is the underlying issue \nthat we are debating tonight. We have an important bill that tries to \naddress accessibility of higher education for millions of Americans, \nand my amendment addresses that very subject by extending a number of \nimportant provisions that are currently in tax law, but they expire in \n2010. These are provisions that have broad bipartisan support, \nprovisions that many in this Chamber have voted for time and again; \nallowing a $2,000 contribution to educational savings accounts, having \nan exclusion for your employer if they provide you with education \nassistance to encourage those employers to foster additional education \nfor their employees; having tax exempt bonds for qualified education \nfacilities; giving deductions, tax deductions for tuition to millions \nof Americans across the country seeking higher education, and allowing \na deduction of student loan interest, not just for those who itemize on \ntheir taxes but for all Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in this effort to extend these \nexisting provisions in law, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, certainly the sentiments of this \namendment are absolutely correct. We certainly want to increase \ndeductibility.\n  As my friend from New Hampshire knows, I have worked long and hard on \nthis and was able to work with some others--the Senator from Maine and \nsome others--to actually get into law and then get extended a $4,000 \ntuition deductibility for the vast majority of families.\n  But the trouble with this amendment, of course, is not only is it not \npaid for, but if it were to be added to this bill, it would rob from \nPeter to give to Paul because it would undo all of the good things in \nthe underlying bill--not just the Pell grants but the excellent \nprovision that says that no one, even of middle income and higher \nmiddle income, should pay more than 15 percent of their adjusted \nearnings when they pay back their student loans.\n  So I will be offering a second-degree amendment that says we \ncertainly agree with increasing tuition deductibility but not at the \nexpense of what the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New \nHampshire are trying to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2361 to Amendment No. 2341\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2361 to amendment No. 2341.\n\n  Mr. Schumer. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide \n     tax relief to help families afford the cost of higher \n     education, including making tuition deductible against taxes, \n     and eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on \n     unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost \n     and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more \n     interest to foreign creditors; and that such relief should be \n     provided on an appropriate legislative vehicle that won't \n     jeopardize legislation providing greater access and \n     affordability to higher education for millions of students by \n     subjecting the bill to a ``blue slip'' by the House.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, is there time remaining on the second-\ndegree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this second-degree amendment expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that Congress should provide tax relief to help \nfamilies afford the cost of higher education, including making tuition \ndeductible against taxes and eliminate wasteful spending such as \nspending on the necessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the \ncosts and forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to \nforeign creditors.\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\n  We do believe on this side in pay-go. We are going to pay for the \nworthy programs we want to enact and put our fiscal house in order. \nThis amendment expresses that. It expresses the view also that we \nshould not jeopardize that, because if this amendment were to be \nadopted, it being tax legislation, the bill would be blue-slipped by \nthe House and sent back to the Finance Committee, and all of the good \nwork we have done over the last day or two and the great things that \nwould be done to help those who need Pell grants and those middle-class \nstudents who will have their loan repayments capped will be gone down \nthe drain. That is what the second-degree amendment does.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I have three quick points. I certainly \ntrust the Finance Committee. If the Finance Committee believes in all \nthese tax provisions, it could send the bill back expediently, and it \ncould move on its merry way. But the suggestion that doing the right \nthing on taxes is incompatible with the Senate doing its work is wrong.\n  Second, this is a second degree. It is a sense of the Senate that we \nagree with all these tax provisions. But we don't quite agree enough to \nactually write them into law. I think that is a little disappointing \nand disingenuous. I think if we believe this is good policy, it is the \nright thing to encourage accessibility of higher education, if it is \nthe right thing to do for the 75 percent of filers in that $50,000 to \n$65,000 range to take advantage of these provisions, we should put it \nin this bill and pass it into law, and we should make sure these \nprovisions continue to be accessible to the Americans who use them.\n  I make a point of order that this second-degree amendment is \nnongermane, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the point of order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, no one disputes that a key part of \nAmerica's economy is our ability to innovate and retain the most \nqualified workers, especially in areas such as math, science, and \nengineering. There is one step Congress can take this year to help \nprovide at least temporary relief. My amendment would allow the \nDepartment of State and the Department of Homeland Security to \nrecapture unused employment-based visas. These unused visa numbers \nwould go to nurses, physical therapists, and other key areas for people \nwith extraordinary ability with advanced degrees.\n  This amendment would also include a one-time H-1B visa increase of \n115,000 for fiscal year 2008 only, given if that cap was hit in the \nfirst day this year.\n  This amendment will go a long way to help provide the legal workers \nwho are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this H-1B visa issue was debated during \nthe course of the immigration bill. We decided to increase the number \nof the H-1B visas but also increase the safeguards against abuse. We \nknow abuses are taking place. We wanted to be sure American workers \nhave first chance at these jobs, No. 1; and, No. 2, we want to stop \nthese foreign job shops that are using thousands of these H-1B visas to \noutsource jobs in the United States then back to their home country.\n  None of those reforms are included. All we have is an increase in the \nH-1B visa numbers. We need a balanced and coordinated approach that \nincreases the numbers with the safeguards. Unfortunately, Senator \nCornyn's amendment does not do that, and I urge my colleagues to oppose \nit.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order pursuant to section 305(b)(2) and section 310(e) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the Budget Act for the consideration of this amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I may have an amendment that we can \nactually all agree on tonight.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the infant adoption tax credit is a \npowerful tool that is making it possible for thousands of American \nfamilies to open their homes to children in need. I know everyone here \nagrees with me that there is nothing more important than for a child to \nhave someone to call a mom and a dad. There is nothing more important \nto the success of education than a good family.\n  Unfortunately, the current adoption tax credit is scheduled to sunset \nin 2010. If we don't make this tax relief permanent, adoption taxes \nwill go up and many American families will not be able to afford the \nexpenses associated with adoption, which are now between $10,000 and \n$25,000. I wish to thank all the people in this Chamber who have done \nso much for the cause of adoption, especially Senator Landrieu, Senator \nCraig, and Senator Bunning, whose amendment we are actually bringing up \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 1 minute on this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a very basic and fundamental issue. This \nis a constitutional issue. The taxes that are raised result in a blue \nslip, which effectively is automatically exercised. The chairman of our \nBudget Committee, the Senator from North Dakota, understands this and \nunderstands it well. It effectively ends the bill. It effectively ends \nthe bill constitutionally.\n  I understand the Senator from Louisiana is going to have an \nalternative. There are only three tax provisions, but the tax \nprovisions that are offered effectively result in what is a \nconstitutional blue slip. I have not talked about killer amendments or \npoison pills, I am talking about this constitutionally.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota, from the Budget Committee, \nagrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2363 to Amendment No. 2362\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2363 to amendment No. 2362.\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     permanently extend the adoption tax credit and eliminate \n     wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary tax \n     loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost and avoid \n     forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to \n     foreign creditors; and that such relief should be provided on \n     an appropriate legislative vehicle that won't jeopardize \n     legislation providing greater access and affordability to \n     higher education for millions of students by subjecting the \n     bill to a ``blue slip'' by the House.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offer this second-degree. I appreciate \nthe Senator's compliments about the work we have done to put this tax \ncredit on the books. It is a very important tax credit, but if we are \ngoing to have it, we need to pay for it.\n  The problem with the first-degree amendment is it is not paid for and \nit is going to jeopardize the underlying bill. So, yes, we do need to \nextend this tax permanently but not on this bill and not tonight, and \nwe need to find a way to pay for it. That is why I am offering this \namendment as a second-degree.\n  I ask all of us who are supporting it to vote for the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her comments as \nwell. We all know adoption is an important issue. I wish the situation \nwere such in the Senate that we could bring this up at a different \ntime. As we look forward to between now and the rest of this year and, \nfrankly, through 2008, it is going to be very difficult to get this \namendment up. We know the process of getting back to the Finance \nCommittee and then back as part of this bill will not bring this bill \ndown. I encourage my colleagues to look at the greater good, the issue \nhere. There is no reason we can't create some predictability with the \nadoption tax credit so we can continue to grow the number of adoptions \nin this country.\n  For that reason, I raise a point of order that the pending second-\ndegree amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthe act for the purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am proposing a commonsense measure to \nuphold the integrity of Federal elections. My amendment to require \nvoters to show photo identification at the polls would go a long way in \nminimizing potential for voter fraud.\n  When a fraudulent vote is cast and counted, the vote of a legitimate \nvoter is cancelled. This is wrong, and my amendment would help ensure \nthat one of the hallmarks of our democracy, our free and fair \nelections, is protected.\n  This provision was approved by the Senate in the 109th Congress when \nit was filed by Minority Leader McConnell, who I am proud to have as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Opinion polls repeatedly confirm that Americans overwhelmingly \nsupport this initiative. I strongly encourage my colleagues to stand \nwith the American people and support this measure.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak against this \nmeasure. If one would want to suppress the election, suppress the vote \nin the 2008 election, one would vote for this because this measure goes \ninto effect January 1, 2008. It provides that everybody who votes \nessentially would have to have a photo ID. If you want to suppress the \nminority vote, the elderly vote, the poor vote, this is exactly the way \nto do it. I urge a ``no'' vote. Many of these people do not have \ndriver's licenses. This amendment would cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars to actually carry out. It is a grant program to the States, but \nit goes into effect--surprise--January 1, 2008. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder pursuant to sections 305(b)(2) and 310(e) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I move to waive all applicable provisions \nof the Budget Act for the consideration of my amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the \n                  individual alternative minimum tax)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. REPEAL OF INDIVIDUAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 55(a) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to alternative minimum tax imposed) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new flush \n     sentence:\n       ``For purposes of this title, the tentative minimum tax on \n     any taxpayer other than a corporation for any taxable year \n     beginning after December 31, 2007, shall be zero.''.\n       (b) Modification of Limitation on Use of Credit for Prior \n     Year Minimum Tax Liability.--Subsection (c) of section 53 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to credit for \n     prior year minimum tax liability) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(c) Limitation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year \n     shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--\n       ``(A) the regular tax liability of the taxpayer for such \n     taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable \n     under subparts A, B, D, E, and F of this part, over\n       ``(B) the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year.\n       ``(2) Taxable years beginning after 2007.--In the case of \n     any taxable year beginning after 2007, the credit allowable \n     under subsection (a) to a taxpayer other than a corporation \n     for any taxable year shall not exceed 90 percent of the \n     regular tax liability of the taxpayer for such taxable year \n     reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subparts A, \n     B, D, E, and F of this part.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2007.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the AMT patch that protected most taxpayers \nfrom the alternative minimum tax expired on December 31 of last year. \nAs a result, 15 million additional taxpayers on top of the 4 million \ntaxpayers already subject to AMT are subject to the tax this year. This \nbill affords us an opportunity to correct the problem now, and we \nshould. We are halfway through the year, and the tax is adding up. The \nAMT should be repealed as soon as possible.\n  The text of my amendment is identical to a bill introduced by Senator \nBaucus on January 4. It is S. 55. Very simply, the bill would repeal \nthe individual AMT without any revenue offsets.\n  In his introductory statement, Senator Baucus noted that the AMT is a \n``monster that really cannot be improved. It cannot be made to work \nright.'' I agree with him. That is why the Senate should vote to repeal \nthe AMT now, before it overwhelms the middle class.\n  While I believe the Chair will rule it is not germane to this bill, I \nwould suggest to my colleagues it is propitious; that this bill gives \nus the opportunity to act now to repeal this tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, if you want to \nkill this bill, this is the way to do it. If your real intention is to \neliminate the educational assistance for millions of young people in \nAmerica, vote for this amendment.\n  Everybody knows what is at stake. The Constitution provides revenue \nbills must begin in the House of Representatives. To begin it here \nviolates the blue slip process, violates the Budget Act, and will kill \nthis bill.\n  All of us know the AMT has to be fixed. In the budget we have passed \nit is fixed. It will be fixed by consideration in the Finance \nCommittee, which is where alternatives for fixing it should be \nconsidered.\n  This is not the time. It is not the place. It violates the Budget \nAct. It violates the constitutional requirement for the initiation of \nrevenue measures. I hope my colleagues will resist the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2364 To Amendment No. 2353\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment to this \namendment. I call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2364 to amendment No. 2353.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide \n     relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax to prevent the \n     expansion of the AMT to nearly 23 million taxpayers in 2007 \n     and eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on \n     unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost \n     of such repeal and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay \n     substantially more interest to foreign creditors; and that \n     such relief should be provided on an appropriate legislative \n     vehicle that won't jeopardize legislation providing greater \n     access and affordability to higher education for millions of \n     students by subjecting the bill to a ``blue slip'' by the \n     House.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, if we are going to vote--and clearly this \nis blue slip material--No. 1., No. 2, it is not germane. And No. 3, it \nis not paid for. Madam President, $872 billion is what is contained in \nthat. So if we are going to do the AMT, which all of us believe we \nought to do, we ought to do it in a responsible way that raises the \nquestion of unnecessary spending, closing tax loopholes, and doing what \nis necessary to try to pay for this. That is what my amendment \nsuggests. If you want to vote somehow to do something about the AMT, \nlet's vote in a responsible way, do it in a way that repeals those \nloopholes, looks at the Tax Code, and pays for that purpose.\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\n  So accordingly, Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I will suggest that under the Budget Act the proposed second-degree \namendment is not germane. Let me make two comments about it first.\n  I think it is responsible for us to repeal the AMT in the way the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has proposed to this \nbody in S. 55. I happen to be a cosponsor of that bill. I think it is a \nvery good idea.\n  It is true it repeals the AMT without any revenue offsets. I happen \nto believe, as the chairman of the Finance Committee does, that is a \nresponsible action, given the number of Americans who otherwise would \nbe subject to the tax.\n  While I appreciate the notion that a sense of the Senate that we \nshould do tax relief on AMT would be a good thing for this body to do, \none of two things will happen. Either the blue slip issue will not be a \nproblem because it will not be raised and we can, in fact, use this \nvehicle to accomplish this result now or it will and, in effect, my \namendment would have been the equivalent of a sense of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I raise a point of order under the \nCongressional Budget Act that the proposed second-degree amendment is \nnot germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for the \npurpose of the consideration of this amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I voted to sustain the point of order \nthat the DeMint amendment was not germane to the pending higher \neducation bill. There is no doubt that the DeMint amendment on labor \nlaw involving secret ballots has nothing to do with education. \nTherefore, it is out of order on this bill unless 60 Senators vote to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  I recently voted to invoke cloture on the so-called card check bill \nfor reasons detailed in a lengthy floor statement that was a vote on \nprocedure in order to debate and consider the adequacy of the NLRB's \nhandling of unfair labor complaints including elections for union \ncertification.\n  That vote and tonight's vote do not signify my position on the \nsubstantive provisions of the entitled Free Choice card check Act or \nthe DeMint amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, we must develop a visa system that is \nnot only fair but also good for America. That is why tonight, I voted \nagainst an amendment that would have raised the cap on H-1B visas \nwithout providing many of the safeguards that are necessary to the H-1B \nvisa system. While we must maintain our competitive edge in the world \nby bringing in the world's most talented and keen minds, we also must \ntake steps to ensure that the program is not abused and does not \ndisplace U.S. workers. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe coming months to achieve comprehensive H-1B reform that will \nimprove the program in a balanced and fair manner.\n  I also want to express my profound disappointment that this and other \nunrelated issues were permitted to slow down and distract from the \nimportant work of helping more students achieve the dream of a college \neducation. The Higher Education Access Reconciliation Act was not the \nplace to legislate these issues and only jeopardized our ability to \nhelp millions of students who await the passage of this bill and the \n$17.3 billion increase in student aid that it provides.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership in bringing a bill \nto the floor to make college more affordable for millions of students. \nI also want to thank him for the example he has set over many years in \nstanding up repeatedly to protect the interests of the students of \nAmerica, and in so doing, to work tirelessly for the future benefit of \nour economy and our country. I am fortunate to now serve on the Senate \nHELP Committee and have seen first hand the efforts of Senator Kennedy \nand his counterpart on the minority side, Senator Enzi. I appreciate \ntheir effort, the hard work of their capable staffs, and the bipartisan \ncollegiality that allows us today to provide much needed support to the \ncollege students of America.\n  The success of our Nation's youth increasingly requires a college \ndiploma. But that diploma is becoming, for many, ever more difficult to \nattain. That difficulty arises not from lack of ambition or lack of \nability. Increasingly, the difficulty arises from lack of any realistic \nway for many American families to afford the college education needed \nfor the success of their daughters and sons.\n  The math here is simple. College costs have increased, but family \nincomes have not, nor has the Federal commitment to provide financial \naid. The cost of college continues to increase for many reasons. Over \nthe past 5 years, the cost of a 4-year public college in my State \nincreased 47 percent. At private colleges in Illinois, the increase was \n27 percent. Incomes have increased little, and so even with financial \naid, 35 percent of a family's income is needed each year to pay for \nattendance at a 4-year public university in my State.\n  Federal student aid has not kept pace with these increased costs. The \nproportion of college expenses met by Pell grants decreased from 47 \npercent to 29 percent over a recent 5-year period for students in my \nState. Students are increasingly forced to rely on loans, and college \ngraduates are increasingly burdened by debt. Graduates from a 4-year \ncollege in Illinois owe, on average, over $17,000 in student loan debt. \nThat is the average.\n  The resulting difficulty in financing a college education impacts not \nonly the dreams of millions of students but also the future of our \ncountry. Capable high school graduates from low- and moderate-income \nfamilies are much less likely to earn a college degree than their \nwealthier peers. Yet competition in the global economy requires that \nour students attain a college degree, whether to become engineers or \nentrepreneurs, in order to maintain the creative and competitive \nworkforce America needs. And for those students who do make it through \ncollege, their large debt loads make it difficult for them to choose \noccupations which might serve the public good but might not pay enough. \nStudent debt is too often limiting options for those very students who \nshould have the greatest opportunities and whose talents might provide \nthe greatest good to society.\n  We must change this. The bill we are considering here today is a step \nin that direction. With it, we expand loan forgiveness for graduates \nwho enter public service, we increase the threshold for income that may \nbe earned by students receiving financial aid, and we make other \nsignificant changes. But most importantly, we increase college access \nby increasing the amount of support for students through increased \ngrant aid.\n  My support of this legislation today echoes the first piece of \nlegislation I introduced in the Senate. That was the Higher Education \nOpportunity through Pell grant Expansion Act of 2005 the HOPE Act, \nwhich called for a significant increase in the maximum Pell Grant to \n$5,100, financed by decreased Federal subsidies to banks and lenders. \nThe bill we debate today would provide that increase to $5,100 by next \nyear and further increase the maximum to $5,400 by 2011. I applaud Mr. \nKennedy and my colleagues on the HELP Committee for keeping this the \nmain focus of the benefits provided in this package.\n  I realize that we are asking lenders to dig a little a deeper to help \nstudents, to come up with innovative ways to continue to provide \nservices students, even while receiving lower subsidies from the \nFederal Government. But I have faith that they can do this, to the \nbenefit of our students and our country.\n  I look forward to soon considering the remainder of the comprehensive \npackage to improve higher education contained in the Higher Education \nAmendments of 2007. But for today, I am proud today to support this \nbill to bring needed assistance to college students, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join in this effort.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I speak today in support of the Higher \nEducation Access Act of 2007, a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nwill increase student aid by billions of dollars by curbing Federal \nsubsidies to private banks and lenders. This is a significant victory \nfor students around the country and in my State of Wisconsin, which \nwill receive over $270 million dollars in new need-based grant aid by \nthe year 2013. Wisconsin has a world-class higher education system, and \nI am pleased to support this much-needed legislation that will help \nopen the doors to college for more students in my State.\n  I have long supported and led efforts in Congress to expand the \navailability of student aid and ensure that qualified students have \naccess to a postsecondary education, including raising the individual \nPell grant award. I was pleased to join with my colleagues in February \nto pass a significant increase in the maximum Pell grant award to \n$4,310 from $4,050, the first increase in 4 years. Earlier this year, I \nalso joined with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy,\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\nCollins, and Coleman, to lead letters to both the Budget and \nAppropriations Committees that advocated for the highest possible \nincrease in funding for Pell grants. The Pell grant program provides \nneed-based aid to low income students, and I am pleased that the Higher \nEducation Access Act retains the Pell grant's focus on need-based aid \nfor low-income students.\n  Access to a higher education is increasingly important in the \ncompetitive, global environment of the 21st century workforce as an \nincreasing number of jobs require education or training beyond high \nschool. But while the importance of attending college continues to \nincrease, the cost of attending college also continues to increase, \nwhich often causes financial strain on students and their families as \nthey seek to finance the cost of higher education.\n  My colleagues and I have long fought against the declining purchasing \npower of the Pell grant by supporting substantial increases in the \nmaximum grant award. According to data from the Department of \nEducation, the maximum Pell grant covered half the cost of tuition, \nfees, room and board at public 4-year colleges 20 years ago but only \ncovered a third of these same costs during the 2005 to 2006 period. The \ndeclining power of the Pell has impacted my State of Wisconsin as well. \nIn 1986 to 1987, the $2,100 maximum Pell grant covered 58 percent of \ncollege costs for Wisconsin students. In 2005-06, the $4,050 maximum \nPell grant only covered 38% of college costs in Wisconsin. This \nlegislation seeks to address the declining purchasing power of the Pell \ngrant by funding new Promise grants which will supplement the Pell \ngrant awards received by students throughout the country and target \nneed-based funds to Pell-eligible students.\n  In addition to the declining purchasing power of need-based aid like \nPell, the availability of such need-based grant aid does not come close \nto meeting the demand for it. As a result, an increasing number of \nstudents turn to Federal and private loans to finance their education. \nAccording to the College Board, in the late 1970s, over three-fourths \nof the Federal aid to students were grants, while 20 percent of Federal \nstudent aid were loans. Recent data from the College Board indicates \nthat the breakdown between grant aid and loans had switched by 2006, \nwith grant aid only making up 20 percent of the federal student aid.\n  Students in my State of Wisconsin, like students in other parts of \nthe country, are greatly affected by the Federal Government's increased \nreliance on student loans at the expense of grant aid. The Project on \nStudent Debt reports that more than 60 percent of Wisconsin graduates \nin 2005 graduated with debt and the average student who graduated from \na 4-year college in my State in 2005 owed over $17,000. While the \nprospect of these large debt burdens impact many students' decisions \nabout whether to attend college, low-income students may be even less \ninclined to attend college if they have to take out large amounts of \nstudent loans. These students are understandably nervous about the \nsignificant debt burden they would have to undertake, and some students \nchoose to forego college altogether for this very reason. This \nlegislation's focus on increasing need-based grant aid for these very \nstudents takes a big step in the right direction toward promoting \nbetter access to higher education for low-income students.\n  Higher levels of debt can also influence the decisions students make \nabout whether to take a job in the public interest sector or in the \nmore-lucrative private sector after graduation. We have all heard about \nstudents who are interested in working in public interest jobs fields \nlike teaching, law enforcement, legal aid, or State and local \ngovernment but who decide against taking these public interest jobs \nbecause of their high debt loads. It is unfortunate that so many \nstudents are forced to consider their debt loads when deciding which \njobs to take or pursue. The loan forgiveness and income-based repayment \nprovisions of this legislation will help those graduating students in \nWisconsin and around the country who want to pursue careers in public \nservice.\n  While I applaud much of the policy included in this measure, I am \ndisappointed that we are again seeing the reconciliation process used \nto advance legislation that is not primarily a deficit-reduction \npackage. While there are better arguments for using reconciliation to \nconsider this particular bill than there were for the reconciliation \nprotection proposed for the legislation to open up the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge to drilling, I am still troubled by the use of this \nextraordinary procedure as a way to advance a significant policy change \nthat is not primarily a deficit reduction package. Thanks to the \nefforts of our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Conrad, the days when \nthe reconciliation process could be totally subverted to protect \nlegislation that actually worsened the deficit are over. I also commend \nChairman Conrad for insisting during the conference discussions on the \nbudget resolution that this particular reconciliation instruction move \ncloser to a more reasonable qualifying threshold of deficit reduction \nthan was initially proposed. I hope that in future budget resolutions, \nwe can further tighten the use of reconciliation to ensure that it is \nused for what it was intended, namely to advance significant deficit \nreduction.\n  A student's access to higher education should not depend on his or \nher family's income but, rather, on the student's desire to obtain a \nhigher education. Passage of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 \nmoves our Nation in the right direction and represents a great victory \nfor students in my State of Wisconsin and around the country. I have \nlong led and supported efforts to expand Federal higher education \nprograms, including Pell and TRIO, and I am pleased to support passage \nof this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe coming months and years to continue to expand important need-based \ngrant programs so that hard-working students will be able to take \nadvantage of the full opportunities that access to a higher education \noffers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to express my support for the \nHigher Education Access Act of 2007. I applaud Chairman Kennedy and \nRanking Member Enzi for their work on crafting this bill that will \nwiden access to higher education by providing for increased funding \nassistance available to American students for their higher education \nstudies.\n  The need for these improvements by now should be as clear to the \nSenate as it is to America's families. In recent years average college \ntuition rates have been rising faster than inflation and outpacing \nstudent financial aid. Skyrocketing tuitions are pricing our families \nout of their ability to afford higher education. This trend not only \ncloses doors to opportunity in the lives of the Nation's young people; \nit also poses harsh consequences on our country and our communities, in \nways that are evident across our economy. I am pleased that, in this \nnew Congress, this bill has been brought forward to reverse the \ndirection of recent budgets that have continued to erode the Federal \nGovernment's support of higher education with deep cuts in the funding \nsupport for colleges and universities.\n  The Federal Government must rise to the challenge and improve our \nfinancial aid programs to ensure that college is an affordable option \nfor all qualified students. No student should be thwarted from \nenrolling and graduating from college because of financial concerns. \nThis bill accomplishes this goal through need-based grant aid to \nstudents by raising the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year, and up \nto $5,400 by 2011.\n  Because tuition has increased well beyond the rate of student \nassistance, students today are graduating with staggering debt burdens. \nWith the weight of this debt on their backs, recent college graduates \nunderstandably gravitate toward higher paying jobs that allow them to \npay back their loans. Unfortunately, all too often these jobs are not \nin the arena of public service or areas that serve the vital public \ninterests of our communities and of our country. We need to be doing \nmore to support graduates who want to enter public service, be it as a \nchild care provider, a doctor or nurse in the public health field, or a \npolice officer or other type of first responder.\n  I appreciate that the chairman has included strong provisions in this \nbill that will forgive the debt of borrowers who continue in public \nservice careers\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nsuch as nursing, teaching, or law enforcement for 10 years. Under this \nbill, a starting teacher in Vermont earning less than $30,000, and with \ndebt of $20,000, could have his or her loan payments capped at 15 \npercent, reducing monthly payments by almost 40 percent.\n  The increases for student aid in this bill are paid for by reducing \nthe subsidies the government provides to lenders. I believe that \nincreasing student assistance should be our highest priority in this \nbill and that this offset is a worthy and sensible exchange. However, \nwhile this bill reduces the subsidies for lenders, I am pleased that it \nrecognizes the importance of not-for-profit lenders, by differentiating \nbetween the size of cuts intended for for-profit and for nonprofit \nlenders. Several States have established not-for-profit State agencies \nto administer financial aid and to provide their residents and students \nattending their schools with quality counseling services and low-cost \nloans. Vermont pioneered this movement by creating the Vermont Student \nAssistance Corporation more than 40 years ago.\n  I do have concerns with the auction proposal contained within this \nbill. I am worried that it could potentially prevent Vermonters from \nexercising their right to choose where to borrow money by requiring the \nSecretary of Education to conduct an auction to select two lenders that \nwill be permitted to make parent loans. Bids will be sealed, invisible \nto the public and to Congress, and awards will be made solely on the \nSecretary's determination of who offers the lowest cost to the \ngovernment.\n  We do not want to crowd out the not-for-profit agencies from \nproviding PLUS loans to families in their State. I am hopeful that the \nchairman and ranking member will be willing to work on this portion of \nthe bill in order to continue to recognize the important role of not-\nfor-profit lenders.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nhigher education reconciliation bill that would increase critical grant \naid to our Nation's neediest college students, help make loan repayment \nmore manageable and encourage students to pursue careers in public \nservice.\n  It is crucial that we help make college more affordable and \naccessible for students at a time when they are struggling to pay \nskyrocketing college costs and taking on more debt to pay for school.\n  In California alone, the cost of attending a 4-year public college \nincreased 43 percent between the school years of 2000-2001 and 2005-\n2006.\n  Furthermore, 46 percent of California students graduating from 4-year \ncolleges in the 2004-2005 school year had student loan debt--at an \naverage of over $15,200. Nationwide, almost two-thirds of all 4-year \ncollege graduates had loan debt.\n  What is even more concerning is that many students are being shut out \nof college altogether.\n  Each year, more than 400,000 low and moderate income high school \ngraduates who are fully prepared to attend a 4-year college do not do \nso because of financial barriers.\n  It is imperative that all students seeking a college education have \nan opportunity to achieve their goals and this bill takes important \nsteps to provide much-needed relief to students across the country.\n  Specifically, this bill would: Provide $17.3 billion in new grant aid \nto low-income college students. Increase the maximum award for Pell \ngrant recipients to $5,100 in 2008 and to $5,400 in 2011. The current \namount is $4,310 and this means low-income California students will be \neligible for an additional $290.9 million in need-based grant aid next \nyear, and an additional $2.5 billion over the next 5 years. Increase \nthe family income level under which a student is automatically eligible \nfor the maximum Pell grant from $20,000 to $30,000.\n  Eliminate the ``tuition sensitivity'' provision in the Pell grant \nprogram's eligibility formula that unfairly penalizes our neediest \nstudents who attend low-cost institutions, such as community colleges, \nfrom receiving the maximum Pell grant award. In California, over \n260,000 community college students would benefit.\n  I was pleased to work with my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, as \nthe lead cosponsor of legislation to eliminate this unfair provision. \nCap Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's \ndiscretionary income providing needed relief to students with high loan \nburdens.\n  Provide new loan forgiveness under the Federal direct loan program \nfor individuals in public service careers for 10 years, such as \nteaching, nursing or law enforcement. It would include Head Start \nteachers and expands on a proposal that I have been working on for \nseveral years to provide loan forgiveness to educators in this \nimportant field.\n  Eliminates the 3-year limitation on the period for which certain \nmembers of the Armed Forces may receive deferments on the interest on \ntheir student loans. It also extends this deferment period to cover 180 \ndays after such a member of the Armed Forces is demobilized. Extends \nthe amount of time student borrowers can receive a deferment for \neconomic hardship from 3 to 6 years. Would apply to borrowers who take \nout their first loan after October 1, 2012.\n  This legislation would bring significant help to many low-income \nCalifornia students and those across the country who would otherwise \nnot be able to afford a college education.\n  A college degree is more important than ever to ensure success in \ntoday's global economy and we must help provide students that need it \nmost with the resources necessary to reach their highest potential.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I believe that we must provide \naccess to higher education, which still too many hard-working American \nstudents cannot afford without the help of Federal financial aid.\n  I support the Higher Education Access Act because it will increase \nthe access to education for many more students. In the 2005 to 2006 \nacademic year, the average cost of a U.S. public college or university \nwas $12,108, with the average Pell grant covering 33 percent of \ntuition, fees, and room and board. For a West Virginia public college \nor university in the 2005 to 2006 academic year, the average cost was \n$9,992, with the average Pell grant covering 41 percent of tuition, \nfees, and room and board. A senior in West Virginia graduating from \ncollege has an average of $16,041 in student loan debt.\n  This bill will help offset that cost. The first provision of the bill \nwill increase the aid available to those students who qualify for \nFederal assistance. By making changes to the current provisions of the \nPell grant program, more low-income students will have the opportunity \nto pursue higher education that otherwise might have been out of their \nreach.\n  Another vital and helpful component of this legislation is the \nrepayment cap and loan forgiveness program, which would help repay \nstudent loans of those individuals who have decided to enter the public \nsector. Those students who go on to become social workers, public \ndefenders, or teachers in high-need subject areas deserve our help \ngetting the education they need for these essential careers.\n  Too often, a college graduate who wants to pursue a career in social \nwork or another aspect of public service may not be able to afford to \nchoose that career because of the low salaries and their high student \nloan debts. The Higher Education Access Act will address this concern \nby placing a cap on Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a \nborrower's discretionary income, which will bring much needed relief to \ngraduates with excessive loan burdens.\n  For example, a social worker with one child in West Virginia earning \n$26,800, with average loan debt of $16,041 would have his or her \nmonthly payments reduced by $107, from $185 to $78, a reduction of 58 \npercent. We should encourage those willing to work in public service by \noffering relief from the high cost of student loans when they start off \non their careers through the 15-percent cap and loan forgiveness.\n  Over 4 years ago, I sponsored legislation with the former Senator \nMike DeWine to provide student loan forgiveness for social workers and \nattorneys in the child welfare system. This legislation reflects our \ngoals and expands it to cover a broader range of public service \ncareers--it is a strong, long-term investment in our communities and \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\n  The act is designed to keep rates for the lenders fair and direct as \nmuch help as possible to our students.\n  This year, 37,297 West Virginia students will receive $103.3 million \nin Pell grants. If this legislation debated today is enacted into law, \nWest Virginia students in the coming academic year will have access to \n$19 million more in Pell grants and student aid.\n  Pell grants have not increased during the past year while the cost of \neducation has increased exponentially. This bold increase in the Pell \ngrant program is needed to keep pace with the changing financial \ndemands of higher learning.\n  The Higher Education Access Act will provide hope and opportunity for \nstudents in West Virginia and across our country. It represents a \ncommitment to education and a wise investment in our future. This \nlegislation will also encourage public service, a cause to which I have \nlong been dedicated. I am proud to support this bill and hope it will \nbecome law this year to improve student aid for the high school seniors \nwho will begin their last year of classes in just a few weeks and all \nthe students who will follow them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as written, the higher education \nauthorization bill takes us down a dangerous fiscal road. Democrats are \nusing a privileged rule that was originally meant to cut the deficit to \nexpand the government instead with more than $19 billion in new \nmandatory spending.\n  Ironically, they're trying to paper over this by cutting existing \nprograms that help teachers and students in States like mine to reach a \nnet savings of less than $1 billion. Compare that to previous \nCongresses, which used reconciliation rules to save nearly $500 billion \nin 1990, $433 billion in 1993, $118 billion in 1997, and $39 billion in \n2005. The Democratic majority is using one of the few budget tools we \nhave for shrinking government and using it to grow government instead.\n  This is surprising to say the least--given that the Senate just \npassed a resolution by unanimous consent saying we wouldn't use these \nrules for new spending. Democrats conveniently dropped that provision \nin conference.\n  Both sides have used reconciliation to move tax policy in the past--\nRepublicans to cut taxes seven times; and Democrats to raise them four \ntimes. What's unprecedented here is using it for no other reason than \nto create new mandatory programs and expand the government--by tens of \nbillions of dollars. These budget shenanigans are standard operating \nprocedure for tax and spenders, but they set an extremely dangerous \nprecedent.\n  Now, I would like to say a word about the programs this bill would \ncut. Democrats justify the cuts to lender subsidies in the higher ed \nbill with the old Robin Hood line that the money they plan to take from \nprivate lenders will go to students instead. But this just isn't true \nin places like Kentucky, where the Federal loans of three out of every \nfour borrowers are held by not-for-profits.\n  These are groups that don't have profits--they funnel their earning \nback to borrowers. When you cut subsidies to them, you're cutting \nsubsidies to students, parents, nurses, and National Guard members \nthroughout my State. To Kentuckians, this bill is a reverse Robin Hood: \nit takes money from our students and funnels it back to Washington.\n  They know what's going on, and they don't like it, regardless of \ntheir political affiliation. I just got a letter from the State \nTreasurer, Jonathan Miller, who also happens to chair the Kentucky \nDemocratic Party. Here's what he wrote:\n  ``If the additional Federal Family Education Loan Program cuts are \nenacted, the entire borrower benefits program will be seriously \njeopardized, and the impact would be immediate and significant for \nthousands of Kentucky families who depend upon Kentucky's nonprofit \nhigher education agencies to help make higher education affordable.''\n  Teachers in Kentucky would also get hit: Last year, thousands of \nteachers in my state received $15 million in student loan forgiveness \nfrom non-profit lenders like the Higher Education Student Loan \nCorporation and the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority.\n  These benefits are targeted to teachers in high need subjects, like \nmath, science, and special education. The President of the Kentucky \nEducation Association, Frances Steenbergen, has informed me that if \nthese cuts enacted, over 14,000 Kentucky teachers will be impacted \nimmediately.\n  Republicans will have an opportunity to salvage this bill, but it \nwon't be easy. It violates the intent of reconciliation to expand \ngovernment, and slashes programs that are an enormous help to students \nand teachers. We'll also use the amendment process to repair some of \nthe damage from yesterday. I think everyone was startled when the \nDemocratic Leadership pulled the Defense Authorization bill from the \nfloor. As the senior Senator from Arizona said, ``He was more sad than \nangry.''\n  Here's a bill that would authorize pay raises for the men and women \nin the military, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, M-RAP, vehicles for \nIraq, and a lot of other urgent military support. Just this week, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee issued a statement decrying \ndelays in the delivery of these M-RAP vehicles--vehicles that have the \npotential of substantially reducing U.S. casualties in Iraq.\n  He sent a letter to the Defense Secretary in which he asked how it \nwas possible ``that with our nation at war, with more than 130,000 \nAmericans in danger, with roadside bombs destroying a growing number of \nlives and limbs, we were so slow to act'' in getting this technology to \nthe troops. He should be asking the Democratic leadership today how it \ncould have pulled the plug on a bill that authorizes the production of \nM-RAP vehicles.\n  He should ask them how they could have complained about the shameful \nneglect at Walter Reed--and then pulled a bill that addressed the most \ncritical failing in our treatment of wounded soldiers and marines \nreturning from battle He should ask them how they could pull a bill \nthat delays a pay raise for military personnel.\n  Republicans have an opportunity today to restore this vital support \nfor our military men and women, and we are going to seize it. It's \nunacceptable to wait: it's now late July and we haven't done a single \nappropriations bill--not one. The House has done six. At this rate, we \nwon't have sent a single appropriations bill to the President by the \ntime we leave here in August--an outrageous waste of time. These pranks \nand gimmicks guarantee we will have our backs to the wall in September.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as this debate comes to a close, I am \nreminded of the great moments in our Nation's history in which we look \nto the future and invested in future generations of Americans. We did \nit when we passed the GI bill. We did it when the Federal Government \ncreated the student loan program. We did it when we created Pell \ngrants. And we do it again today with the largest new investment in \nstudent aid since the GI bill.\n  A vote for this bill is one we can cast with pride and great hope--\npride in doing our part for the future of our great country and hope \nthat our actions tonight will mean a better future for millions of \nyoung Americans. By passing this bill tonight, we will recognize that \nprinciple once again.\n\n  We know that our students today face significant challenges in paying \nfor college. Each year, over 400,000 talented, qualified students do \nnot attend a 4-year college because they cannot afford it.\n  In 1993, fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance \ntheir education, but today, more than two-thirds of students borrow for \ncollege.\n  Today, the average student leaves college with more than $19,000 in \nstudent loan debt.\n  That is why this higher education legislation is so important. We \nwill provide more than $17 billion to help students and families pay \nfor college. This legislation will help reverse the crisis in college \naffordability in several ways: It will immediately and dramatically \nincrease the amount of aid for Pell grant recipients; it will help \nstudents manage their debt, by capping student loan payments at 15 \npercent of their monthly income; it will provide longer deferments in \nloan repayments for student borrowers facing economic hardship; and it \nwill completely forgive\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\nthe loans of those who enter society's most needed professions. It will \nrestore balance to our grossly unfair student loan system by reducing \nunnecessary subsidies for lenders.\n  Everything we know about the college affordability crisis tells us \nthat low-income students and families are struggling the most. With \nthis bill, we will increase the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next \nyear--a $790 increase--and to $5,400 in 2011.\n  I am very pleased that our legislation will expand loan forgiveness \nto borrowers who stay in public service professions for 10 years. Our \nsociety needs more teachers, more emergency management and law \nenforcement professionals, more public health doctors and nurses, more \nsocial workers, more librarians, more public interest lawyers, and more \nearly childhood teachers. Under our bill, we will produce more of them, \nbecause they--and all the groups I have just mentioned--will be \neligible for loan forgiveness.\n  The bill before us will deliver long-overdue relief to students and \nfamilies across the Nation who are struggling to afford college. But \nthere is more we can--and must--do to improve higher education for \nstudents and families.\n  Next week, we will take up other important changes in our higher \neducation amendments of 2007. In this bill, we take commonsense steps \nto improve higher education. We will address the rising cost of \ncollege, pursue needed sunshine ethics reforms to the student loan \nindustry, and steps to simplify the federal financial aid application \nform.\n  These are critical reforms--but the most critical steps are the ones \nwe take tonight to dramatically increase college aid for our Nation's \nstudents.\n  From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the engine of \nthe American dream. We can look to the landmark success of the GI bill \nto see what a difference higher education makes.\n  The GI bill produced 67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 \nteachers, and 450,000 engineers. It also funded the education of three \nPresidents, three Supreme Court Justices and about a dozen Senators who \nserved in this very Chamber.\n  This bill is a big step in the right direction. It dedicates over $17 \nbillion for students and families to benefit from a college education \nand keep our country strong in the years ahead. It will help keep the \ndoors to college open for all students, regardless of income level or \nbackground, just as the GI bill did half a century ago.\n  We can't let the engine of education stall today. More than ever \ncollege is the key to opportunity for students and the key to a strong \nAmerica for the future. I urge the Senate to approve this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the substitute \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2327) as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \npassage of H.R. 2669, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, and that the HELP Committee be appointed as conferees, with the \nabove occurring without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the \nmajority whip would indicate whether there will be no votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think I will defer to the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have in wrap-up the agreement that we \nare not going to do the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to \nhomeland security. We will proceed to that legislation as soon as we \ncomplete the additional education bill we are going to work on on \nMonday. We are working really hard to try to not have a lot of votes \nMonday night. The first vote will be 5:15. Under the order entered, \nthere could be as many as 12 or 15 votes. We hope that doesn't occur, \nbut it is possible. There will be multiple votes Monday. We may not be \nable to complete them all Monday. We hope we can, but that is where we \nare.\n  Tuesday, we will start the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  I tell all Members that we have now 2 weeks left in this work \nsession. As I have indicated from the first day, we are going to do our \nbest to have everybody out of here 2 weeks from tomorrow. We have a lot \nto do. We have to complete homeland security, work on SCHIP and \ncomplete that, we have two conference reports, one on which Senator \nLieberman today had a real conference. Democrats and Republicans \nappointed to the conference sat down to see what they could work out on \nthe 9/11 Commission recommendations. Progress was made. Senator \nLieberman said he thinks that can be done early next week.\n  And then I had a number of conversations today with the distinguished \nRepublican leader. We are where we are on the ethics lobbying reform. I \nwish we could approach it a different way. That is not going to work \nout, it appears. We are going to attempt to complete that also before \nwe finish this work period.\n  We have a lot to do, and I know there are things people want to do a \nweek from this weekend. We are going to try to see that they can do \nthat. There are no guarantees. We have to finish this legislation or we \nwill work into the August recess. Those are the choices we have. There \nwill be no votes tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Lott).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to mark the passing of an \nAmerican hero. Retired Four-Star GEN Wayne Downing, a native of Peoria, \nIL, passed away on Wednesday.\n  General Downing personified the ideal that was ingrained into him and \nall cadets at West Point: ``Duty, Honor, Country.''\n  He spent most of his adult life wearing his country's uniform and \ncontinued to answer the call to serve even after retirement.\n  When General Downing retired after 34 years of military service in \n1996, he was one of the country's leaders on terrorism.\n  After three decades as an Army Ranger, he had spent more time \ndeveloping and implementing anti-terrorist and insurgent tactics than \njust about any man alive.\n  His devotion to service came early in his life.\n  Growing up in Peoria, his mother would read to him news reports from \nthe battlefields of Europe where his father, PFC Francis Downing, was \npart of the 9th Armored Division, leading the American charge into Nazi \nGermany.\n  Private First Class Downing was killed in March 1945 in one of the \nfinal engagements of World War II.\n  As he grew up fatherless, Wayne would spend hours listening to the \ntales of his neighbor, a wounded combat veteran of the 101st Airborne \ndivision. It was while listening to those stories that he decided what \nhe was going to do with his life.\n  He began his career in the Army as a junior officer in Vietnam, where \nhe served two tours of duty and earned two Silver Stars, the Soldiers \nMedal, the Bronze Star with Valor and five oak leaf clusters, and the \nPurple Heart.\n  In 1974, he was hand-picked by his commander to help reform the famed \nArmy Rangers.\n  During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, he commanded 1,200 U.S. \nSpecial Forces.\n  By the time he retired in 1996, General Downing was head of the U.S. \nSpecial Operations Command, in charge of the special operations forces \nof all the services, including the Navy's SEALs and the Army's Green \nBerets.\n  But retirement did not end General Downing's service to America. Two \nPresidents called him out of retirement to help them confront \nterrorism.\n  President Clinton tapped him to lead the investigation into the 1996 \ntruck bomb attack that killed 19 U.S. servicemen and one Saudi and \nwounded 372 others at Khobar Towers, a U.S. military housing complex in \nSaudi Arabia.\n  After September 11, President Bush called General Downing out of \nretirement again to serve as his top counter-terrorism advisor a post \nGeneral Downing held for nine months.\n  There was not a man alive more qualified for the job.\n  Wayne Downing understood earlier than most the nature of the threat \nwe face from terrorism, and he did his best to help craft a wise and \neffective response to that threat.\n  It is one of the mysteries of this life that a man who has faced such \nformidable foes would die from a microscopic enemy: bacterial \nmeningitis. Family members say he died within 24 hours of contracting \nthe illness. He was 67 years old.\n  I last saw General Downing on Memorial Day. He was the keynote \nspeaker in Peoria at the dedication of a memorial to servicemembers who \nhad died in World War I and World War II. I had the privilege of \nspeaking at that same gathering.\n  When organizers of the dedication approached him about speaking, they \nwere apologetic that they could offer him only a small stipend. Before \nthey could finish their apology, General Downing interrupted and said \nit would be his honor to speak.\n  One of the names carved into the memorial belonged to his father.\n  As he rose to speak that day, it was raining. Someone tried to offer \nGeneral Downing an umbrella, but he politely waved it away. He said to \nthe crowd:\n\n       Many of you were infantry, and so was I. We didn't have \n     umbrellas in the infantry.\n\n  He was a soldier's soldier to the end and a true patriot.\n  He will be missed. On behalf of the United States Senate, I would \nlike to extend my deepest condolences to General Downing's family, his \ncolleagues and friends. Our nation joins you in your grief. I am \nhonored to have known this great patriot, GEN Wayne Downing of Peoria, \nIL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9598-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9598-S9599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DORIS G.

In reality, her life has been molded by \n     politics.\n       ``I can't remember when politics was not discussed in my \n     home,'' said Petercheff. ``Quite frankly, it still is,'' she \n     added.\n       ``Petercheff, owner of One Acorn and Associates, a \n     political consulting firm, is slowed by health problems, but \n     her telephone still rings with questions about how to manage \n     a political campaign.\n       ``I interpret politics as people,'' said Petercheff. \n     ``That's one of the things we've forgotten--people. I love \n     people. God gave me a talent in politics . . . to help \n     people. I never had a doubt that the Lord provided me a way \n     to work for Congressman (Tim Lee) Carter so I could help \n     people.'' She was 5th District office manager for Carter for \n     18 years.\n       ``Petercheff was reared in a political atmosphere. Her \n     grandfather, Jacob N. Mayfield, owned and operated a country \n     story in the Acorn community.\n       ``Grandpa was a great patriot. He always displayed a large \n     American flag at the store,'' Petercheff recalls.\n       ``I thought that flag was so beautiful,'' she said. ``I \n     went up to Grandpa and said, `Grandpa, what is that (flag)?' \n     And he pulled me on his lap and told me what the flag was and \n     how important it was.\n       ``That was my first love of politics and my country,'' she \n     remembers. ``I was probably 3 or 4 years old at the time.''\n       Mayfield was a magistrate for many years. Petercheff \n     pointed out that those were the days before state courts were \n     reorganized and magistrates performed many official duties \n     such as marriages, signing birth certificates and other legal \n     functions.\n       ``Everybody came to the store. We were (the same as) \n     Somerset at that time. We sold\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\n     everything you couldn't grow,'' Petercheff remembers. She \n     said Ky. 1675, extending from Ky. 80 to Mt. Victory, was in \n     those days the main route from Crab Orchard to Sublimity \n     Springs, at that time a well-known health resort near Mt. \n     Victory.\n       ``Stagecoaches passed by here (on the way to Sublimity \n     Springs),'' she recalled.\n       ``We went to Somerset on `Burden Road,' '' laughed \n     Petercheff. ``It was really (through) Burdine Valley, but we \n     called it `Burden Valley.' ''\n       Petercheff is from a strong Republican family. Both her \n     Grandpa Mayfield and Grandpa John Cottongim, a deputy sheriff \n     from 1911 to 1916, were dyed-in-the-wool Republicans.\n       As a professional consultant, Petercheff would cross the \n     political divide.\n       ``One of my proudest times was working with (Democrat) \n     Wallace Wilkinson in 1987,'' Petercheff said. She was \n     organizational coordinator during Wilkinson's successful \n     campaign for governor, working with the now nationally famous \n     James Carville.\n       ``Democrats are a different breed,'' she remarked. ``They \n     are more open . . . a physically touchy, feelie kind . . . \n     they don't flout their affluence.\n       ``I am a conservative . . . a fiscal conservative, not a \n     social conservative,'' Petercheff said. ``I loved matching my \n     brains against those big consultants. It's amazing how those \n     big national consultants (are often off base).''\n       ``The key to success in politics, Petercheff said, is to \n     ``get organized, make a plan and then work your plan that's \n     how you win.''\n       ``On the other hand, Petercheff believes politics must be \n     enjoyed.\n       ``I've told clients, `Politics is fun. If it's not fun, we \n     won't do it.' ''\n       But an office seeker must be dedicated to the cause. \n     ``Campaigns are hard work,'' she assures.\n       If Petercheff has a political hero, it's the late \n     Congressman Carter.\n       ``Tim Lee . . . he was a country doctor. His first interest \n     and first desire was to help individual people. If Tim Lee \n     ran across a need for which he couldn't find an answer, he \n     would dig down in his pocket and come up with the money. And \n     you didn't have to vote for him to get help.\n       ``Tim Lee was the ultimate politician,'' she said. ``He \n     knew how to (handle) things politically to get people to do \n     what they should do.''\n       ``Petercheff recalls that she started working for Carter in \n     1964 ``. . . when women were not involved in politics . . . \n     maybe they stuffed envelopes.''\n       ``But Petercheff never took a back seat. Few people have a \n     more impressive profile of services.\n       ``Among her positions as a volunteer, Petercheff served as \n     chair of the Mayfield precinct for 30 years; secretary of the \n     Pulaski County Young Republicans Club for four years; \n     treasurer in 1970 for the State Young Republican Federation; \n     chair in 1971 of 5th District Young Republicans; and \n     secretary from 1972 to 1976 for the Pulaski County Republican \n     Executive Committee.\n       ``Also, in 1969 she served as president of the Pulaski \n     County Republican Women's Club; from 1976 to 1978 she was \n     chair of the 5th District Republican Party; from 1972 to 1978 \n     she was a member, state-at-large, Republican State Central \n     Committee; in 1966 she was campaign chair for the U.S. \n     Senator John Sherman Cooper and Tim Lee Carter; and served as \n     campaign chair for now-Congressman Hal Rogers for state Young \n     Republican chairman.\n       Also, she was campaign coordinator for Rogers in his quest \n     for Pulaski County attorney; Pulaski County campaign and \n     headquarters secretary during Louie Nunn's successful \n     campaign for governor; 5th District coordinator for Tom \n     Emberton for governor; and state organizational coordinator \n     for Huda Jones's campaign for secretary of state.\n       ``Also, state campaign primary coordinator for Gerald Ford \n     for president of the United States; state campaign manager \n     for Hal Rogers for lieutenant governor; 5th District campaign \n     coordinator for Ronald Reagan, (Senior) George Bush, Mitch \n     McConnell and Rogers; 5th District coordinator for Jim \n     Bunning for governor; and 5th District campaign manager for \n     Hal Rogers for Congress in 1980, 1982 and 1984.\n       ``Petercheff has served in some position in every state, \n     district and local election since 1962. She started One Acorn \n     and Associates in 1984 with several stockholders. In April \n     1986, she became the sole owner and operator of One Acorn. \n     Her list of clients is like a ``who's who'' in local, state \n     and national politics.\n       ``Like many Pulaski Countians, to make a living, \n     Petercheff's family--her father, Thomas O. Cottongim, and her \n     mother, Mary Iva Mayfield Cottongim--left their home in Acorn \n     in 1941 and moved to Indianapolis. She went to high school in \n     the Indiana city and married her high school sweetheart, \n     Jimmy Petercheff, now deceased.\n       ``She and Jimmy returned to Pulaski County in 1959 and took \n     over operation of the family's general store, originally \n     known as J.N. Mayfield Mercantile and later Acorn Mercantile.\n       ``They closed the store in 1967. ``I had gone to work for \n     Dr. Carter and we had to hire somebody to run the store,'' \n     Petercheff said.\n       ``Doris and Jimmy have four sons, 11 grandchildren and six \n     great-grandchildren.

Madam President, today I rise to recognize three \nArkansans who served our country with dignity and honor and gave their \nlives to our country in Iraq: MAJ Michael Taylor, 1SG Tom Warren, and \nArmy SFC John Gary Brown. They will be remembered by their friends and \nfamily as men who lived lives full of passion and love. Their Nation \nwill remember them as men who dedicated themselves to protection of our \nfreedom.\n  Michael Taylor's father-in-law described him as ``a good guy'' with a \npersonality that attracted everyone to him since his childhood days in \nNorth Little Rock. As a National Guardsman, who worked at the Veterans' \nAdministration, he soon learned that his true passion was in flying. He \nhad spent a lot of time working with computers, and the relationship \nbetween modern helicopters and computers gave him a leg up when it came \ntime to enter flight school. He retired from the VA to become a pilot \nwith the Arkansas National Guard flying Black Hawk helicopters. Taylor \neventually reached the Bravo Company's top position and commanded the \ncompany.\n  The second member of the flight team was First Sergeant Tom Warren. \n1st Sgt. Warren grew up in Jacksonville, AR, near Camp Robinson. He \nattended North Little Rock High School in 1976 and married his wife \nDoris on January 17, 1983. He raised five children and throughout his \nlife was very active in church. He was a Mason, including being past \nmaster at his lodge in Levy, which was the same position his father had \nheld. He also served as deacon at Lifehouse Christian Fellowship, where \nhe was an active member. Outside of church, Warren loved to golf, but \nnothing besides his family could match his love for aviation. Warren \nreached the position of first sergeant, making him the top ranked \nenlisted soldier in the company.\n  Gary Brown hailed from the small town of Nashville, AR. He was born \nand raised there and attended Nashville High School, where he was on \nthe track team. He graduated in 1982 and spent a year at Ouachita \nBaptist University. During his time in Little Rock, he was a member of \nAgape Church and was active in the church's children's bus ministry and \nmen's Bible study. His twin brother said that everything Brown did in \nhis life meant something to him, whether it was easy or hard, and he \ncould always be found with a smile on his face.\n  To him, serving his country meant something, and he served for 20 \nyears in the National Guard. Most recently Brown was the crew chief of \nthe Arkansas National Guard's 77th Aviation Brigade. He pursued \nperfection and was truly dedicated to his job.\n  The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that First Sergeant Warren flew was \nwhat he called a limousine service. They ferried others around Iraq as \npart of ``Task Force Dragon,'' but they became known as the ``Catfish \nAir.'' Serving their fellow soldiers, these men risked their lives \nevery day to make sure people got to and from dangerous areas as safely \nas possible.\n  Tragically these three men's lives intertwined on January 20, 2007, \nwhen their helicopter crashed in the area northeast of Baghdad in one \nof the deadliest moments of the war for our National Guard. I offer my \ncondolences to their families, and I pray that they can find comfort in \nthe knowledge that these three men died serving others and doing what \nthey loved on behalf of a grateful Nation. My thoughts and prayers go \nout to the many people whose lives were touched by these men.\n\n\n                        Specialist Jeremy Stacey\n\n                   Private First Class Bruce Salazar\n\n  Madam President, it is with great sadness that I also rise to honor \ntwo young men with Arkansas ties who died on back-to-back days during \nthe July 4 recess. Specialist Jeremy L. Stacey was killed on July 5 by \na roadside bomb in Baghdad, and Army PFC\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\nBruce Salazar Jr., was killed on July 6 by an improvised explosive \ndevice, IED, in Muhammad Sath, Iraq.\n  Specialist Stacey spent a large portion of his life growing up in \nAmarillo, TX, and later moved with his mother, Betty Click, to \nBismarck, AR, where he graduated from Bismarck High School in 2003. \nShortly after graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army.\n  Specialist Stacey was remembered by those in Bismarck as a great guy \nthat everyone loved. He had been called a prankster with a quick wit by \nthose who knew him well, and his death has been devastating for his \nfamily and the Bismarck community. Specialist Stacey was the first \nfatality of the Bismarck graduates serving in Iraq.\n  Specialist Stacey was an M1 armor crewman with the 1st Cavalry \nDivision stationed in Fort Bliss, TX, and had received the National \nDefense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Good \nConduct Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon. He was posthumously \nappointed to the rank of corporal and awarded the Bronze Star and \nPurple Heart.\n  After his graduation in Arkansas, Stacey's mother moved to Los \nChavez, NM, and although he reenlisted in December for another 3-year \nterm, he talked of moving to New Mexico to be near his mother once his \nservice was complete. A talented writer who wrote fiction, Stacey also \ndreamed of going to college one day. He is survived by his mother and \nfour sisters: Jessica Stacey, Shaila Stacey, Lisa Close, and Erica \nClose.\n  Just one day after Specialist Stacey was killed, Arkansas lost \nanother one of its sons when Army PFC Bruce Salazar was killed. Salazar \nmoved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, in 2003 when he followed his best \nfriend Ronnie Jacques from Davis, CA, to Northwest Arkansas. Salazar's \nfather, Bruce Salazar Sr., lives in Springdale, and the younger Salazar \nworked in Springdale while completing his general equivalency degree.\n  The 24-year-old joined the Army and planned on being a career \nsolider, according to his mother and his friend. After the war, Salazar \nplanned on helping his mother, Suzie Ruiz of Modesto, CA, buy a house, \nand he looked forward to moving to Florida. His mother remembered him \nas a good kid who was always there when she needed him. He was an avid \nbaseball fan and wanted to be a fighter pilot. A few weeks before his \ndeath, Salazar spoke to his mom about family and friends and asked for \na baseball glove to play catch. Ms. Ruiz mailed the glove and a book on \nbecoming a pilot.\n  Private First Class Salazar was an infantryman with the 1st \nBattalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd \nInfantry Division based in Fort Stewart, GA. He is survived by his \nmother Suzy father Bruce sister Alicia Salazar and four half-sisters in \nSouthern California.\n  The deaths of these two young men, like the thousands who have \nalready given their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, touch many families and many communities across our State \nand throughout this great land. Our Nation is grateful for their \nservice, and in the days and weeks ahead, our thoughts and prayers are \nwith their families and loved ones during this difficult time.\n\n\n                       Corporal Zachary D. Baker\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to remember a young Arkansan who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice by giving his life for our freedom in Iraq \nearlier this year, CPL Zachary Baker. Coporal Baker was 24 years old \nand is survived by his wife Christina and seven-year-old son Andrew, as \nwell as his mother, father, brother, sister, and other relatives.\n  Known affectionately to his family as ``Bubba,'' Baker was serving \nhis second tour of duty in Iraq. He was originally sent to Iraq in 2005 \nand volunteered to go back after completing that tour. His family \ndescribed him as a good Christian man who thought about others before \nhimself.\n  He was killed with five other members of the First Cavalry Division \nbased out of Fort Hood, TX, when a roadside bomb exploded near the \nBradley fighting vehicle they were in. His team was responding to a \nhelicopter that Iraqi insurgents shot down north of Baghdad after two \ncrew members radioed for help. Both crew members died in the crash.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. My thoughts and prayers, \nas well as those of so many Arkansans, are with you during this \ndifficult time.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Justin Estes\n\n  Madam President, Arkansas lost a fine young American this past year \nwhen SSG Justin Estes of Sims was killed while trying to assist a \nwounded soldier near Samarra, Iraq. According to reports, Sergeant \nEstes was in the third vehicle of a convoy when another vehicle was \nstruck by an improvised explosive device, IED. Without regard for \nhimself, Sergeant Estes left his vehicle and rushed to pull an injured \ncomrade out of the burning vehicle. He began administering first aid to \nthe wounded soldier when another IED detonated. He died in the arms of \na second soldier from the explosion.\n  Sergeant Estes was remembered as a fine soldier, ``The Best of the \nBest,'' who put others before himself. He was serving his second tour \nfor the 82nd Airborne and was set to return to the United States after \nhis first tour. However, he gave his slot to a fellow soldier so that \nhe could see his newborn son. Family and friends also recalled his fun-\nloving spirit.\n  Sergeant Estes was awarded three medals: the Bronze Star, the Purple \nHeart, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He is survived by his parents, \nDon and Kathy Estes of Kentucky and John and Diane Salyers of Sims. He \nalso has two older sisters, Norma and Kelli, in addition to other \nfamily. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Estes family during this \ntrying time.\n\n\n                       Specialist Erich Smallwood\n\n  Madam President, it is with great sadness that I also rise today to \npay tribute to a Arkansan who served his country with honor, SPC Erich \nS. Smallwood of Trumann, AR. Specialist Smallwood died on May 26, 2007, \nfrom injuries suffered when an improvised explosive device detonated \nnear his vehicle outside of Balad, Iraq. Erich was a member of Company \nB of the 87th Troop Command's 875th Engineer Battalion based in Marked \nTree, AR, and served with the battalion's Company A based in Jonesboro, \nAR. He was the first loss for the 875th during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  A 2002 graduate of Trumann High School, Smallwood was a beloved \nmember of his community. He was selected ``Mr. Trumann High School'' by \nhis classmates and was a good athlete who played football, baseball, \nand ran track for THS. He was also selected ``Most Involved'' his \nsenior year in high school and was a member of Future Farmers of \nAmerica and the Spanish Club.\n  In the days following his death, friends and loved one remembered \nSmallwood for the person he was and the examples he set. In an \ninterview in the Trumann Democrat, his high school principal, Jim \nMontgomery, recalled that Specialist Smallwood had a great sense of \nhumor. ``He liked to kid around, but he never got into any trouble. . . \nHe was always doing something to make people laugh . . . He was a good \nstudent and a good person.''\n  At his funeral on June 4, his brother-in-law, Jon Redman of \nJonesboro, noted that he was an inspiration to others. ``He was a \nspecial kind of person. He always had that smile on his face. . . He \nwas the greatest brother anyone could have. He was a friend to many \npeople and never met a stranger. He was the heart and soul of his \nunit.''\n  Arkansas National Guard Adjutant GEN William B. Wofford remembered \nhim as ``a soldier both inside and outside the wire. He wanted to be an \nencouragement to someone. He was a true patriot, was intelligent, and \nloved his fellow soldiers.''\n  At a Memorial Day service in Trumann, just 2 days after his passing, \nMayor Sheila Walters read a proclamation recognizing the sacrifice of \nSpecialist Smallwood. It read: ``We honor all soldiers and their \ncommitments to this great country by their legacy of patriotism and \nsacrifice. We honor our very own Erich Smallwood for giving his life in \nthe cause of freedom. He is one of the many heroes who have protected \nand inspired us all.''\n  Madam President, Specialist Smallwood was a unique person who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice in serving his country and protecting our \nfreedoms. My thoughts and prayers are with his fiancee, Amanda; father, \nJames; mother, Pamela; sister, Terah;\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\nbrother J.T., who is also currently serving in Iraq; and the rest of \nthe Smallwood family during this trying time.\n\n\n                         sergeant robb rolfing\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I mourn the loss and celebrate the life \nof Rob Rolfing. Robb died on June 30 while engaging enemy insurgents in \nBaghdad. He was the 23rd South Dakotan to make the ultimate sacrifice \nin the war on terror. My deepest sympathies go out to Robb's family, in \nparticular, his mother Margie, his father Rex, his brother TJ, and his \nsister Tiffany. With Robb's tragic death, South Dakota has lost one of \nits finest sons and the Army has lost a dedicated professional.\n  Robb was from Sioux Falls and graduated from O'Gorman High School in \n1996. His love of science and ingenuity was inspired by television's \nMacGyver. Those who remember Robb from high school like to recount how \nRobb was never without duct tape or a Swiss Army knife. Another of \ntheir favorite stories is how Robb rigged up a makeshift parachute for \nhis graduation cap so that when he threw it in the air it glided back \ndown to the ground.\n  As Robb grew it was clear that he was a gifted scholar, athlete, \nleader, and coach. He dedicated himself to the pursuit of excellence in \nevery aspect of his life. He was a passionate soccer player who \nexcelled on and off the field at Vassar College. He finished his \ncollegiate career with a degree in Astrophysics and was twice named the \ncaptain of the Vassar soccer team, scored the winning goal to advance \nhis team to Vassar's first ever national tournament, and was the team's \nsecond all-time leader in goals, assists, and points. Following \ngraduation from college, Robb coached soccer at Rollins College in \nFlorida and Curry College in Massachusetts.\n  When the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, Robb \npursued another of his dreams. He joined the U.S. Army and became a \nmember of the Green Berets, the Army's elite experts in unconventional \nwarfare. Based on Robb's dedication to excellence and his mechanical \ningenuity it came as no surprise that Robb served as the special forces \nengineer for his unit, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special \nForces Group, airborne. Special forces engineers are skilled at \nconstruction projects, building field fortifications, and using \nexplosive demolitions. Looking back over Robb's life, it seems that his \nwhole experience was designed to culminate in gaining the coveted Army \nGreen Beret that is recognized the world over.\n  Green Berets are commonly called quiet professionals and referred to \nas a special breed of man. Robb was both these things and truly lived \nthe Green Beret motto, De Oppresso Liber, To Liberate the Oppressed.\n  Mr. President, I truly mourn the loss of SGT Robb Rolfing and I \nextend my thoughts, prayers, and best wishes to his family, friends, \nand loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9601-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9601-S9606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  MRAP\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I want to explain an amendment I hope to \nget adopted when we return to the Defense authorization bill and that I \nhave filed today.\n  Let me be very frank. This is a very expensive amendment. It is also, \nliterally, priceless. It makes good on this commitment: So long as a \nsingle American soldier or marine remains in Iraq, we will provide him \nor her with the best protection this country can provide.\n  Let me start with the basics. There are two critical issues facing \nour soldiers and marines today: improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, \nand explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. IEDs are planted in roads \nand on the side of roads to hit the bottom of vehicles with powerful \nexplosives. EFPs are shaped charges that come into the side armor of \nvehicles at high speeds.\n  We know that IEDs now cause about 70 percent of all American \nfatalities. Since 2003, in any given month, IEDs have caused between 30 \nand 76 percent of American fatalities. For every death, there are \nusually 2 to 10 Americans wounded. Over the past year, we have also \nseen a growing threat from EFPs. They are not yet everywhere in Iraq, \nbut they are spreading and they are very lethal.\n  The military has a strategy for dealing with both. First, they seek \nto disrupt the organizations that produce IEDs and EFPs. They go after \nthe people and the supplies. Second, they attempt to use tactics and \ntechnology to prevent IEDs and EFPs from being activated when American \npersonnel are close enough to be harmed. Third, they attempt to survive \na direct hit. It is the third area where we could and should have done \nmuch more to make a difference years ago but where still today we can \nand must make a difference.\n  The military has tested, both at testing centers and in the field, \nthe Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, also called an MRAP. The \nMRAP provides dramatically improved protection against IEDs. The \nmilitary has said that it is four to five times as good as an up-\narmored HMMWV. More important, military commanders tell us that it will \nreduce deaths and casualties from IEDs by 67 to 80 percent. The \nBrookings Institution found that 1,400 Americans died in Iraq due to \nIEDs from March of 2003 through June of 2007. If we had had MRAPs in \nthe field from the start--and we could and should have--938 to 1,120 \nAmericans would be alive today.\n  And let me just clarify for my colleagues that this is not new \ntechnology. It has been used successfully in Africa, by nations much \npoorer than ours, since the 1970s. I don't want to get bogged down in \nhistory, but this is not rocket science. Every day we delay, another \nsoldier or marine is killed or injured by an IED. If we just look at \nthis year, IEDs killed 309 Americans; 207 to 247 would still be alive \ntoday if they had been in MRAPs. We need to make sure that for the \nsecond half of 2007, those MRAPs are there and those lives are saved.\n  What about the threat from these shaped charges that come in from the \nside, the EFP? The Army's Rapid Equipping Force and the Joint \nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Organization started working on that \nlast year. In conjunction with industry, they produced a vehicle \nnicknamed ``the Bull'' and officially called the Highly Survivable \nUrban Vehicle Ballistic Protection Experiment Program. This vehicle was \ntested and shown to defeat EFPs and also tested against the first level \nof MRAP requirements. That testing was completed in March of this year. \nFor some reason, the military has not asked for another vehicle to do \nthe MRAP level two tests. So we do not actually know how capable this \nvehicle might be for all threats, but we know it works against EFPs. \nInstead of trying to get ahead of the enemy and get this technology \ninto the field, the military seems to be sitting on its hands while the \nEFP threat has increased. Why wouldn't you field something you know \nworks?\n  The perfect vehicle would be a complete MRAP with EFP protection, but \nthat appears to be many months away, although some MRAP producers tell \nme that their vehicles have survived EFP hits in the field. So again, \nwe do not have the complete picture. We have also been told that Frag-\nKit-6 armor can defeat EFPs, but it is too heavy for MRAPs. So vehicles \nmust be redesigned and retested. This will take time. I understand that \nand support that effort, but Americans are dying today. Again, as with \nthe MRAP, we have a technology that could keep them alive, and we \nshould be using it while we work to perfect it.\n  I do not know if all of my colleagues saw the USA Today article that \nappeared on Monday detailing some of the history surrounding the MRAP. \nI will summarize a few points but will ask to have the entire article \nprinted in the Record.\n  This article details efforts to get MRAPs going back to 2003. It also \ndetails the reasons for delay, and that is what I want to point out to \nmy colleagues.\n  First, apparently, the leadership at the Pentagon did not expect this \nwar to last this long. Well, that is no surprise. We all remember the \n``Mission Accomplished'' speech and the promise of roses in the \nstreets. We remember Vice President Cheney telling us that the \ninsurgency was in its death throes. We remember Secretary Rumsfeld \ntelling us that crime in Baghdad was not any worse than that in \nWashington, DC. I remember all of that. Sadly, none of those leaders \nremember the hearings that Senator Lugar and I held before the war \nbegan that predicted the need for a long-term American presence and \nengagement. They don't remember\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\nsome of us, starting before the war, repeatedly urged the President to \nlevel with the American people about the likely duration, cost, and \ndanger of this war. Perhaps even more tragically, this uncertainty \nabout future force levels continues to limit the military commitment to \nfielding more MRAPs and EFP protected vehicles.\n  Second, these vehicles were seen as contrary to Secretary Rumsfeld's \nvision for the transformed military, a lighter, more agile force. While \nit depends on what armored humvee you are talking about, many believed \nthat MRAPs were heavier and slower than humvees. The stifling effect \nSecretary Rumsfeld's views and management style had on military leaders \nis well known to everyone who follows military issues. In this \ninstance, it meant that officers were predisposed against the heavier \nvehicle and didn't push the issue when our forces in the field asked \nfor MRAP technology. Instead, they focused on the first two parts of \nthe anti-IED strategy I talked about earlier.\n  Finally, and most disturbing to me, many believed that Congress would \nnot support funding the MRAP while also fielding better armored \nhumvees. I do not know of a single wartime funding request that \nCongress has denied. There have been some items added to the \nsupplemental bills that were clearly not urgent or war related, but \nnothing directly linked to current operations was refused. Nonetheless, \nit appears that the military did not believe that our support for \nneeded equipment was for real. Even today, I hear that leaders are \nconcerned that they must cut multiple existing programs to pay for this \ngrowing MRAP requirement. There may be programs that we could all agree \nare not as vital for a wartime Army, but I do not want that debate and \nconcern to slow lifesaving equipment.\n  I understand that this program will be the third largest procurement \nprogram in the Pentagon. As I said, it is very costly. We can work \ntogether in the future to find the lower priority programs that simply \nshould not be funded if they are competing with lifesaving programs. We \ndo not have any more time to delay spending the money needed to buy \nthese vehicles, however, if we are going to save lives.\n  Leadership is about making hard choices, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and the administration to do whatever it \ntakes. I am even willing to cut programs I support because saving lives \nand limbs under fire today must truly be our first priority. So, today, \nwith this amendment I hope we can make it clear that we will provide \nwhatever funding is needed, so that military leaders do not fear being \nhonest about their needs.\n  In addition to the issues brought out in the article, I have also \nheard a regular concern that some in the military do not believe MRAPs \nwill be needed in the future--that when we leave Iraq, we will leave \nmost of these vehicles behind. I was happy to see the Secretary of the \nArmy, Peter Geren, state clearly in his confirmation hearing that he \nbelieves MRAPs will be needed in future conflicts. It is clear to me \nthat until we show America's enemies that we can handle IEDs, they will \ncontinue to use them throughout the world. We are already seeing an \nincreased use of IEDs in Afghanistan.\n  It is also clear to me that those who worry about what the military \nwill be driving in 5 years are missing the boat here. I understand that \nthere are great advancements being developed for our future force. But \nwe have a sacred trust to those on the front lines today, right now. \nRight now, we are saying to them: If you survive this war, we will get \nyou really good protection for the next one. Give me a break. To \nparaphrase a former Secretary of Defense, you fight the war you are in, \nnot the war you might be in down the road. Ideally, you do both, but \nyour priority has to be protecting the men and women under fire now. \nEnd of story. Can anyone imagine Roosevelt saying, ``Listen, we may not \nneed some of those boats after Normandy, so maybe we should not build \nso many?'' Of course not. War is inherently wasteful and this war is no \nexception. I am willing to waste money and equipment if it means we \ndon't waste lives and limbs. The fact that we may not need all of the \nvehicles we buy today in 5 years, is no reason to shortchange the \nsoldiers and marines who truly need the vehicles today.\n  I have given my colleagues some of this history so they will \nunderstand why we must stand up for our marines and soldiers on this \nissue. We must cut through the ``business as usual'' bureaucracy. I \napplaud Secretary Gates for making MRAPs the top priority of the \nmilitary, but I am concerned that even now, some of the same problems \ncontinue. After all, Army commanders in Iraq concluded that they need \n17,700 MRAPs. That is 15,200 more than currently being bought. We must \nact now to put money in the pipeline to order the additional vehicles \nand expand production capacity.\n  Instead, we find out that 2 months later, the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council has yet to approve the Army request as a ``validated \njoint requirement.'' I don't get it.\n  The President tells us that the most important thing in this war is \nthe judgment of our commanders in the field. Now, I may disagree with \nthe policy being executed, but I would agree that when it comes to \ntactical decisions about the best way to implement our policies, this \nis the right approach. Apparently, others feel that the commanders \nshould only be listened to selectively, when it does not cost too much \nmoney.\n  The commanders in the field have said that they need an additional \n15,200 mine resistant vehicles for the Army. They have also said that \nthey need thousands of vehicles with EFP protection. So, why the delay?\n  No one from the Pentagon has been able to explain it to me.\n  Last, some argue that the real problem is production capacity. I \nsimply don't buy it. We are being told that American industry cannot \nhandle this or does not care enough about our soldiers and marines to \ndo it. I don't buy it. These are purely military vehicles. If the \nmilitary does not place the orders, industry will not build them, and \nthey certainly won't create new production capacity. They cannot sell \nthe extras to your neighbor or mine. So we must put the money up front \nand challenge our companies to deliver quickly. We did that on the \nsupplemental where Congress accepted my amendment adding $1.2 billion. \nBecause that led to increased production capacity, Secretary Gates has \nreprogrammed another $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2007 to take \nadvantage of that new capacity.\n  We made it to the Moon by putting money up front and challenging \nAmericans to do their best to get there. MRAPs and EFP protected \nvehicles are basically modified trucks. America knows how to make \ntrucks and how to make a lot of them. As I said before, this is not \nrocket science. If we buy it, they will build it.\n  What if they cannot? What if industry can only get 15,000 or 20,000 \nof the 23,000 we need built by the end of fiscal year 2008? Well, I \ntell my colleagues, than we will know that we gave them every chance to \nsucceed. More important, we gave our soldiers and marines their best \nchance to survive this war.\n  And the downside is simply that all of the funds we provide cannot be \nspent in 1 year and all of the vehicles cannot be purchased. In that \nsituation, all we have to do is authorize reprogramming the unspent \nfunds for the next fiscal year. Compared to taking a chance on saving \nour kids, that is an easy downside to accept.\n  I opened by saying that this was a very expensive amendment, and it \nis. Let me be clear. It provides $23.6 billion for Army MRAPs, enough \nmoney to buy the 15,200 the commanders in the field are asking for. The \namount is based on the last cost estimate I was given by the Pentagon \non July 9. The amendment also provides an additional $1 billion that I \nhave been told is needed for the purchase of 7,774 MRAPs currently \nplanned for and funded in this bill. The increased funds are needed for \nairlift, training, and maintenance costs not originally included in the \nprogram budget.\n  In addition, the amendment provides $400 million for EFP protection. \nHalf is to field 200 of the vehicles already tested and half is for the \njoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization to continue to \nwork on and field better vehicles. The Bull may not be the perfect \nanswer, but it gives us a chance to save American lives today. While we \nwork on the perfect solution, an MRAP with EFP protection, we should \nstill be giving our soldiers and marines the best we have today. The \nmilitary needs\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\nto see if the Bull can provide full MRAP protection. They also need to \nlook at other ideas for improving MRAPs, but while they do, we should \ntake advantage of the proven technology we have at hand.\n  Last, this amendment asks Secretary Gates to report back to us within \n30 days on any legal authorities he needs to produce and field these \nprotective vehicles faster.\n  Let me also clarify what we are adding these funds to. The Armed \nServices Committee added $4.1 billion to the President's initial \nrequest for a mere $441 million for MRAPs in this bill. At the time, \nthat was all that was thought to be needed to meet the 7,774 \nrequirement and I applaud the committee for meeting that need. The \nsituation has changed since the bill came out of committee. We now know \nthat the Army commanders on the ground want far more. We cannot get \nsuch a large order produced if we continue to delay.\n  For me, this is very simple. I believe that when our sons and \ndaughters are getting blown up and we have vehicles proven to \ndramatically improve their odds of survival, we must get the vehicles \nto them. This amendment allows us to do that. When the Senate returns \nto debate on the Defense Authorization Act, I hope all of my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which \nI referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 16, 2007]\n\n   Pentagon Balked at Pleas From Officers in Field for Safer Vehicles\n\n         (By Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook)\n\n       Pfc. Aaron Kincaid, 25, had been joking with buddies just \n     before their Humvee rolled over the bomb. His wife, Rachel, \n     later learned that the blast blew Kincaid, a father of two \n     from outside Atlanta, through the Humvee's metal roof.\n       Army investigators who reviewed the Sept. 23 attack near \n     Riyadh, Iraq, wrote in their report that only providence \n     could have saved Kincaid from dying that day: ``There was no \n     way short of not going on that route at that time (that) this \n     tragedy could have been diverted.''\n       A USA TODAY investigation of the Pentagon's efforts to \n     protect troops in Iraq suggests otherwise.\n       Years before the war began, Pentagon officials knew of the \n     effectiveness of another type of vehicle that better shielded \n     troops from bombs like those that have killed Kincaid and \n     1,500 other soldiers and Marines. But military officials \n     repeatedly balked at appeals--from commanders on the \n     battlefield and from the Pentagon's own staff--to provide the \n     lifesaving Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, or MRAP, \n     for patrols and combat missions, USA TODAY found.\n       In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates late last \n     month, two U.S. senators said the delays cost the lives of an \n     estimated ``621 to 742 Americans'' who would have survived \n     explosions had they been in MRAPs rather than Humvees.\n       The letter, from Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and Kit Bond, \n     R-Mo., assumed the initial calls for MRAPs came in February \n     2005, when Marines in Iraq asked the Pentagon for almost \n     1,200 of the vehicles. USA TODAY found that the first appeals \n     for the MRAP came much earlier.\n       As early as December 2003, when the Marines requested their \n     first 27 MRAPs for explosives-disposal teams, Pentagon \n     analysts sent detailed information about the superiority of \n     the vehicles to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, e-mails obtained \n     by USA TODAY show. Later pleas came from Iraq, where \n     commanders saw that the approach the Joint Chiefs embraced--\n     adding armor to the sides of Humvees, the standard vehicles \n     in the war zone--did little to protect against blasts beneath \n     the vehicles.\n       Despite the efforts, the general who chaired the Joint \n     Chiefs until Oct. 1, 2005, says buying MRAPs ``was not on the \n     radar screen when I was chairman.'' Air Force general Richard \n     Myers, now retired, says top military officials dealt with a \n     number of vehicle issues, including armoring Humvees. The \n     MRAP, however, was ``not one of them.'' Something related to \n     MRAPs ``might have crossed my desk,'' Myers says, ``but I \n     don't recall it.''\n       Why the issue never received more of a hearing from top \n     officials early in the war remains a mystery, given the \n     chorus of concern. One Pentagon analyst complained in an \n     April 29, 2004, e-mail to colleagues, for instance, that it \n     was ``frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees \n     while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that \n     would provide more protection.''\n       The analyst was referring to the MRAP, whose V-shaped hull \n     puts the crew more than 3 feet off the ground and deflects \n     explosions. It was designed to withstand the underbelly bombs \n     that cripple the lower-riding Humvees. Pentagon officials, \n     civilians and military alike, had been searching for \n     technologies to guard against improvised explosive devices, \n     or IEDs. The makeshift bombs are the No. 1 killer of U.S. \n     forces.\n       The MRAP was not new to the Pentagon. The technology had \n     been developed in South Africa and Rhodesia in the 1970s, \n     making it older than Kincaid and most of the other troops \n     killed by homemade bombs. The Pentagon had tested MRAPs in \n     2000, purchased fewer than two dozen and sent some to Iraq. \n     They were used primarily to protect explosive ordnance \n     disposal teams, not to transport troops or to chase Iraqi \n     insurgents.\n\n\n        The goal: Iraqis ``stand up'' so U.S. can ``stand down''\n\n       Even as the Pentagon balked at buying MRAPs for U.S. \n     troops, USA TODAY found that the military pushed to buy them \n     for a different fighting force: the Iraqi army.\n       On Dec. 22, 2004--two weeks after President Bush told \n     families of servicemembers that ``we're doing everything we \n     possibly can to protect your loved ones''--a U.S. Army \n     general solicited ideas for an armored vehicle for the \n     Iraqis. The Army had an ``extreme interest'' in getting \n     troops better armor, then-brigadier general Roger Nadeau told \n     a subordinate looking at foreign technology, in an e-mail \n     obtained by USA TODAY.\n       In a follow-up message, Nadeau clarified his request: \n     ``What I failed to point out in my first message to you folks \n     is that the U.S. Govt. is interested not for U.S. use, but \n     for possible use in fielding assets to the Iraqi military \n     forces.''\n       In response, Lt. Col. Clay Brown, based in Australia, sent \n     information on two types of MRAPs manufactured overseas. ``By \n     all accounts, these are some of the best in the world,'' he \n     wrote. ``If I were fitting out the Iraqi Army, this is where \n     I'd look (wish we had some!)''\n       The first contract for what would become the Iraqi Light \n     Armored Vehicle--virtually identical to the MRAPs sought by \n     U.S. forces then and now, and made in the United States by \n     BAE Systems--was issued in May 2006. The vehicles, called \n     Badgers, began arriving in Iraq 90 days later, according to \n     BAE. In September 2006, the Pentagon said it would provide up \n     to 600 more to Iraqi forces. As of this spring, 400 had been \n     delivered.\n       The rush to equip the Iraqis stood in stark contrast to the \n     Pentagon's efforts to protect U.S. troops.\n       In February 2005, two months after Nadeau solicited ideas \n     for better armor for the Iraqis and was told MRAPs were an \n     answer, an urgent-need request for the same type of vehicle \n     came from embattled Marines in Anbar province. The request, \n     signed by then-brigadier general Dennis Hejlik, said the \n     Marines ``cannot continue to lose . . . serious and grave \n     casualties to IEDs . . . at current rates when a commercial \n     off-the-shelf capability exists to mitigate'' them.\n       Officials at Marine headquarters in Quantico, Va., shelved \n     the request for 1,169 vehicles. Fifteen months passed before \n     a second request reached the Joint Chiefs and was approved. \n     Those vehicles finally began trickling into Anbar in \n     February, two years after the original request. Because of \n     the delay, the Marines are investigating how its urgent-need \n     requests are handled.\n       The long delay infuriates some members of Congress. ``Every \n     day, our troops are being maimed or killed needlessly because \n     we haven't fielded this soon enough,'' says Rep. Gene Taylor, \n     D-Miss. ``The costs are in human lives, in kids who will \n     never have their legs again, people blind, crippled. That's \n     the real tragedy.''\n       Not until two months ago did the Pentagon champion the MRAP \n     for all U.S. forces. Gates made MRAPs the military's top \n     priority. The plan is to build the vehicles as fast as \n     possible until conditions warrant a change, according to a \n     military official who has direct knowledge of the program but \n     is not authorized to speak on the record. Thousands are in \n     the pipeline at a cost so far of about $2.4 billion.\n       Gates said he was influenced by a news report--originally \n     in USA TODAY--that disclosed Marine units using MRAPs in \n     Anbar reported no deaths in about 300 roadside bombings in \n     the past year. His tone was grave. ``For every month we \n     delay,'' he said, ``scores of young Americans are going to \n     die.''\n       One reason officials put off buying MRAPs in significant \n     quantities: They never expected the war to last this long. \n     Bush set the tone on May 1, 2003, six weeks after the U.S. \n     invasion, when he declared on board the aircraft carrier \n     Abraham Lincoln that ``major combat operations in Iraq have \n     ended.''\n       Gen. George Casey, the top commander in Iraq from June 2004 \n     until February this year, repeatedly said that troop levels \n     in Iraq would be cut just as soon as Iraqi troops took more \n     responsibility for security. In March 2005, he predicted \n     ``very substantial reductions'' in U.S. troops by early 2006. \n     He said virtually the same thing a year later.\n       Casey wasn't the only optimist. In May 2005, Vice President \n     Cheney declared that the insurgency was ``in its last \n     throes.''\n       Given the view that the war would end soon, the Pentagon \n     had little use for expensive new vehicles such as the MRAP, \n     at least not in large quantities. The MRAPs ordered for the \n     Iraqis were intended to speed the day when, to use Bush's \n     words, Iraqi forces could ``stand up'' and the United States \n     could ``stand down.''\n       Nadeau, who wrote the e-mail that led to MRAPs for the \n     Iraqis, explains why he did so: ``The U.S. government knows \n     that eventually we're going to get out'' of Iraq. The United \n     States wants ``to help get (the Iraqis) in a position to take \n     care of themselves.''\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\n       For U.S. forces, however, the answer was something else: \n     adding armor to Humvees. Nadeau and others say the choice \n     made sense because Humvees were already in Iraq and the \n     improvements--adding steel to the sides, upgrading the \n     windows and replacing the canvas doors--could be made \n     quickly, and far more cheaply. Adding armor to a Humvee cost \n     only $14,000; a Humvee armored at the factory cost $191,000; \n     today, an MRAP costs between $600,000 and $1 million, though \n     some foreign models cost only about $200,000 in 2004.\n       The solution to the IED problem in 2003 had to be \n     ``immediate,'' says retired vice admiral Gordon Holder, \n     director for logistics for the Joint Chiefs until mid-2004. \n     ``We had to stop the bleeding.'' Holder says MRAPs seemed \n     impractical for the immediate need: ``We shouldn't take four \n     years to field something the kids needed yesterday.''\n       Would it actually have taken four years? That depends upon \n     how much urgency the Pentagon and Congress attached to \n     speeding production. Force Protection Inc., the small South \n     Carolina company that landed the first significant MRAP \n     contracts, was criticized this month by the Pentagon's \n     inspector general for failing to deliver its vehicles on \n     time. But bigger defense contractors were available then--and \n     have secured MRAP contracts in recent weeks that call for \n     deliveries in as little as four months.\n       A bigger obstacle might have been philosophical: The MRAP \n     didn't fit the Pentagon's long-term vision of how the \n     military should be equipped.\n       Then-Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld regarded the Iraq \n     war ``as a means to change'' the military, ``make it lighter, \n     make it more responsive, make it more agile,'' Holder says. \n     The MRAP, heavier and slower than the Humvee, wouldn't have \n     measured up, he says.\n\n\n              The commander: ``IEDs are my No. 1 threat''\n\n       By June 2004, the military had lost almost 200 U.S. troops \n     to the homemade bombs. Gen. John Abizaid, then head of U.S. \n     Central Command, told the Joint Chiefs that ``IEDs are my No. \n     1 threat.'' He called for a ``mini-Manhattan Project'' \n     against IEDs, akin to the task force that developed the \n     atomic bomb during World War II.\n       The Pentagon organized a small task force that, two years \n     later, morphed into a full-fledged agency: the Joint IED \n     Defeat Organization, or JIEDDO. Its leader, Montgomery Meigs, \n     is a retired four-star general. Its annual budget totals $4.3 \n     billion. Its mission: to stop IEDs from killing U.S. troops.\n       In one of its PowerPoint presentations, JIEDDO made its \n     priorities clear. First, prevent IEDs from being planted by \n     attacking the insurgency. Then, if a device is planted, \n     prevent it from exploding. ``When all Else Fails,'' reads \n     another slide, ``Survive the blast.'' That put solutions such \n     as the MRAP into the category of last resorts.\n       JIEDDO did spend its own money for 122 MRAPs, but it \n     primarily focused on electronic jammers to prevent bombs from \n     being remotely detonated, unmanned surveillance aircraft to \n     catch insurgents putting bombs along roads and better \n     intelligence on who was building and planting bombs.\n       The agency has claimed some successes. Insurgents in 2007 \n     had to plant six times as many bombs as they did in 2004 to \n     inflict the same number of U.S. casualties, Meigs said in an \n     interview.\n       But the insurgents--Sunnis loyal to the deposed leader \n     Saddam Hussein, Shiites who hated the U.S. occupiers and \n     foreigners aligned with al-Qaeda--often managed to stay one \n     step ahead of JIEDDO. They changed the kind of explosives \n     they planted and varied the locations of the devices and the \n     way they detonated them.\n       When the Pentagon added armor to the sides of Humvees to \n     guard against bombs planted along roadsides, the insurgents \n     responded by burying bombs in the roads. The bombs could \n     blast through the vulnerable underbelly of the Humvees. The \n     insurgents also moved to larger, more sophisticated bombs, \n     some packed with as much as 100 pounds of explosives.\n       Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, the No. 2 \n     official at the Pentagon, testified on Capitol Hill in June \n     that ``as the threat has evolved, we have evolved. We work \n     very, very hard to be responsible to our troops.''\n       Taylor, the Democratic congressman from Mississippi, \n     pressed England about why the Pentagon waited until May to \n     request substantial numbers of MRAPs. ``Are you telling me no \n     one could see that (need) coming, no one could recognize that \n     the bottom of the Humvee'' didn't protect troops, and \n     ``that's why the kids inside are losing their legs and their \n     lives?'' Taylor asked.\n       ``That is too simplistic a description,'' England replied. \n     ``People have not died needlessly, and we have not left our \n     people without equipment.''\n       To Pentagon decision-makers, the Humvee seemed able to \n     handle the threat early in the war--roadside bombs, rather \n     than those buried in the roads. ``If anybody could have \n     guessed in 2003 that we would be looking at these kind of \n     (high-powered, buried) IEDs that we're seeing now in 2007, \n     then we would have been looking at something much longer'' \n     term as a solution, Holder says. ``But who had the crystal \n     ball back then?''\n       Nadeau, now a major general in charge of the Army's Test \n     and Evaluation Command in Alexandria, Va., also defends the \n     Pentagon's choices. He says buried IEDs did not become a \n     serious threat to the armored Humvees until 2006. Critics \n     might say, ``Why didn't you guys buy 16,000 MRAPs a decade \n     ago?'' Nadeau says today. ``You know, I didn't need them.''\n       Six officers interviewed by USA TODAY say the threat to the \n     Humvees surfaced sooner. Lt. Col. Dallas Eubanks, chief of \n     operations for the Army's 4th Infantry Division in 2003-04, \n     says IEDs became more menacing before he left Iraq. ``We were \n     certainly seeing underground IEDs by early 2004,'' he says.\n       In mid-2005, two top Marines--Gen. William Nyland, \n     assistant Marine commandant, and Maj. Gen. William Catto, \n     head of Marine Corps Systems Command--testified before \n     Congress that they were seeing an ``evolving'' threat from \n     underbelly blasts. They said at the time that armored Humvees \n     remained their best defense.\n\n\n              The congressman: MRAP's ``simple'' advantage\n\n       Just after lunch on June 27, 2004, a group of enlisted men \n     parked a handful of armored vehicles near a cinderblock \n     building at Marine headquarters in Fallujah, Iraq.\n       The day had turned sweltering, like every summer afternoon \n     in central Iraq. But this day was special. A congressional \n     delegation had arrived, and among the dignitaries was Rep. \n     Duncan Hunter, then the chairman of the House Armed Services \n     Committee. Hunter wasn't just a powerful congressman. He was \n     a Vietnam War veteran, and his son, then a 27-year-old Marine \n     lieutenant also named Duncan, was stationed at the base.\n       More important to most of the Marines, the California \n     Republican had been instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to \n     get better armor for them. Humvees with cloth doors--canvas, \n     like the crusher hat that Hunter wore that day--had been \n     standard issue when the war began. The fabric worked well to \n     shield the sun; it offered no protection against explosives.\n       Then, as now, Hunter was impatient with the pace of \n     procurement in Iraq. That winter, he had dispatched his staff \n     to steel mills, where they persuaded managers and union \n     leaders to set aside commercial orders to expedite steel \n     needed to armor the Humvees. He also worked with the Army and \n     its contractors to expand production.\n       In Fallujah, Hunter recognized the Humvees. He couldn't \n     identify the two vehicles next to them. One was called a \n     Cougar, the other a Buffalo. Both were MRAPs, made by Force \n     Protection Inc., and both, he was told, were coveted. They \n     were used by explosives disposal teams, but combat units \n     ``looked at them and said, `We want those,' '' Hunter \n     recalls.\n       Throughout most of Iraq, they still haven't arrived.\n       Despite requests from the field, Pentagon officials decided \n     to ration the vehicle. In 2003 and 2004, they bought about \n     55, and only for explosives-disposal units. But they chose a \n     different approach for protecting the rest of the troops: \n     adding armor to Humvees. The choice was problematic. The \n     Humvee's flat bottom channels an explosion through the center \n     of the vehicle, toward the occupants.\n       Memos and e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show a stream of \n     concerns about the decision to armor the Humvee. Most went up \n     the chain of command and withered:\n       December 2003: At the direction of then-deputy Defense \n     secretary Paul Wolfowitz, who was troubled by the mounting \n     death toll from IEDs, the Joint Chiefs began to explore \n     options for giving troops better armor. Detailed information \n     on the Wer'Wolf, an MRAP made in the African country of \n     Namibia, was passed from analysts in the Pentagon to Lt. Col. \n     Steven Ware, an aide collecting information for the Joint \n     Chiefs.\n       March 30, 2004: Gen. Larry Ellis, in charge of U.S. Forces \n     Command in Atlanta, sent a memo to the Army's chief of staff, \n     Gen. Peter Schoomaker. He complained that ``some Army members \n     and agencies are still in a peacetime posture.'' U.S. \n     commanders in Iraq told him that the armored Humvee ``is not \n     providing the solution the Army hoped to achieve.'' He didn't \n     recommend MRAPs but rather suggested accelerating production \n     of a combat vehicle called the Stryker. In response, the \n     military said new Humvee armor kits would suffice.\n       April 28-29, 2004: Duncan Lang, a Pentagon analyst who \n     worked in acquisition and technology, suggested purchasing \n     the Wer'Wolf, the MRAP put before the Joint Chiefs in \n     December 2003. In an e-mail to colleagues and supervisors, \n     Lang said ``a number could be sent to Iraq ``as quickly as, \n     or even more quickly than, additional armored Humvees.'' He \n     called it ``frustrating to see the pictures of burning \n     Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there \n     that would provide more protection.''\n       April 30, 2004: Another Pentagon analyst, Air Force Lt. \n     Col. Bob Harris, forwarded details about MRAP options to a \n     member of the IED task force. The list included a variety of \n     MRAPs, among them the Wer'Wolf and Force Protection's Cougar. \n     ``There was no great clarity as to why they didn't pursue \n     these options,'' Harris says. ``I saw it as my job to \n     educate.'' Harris is now an acquisition officer at Hanscom \n     Air Force Base in Massachusetts.\n       Hunter says the advantages the MRAP had on the Humvee were \n     clear. ``It's a simple formula,'' Hunter says. ``A vehicle \n     that's 1 foot off the ground gets 16 times that (blast) \n     impact that you get in a vehicle that's 4 feet off the \n     ground,'' like the MRAP.\n       Although Hunter favored adding armor to Humvees, he now \n     calls the military's devotion to that approach a costly \n     mistake. ``It's true that they saved more lives by moving\n\n[[Page S9605]]\n\n     first on up-armoring the Humvees,'' he says. ``The flaw is \n     that they did nothing on MRAPs. The up-armoring of Humvees \n     didn't have to be an exclusive operation.''\n       Holder dismisses the idea that the Pentagon could have \n     moved on a dual track: armoring Humvees while ordering \n     up MRAPs. He doubts Congress would have funded both at the \n     time. But that's exactly what Congress is doing now--\n     buying both vehicles.\n       ``We probably should've had the foresight'' to start buying \n     MRAPs earlier, says Ware, the Joint Chiefs aide (now retired) \n     who passed the information to superiors and counterparts in \n     the Army and Marines. But ``we just couldn't get them there \n     fast enough.'' Adding armor to the Humvee, Ware says, ``was \n     better than nothing.''\n\n\n          The lieutenant colonel: ``Hope no one gets wasted''\n\n       A PowerPoint presentation, dated Aug. 25, 2004, shows \n     wounded troops lying in hospital beds. Most are bandaged. One \n     is bloody. His left eye is barely open, his injured right is \n     covered by a patch. Each was maimed by an IED. Each, save \n     one, was in a Humvee.\n       On another slide: ``Numerous vehicles on the market provide \n     far superior ballistic protection'' than the Humvee, wrote \n     then-lieutenant colonel Jim Hampton, the man who prepared the \n     presentation for the operations staff of the U.S. Army Corps \n     of Engineers in Baghdad.\n       Safety is a passion for Hampton. He's so concerned with \n     security that he asks his wife, Kate, to take her pistol when \n     she goes for walks on their 80 acres in rural Mississippi. \n     When he got to Iraq in early 2004, he was tasked with looking \n     at armor options to protect the Corps of Engineers, the \n     agency sent to help with rebuilding efforts. For weeks, he \n     studied armor options. His conclusion: The corps should get \n     MRAPs to protect its people, specifically Wer'Wolves. Hampton \n     says he asked for 53 Wer'Wolves. The corps got four.\n       Hampton couldn't have been more opposed to up-armoring the \n     Humvees and warned his superiors. He even e-mailed his wife \n     from Iraq. ``Hey Babe,'' his e-mail read. ``Just a little \n     aggravated with the bureaucracy. It is simply beyond my \n     comprehension why we're having to go through such (an ordeal) \n     to order confounded hard vehicles. I sure hope no one gets \n     wasted before the powers-that-be get off their collective fat \n     asses.''\n       Finally, he wrote his congressman, Rep. Chip Pickering, R-\n     Miss., urging him to investigate deaths involving the Humvee. \n     ``We would never consider sending troops'' in Humvees ``up \n     against armor or artillery,'' Hampton wrote, ``but this is \n     tantamount to what we're doing because these vehicles are \n     being engaged with the very ordnance delivered by artillery \n     in the form of improvised explosive devices.''\n       By November 2004, Pentagon analyst Lang had grown \n     discouraged, an e-mail shows. ``I have found that you can \n     never put the word out too many times,'' he wrote on Nov. 17. \n     ``I send it on to (the Secretary of Defense's office), Army \n     and (Marine Corps) contacts I have. Some of it is getting to \n     the rapid fielding folks and force protection folks that are \n     looking at Iraq issues. I do not see much action.''\n       Lang closed the message with a variation on his earlier \n     plea: ``For the life of me, I cannot figure out why we have \n     not taken better advantage of the sources of such vehicles,'' \n     he wrote. ``We should be buying 200, not 2, at a time. These \n     things work, they save lives and they don't cost much, if \n     any, more than what we are using now.'' At the time, a basic \n     Wer'Wolf cost about the same as a factory-made armored \n     Humvee: around $200,000.\n       In December 2004, at a town hall meeting with troops in \n     Kuwait, a soldier asked Rumsfeld about the lack of armor on \n     military vehicles. Rumsfeld explained the situation this way: \n     ``You go to war with the Army you have. They're not the Army \n     you might want or wish to have at a later time.''\n       The concerns troops voiced at the meeting might have had an \n     impact. Within a week, the Marine Corps Systems Command in \n     Quantico posted its first notice seeking information on MRAPs \n     from potential contractors.\n       Back in Fallujah, the desire for the Cougar had grown. By \n     February 2005, the Marines were formally asking for more. \n     Field commanders sent their first large-scale request for \n     MRAPs, seeking 1,169 vehicles with specifications that \n     closely mirrored those of the Cougar. They no longer \n     envisioned the vehicle as limited to explosives-disposal \n     teams; they wanted MRAPs for combat troops, too.\n       Roy McGriff III, then a major, drafted the request signed \n     by Brig. Gen. Hejlik. ``MRAP vehicles will protect Marines, \n     reduce casualties, increase mobility and enhance mission \n     success,'' the request read. ``Without MRAP, personnel loss \n     rates are likely to continue at their current rate.'' In \n     spring 2005, he would have a chance to argue his case before \n     top generals.\n\n\n              The Marine major: ``Unnecessary'' casualties\n\n       They convened March 29-30, 2005, at the Marine Corps Air \n     Station in Miramar, Calif. The occasion: a safety board \n     meeting, a regular gathering to address safety issues across \n     the Corps. In attendance: five three-star generals, four two-\n     stars, seven one-stars and McGriff.\n       McGriff knew the MRAP's history and the Pentagon's \n     reluctance to invest in the vehicle. He had learned about the \n     vehicle from a fellow Marine, Wayne Sinclair. Sinclair, then \n     a captain, wrote in the July 1996 issue of the Marine Corps \n     Gazette that ``an affordable answer to the land mine was \n     developed over 20 years ago. It's time that Marines at the \n     sharp end shared in . . . this discovery.''\n       Addressing the generals, McGriff recommended analyzing \n     every incident involving Marine vehicles the same way \n     investigators probe aircraft crashes. Look at the vehicle for \n     flaws, McGriff recalls telling the officers, and examine the \n     tactics used to defeat it.\n       Lt. Gen. Wallace Gregson, commander of Marine Corps Forces \n     in the Pacific, and Lt. Gen. James Mattis, leader of the \n     Marine Combat Development Command, listened and then \n     conferred for a moment.\n       The room grew quiet. ``Then they said, `OK, what do you \n     want to do?' '' McGriff remembers.\n       He recited the very plan that the Pentagon, under a new \n     Defense secretary, would embrace in 2007: ``A phased \n     transition. Continue to armor Humvees. At the same time, as \n     quickly and as expeditiously as possible, purchase as many \n     MRAPs as possible. Phase out Humvees.''\n       According to McGriff, the room again grew silent. Then, \n     Mattis finally spoke: ``That's exactly what we're going to \n     do.'' Mattis' words failed to translate into action. The \n     urgent-need request McGriff drafted went unfulfilled at \n     Marine headquarters in Quantico. A June 10, 2005, status \n     report on the request indicated the Marine Corps was holding \n     out for a ``future vehicle,'' presumably the Joint Light \n     Tactical Vehicle--more mobile than the MRAP, more protective \n     than the Humvee, and due in 2012. In practical terms, that \n     meant no MRAPs immediately.\n       McGriff foresaw some of the turmoil over vehicles in a \n     prophetic 2003 paper for the School for Advanced Warfighting \n     in Quantico.\n       ``Currently, our underprotected vehicles result in \n     casualties that are politically untenable and militarily \n     unnecessary,'' his paper read. ``Failure to build a MRAP \n     vehicle fleet produces a deteriorating cascade of effects \n     that will substantially increase'' risks for the military \n     while ``rendering it tactically immobile.'' Mines and IEDs \n     will force U.S. troops off the roads, he wrote, and keep them \n     from aggressively attacking insurgents.\n       The words were strong and the conclusions were damning. \n     Rhodesia, a nation with nothing near the resources of the \n     U.S. military, had built MRAPs more than a quarter-century \n     earlier that remained ``more survivable than any comparable \n     vehicle produced by the U.S. today,'' McGriff wrote.\n       Despite his views then, McGriff, now a lieutenant colonel, \n     says he understands the delays. MRAPs needed to be tested to \n     ensure they could perform in combat. ``Nothing happens fast \n     enough when people are fighting and dying,'' he says today. \n     ``But amidst the chaos, you still have to make the right \n     choices. In the end, I think the Marines got the MRAP \n     capability as quickly and safely as possible.''\n       Others disagree.\n       Marine major Franz Gayl, now retired, was science adviser \n     to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq. He saw how \n     Marines were still being killed or maimed in Anbar in the \n     fall of 2006. If the Marine Corps had decided MRAPs were a \n     top priority, he says, it could and should have pursued them \n     with the same urgency the Pentagon is now showing.\n       ``The ramp-up of industry capacity was delayed by over 1\\1/\n     2\\ years,'' Gayl says, ``until it became the dire emergency \n     that it is today.''\n       Bureaucrats didn't want the MRAP sooner ``because it would \n     compete against'' armored Humvees and ``many other favored \n     programs'' for funding, Gayl says. Gayl, who works as a \n     civilian for the Marines at the Pentagon, has filed for \n     federal whistleblower protection because he fears retaliation \n     for speaking out about the failure to get MRAPs sooner.\n\n\n            Defense Secretary Gates: ``Lives are at stake''\n\n       After McGriff addressed the generals in March 2005, another \n     15 months passed. Then the Marines in Iraq reiterated the \n     request for MRAPs. This time they sent the request directly \n     to the Joint Chiefs. This time they were successful.\n       In December 2006, after insurgent bombs had killed almost \n     1,200 U.S. troops in Iraq, the Joint Chiefs validated \n     requests from Iraq for 4,060 MRAPs, and the formal MRAP \n     program was launched.\n       By March 2007, Marine Corps Commandant James Conway called \n     the vehicle his ``No. 1 unfilled warfighting requirement.''\n       In part, that's because he saw it save lives in Anbar \n     province. Brig. Gen. John Allen, deputy commander of \n     coalition forces there, says the Marines tracked attacks on \n     MRAPs since January 2006. The finding: Marines in armored \n     Humvees are twice as likely to be badly wounded in an IED \n     attack as those in MRAPs.\n       Perhaps more convincing: No Marines have been killed in \n     more than 300 attacks on MRAPs there.\n       The news, revealed in USA TODAY on April 19, drew the \n     attention of Defense Secretary Gates, four months into his \n     job at the Pentagon. He was traveling in Iraq and read about \n     the MRAP's success in the Pentagon's daily news roundup. \n     Weeks later, at a news conference, Gates said the Pentagon \n     would rush MRAPs to Iraq ``as best we can.''\n       Late last month, top Pentagon officials approved an Army \n     strategy for buying as many as 17,700 MRAPs, allowing a one-\n     for-one swap\n\n[[Page S9606]]\n\n     for its armored Humvees. About 5,200 MRAPs had been approved \n     for the other services. Now, Pentagon officials decline to \n     say exactly how many MRAPs they need.\n       One official says they'll build MRAPs as fast as possible, \n     then recalibrate the military's needs as they assess \n     operations in Iraq, a tacit acknowledgment that they may need \n     fewer MRAPs as U.S. troops are withdrawn.\n       During another news conference late last month, Gates \n     worried that the companies building the MRAP--not only Force \n     Protection but BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Oshkosh Truck, \n     Armor Holdings, International Military and Government and \n     Protected Vehicles--won't be able to get the vehicles to Iraq \n     fast enough.\n       ``I didn't think that was acceptable,'' Gates said. ``Lives \n     are at stake.''\n\n\n             the young lieutenant: ``safest vehicle ever''\n\n       As the sun egan to bake the Iraqi countryside last month, \n     Marine 2nd Lt. George Saenz headed back to his base on the \n     outskirts in Fallujah. He felt oddly joyful.\n       Saenz had just spent hours leading his platoon through one \n     of the most excruciating battlefield jobs--inching a convoy \n     along the crumbling streets of Fallujah, searching for \n     homemade bombs planted in the asphalt or dirt.\n       The night before had proved dangerous. Two bombs had blown \n     up underneath Saenz's convoy, including one beneath his \n     vehicle.\n       As Saenz turned through the gray blast walls protecting the \n     base, he says he couldn't help but think: If I had been \n     riding a Humvee, I wouldn't be here right now.\n       Saenz knew why he was alive. His platoon in the 6th Marine \n     Regiment Combat Team had replaced its Humvees with MRAPs. The \n     two blasts produced just one injury, a Marine whose \n     concussion put him on light duty for a week.\n       ``We're probably in the safest vehicle ever designed for \n     military use,'' Saenz says, recalling his platoon's record: \n     Three months. Eleven bomb attacks. No one dead.\n       MRAPs have become legendary in Anbar since Marines began \n     using them on dangerous missions clearing roadside bombs. \n     Tank commanders, radio operators and others drop by Saenz's \n     platoon every day to do what Rep. Hunter had done three years \n     earlier--inspect the small fleet of MRAPs, knock on the \n     armor, sometimes crawl inside.\n       Scores of MRAPs are scheduled to arrive in Anbar this \n     summer. That means they'll be available for the first time to \n     the Marines for tasks other than clearing IEDs, says Marine \n     Col. Mike Rudolph, logistics officer for U.S. forces in \n     western Iraq. No one has decided how MRAPs will be used, but \n     ``everybody wants one,'' Rudolph says.\n       To be sure, the vehicle isn't perfect. Saenz's team warns \n     that MRAPs drive like trucks, plodding and heavy. Some models \n     are so bulky they have blind spots for troops peering over \n     the boxy hood and so noisy a driver has to shout at someone 2 \n     feet away.\n       ``They're just so heavy,'' Sgt. Randall Miller says. \n     ``These are virtually designed off a semi-truck platform.''\n       After substantial testing, the military also has concluded \n     that MRAPs are vulnerable to explosively formed projectiles, \n     the newest and most devastating variation of the IED. More \n     armor has been developed for the MRAPs the Pentagon ordered \n     this spring.\n       Miller isn't complaining. On his first tour in Iraq in \n     2004-05, Miller searched for land mines in a Humvee. His \n     detection technique was simple: ``Go real slow, cross your \n     fingers.'' He still drives slowly but feels safer knowing the \n     MRAP's V-shaped hull will deflect a bomb blast. ``I've seen \n     our guys get hit and walk away,'' Miller says. ``They're \n     awesome, awesome vehicles.''\n\n\n              the widow: ``they should've done it'' sooner\n\n       Whom or what is to blame for the delay in getting safer \n     vehicles for the 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq?\n       Jim Hampton, now a retired colonel, questions why the \n     Pentagon and Congress didn't do more to keep the troops safe. \n     ``I have colleagues who say people need to go to jail over \n     this, and in my mind they do,'' Hampton says.\n       Hunter, now running for president, blames the Pentagon \n     bureaucracy, which he says ``doesn't move fast enough to meet \n     the needs of the war fighter. We have a system in which the \n     warfighting requirements are requested from the field and the \n     acquisition people say, `We'll get it on our schedule.' ''\n       Other members of Congress blame Rumsfeld and his vision of \n     transforming the military into a leaner, faster fighting \n     force.\n       Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., wonders if Rumsfeld's forceful \n     personality silenced some of the generals. ``Rumsfeld so \n     intimidated the military that I've lost confidence in them \n     telling us what they really need'' in Iraq, Murtha says.\n       ``They all knew the Rumsfeld rule: Your career is over if \n     you say anything contrary'' to his policies, Murtha says. \n     ``It's much better now that Rumsfeld is gone. The military is \n     being much more honest.''\n       If the Pentagon ``had just listened to the guys in the \n     field'' who wanted MRAPs, Murtha says, ``we'd have them in \n     Iraq right now.''\n       USA TODAY could not determine what role, if any, Rumsfeld \n     played in MRAP deliberations. A spokesman for Rumsfeld, now \n     running a foundation in Washington, said last week that the \n     former Defense secretary would not comment.\n       Aaron Kincaid's widow, Rachel, doesn't know who should be \n     held accountable.

Madam President, as I said late last week, it has been \n52 months since military operations began in Iraq. Approximately 3,613 \nAmericans have died and 25,000 have been wounded. More than 4 million \nIraqis have fled their homes, and tens of thousands, at a minimum, have \nbeen killed. We have now been engaged in the war in Iraq longer than we \nwere in World War II.\n  With the surge well underway, violence in Iraq has reached \nunprecedented levels and American troop fatalities are up 70 percent. \nFrom all angles, the situation in Iraq is an absolute disaster, and the \nadministration's inability or unwillingness to recognize this reality \nis diminishing our international credibility, straining our relations \nwith many foreign governments, and causing us to neglect weak and \nunstable regions that could pose threats to our national security.\n  The administration's single-minded focus on Iraq is preventing us \nfrom adequately confronting threats of extremism and terrorism around \nthe globe. The declassified NIE released just yesterday confirms that \nal-Qaida remains the most serious threat to the United States and that \nkey elements of that threat have been regenerated or even enhanced. The \nadministration's policies in Iraq have also resulted in the emergence \nof an al-Qaida affiliate that did not exist before the war--al-Qaida in \nIraq, or AQI. According to the NIE, al-Qaida's association with this \ngroup helps it raise resources and recruit and indoctrinate operatives, \nincluding for attacks against the United States.\n  Yet, while this report is further proof that the war in Iraq is a \ndistraction from our core goal of fighting those who attacked us on 9/\n11, this administration and its supporters are still calling Iraq the \n``central front in the war on terror,'' even though al-Qaida is a \nglobal threat and AQI is one of a number of actors responsible for \nviolence in Iraq's self-sustaining sectarian conflict.\n  While our attention has been diverted and our resources squandered in \nIraq, al-Quaida has protected its safe haven in Pakistan and has \nincreased cooperation with regional terrorist groups. The sooner we \nredeploy from Iraq, the sooner we can refocus our efforts and develop a \nwide-ranging, inclusive strategy that would deny al-Qaida these \nadvantages.\n  I remind my colleagues that last November, our constituents spoke out \nagainst this war in every way they possibly could. And as the situation \ncontinues to deteriorate, they have repeated their call--they were \noutside this building last night holding a candlelight vigil, and in \nStates around the Nation, to show their support for ending this war and \nto tell President Bush and Senate Republicans to ``stop obstructing an \nend to the war.'' I know my colleagues heard their voices last \nNovember, and I am hopeful they heard them last night. It almost goes \nwithout saying that they hear them every time they return home as well.\n  But, just like last week and the week before that, at the other end \nof Pennsylvania Avenue, these pervasive calls are ignored as the \nPresident continues to make it clear that nothing not the voices of his \ncitizens, not the advice of military and foreign policy experts, not \nthe concerns of members from his own party--will discourage him from \npursuing an indefinite and misguided war.\n  We can't put all the blame on the White House, however. An \noverwhelming majority of Congress authorized this misguided war, and \nnow a far smaller but still determined minority\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\nis allowing this war to continue, despite the wishes of the American \npeople, despite the fact that our military is overstretched, and \ndespite the fact that our presence in Iraq has been, according to our \nown State Department, ``used as a rallying cry for radicalization and \nextremist activity in neighboring countries . . .''\n  It is up to Congress to act because the President will not. It us up \nto us to listen to the American people, to save American lives, and to \nensure our Nation's security by redeploying our troops from Iraq. We \nhave that power and responsibility and we must act now.\n  That is why I support the amendment offered by Senators Levin and \nJack Reed--an amendment with binding deadlines for both beginning and \nending redeployment and the only amendment we are likely to consider \nthat would take a strong step toward bringing our involvement in this \nwar to a close.\n  The Levin-Jack Reed amendment is not as strong as I would have liked, \nbut it does require the President to bring home our troops, starting in \n120 days. I am encouraged that this amendment is bipartisan, and while \nI wish it had the support of the entire Senate, the support of Senators \nSmith, Hagel, and Snow is nonetheless an important development.\n  I call on other Republicans to follow their lead; there is no time to \nwaste. It is not enough to pass something that sounds good but doesn't \nmove us toward ending the war. Weak, feel-good amendments may give \npeople up here political comfort but that comfort won't last long we \ncan fool ourselves, but we can't fool the American people.\n  It is a tragic truth that the war in Iraq has become the defining \naspect of our engagement in this part of the world. Coupled with this \nadministration's inconsistent efforts to promote democracy and the rule \nof law overseas, the war has alienated and angered those whose support \nand cooperation we need if we are to prevail against al-Qaida and its \nallies.\n  As long as the President's policies continue, Iraq will continue to \nbe what the 2006 declassified National Intelligence Estimate called a \n``cause celebre'' for a new generation of terrorists. Meanwhile, al-\nQaida has expanded its relations with dangerous regional terrorist \ngroups.\n  The newest National Intelligence Estimate indicates that we may now \nbe facing the worst-case scenario in that our indefinite military \npresence in Iraq has both allowed al-Qaida to reconstitute itself while \nit has also served as a recruitment tool for a growing and scattered \nglobal network of al-Qaida affiliates. It is becoming increasing \ndifficult for this administration to argue, as it continues to do, that \nour presence in Iraq is doing anything but profoundly undermining our \nnational security.\n  Instead, we should be directing our attention and resources to \ncombating the global threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates. The \nfight against terrorism is not conventional and requires better \nintelligence, better cooperation with friends and allies, stronger \nregional institutions, and more comprehensive policies designed to \nreverse the conditions that might lead to the creation of safe havens. \nWe must prevent these safe havens from being established, including by \nworking to settle regional conflicts and ensuring adequate provision of \neconomic and development assistance so local populations can reject \nterrorist organizations. We need regional strategies that address the \ncapabilities and policies of all affected countries, both bilateral and \nmultilateral. We must expand our assistance while ensuring that \ncorruption and threats to human rights and political liberties do not \nundermine these efforts.\n  By redeploying our troops from Iraq, we can refocus on developing \nthese vital strategies. And by freeing up strategic and technical \ncapacity, we can better address other priorities that have not received \nadequate attention, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and \nSomalia. We can provide real international leadership to combat other \npressing enemies such as endemic poverty, HIV/AIDS, and corruption--all \nof which can contribute to the kinds of instability where extremists \nthrive. These global battles can't be won if the war in Iraq continues \nto dominate our foreign policy and indefinitely drain vital security \nresources.\n  As I have said before and as I will undoubtedly say again, the \nadministration's policies in Iraq are an unmitigated disaster. But we \ncan mitigate this disaster, lessen the massive burden imposed on our \ntroops, regain our credibility with the international community, and \nmake our Nation more secure. We can and must do that by redeploying our \ntroops from Iraq. Repairing the damage that has been done to our \nnational security will be difficult and time-consuming, and we can \nstart today by passing the Levin-Jack Reed amendment.\n  There is no reason to wait any longer. Members of this body have \nclaimed that in September we will have a clearer sense of whether the \n``surge'' has succeeded and whether our policy needs to change. But we \nalready know what that report will tell us. We have heard it from \nforeign policy and military experts and could even read it with our own \neyes in the Pentagon's first quarterly surge report or the White \nHouse's Benchmark Assessment Report, which was released last week. The \nsurge was intended to create a ``window'' for political progress, but \nsignificant political progress is still nowhere to be seen. We already \nknow there is no military solution to Iraq's problems, so now the \nquestion is how long are we prepared to wait? How long are we prepared \nto have our young men and women police a civil war where the struggle \nover national identity and the distribution of power has long since \nmoved out of the Parliament building and onto the streets? How many \nmore brave young Americans will lose a limb or be killed while we tell \nourselves that another couple months will turn around 4 years of failed \npolicies? When are my colleagues on the other side willing to say that \nenough is enough?\n  It has been a long night, and we have had some heated exchanges. It \nappears that a minority of the Senate is prepared to prevent a majority \nof the Senate--and the country--from doing what is long overdue: \nputting an end to a war without end. This is not the first time that a \nminority has prevented a majority from acting in this body. Indeed, I \nhave been on the other side of a few of those fights. But this is not a \nquestion of senatorial prerogatives. I am not questioning the right of \nSenators to prevent a vote on the Levin-Jack Reed amendment. I am, \nhowever, questioning the wisdom of such a move, of allowing this \nterrible mistake to continue for days, weeks, months.\n  I will continue working to bring this war to a close. As long as so \nmany of my colleagues refuse to listen to the American people, to \nacknowledge that this war is hurting our country and making our Nation \nmore vulnerable, we will have more debates and more votes. Sooner or \nlater, we will end this war. And the sooner we do so, the sooner we can \nstart redeploying our servicemembers from Iraq's civil war and \nrefocusing on a global campaign against a ruthless, determined enemy \nwhose reach extends far beyond Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9607-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9607-S9608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING LADY BIRD JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, so much has been said about the various \nparts of Lady Bird Johnson's life, as one of our most beloved First \nLadies, as a loving mother and grandmother, as the mother of the \nconservation movement, and as a skilled businesswoman. But there is \nanother aspect all of us in this body appreciate, and that is her mark \non this Chamber.\n  Before the Johnsons left Washington in January 1969, they came to the \nCapitol to say farewell. And the ever gracious Lady Bird Johnson, who \nhad watched her husband serve as a Senator and a majority leader, said:\n\n       When we say goodbye to Washington, the address of 1600 \n     Pennsylvania Avenue was a small span of time for us in \n     comparison to the years that we spent closely affiliated with \n     this building.\n\n  She knew how to use this building. She was the first First Lady to \never undertake a major legislative effort--the Highway Beautification \nAct of 1965. Four decades later, her efforts still bloom on our \nhighways in every region of this country, and in this city.\n  She did what each of us, and all of us combined, come here to do--\nleave America better than we found it. Her achievement is all the more \nremarkable because it was a trying period in\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\nour Nation's history. A President had been assassinated, we were \ndivided by Vietnam, there were riots in our cities over desegregation.\n  But she understood nature belongs to every single one of us, and we \nhave an obligation to pay nature back. As President Johnson said, when \nhe signed the law:\n\n       There is a part of America which was here long before we \n     arrived, and will be here, if we preserve it, long after we \n     depart.\n\n  As Mrs. Johnson departs, we thank her for her preservation. We thank \nher for lining every corner of the country with flowers that we all \nenjoy.\n  And we thank her for teaching us that preservation and beauty go \nbeyond the wildflowers, to the need to deal with pollution and urban \ndecay and other problems that are too prevalent in our country and \nworld today.\n  Jill and I are thinking of her daughters, Lynda and Luci, their \nfamilies--and, in particular, Senator Robb, who served this body so \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9608-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING CAL RIPKEN, JR.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I honor and congratulate Cal \nRipken, Jr., on his induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Throughout \nhis storied 21-year career, Cal has been the epitome of an ``Iron \nMan,'' both on and off the field.\n  I watched Cal go from being unknown to being the best known baseball \nplayer from Baltimore since Babe Ruth. I was there on the last day at \nMemorial Stadium and the first day at Camden Yards, and I will watch \nhim when he is inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 29.\n  For we Orioles fans, it was never if we would be celebrating such an \namazing feat but when we would be celebrating it. All baseball fans \nknow about ``The Streak.'' We fans remember the victory lap he took \naround Camden Yards. And the countdown--where the numbers were \ndisplayed not just at the Camden Warehouse or in the Baltimore Sun but \nalso at my office in Hart Senate Office building: 2,632 consecutive \ngames, 431 home runs, 19 All-Star game starts, two American League \nGolden Glove awards, eight Silver Slugger Awards, two American League \nMVPs, and on and on.\n  But the most important thing we remember, which the numbers cannot \nfully reflect, is the strong, dependable presence of Cal--night after \nnight, day after day--through broken bones, through the wide range of \nemotions and pressures he experienced as a major leaguer, as a father, \nand as an active citizen in our community. Every game there he was--at \nthird base and shortstop, smiling, and doing his job. And doing it \nwell.\n  I remember that fateful night when Cal broke Lou Gehrig's long-\nstanding consecutive game record. To see that banner drop from 2130 to \n2131, and to hear the admiration and jubilation from the crowd in \nBaltimore, was something I will always remember. The sustained cheers \nwere neverending as Cal, urged by Rafael Palmeiro, took a lap around \nthe field. It was a proud night for the Ripken family, for the Orioles, \nand for Maryland. It was such a magical night. Families from all over \ncame with their kids to celebrate the ``Iron Man'' and his achievement. \nThe evening had as much dignity as the player himself.\n  Cal's accomplishments transcend well beyond the baseball field. His \ncharacter and demeanor is reflected in the success he experiences every \nday off the field. He shows up and gives maximum effort in every aspect \nof life. He puts his family above all, he is a consummate community \nactivist and is committed to living and teaching the ``Ripken Way.''\n  The ``Ripken Way'' is simple, really, but its wisdom is enough to \nbuild great players and bind generations together. It states: ``Keep it \nSimple, Explain the Why, Celebrate the Individual, and Make it Fun.'' \nThis style emphasizes clarity and simplicity, while also stressing \nempathy and interest.\n  I have certainly used the ``Ripken Way'' in my life and I believe \nmany Marylanders and Americans also use it. In Maryland, I can tell you \nthe ``Ripken Way'' is not just on our ballfields. It is in our \nfactories. It is in our homes. It is in the bread we serve our \nfamilies. It is in our hospitals in Baltimore, where Cal has \ncontributed so much to children in need of hope and a smile. And it is \nin our hearts today as we salute Cal Ripken, Jr., and this wonderful \nhonor he is receiving.\n  Cal applies the ``Ripken Way'' both on and off the ballfield, \nparticularly in his philanthropic work at the Cal Ripken Sr. \nFoundation. The Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation was established in 2001 in \nmemory of Cal's father. To this day, Cal carries the torch and legacy \nof his father. It is a legacy that has shaped Cal's life and a legacy \nthat has shaped the entire Orioles' organization.\n  By emphasizing work ethic, playing by the rules, putting the team \nfirst, and showing up every day, the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation serves \ndisadvantaged youth across the country. The foundation has even built a \nbeautiful state-of-the-art stadium in Aberdeen, MD, where kids can \nplay. Cal has put much of his own money into the foundation and the \nstadium's construction, while also working to secure private donations.\n  Cal may be a local boy, but he is no ordinary man. There is no \nquestion that Cal has earned his way into the Hall of Fame, the respect \nof the world, and the admiration of generations to come.\n  Baltimore may have lost the powerhouse company Bethlehem Steel, but \nit will always be home to ``Iron Man'' Cal Ripken, Jr. I congratulate \nCal on his stellar career, his strong work ethic, his commitment to \nfamily and community, and for the well-deserved, wonderful honor of \nbeing inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  While he has already achieved so much, I can't help but think that \nthe best is yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9608-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9608-S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING TONY GWYNN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Tony Gwynn on his induction into the National Baseball \nHall of Fame on July 29, 2007. During an illustrious 20-year career \nspent entirely with the San Diego Padres, Tony Gwynn was a consummate \nsportsman whose excellence at the plate earned him the recognition as \none of the greatest hitters in the game's long and storied history.\n  A native Californian, Tony Gwynn was a standout student-athlete at \nSan Diego State University, where he excelled on the school's baseball \nand basketball teams. Tony remains the only athlete in Western Athletic \nConference history to be recognized as an all-conference performer in \ntwo sports. His talents on the baseball diamond and the basketball \ncourt would lead to his selection by the San Diego Padres and the \nNational Basketball Association's San Diego Clippers on the same day in \n1981.\n  Tony Gwynn made his major league debut on July 19, 1982. Over the \ncourse of the next 20 years, he would compile one of the most \naccomplished resumes in baseball history. A remarkable model of \nconsistency, Tony batted over .300 for 19 consecutive seasons, leading \nto 3,141 career hits. A 15-time All-Star, he won 8 batting titles \nduring his career, tying the National League record held by Honus \nWagner. He is the only player in major league history to win four \nbatting titles in two separate decades. A true all-around player, Tony \nalso won five Gold Glove Awards in recognition of his defensive \nexcellence in the outfield.\n  In addition to his accomplishments on the field, Tony Gwynn has also \nbeen widely recognized for his passion and commitment to make a \npositive impact in the community. In 1995, he was presented the Branch \nRickey Award as the top community activist in Major League Baseball. He \nreceived the prestigious Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award in 1999 \nfor combining sportsmanship and community service with excellence on \nthe field. That same year, he was inducted into the World Sports \nHumanitarian Hall of Fame in Boise, ID.\n  Affectionately known as ``Mr. Padre,'' the Padres retired his No. 19 \njersey and named the street on which its beautiful downtown stadium is \nlocated ``Tony Gwynn Drive'' in his honor. Judging from his excellence \non and off the field, it is clear to see why Tony Gwynn is one of the \nmost admired and beloved sports figures in America.\n  As his teammates and fans would attest, Tony Gwynn is a deserving \ninductee into the National Baseball Hall\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nof Fame. Throughout his career in baseball, Tony has consistently \nconducted himself with integrity, character, and a commitment to \ncommunity service, all the qualities that embody the best ideals of our \nnational pastime.\n  I congratulate Tony Gwynn on his induction in the National Baseball \nHall of Fame and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9609-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   IN MEMORIAM: ELMA PHYLLIS STERLING\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of the late Elma Phyllis Sterling, a devoted mother \nand pioneering community leader in Fresno. Mrs. Sterling, a long-time \nFresno resident, passed away on July 4, 2007. She was 94 years old.\n  Elma Phyllis Sterling was born on November 22, 1914. She attended \nhigh school and college in New Orleans. Upon her graduation from Xavier \nUniversity, Mrs. Sterling served as a schoolteacher in Louisiana before \nmoving to Oakland, CA, in 1944. Three years later, she married her \nhusband, Feltus LeRoy Sterling, Jr. The couple eventually moved to \nFresno, where they founded a successful funeral home that remains \nfamily-operated today. They raised four children, Consuelo Sterling-\nMeux, Cynthia Sterling, Feltus Leroy Sterling, Jr., and Alphonse \nChristopher Sterling.\n  In addition to operating a family-owned business and raising their \nchildren, Mrs. Sterling generously offered her time, considerable \nenergy, and many talents to a number of civic organizations. At one \ntime, she was involved with 15 different civic causes that were \ncommitted to make her community a better place for everyone.\n  A former president of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People in Fresno, Mrs. Sterling led a group of local civil \nrights activists to Alabama to march with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nin 1963. She also played an instrumental role in the establishment of \nthe National Council of Negro Women in Fresno. Through her devotion to \ncommunity service, Mrs. Sterling demonstrated an admirable and \nunyielding commitment to civil rights and social justice.\n  A renowned and widely respected community leader, Mrs. Sterling made \nhistory when she became the first African American to hold a seat on \nthe Fresno City Council after she was called to public service by \nfilling a vacant seat on February 27, 1969. As she had done throughout \nher life, Mrs. Sterling handled her tenure on the Fresno Council with \nher usual grace, dignity, and keen sense of fairness and justice. \nAlthough she did not seek to keep her seat beyond her appointed term, \nit is fair to say that the impact of Mrs. Sterling's tenure on the \nFresno City Council is still being felt today. Mrs. Sterling's example \nhas inspired succeeding generations of Fresno residents to become \ninvolved in community service regardless of their race, creed, or \ncolor. In a fitting testament to her legacy, Cynthia Sterling, Elma \nPhyllis Sterling's daughter, became the first African-American woman to \nbe elected to the Fresno City Council in 2002.\n  Throughout a rich and fulfilling life, Elma Phyllis Sterling gave her \ngenuine compassion and precious humanity to protect, uplift, and \nempower those who are most often neglected in our society. Mrs. \nSterling has left behind a legacy of service and the admiration of \nthose whose lives she touched over the years. She will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9609-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DEBRA BROWN STEINBERG\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to recognize Debra \nBrown Steinberg for receiving an Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the \nNational Ethnic Coalition of Organizations. This award acknowledges her \nwork representing immigrants whose family members died in the September \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. \nAs a recipient of the award, Debra joins an elite group of \ndistinguished Medal of Honor recipients such as Lee Iacocca, former \nChrysler CEO and author of ``Where Have all the Leaders Gone?'', as \nwell as several former U.S. Presidents including Gerald Ford, George \nH.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.\n  Ms. Steinberg, moved with compassion, responded to the attacks by \nplaying a vital leadership role in creating the New York Lawyers for \nthe Public Interest 9/11 Project in early October 2001. She also played \nan important role in the creation of the 9/11 Victims Compensation \nFund, which awarded a total $7 billion to family members of individuals \nkilled in the 9/11 attacks, by drafting the New York City Bar \nAssociation's comments on the interim and final regulations for the \nfund. Since that time, she has worked selflessly to ensure that the \nfamily members of victims of 9/11 are cared for.\n  Nearly 6 years after the 9/11 attacks, Debra Brown Steinberg is still \nfighting for the families of victims of the terrorist attacks--\nspecifically immigrants without legal status in the United States who, \nafter facing the traumatic loss of a family member on 9/11, now face \npotential deportation. As our Nation continues to mourn the loss of \nfriends and family members who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ms. \nSteinberg has set an example for all of us by helping families that \nhave suffered greatly. Her selfless and persistent efforts have given \nthese immigrant families hope that one day they will be able to grieve \nfreely.\n  In addition to her work representing these immigrant families through \nthe 9/11 Compensation Fund process, she has helped to draft the \nSeptember 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act, S. 615, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Lautenberg on February 15, 2007.

Madam President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that celebrated its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 13 to 15, the residents of Sterling gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Sterling is a community in central North Dakota, only a short drive \nfrom Bismarck, the State capital. Sterling began as a railroad depot \nnamed Sixteenth Siding in 1873 and became home to settlers in 1880, who \nrenamed it Ballville. In 1882, the post office was established with \nOscar Ball serving as its postmaster, and the town then was renamed \nSterling.\n  Sterling has always been a quiet, small town, maintaining a \npopulation of fewer than 250 people since its founding. It has \nnonetheless been home to many notable establishments over the past 125 \nyears--the bank and hotel buildings still stand as a testament to the \nlife of the town over the past century and a quarter.\n  Though the town may be small, the anniversary celebration was not \nsmall by any means. Over 1,000 people attended the festivities, a crowd \ncomparable to the one at Sterling's centennial celebration 25 years \nago. The celebration included dances, live music, a quilt show, a \npickup mud run, and a parade, at which onlookers were showered with \nfree gifts and wowed by the 100 horses that walked together at the rear \nof the procession.\n  Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nSterling, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Sterling and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Sterling that \nhave helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this \nfine community is deserving of our recognition.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9610-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n               HONORING INTELLIGENT SPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Intelligent \nSpatial Technologies, a company founded by a tremendously innovative \nyoung entrepreneur from my home State of Maine. Intelligent Spatial \nTechnologies of Orono is a software and data company that was launched \nin 2003 by Christopher Frank.\n  The successful operation of Intelligent Spatial Technologies is a \nbeacon to all young entrepreneurs who dream of starting up their own \nbusiness. Mr. Frank founded Intelligent Spatial Technologies while a \nstudent at my alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono. While \nthere, he worked with an all-University of Maine alumni team to grow \nand develop an innovative idea he dreamed of to provide location-based \ninformation on-the-go. After graduating from the University of Maine, \nMr. Frank applied to become a tenant in the Target Technology \nIncubator. Supported by the University of Maine, the Community College \nSystem, and the Maine Small Business Development Centers, the Incubator \noffers early-stage tech-based companies the training and tools \nnecessary to make their ventures a success.\n  With the help of Target Technology Incubator and over a million \ndollars in Federal and State research grants, Mr. Frank was able to \nrealize his idea and transform it into a new, vibrant business in the \nState of Maine. Today, Intelligent Spatial Technologies is a leading \ndeveloper in the fast-growing industry of location-based services, \nwhich is a particularly remarkable achievement when one considers that \nthe current market value for GPS-related products is an estimated $12 \nbillion.\n  Notably, Intelligent Spatial Technologies was able to successfully \nmarket its first product, the iPointer, to the University of Maine. The \niPointer is an advanced device that empowers users to explore a defined \narea by pointing at landmarks and receiving feedback in the form of \ntext and audio-visual images over a wireless Internet connection. The \nUniversity of Maine used the product to provide prospective students \nwith informative, custom tours to familiarize them with the university \ncampus. The iPointer is the cornerstone of Intelligent Spatial \nTechnologies and a unique contribution to location-based services \nindustry. It is terrific to see that Mr. Frank wants to expand the use \nof his creative technology to more everyday uses, such as use with \ndigital cameras, cellular phones, and hand-held computers.\n  Before concluding, I would be remiss not to mention that Christopher \nFrank was named Maine's Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration in 2006. His cutting-edge technology and \nstellar leadership is highly respected in the Bangor community. Not \nonly does Mr. Frank show leadership as president and founder of \nIntelligent Spatial Technologies, but he also is a founder of FUSION \nBangor, an organization which aims to engage young people in community \nleadership through forums, meetings, and similar events. Mr. Frank has \nshown that no matter what your age, you can have an impact on both the \nbusiness community and the local community.\n  The State of Maine is incredibly proud of Intelligent Spatial \nTechnologies. To see a college student realize his business dream--\nwhile still a student, no less--is always inspiring. I wish Christopher \nFrank and everyone at Intelligent Spatial Technologies continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9610-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9610-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9610-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND RELATED \nMEASURES DEALING WITH THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR--PM \n                                   22\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United State's, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. l622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to phase \nout the use of mercury in the manufacture of chlorine and caustic soda, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I reintroduce legislation initially \ninspired by an indepth report published in late 2005 by the Chicago \nTribune that highlighted the extent of mercury contamination in the \nfish eaten by the American people.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause serious developmental \nproblems in children, ranging from severe birth defects to mental \nretardation. As many as 630,000 children born annually in the U.S. are \nat risk of neurological afflictions related to mercury. In adults, \nmercury can cause problems affecting vision, motor skills, blood \npressure and fertility. As many as 10 percent of women in the U.S. of \nchildbearing age have mercury in their blood at a level that could put \na baby at risk.\n  Sampling conducted by the Tribune showed surprisingly high levels of \nmercury concentrations in freshwater and saltwater fish purchased by \nChicago area consumers, fish like tuna, swordfish, orange roughy, and \nwalleye. The Tribune also reported on how existing programs at the Food \nand Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have \nfailed to adequately test and evaluate mercury levels in fish.\n  For all Americans, especially pregnant women and other at-risk \ngroups, there are risks to eating fish with high mercury levels. That \nis why we need to work harder to get at the root causes of mercury \ncontamination. In the short term, some have proposed strategies that \ninclude eating less fish, or issuing consumption advisories, or \nprinting labels on tuna cans, or posting placards at the supermarket. \nEach of those strategies have their respective merits, but if we are \nreally serious about making fish safer to eat, we need to actually \nreduce the amount of mercury in fish, and that means reducing the \namount of mercury used in industry.\n  When policymakers focus on addressing mercury sources, often coal-\nfired power plants and incinerators are at the top of the list. I think \nit is important that we not overlook other sources, however, where new \npolicies could yield notable mercury reductions in the short term using \nmethods that are achievable and affordable. One such source is the \nchlor-alkali industry.\n  Chlor-alkali facilities manufacture chlorine gas and caustic soda, \nimportant chemicals that serve as the building blocks of many of the \nproducts and plastics essential to modem everyday life. For more than \n100 years, mercury has been a key component in the chlorine process. \nSince 1974, however, about 115 plants worldwide have converted to \nbetter technologies such as membrane and diaphragm cells. Today in the \nU.S. more than 90 percent of the chlor-alkali industry has switched \nfrom using mercury to using these alternative catalysts. Moreover, of \nthe 8 plants in the U.S. that still use mercury, 3 are in the process \nof stopping. The remaining 5, however, have made no such commitment. It \nis also worth noting that in 2005 alone, the 5 uncommitted mercury \nusing plants released more than 4,400 pounds of mercury into the air, \non average four times the average mercury releases of a standard coal-\nfired power plant.\n  The time has come to finish these upgrades and end the use of mercury \nin the chlor-alkali process, especially since these remaining plants \nrank among the largest mercury emitters in their respective states.\n  The bill I introduce today, the Missing Mercury in Manufacturing \nMonitoring and Mitigation Act, or M5 Act, prohibits using mercury cells \nin the chlorine or caustic soda manufacturing process by the year 2012. \nThe M5 Act also puts procedures in place by mid-year 2008 to track and \nreport mercury input and output in the chlor-alkali industry. The \nevidence suggests that between 2000 and 2004, the industry could not \naccount for more than 130 tons of mercury. The EPA calls this ``an \nenigma.'' The M5 Act addresses this enigma by tightening up mercury \ntracking requirements. My bill also establishes an advisory committee \nto study and recommend methods for transfer and long-term storage of \nmercury from closed or closing facilities. And the bill directs the \nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Register to conduct a health \nassessment at those facilities that still use mercury after 2008.\n  It is important to point out that there are alternatives to mercury \nin the chlor-alkali process, more than 100 plants worldwide have \nconverted to better technologies. We also know that these alternatives \nare not cost-prohibitive. Statistics compiled in a recent report by the \ngroup Oceana demonstrate that conversion costs are substantially \nsimilar to the cost of the continued use of mercury, for example, the \ncost of waste disposal, treatment, monitoring, fines, and higher energy \nconsumption associated with using the old technology.\n  If there were simply no alternatives to mercury for this industry, if \nother technologies had not been proven on a commercial scale, or if \nswitching from mercury was simply too expensive, then I could \nunderstand if there were strong arguments against this legislation. But \nhere we actually have a situation where mercury use could actually be \nphased out within a rather short period of time, improving the health \nof children and families. So the choice is whether we want to wait \nanother decade and hope that improvements happen, or whether we want to \nensure that mercury is phased out beginning today. I hope my colleagues \nwill choose the latter, and I urge their support of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1820. A bill to better provide for compensation for certain \npersons injured in the course of employment at the Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory in California; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nenable hundreds of former Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers or \ntheir survivors\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nto receive compensation for illnesses caused by exposure to radiation \nand other toxic substances.\n  These benefits have long been denied them due to flaws in the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Injury Compensation Act of 2000.\n  This bill fulfills the intent of Congress when it approved the act, \nproviding compensation and care for nuclear program workers who \nsuffered severe health problems caused by on-the-job exposure to \nradiation.\n  Specifically, this bill will provide a special status designation, \nunder the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act, to \nSanta Susana Field Laboratory employees, so they can receive the \nbenefits they deserve.\n  The bill would extend the ``special exposure cohort'' status to \nDepartment of Energy employees, Department of Energy contract \nemployees, or atomic weapons employees who worked at the Santa Susana \nField Laboratory for at least 250 days prior to January 1, 2006.\n  This revision will provide the act's benefits to any of those workers \nwho contracted a radiation-linked cancer due to their employment at the \nSanta Susana Field Laboratory.\n  Workers at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory played a significant \nrole in keeping our Nation secure during the Cold War. They helped \ndevelop our nuclear weapons program, a cornerstone of our national \ndefense.\n  Sadly, many workers of this era were exposed to radiation on a \nregular basis. But the records are incomplete and inaccurate. Some \nrecords show only estimated levels of exposure for workers, and are \nimprecise. In other cases, if there were records kept, they can't be \nfound today.\n  Many Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers were not aware of the \nhazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no preventative equipment like \nrespirators, gloves, or body suits were provided to workers.\n  More than 600 claims for compensation have been filed by Santa Susana \nField Lab workers. Mr. President, 90 percent of those have been denied \ndue to lack of documentation, or inability to prove exposure \nthresholds.\n  Santa Susana Field Lab workers and their families now face the burden \nof having to reconstruct exposure scenarios that existed more than 40 \nyears ago, in most cases with no documentation.\n  The case of my constituent, Betty Reo, provides a stunning example of \nwhy this legislation is necessary.\n  Ms. Reo's husband, Cosmo Reo, worked at the Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory as an instrumentation mechanic from April 18, 1957, until \nMay 17, 1960. Cosmo worked in the rocket testing pits and was exposed \nto hydrazine, trichlorethylene and other cancer-causing chemicals which \nattack the lungs, bladder and kidneys.\n  Cosmo died of renal failure in 1980. Ms. Reo applied for benefits \nunder the Energy Employees Occupational Injury Compensation Act. She \nhas been trying to reconstruct the exposure scenarios under which her \nhusband worked, but without adequate documentation, which is virtually \nnonexistent, she has repeatedly been denied benefits.\n  This bill would help people like Betty Reo.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting these injustices and \ncutting through the ``red tape'' that prevents Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory workers, and their families, from receiving fair \ncompensation.\n  For many, such as Ms. Reo, time is running out. We can no longer \nafford to delay, and this bill provides a straightforward solution to \nfix a broken system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF MEMBER OF SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees \n     Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 \n     U.S.C. 7384l(14)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) The employee was so employed for a number of work \n     days aggregating at least 250 work days before January 1, \n     2006, by the Department of Energy or a Department of Energy \n     contractor or subcontractor at the Santa Susana Field \n     Laboratory in California.''.\n       (b) Reapplication.--A claim that an individual qualifies, \n     by reason of section 3621(14)(D) of the Energy Employees \n     Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (as \n     added by subsection (a) of this Act), for compensation or \n     benefits under such Act shall be considered for compensation \n     or benefits notwithstanding any denial of any other claim for \n     compensation with respect to such individual.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1823. A bill to set the United States on track to ensure children \nare ready to learn when they begin kindergarten; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, supporting our children and early \nchildhood education are critical to keeping America competitive. Today \nI am pleased to introduce the Ready to Learn Act, legislation that will \nhelp families in New York and across the country by preparing children \nfor kindergarten. I am pleased my colleague Senator Bond, a long-time \nleader in early childhood development, has partnered with me in \nintroducing this essential legislation.\n  Since my time as a law student, I have worked to spread information \nabout the importance of care and education for our children, especially \nour youngest children. It is critical that we provide them with every \npossible opportunity to learn, grow, and develop early on, not just \nonce they start kindergarten, but before they arrive. This is a cause I \nhave believed in and fought for over the past 35 years, as an advocate, \na lawyer, First Lady, a Senator, and most important of all, as a \nmother.\n  The Ready to Learn Act will help prepare children for kindergarten by \nproviding funding for States to establish high-quality early learning \nprograms to promote school readiness for four-year-olds in their State. \nStates will apply for funding through a competitive process to \nestablish and administer voluntary preschool programs; this legislation \nwill allow governors to build on pre-existing early childhood systems. \nSchools, child care entities, Head Start programs, or other community \nproviders of pre-kindergarten programs are all eligible for funding.\n  To ensure high-quality programs that properly prepare children to be \nready to learn, State plans will require qualified teachers, a \ndevelopmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate early \nlearning curriculum and support for professional development.\n  Research has shown the early years are critical in a child's \ndevelopment and that pre-kindergarten education offers benefits that \nextend through the first years of school and beyond. Children who \nattend high-quality pre-k programs are less likely to be held back a \ngrade or to need special education, and they are more likely to \ngraduate from high school. They also have higher earnings as adults and \nare less likely to become dependent on welfare or involved in crime.\n  While some parents can afford high-quality pre-kindergarten \nopportunities for their children, so many hard working families simply \ncan't. As a result, in today's current education system, it is not \nunusual for children to arrive at kindergarten already behind their \npeers. Nearly 50 percent of all kindergarten teachers report that at \nleast half of their students come to school with problems that hinder \ntheir success. One in every six kindergartners needs specialized one-\non-one tutoring or special instruction in a small group. Each year, \nmore than 200,000 children repeat kindergarten.\n  Back when I was First Lady, I hosted a White House Conference on \nEarly Childhood Development and Learning, where expert after expert \nemphasized the importance of these early years. A child who arrives at \nkindergarten ready to learn has a far greater chance of excelling, not \nonly in his or her early years, but far into his academic career. \nStudies show that children who learn the names and sounds of letters \nbefore entering kindergarten are 20 times more likely to read simple \nwords by the end of kindergarten than children who enter kindergarten \nnot knowing the letters of the alphabet. Children who do not know their \nletters prior to kindergarten too often fail to catch up with their \npeers who do. Eighty-eight percent of children who\n\n[[Page S9617]]\n\nare poor readers in first grade remain poor readers by the fourth \ngrade. Children who are not at least modestly skilled readers by the \nend of third grade are unlikely to graduate from high school.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have seen what happens when we invest \nin our children. We already know that for every one dollar we spend on \nearly childhood education, we reap seven dollars as a society. I have \nseen what happens when caring adults come together and make the \ncommitment to ensuring that our children can fulfill their God-given \npotential.\n  I saw it back in Arkansas when we brought HIPPY to America to teach \nparents how they could educate their children. We taught them about the \nimportance of reading to their children, and using household objects to \nteach basic lessons.\n  I have seen it in visiting Head Start programs where children were \nlearning to read, learning to count and solve problems, learning to \nshare and interact with others and thrive in a structured environment.\n  We are seeing it around the country in States that have already \nstarted investing in early childhood programs. The Ready to Learn Act \nwill support and build on that success.\n  Supporting our children and early childhood education are critical to \nkeeping America competitive. It is my hope that my colleagues will join \nSenator Bond and I in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1824. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative under the Medicare \nprogram to assess and report on health care quality in hospitals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Hospital \nQuality Report Card Act, a quality-focused initiative that will \nactively engage all relevant stakeholder groups--patients, providers, \nadministrators, and payers--and increase availability of information \nabout the quality of health care services in local hospitals and health \nsystems.\n  We know that overall performance in our Nation's hospitals can vary \ntremendously, and is mediocre at best in many institutions. The \nacademic literature has documented serious issues in health care \nquality for treatment of a number of conditions, including cardiac \narrhythmias, hip replacements, and alcohol dependence to name just a \nfew. But discussions of health care quality are not limited to academic \nexercises; patients and their families experience medical errors and \nsubstandard hospital care every day. Just last month, the L.A. Times \nreported an extreme case involving Ms. Edith Isabel Rodriguez. Ms. \nRodriguez, a 43-year old American woman with a perforated bowel, \nsuffered an excruciating and possibly preventable death, after lying \nunattended on the floor of an emergency room for 45 minutes. Our \nNation's hospitals can do better and must do better.\n  One step towards improving health care quality is collecting, \nanalyzing, and reporting on health care quality, using measures that \nhave been developed, validated, and accepted by the medical community. \nNot only will such measures assist hospitals by identifying problem \nareas and facilitating monitoring for improvement, but the transparency \nthrough public reporting will also help consumers and payers make \ninformed decisions about where to obtain health services.\n  The Hospital Quality Report Card Act grants the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services the power to collect hospital information related to \nthe staffing levels of nurses and health professionals, the \naccreditation of hospitals, the quality of care for vulnerable \npopulations, the availability of specialty services and intensive care \nunits, hospital acquired infections, measures of crowding in emergency \nrooms, and other indicators of quality care. This information--focused \non health care effectiveness, safety, timeliness, efficiency, patient-\ncenteredness, and equity--will be electronically accessible to the \npublic. The report card initiative builds upon current work at the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as initiatives in a \nnumber States including my own home State of Illinois. I am proud to \nreport that I was the primary sponsor of the Illinois Hospital Report \nCard Act that passed into law in 2003 and took effect in 2004.\n  Our Nation's reputation of having one of the best health care systems \nin the world needs to be restored, and this won't happen until we can \nassure the American people that our hospitals are doing a better job \noffering top-notch quality care. The Hospital Quality Report Card \nInitiative will help by expanding and reporting quality measurement, \nwhich will provide an incentive for hospitals to do better and valuable \ninformation to patients and consumers. I ask that you support the \nHospital Quality Report Card Act and help my efforts to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Casey, Mr. Tester, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Mr. Carper, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Obama, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Harkin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1825.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire prompt payment to pharmacies under part D, to restrict pharmacy \nco-branding on prescription drug cards issued under such part, and to \nprovide guidelines for Medication Therapy Management Services programs \noffered by prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans under such part; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, implementation of the Medicare \nprescription drug plan has helped provide prescription drug coverage \nfor millions of Medicare beneficiaries who previously did not have \naccess to medications. Many seniors are now paying less for \nprescription drugs and the savings for the prescription drug program \nare even greater than expected. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, and health care providers worked together to plan and \nimplement this program and from the beginning, pharmacists played a \nsignificant role in making this benefit successful. Pharmacists \nassisted their Medicare patients in the selection and enrollment \nprocess and filled prescriptions for patients, regardless of the \nguarantee of timely reimbursement. Pharmacists continue to be diligent \nin serving their patients and providing much-needed medications, \ndespite financial difficulties they have encountered in providing these \nservices.\n  We are introducing a bill today to assist pharmacists as they \ncontinue to serve their patients and as they help to continue the \nsuccess of the Medicare drug benefit. This bill will allow pharmacists \nto achieve efficiencies in reimbursement for the products they provide \nto Medicare beneficiaries. This is especially important to the small, \nrural independent pharmacies in my State. This legislation will also \nprovide incentives for pharmacists and other providers to help \nbeneficiaries better use their medications, adhere to their drug \nregimens, and utilize cost saving medication therapy management \nprograms.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation that will help continue the \nsuccess of the Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, earlier today I joined with Senators \nCochran and Enzi to introduce the Pharmacist Access and Recognition in \nMedicare Act of 2007. This is bipartisan legislation that will help \nensure patients have access to local pharmacies.\n  I am concerned that the Medicare Modernization Act that was enacted \nin 2003 failed to sufficiently ensure Medicare patients would have \nquality access to prescription medicines available at local pharmacies.\n  The new drug program took effect at the beginning of 2006. We now \nknow that during that year over 1,100 community pharmacies across the \ncountry closed their doors according to the National Community \nPharmacists Association.\n  It is critical to me that patients living in small towns throughout \nArkansas and across America have access to community pharmacies.\n  While I believe major reforms need to be made in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, I believe that the bipartisan bill I \nintroduced with Senator Cochran and Enzi today is an achievable first \nstep in making the Medicare drug benefit work better for patients and \npharmacists who are local front line health care providers.\n  This bill will ensure that pharmacies are paid on a timely basis for \nprescriptions that are filled for Medicare beneficiaries. It can take a \nmonth for pharmacies to be paid now, and this bill will ensure that \npharmacies get paid electronically for clean claims within 10 business \ndays.\n  Seniors should have a choice concerning what pharmacy they use. Our \nbill codifies regulations ensuring that Medicare drug cards are not \ncobranded with the name of a pharmacy, leaving beneficiaries under the \nimpression that the card may only be good at a single, large chain \npharmacy.\n  Cards could be cobranded in the first year of the program. \nRegulations prohibit that happening this year, but our bill ensures \nthis will not be a problem in the future.\n  The bill will also help ensure that medicines are used appropriately. \nPharmacists are the best trained providers in our health care system to \nensure prescribed medications are used correctly. The bill creates a 2 \nyear community-based medication therapy management demonstration \nprogram using pharmacists to provide services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1828. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to conduct a study of the feasibility of increasing \nthe consumption in the United States of certain ethanol-blended \ngasoline; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a small but \nimportant bill that seeks to improve the quality of the air we breathe \nand increase the level of public involvement under the Clean Air Act.\n  The senior Senator from Rhode Island joined me in sponsoring an \nidentical version of this bill as an amendment to the energy bill. \nUnfortunately, there was an objection to clearing that amendment for \nunknown reasons.\n  The objection was a surprise, particularly given the widespread \nsupport across a variety of industries and advocacy groups. In fact, \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council and American\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\nLung Association sent Senator Reed and me a letter of support.\n  Under current law, the Clean Air Act allows a petition for a new \nrenewable fuel or renewable fuel additive, including mid-level ethanol \nblends, to be approved without EPA taking any action whatsoever, not \nasking for public comment, not conducting studies on the safety or \nemissions impacts and not reviewing existing emissions or safety \nstudies. In fact, current law provides that a petition is deemed \napproved even if EPA fails to act or make a determination one way or \nanother.\n  Environmental law and the Clean Air Act specifically, is premised \nupon public input and involvement. It is critical that this section of \nthe Act, as elsewhere, provide for adequate stakeholder involvement. My \nbill would force EPA to give public notice and seek public comment from \nall interested persons on any petition for a new renewable fuel or \nrenewable fuel additive.\n  Safeguarding air quality is critical, but guaranteeing that the \nengines that consumers rely on is important as well. Studies done by \nAustralia's EPA found that mid-level ethanol blends can cause the \nfollowing problems with motor vehicle and small, off-road engines: \nfailure of exhaust components, for example catalyst, due to heat/\ndurability, engine damage and seizure, engine stalling and stopping, \nfailure of engine cut-off switches, unexpected engagement of cutting \nblades/chains, and fuel leaks and blockage of fuel lines. My bill \ndirects EPA, with DOE's and USDA's assistance, to study whether the use \nof higher ethanol blends pose safety, air quality, or engine \noperability concerns in motor vehicle and nonroad engines, and \nequipment.\n  Ethanol proponents should support this bill. The ethanol industry \ncannot afford to have consumers turn against their product if higher \nlevels of ethanol blends cause their snowmobile, chainsaw, or boat \nengine to shut down. If EPA's study shows that these higher blends are \nsafe for all engines, then the ethanol industry will benefit from the \nstudy.\n  This bill is about good Government and transparent Government. EPA \nshould not be permitted to approve these petitions ``in the dark of \nnight,'' without public participation.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, like the amendment that Senator \nReed and I offered during the energy bill, will simply make sure that \nEPA carries out its duty to protect human health and the environment, \nincrease the public's role under the Clean Air Act, and shed light on a \ncurrently private process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Shelby:\n  S. 1829. A bill to reauthorize programs under the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to introduce the Protect Our Children First \nAct of 2007, which will reauthorize funding for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, NCMEC through fiscal year 2013, and \nincrease Federal support and coordination to help NCMEC programs to \nfind missing children across the Nation. I am glad that Senator Hatch \nhas joined me in introducing this bill, along with Senators Lincoln and \nShelby. As members of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, we \nhave all worked together on numerous pieces of legislation to protect \nthe safety and welfare of our children, and I thank them for their \ncontinued leadership and for joining me in introducing this bill.\n  Just a few months ago, we commemorated the 25th National Missing \nChildren's Day, when our Nation particularly remembers our commitment \nto work together in locating and recovering missing children. It pains \nus all to see on TV, in the newspapers or on milk cartons photo after \nphoto of missing children from various comers of our country. As a \nfather and grandfather, I know that an abducted child is the worst \nnightmare. Unfortunately, it is a nightmare that happens all too often. \nIndeed, the Justice Department estimates that 2,200 children are \nreported missing each day. There are approximately 114,600 attempted \nstranger abductions every year, with 3,000 to 5,000 of those attempts \nsucceeding. Experts estimate that children and youth comprise between \n85 percent and 90 percent of missing person reports. These families \ndeserve the assistance of the American people and a helping hand from \nthe Congress and from Federal agencies.\n  As the Nation's top resource center for child protection, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children spearheads national \nefforts to locate and recover missing children and raises public \nawareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation and sexual \nexploitation. NCMEC works to make our children safer by being a \nnational voice and advocate for those too young to vote or speak up for \ntheir own rights. The center operates under a Congressional mandate and \nworks in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to coordinate the efforts \nof law enforcement officers, social service agencies, elected \nofficials, judges, prosecutors, educators, the U.S. Marshals Service, \nand the public and private sectors to break the cycle of violence that \nhistorically has perpetuated these needless crimes against children. \nChild advocates like John Walsh, who worked hard in helping Congress \nenact the National Center's charter, also continue to support the \ncenter's vital work.\n  The center's professionals have disturbingly busy jobs, they have \nworked on more than 127,700 cases of missing and exploited children \nsince its 1984 founding, helping to recover more than 110,200 children. \nThe center raised its recovery rate from 64 percent in the 1990s to 96 \npercent today. The center has set up a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour \ntelephone hotline to take reports about missing children and clues that \nmight lead to their recovery, a National Child Pornography Tipline to \nhandle calls from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of \nchildren through the production and distribution of pornography, and a \nCyberTipline to process online leads from individuals reporting the \nsexual exploitation of children. It has taken the lead in circulating \nmillions of photographs of missing children, and it serves as a vital \nresource for the 17,000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the \nNation in the search for missing children and in the pursuit of \nadequate child protection.\n\n  The center has also developed a ``Cold Case Unit'' within the Missing \nChildren Division that focuses on long-term missing children cases. By \nusing age progression technology, NCMEC has recovered 741 missing \nchildren. NCMEC forensic artists have also identified 24 missing \nchildren by using facial reconstructions of unidentified remains.\n  In order to help the center solve these long-term cases, Section 5 of \nthis bill would allow an Inspector General to provide staff support to \nNCMEC for the purpose of conducting reviews of inactive case files to \ndevelop recommendations for further investigation. The Inspector \nGeneral community has one of the most diverse and talented criminal \ninvestigative cadres in the Federal Government. A vast majority of \nthese special agents have come from traditional law enforcement \nagencies, and they are highly trained and extremely capable of dealing \nwith complex criminal cases.\n  Under current law, an Inspector General's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. Our \nbill would allow an Inspector General to permit criminal investigators \nunder his or her supervision to review cold case files, so long as \ndoing so would not interfere with normal duties. An Inspector General \nwould not conduct actual investigations, and any Inspector General \nwould only commit staff when the office's mission-related workloads \npermitted. At no time would these activities be allowed to conflict \nwith or delay the stated missions of an Inspector General.\n  The Protect Our Children First Act also gives the Center better tools \nfor working in coordination with Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies to find missing children. This bill would provide \nanalytical and technical support to assist law enforcement agencies in \nsearching public databases to identify missing children and to locate \nabductors and would facilitate the deployment of the National Emergency \nChild Locator Center to assist in locating children in times of \nnational disasters. In addition, the bill would allow\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\nNCMEC to work in conjunction with the FBI to provide fitness \ndeterminations based on criminal history of volunteers in child-serving \norganizations and track the incidence of attempted child abductions to \nreport any links or patterns to law enforcement agencies.\n  NCMEC is headquartered in Alexandria, VA, and operates branch offices \nin five other locations throughout the country to provide hands-on \nassistance to families of missing children, advocating legislative \nchanges to better protect children, conducting an array of prevention \nand awareness programs, and motivating individuals to become personally \ninvolved in child-protection issues. It has also grown into an \ninternational organization, establishing the International Division of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which has been \nworking to fulfill the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \nInternational Child Abduction. The international division provides \nassistance to parents, law enforcement, attorneys, nonprofit \norganizations, and other concerned individuals who are seeking \nassistance in preventing or resolving international child abductions.\n  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with an annual DOJ grant, \nwhich expires after fiscal year 2008. We must act now to extend its \nauthorization so that it can continue to help keep children safe and \nfamilies intact around the Nation. There is so much more to be done to \nensure the safety of our children, and the legislation we introduce \ntoday will help the center in its efforts to prevent crimes that are \ncommitted against them.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should be \nmoved easily through the Senate and the House. The children we seek to \nprotect through legislation like this should not be used as pawns by \ngroups who would play politics by saddling such efforts with \ncontroversial measures. I applaud the ongoing work of the center and \nhope both the Senate and the House will promptly pass this bill to show \nour support for the NCMEC to continue to find our missing children and \nto protect exploited children across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the health of Americans through the \ngradual elimination of tobacco products; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious and deadly \nhealth issue. I am talking about tobacco, a scourge on our society.\n  Smoking kills. There is no such thing as a safe cigarette. These are \nnot mere platitudes. They are the deadly truth. Tobacco kills more \nAmericans each year than alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroin, homicide, \nsuicide, car accidents, fire and AIDS combined.\n  My colleague Senator Kennedy has proposed dealing with this shocking \nstatistic by having the Food and Drug Administration regulate tobacco. \nI suggest my colleagues ask themselves: What will it mean to have \ncigarette and tobacco products regulated by the FDA?\n  The FDA is the gold standard among public health regulators the world \nover. For the past century, the FDA has protected the public, from \nfilthy conditions in meat packing plants to thalidomide, which caused \nthousands of birth defects in Western Europe. The FDA's constant \nvigilance is not just an historical artifact. It seems like every day \nthere is something new for the FDA to protect us from. The headlines \nbehind me show how we have come to depend on the FDA every day to \nprotect us and our children from poisons that could harm or even kill \nus.\n  It is evident that the FDA is overworked and underfunded. We, as a \nnation, currently ask the FDA to be responsible for so many things: \nensuring that new drugs and medical devices are safe and effective; \nsafeguarding the Nation's food supply; regulating the manufacture and \ndistribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals; \nand, increasing the security of our blood supply.\n  In each of these key activities, the role of the FDA is to protect \nour health. In providing that protection, the FDA examines key \nscientific facts and weighs the balance of benefit to our society and \nrisk to our health. It is incomprehensible to me to extend that \ncritical role to an FDA risk/benefit analysis of tobacco and \ncigarettes.\n  I will say it again: Smoking kills. There is no such thing as a \n``safe'' cigarette. Any public statement by the FDA under their current \nauthority would necessitate the finding that there is no benefit to the \nuse of cigarettes, only harm.\n  The Kennedy-Cornyn bill would establish the FDA as the regulator for \ntobacco products. However, the bill explicitly states that the FDA will \nnot be permitted to prohibit the sale of any tobacco product to adults. \nThat is not true regulation. The bill would gut the authority that \nCongress has bestowed and staunchly defended for the FDA, the authority \nto remove health threats from the marketplace. This approach is so \nflawed that I believe the bill cannot be fixed.\n  Even having the FDA review and approve cigarettes sends mixed and \nconfusing messages to the public, creating the sense that cigarettes \nare safe or can be made safer. The FDA cannot be put in the position of \napproving a product which years of science and the personal experience \nof far too many Americans has shown to be dangerous. Simply put, \ntobacco kills people. Piling on regulations and bureaucracy won't \nchange that.\n  I commend my colleague Senator Kennedy for trying to do something \nabout the evil of tobacco. But this bill is a dinosaur. It has been \nintroduced year after year, with barely any changes. In fact, the bill \nwould have FDA issue a regulation from 1996 completely intact. A \nregulation, I might add, that was overturned by the Supreme Court. But \nthat is beside the point. Instead of resurrecting broken, outdated \nlegislation, we should be aiming to make tobacco extinct.\n  While some in the tobacco industry claim to share my views on \nsmoking, I do not believe they have actually bought in to the idea of \ngetting people to stop using tobacco. A case in point is the new $350 \nmillion facility Philip Morris has built in Richmond, VA. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nclassified ad from the journal Science.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this ad calls for the recruitment of \nscientists to work at this facility, studying how to ``develop relevant \nexposure models'' for smoking related diseases. Or to do large scale \nepidemiology studies on ``the cause of cigarette smoke-related \ndiseases.'' Here I thought the cause of cigarette smoke-related \ndiseases was smoking. Silly me.\n  Clearly, Philip Morris believes it will still be able to operate \nunder the Kennedy bill. It will be business as usual for the Marlboro \nMan, and more Americans will die needlessly.\n  Trying to make cigarettes safer through a billion-dollar bureaucracy \nis a waste of time and money. The right approach is to get people to \nstop smoking, or better yet, to never start.\n  The key failing of the Kennedy dinosaur legislation is that it will \nnot reduce smoking. In 2004, this bill did pass the Senate, as part of \nFSC-ETI. The Congressional Budget Office, in scoring the Senate-passed \nbill, examined the tobacco provisions. I suggest my colleagues study \nthat score carefully. CBO suggested there would be essentially no \nreduction in adult smoking, and only a 12.5 percent reduction in youth \nsmoking. The bill assesses user fees in excess of $450 million a year. \nThere are currently 2.7 million youth smokers. When you do the math, it \ncomes out to nearly $1,500 per year per youth smoker to achieve these \nreductions. I don't know if you've talked to any teenagers recently, \nbut they are pretty entrepreneurial. I bet a lot of them would quit \nsmoking if you just paid them to give it up, or even to stay off the \nstuff in the first place.\n\n  In another example of very little bang for very big bucks, a recent \nInstitute of Medicine report from May says that if we keep doing what \nwe are doing, we will reduce smoking from the current 20 percent of the \npopulation to about 15 percent over the next 20 years. If we do \neverything in the report, which is basically the Kennedy bill plus a \nnumber of other steps, some of which maybe unconstitutional, we might \nreduce it to 10 percent. At an unknown, but likely very high, cost.\n  This bill can't be fixed. I know we can do better. We just have to \nthink bigger. We must win the war on tobacco, not sign a peace treaty \nwith Phillip Morris.\n  I have developed my own tobacco legislation that would truly have an \nimpact on the number of smokers in this country, and I am pleased to \nintroduce today the Help End Addiction to Lethal Tobacco Habits or \nHEALTH Act.\n  My bill contains a novel cap-and-trade program--guaranteeing that\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\nfewer people suffer the deadly consequences of smoking, while providing \nflexibility in how those reductions are achieved.\n  Cap-and-trade programs have a proven track record in the \nenvironmental arena. In the 1980s, lakes and forests were dying from \nacid rain. The acid rain was caused by emissions of sulfur and nitrogen \noxides from power generation at electrical plants. The Clean Air Act \namendments of 1990 instituted a system of allowances for emissions of \nsulfur and nitrogen oxides that could be used, banked, traded or sold \nfreely on the open market. The number of allowances decreased each \nyear. This system achieved the desired results faster and at lower cost \nthan had been anticipated. The cap-and-trade program for sulfur and \nnitrogen oxides has made dramatic differences in our air quality over \nthe past 15 years, and is a resounding success. I propose to carry this \nmarket-oriented system over to the tobacco control arena. Although this \nhas never been tried for a health issue, I think it will work.\n  My legislation will contain a cap-and-trade system for shrinking the \nsize of the tobacco market over the next 20 years. Smoking reductions \nare guaranteed, and companies are given time and flexibility to make \nthe reductions or divest. In addition, small tobacco companies would \nhave a valuable asset in their allocations, leveling the playing field \na bit between the smaller and larger industry members. Finally, and I \nthink very importantly, public health groups could buy and retire \nallowances to achieve the reductions in tobacco use even faster than \nspecified in my bill. I would like to issue a challenge today to those \ngroups, use your clout to help me make this work. Stand with me to \nfight tobacco and protect the health of all Americans.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the FDA approves cures, not \npoisons. Forcing the FDA to regulate tobacco but not letting them ban \nit, as my colleague Senator Kennedy proposes, would undermine the long \nhistory of the agency protecting and promoting the public health.\n  In closing, every day, we hear about some new problem the FDA faces \nin protecting our health. From contaminated seafood to tainted \ntoothpaste, this agency is in dire need of congressional support to \ncarry out its mission. We should be focusing our efforts on increasing \nthe number of inspectors, and on renewing the expiring drug and device \nuser fee laws.\n  I ask my colleagues to think hard about what they are proposing when \nthey suggest FDA regulation is the way to defeat tobacco. My record is \nclear when it comes to tobacco. I am no friend of big tobacco and I \nhave never taken a dime of tobacco company money for my campaigns. I \ndon't intend to start now. But I absolutely reject the notion that the \nway to show you're ``for kids'' and ``against Big Tobacco'' is by \nsending the Nation's premier public health watchdog out to fight for \nsafety with one hand tied behind its back. We must not mandate the FDA \nseal of approval on a deadly product that has no health benefit \nwhatsoever. We can do better.

A bill to require periodic reports on claims related to acts \nof terrorism against Americans perpetrated or supported by the \nGovernment of Libya; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senators \nLevin and Lautenberg, a piece of legislation which I hope will help the \nAmerican victims of Libyan terrorism and their families move one step \ncloser to receiving justice for the terrible crimes committed against \nthem. Our legislation requires the administration to submit to Congress \ntwice yearly reports on the status of the outstanding legal claims by \nthese American victims and their families against the government of \nLibya. It also requires the administration to explain its own efforts \non their behalf.\n  I believe it is in the United States' strategic interest to develop \nbetter relations with Libya. Colonel Qaddafi renounced terrorism and \ndismantled Libyan weapons of mass destruction programs. We need to \ndemonstrate to the rogue regimes of the world that there is a path back \nto the civilized community of nations. Libya is an important country in \nits own right as a gateway between Europe and Africa, as a country \nwhich shares a border with the Darfur region of Sudan, and as an OPEC \nmember.\n  But for this relationship to advance, we need to come to terms with \nthe past. Several hundred Americans have been killed by Libyan \nterrorism and scores more have been injured. The Libyan regime has \naccepted responsibility for the heinous Pan Am 103 bombing, which \nkilled 270 Americans. That admission also helped pave the way to the \nnegotiations that led to Libya's renunciation of its support for \nterrorism and its WMD programs. But the families of the victims of Pan \nAm 103 are still waiting for the final settlement of their case. Last \nyear, the Libyan government agreed to terms with the victims of the La \nBelle discotheque bombing in Germany. But they have since refused to \nhonor the previously agreed upon terms. Other victims of Libyan terror \nare still waiting for justice. Their cases may be smaller in scale, but \npain that the victims and their families have suffered is no less real.\n  The victims and families deserve to know what their government is \ndoing on their behalf to settle these cases. Colonel Qaddafi needs to \nunderstand that the way forward needs to account for the past. And the \nState Department needs to begin to develop a coherent vision for what \nwe hope to achieve in the Libyan--American relationship.\n  This piece of legislation we offer is modest, but I believe that it \ncan help us to make progress in each of these three aspects.\n  Lastly, I would like to say a few words about the human rights \nconditions inside Libya. Yes, Americans are interested in Libya's \nexternal behavior.\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\nBut we are also concerned about the human rights conditions within \nLibya. I am relieved that the death sentence of the six Bulgarian \nnurses and Palestinian doctor accused of infecting Libyan children with \nHIV has been commuted. But the case against them is preposterous, as \nconfirmed by rigorous investigations into the allegations by UNESCO and \nthe World Health Organization. That they remain in jail is outrageous.\n  For more than 3 years, years, I have been calling for the release of \nFathi Eljahmi, a courageous democracy advocate with serious health \nproblems whose only crime is to speak truth to power. I again call on \nthe Libyan government to release Mr. Eljahmi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9624-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9624-S9625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 276--CALLING FOR THE URGENT DEPLOYMENT OF A ROBUST \nAND EFFECTIVE MULTINATIONAL PEACEKEEPING MISSION WITH SUFFICIENT SIZE, \n  RESOURCES, LEADERSHIP, AND MANDATE TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN DARFUR, \n    SUDAN, AND FOR EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE RENEWAL OF A JUST AND \n                        INCLUSIVE PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \nMikulski, and Mr. Harkin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 276\n\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people have died and \n     approximately 2,500,000 people have been displaced in Darfur, \n     Sudan since 2003;\n       Whereas Congress declared on July 22, 2004 that the \n     atrocities in Darfur were genocide;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has repeatedly decried the \n     genocide in Darfur, stating, for example, on April 18, 2007, \n     ``that genocide is the only word for what is happening in \n     Darfur--and that we have a moral obligation to stop it'';\n       Whereas the crisis in Darfur and the surrounding region \n     continues and has in fact in some ways worsened despite the \n     efforts of the United States, the United Nations, the African \n     Union, and the international community;\n       Whereas on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706 providing that the existing United Nations Mission in \n     Sudan (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [the African Mission in \n     Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the \n     implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the \n     expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31 \n     December 2006'', and that UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up \n     to 17,300 military personnel . . . up to 3,300 civilian \n     police personnel'', which ``shall begin to be deployed no \n     later than 1 October 2006'';\n       Whereas the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir rejected \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 and refused \n     to allow the United Nations to deploy a peacekeeping force to \n     Darfur;\n       Whereas Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United \n     Nations, and Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African \n     Union, led efforts to reach a compromise with President al-\n     Bashir by convening a summit of interested governments and \n     international bodies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on November 16, \n     2006;\n       Whereas as a result of the Addis Ababa summit an agreement \n     was reached by all parties, including the United Nations, the \n     African Union, the European Union, the Government of Sudan, \n     the United States, and China, which called for a three-phased \n     deployment of a hybrid United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping force to Darfur of no less than 17,000 military \n     troops and 3,000 civilian police, with a primarily African \n     character, but open to non-African troop and police \n     contributors;\n       Whereas the agreement stated that the United Nations-\n     African Union hybrid force would have a strong mandate to \n     protect civilians and that the peacekeeping force must be \n     logistically and financially sustainable, with support from \n     the United Nations;\n       Whereas President al-Bashir has repeatedly obstructed the \n     Addis Ababa agreement since its signing by reneging on and \n     redefining the terms of his commitment to allow the \n     deployment of the full hybrid United Nations-African Union \n     force;\n       Whereas on June 11, 2007, President al-Bashir pledged to \n     accept unconditionally the full United Nations-African Union \n     hybrid deployment;\n       Whereas some subsequent speeches and statements by \n     President al-Bashir have contradicted that claim of \n     acceptance while others have reinforced it;\n       Whereas diplomatic efforts to secure President al-Bashir's \n     genuine acceptance and facilitation of the full United \n     Nations-African Union hybrid force must not lead to weakening \n     of the structure, capacities, or mandate of that force in \n     exchange for President al-Bashir's full compliance;\n       Whereas history has repeatedly demonstrated that the \n     ultimate success or failure of any peacekeeping force depends \n     significantly on its size, resources, mandate, mobility, and \n     command structure;\n       Whereas to establish conditions of peace and security, the \n     peacekeeping mission must be accompanied by a peace-building \n     process among the parties to the conflict;\n       Whereas such a process will require a sustained, \n     coordinated, and high-level diplomatic attempt to unify the \n     rebel groups in the region and engagement with the rebels and \n     the Sudanese government in order to forge a comprehensive \n     political settlement;\n       Whereas under the international humanitarian law of the \n     Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3516) and the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions \n     of 12 August 1949, done at Geneva June 8, 1977, all parties \n     to the conflict in Darfur are required to refrain from \n     attacks on civilians and on medical and other humanitarian \n     personnel, and all perpetrators should be held accountable \n     for violations of international humanitarian law; and\n       Whereas failure on the part of the international community \n     to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy, and maintain \n     an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping \n     force will result in the continued loss of life and further \n     degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in Darfur: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the President of the United States to--\n       (A) work with members of the United Nations Security \n     Council and the African Union to ensure the expeditious \n     deployment of the United Nations-African Union hybrid \n     peacekeeping force under Chapter VII of the United Nations \n     Charter and operating under United Nations guidelines and \n     procedures for command and control with a mandate affirming \n     that civilian protection is a primary mission objective;\n       (B) strongly encourage the member states of the United \n     Nations that have the capabilities to do so, to contribute \n     collectively approximately 19,500 military personnel and up \n     to 6,500 police to implement the mandate, as is currently \n     under discussion in the United Nations Security Council;\n       (C) work bilaterally and with member states of the North \n     Atlantic Trade Organization, the United Nations, the European \n     Union, the African Union, and other capable partners to--\n       (i) rapidly implement pre-deployment programs and provide \n     equipment to United Nations standards, with a special focus \n     on African peacekeepers, in order to ensure that a full \n     complement of peacekeepers can be deployed, sustained, and \n     rotated as necessary; and\n       (ii) provide the United Nations-African Union hybrid force \n     with--\n\n       (I) sufficient logistical support and airlift capacity;\n       (II) necessary vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and \n     helicopters for tactical reconnaissance and armed deterrence; \n     and\n       (III) other equipment;\n\n       (D) work with members of the United Nations and the African \n     Union to--\n       (i) ensure that substantive civilian mission components are \n     rapidly established and able to capitalize on any \n     opportunities to advance the political and peace processes \n     which the successful deployment of the United Nations-African \n     Union hybrid force may create;\n       (ii) reinitiate a peace-building process among the parties \n     to the conflict as part of a sustained, coordinated, high-\n     level diplomatic effort to forge a comprehensive political \n     settlement; and\n       (iii) ensure the security, maintenance, and expansion of \n     humanitarian access to those in need and promote a return to \n     the rule of law in the region;\n       (E) work with members of the United Nations, the African \n     Union, the European Union, and other donor nations to ensure \n     that adequate financial support is provided to peacekeepers \n     serving in the current African Mission in Sudan, and the \n     planned hybrid United Nations-African Union force; and\n       (F) work with Congress to ensure robust funding for the \n     hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in \n     Darfur;\n       (2) urges the Secretary-General of the United Nations and \n     the Chairperson of the African Union to make every effort to \n     expedite the urgent generation, rapid deployment, and \n     effective administration of the full United Nations-African \n     Union hybrid force;\n       (3) urges Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and the \n     Government of Sudan to abide by the agreement of President \n     al-Bashir to fully accept and facilitate the deployment of \n     the United Nations-African Union hybrid force without \n     condition;\n       (4) urges the President's Special Envoy to Sudan to \n     continue his legislative outreach, including offering to \n     brief Congress every 60 days on the status of deployment of \n     the United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping force \n     and parallel measures to enable peace in Darfur through an \n     inclusive political process; and\n       (5) urges President George W. Bush, the United Nations \n     Security Council, the African Union, the European Union, the \n     League of\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\n     Arab States, nations in the region, and individual nations \n     with significant economic or political influence over Sudan \n     to--\n       (A) hold President al-Bashir and the Government of Sudan \n     accountable for any failure through neglect or obstruction to \n     fully facilitate the deployment of the full United Nations-\n     African Union hybrid force for Darfur; and\n       (B) be prepared to implement meaningful measures, including \n     the imposition of multilateral sanctions, an arms embargo, \n     and a no fly zone for Sudanese military flights over Darfur, \n     if the Government of Sudan obstructs deployment of the agreed \n     upon peacekeeping mission.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Lugar and I introduce a \nresolution calling for the urgent deployment of a peacekeeping mission \nto Darfur, but also laying out some benchmarks for that mission.\n  We are all aware of the terrible carnage that 4 years of genocide \nhave wrought in Darfur and the surrounding region. Hundreds of \nthousands of people have been killed and millions more have been driven \ninto camps.\n  The world has watched, it has passed resolutions, and it has decried \nthe killings, but it has not stopped them.\n  Last month brought the welcome news that the Sudanese government had \nfinally agreed once again, the deployment of a full-scale, joint \npeacekeeping operation by the United Nations and the African Union.\n  But in the weeks since then, President al-Bashir has fallen into his \nold pattern of backpedaling away from his commitments, of accepting the \nmission but seeking to impose conditions, and of alternately agreeing \nto the troops and then recanting.\n  President Bashir may be wavering, but the world must not.\n  The resolution that we are introducing today expresses Congress's \ndetermination to move forward in support of this peacekeeping mission \nand reaffirms the minimum standards of this mission, which the Khartoum \ngovernment must not be allowed to bargain away.\n  It is critical that the United Nations and the African Union hold \nfirm on the structure, capacity, command and control mechanisms, and \nmandate of the peacekeeping force. We cannot negotiate down on the \nforce levels that are needed; this resolution supports the ongoing \nefforts at the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution \nauthorizing approximately 20,000 peacekeeping troops and over 6000 \npolice personnel.\n  In addition to numbers, it is equally important that the mission have \nthe mandate to protect Darfur's civilians and the means to carry out \nthat mandate.\n  All the resolutions in the world, however, will not save the people \nof Darfur if the international community does not contribute the forces \nand equipment that are needed for this peacekeeping mission.\n  This resolution urges the member states of the United Nations to step \nup to volunteer the needed forces. It also urges the President to work \nwith these countries and the African Union and NATO to expedite \ndeployment.\n  Together with our partners, we must ensure that the UN-AU force has \nthe people and the equipment to do the job, including the air assets \nthat will be needed to patrol an area that is the size of Texas but \nlacks both roads and infrastructure. We must also take steps to ensure \nhumanitarian access and security for those bringing aid to the millions \nof people in Darfur who are in need. We cannot continue to allow \nattacks against humanitarian workers to take place with impunity.\n  Our resolution also emphasizes that peacekeeping must be accompanied \nby a reinvigorated peace-building effort. Chaos and fragmentation are \naccelerating in Darfur by the day. Blue helmeted troops are not enough: \nKhartoum, the rebel groups, and leading nations like the U.S. must all \nwork toward a lasting and inclusive peace agreement on the ground.\n  I am committed to working with the administration to help secure the \nresources that are needed to fund this mission. If commitments for \ncrucial equipment are not forthcoming, then the U.S. should help \nprovide them--we have the best troops and the best equipment in the \nworld and we must stand ready to assist this effort to bring four years \nof murder, rape, and destruction to an end.\n  Finally, I will conclude as our resolution does: if Khartoum does not \nfulfill its part of the agreement and allow the full deployment of the \npeacekeeping mission, then the international community must impose \nmultilateral sanctions, an expanded arms embargo, and a no fly zone \nover Darfur.\n  The world stands at a critical moment: we must collectively assume \nour responsibility to protect the people of Darfur, either through the \nfulfillment of this peacekeeping mission or the imposition of \nmeaningful countermeasures. Four years of killing are four years too \nmany.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/19/senate-section/article/S9625-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9625-S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2331.

Cole, which killed 17 United States sailors.\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\n       (6) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who played a major \n     role in the East African Embassy Bombings, which killed more \n     than 250 people.\n       (7) The Department of Defense has estimated that of the \n     approximately 415 detainees who have been released or \n     transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, at \n     least 29 have subsequently taken up arms against the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (8) Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his \n     1998 fatwa against the United States, that ``[t]he ruling to \n     kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--\n     is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any \n     country in which it is possible to do it''.\n       (9) In the same fatwa, bin Laden said, ``[w]e--with God's \n     help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to \n     be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans \n     and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it''.\n       (10) It is safer for American citizens if captured members \n     of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not housed \n     on American soil where they could more easily carry out their \n     mission to kill innocent civilians.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior \n     members of al Qaeda, should not be released into American \n     society, nor should they be transferred stateside into \n     facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2352.
